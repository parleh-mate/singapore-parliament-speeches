<B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, &nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked if there is any security system that can prevent harmful materials from being brought into MRT stations. Today, various types of detection equipment are available for screening passengers and their baggage.&nbsp; However, with over 4 million passenger trips made on our bus and MRT systems each day, it would not be possible to impose 100% security check without severely degrading the efficiency and operation of our public transport system. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 1.0in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Members that the Government, together with the train operators, has always taken a pro-active approach to making sure that our train network is safe and secure.&nbsp; Even before the <st1:State><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:State> train bombings, we had conducted security planning and surveys for our MRT system, and implemented many security measures. For example, the operators have tightened security of the access to vital installations, and have installed CCTVs to monitor the MRT network. LTA is also incorporating similar security features into the design of the Circle Line. &nbsp; In addition, the Police carry out routine patrols of the MRT stations. The transport operators, LTA and the security agencies have also conducted several exercises to ensure that we are able to respond effectively to security threats to our public transport system.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the <st1:State><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:State> incident, the Government and our public transport operators have stepped up measures to increase the level of staff vigilance. &nbsp; As I announced last week,&nbsp; the Government has&nbsp;set up a high level Committee to continually review the security of our <p align=left>Column: 2696<p>public transport system. The Committee will undertake a comprehensive review of the public transport security arrangements, and will make its recommendations taking into account international \"best practices\".&nbsp; This review will cover both our rail and bus systems, including bus interchanges.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 35.45pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ng asked how effective these security measures will be.&nbsp; Experience elsewhere has shown that it is very difficult to fully protect any public transport system without drastically reducing its function and efficiency.&nbsp; However, the security measures that we have introduced, together with future enhancements, will help to deter and prevent a large scale attack that will seriously cripple the public transport system.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 35.45pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government will continue to work closely with the operators to keep our public transport system secure, commuters also have an important role to play. We have thus embarked on a public education programme to increase public awareness and vigilance. The operators have put up security posters at MRT stations, and are regularly broadcasting security messages&nbsp;reminding commuters to report any unattended or suspicious packages. &nbsp; Similar measures will be extended to the bus interchanges. All commuters can help to ensure the security of our public transport system by being vigilant. This will ultimately safeguard their own safety.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"StandardPara\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member asked how much the additional security features will cost. &nbsp; This will largely depend on the recommendations of the Committee as it undertakes the review.&nbsp; However, since the public transport system is for the general public, the security of the system should be the collective responsibility of the Government, the public transport operators and the commuters. &nbsp; It is therefore reasonable <p align=left>Column: 2697<p>that the costs of security measures be shared. &nbsp; The Committee will ensure that only security measures that are necessary will be added so that the cost borne by the commuters will be minimised and kept reasonable.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me give an example - the decision to remove litter bins from the MRT stations.&nbsp; The moment that was decided upon, the operators were told to remove them.&nbsp; The decision to increase public awareness resulted in the posters being made and broadcast announcements being finalised and those were implemented straightaway.&nbsp;

LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current Singapore-Australia air services agreement (ASA), which was last expanded in September last year, both Singapore and Australia designated airlines are restricted in their 5<sup>th</sup> freedom rights to fly beyond each other's country.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given our close bilateral relationship, including the recently concluded Singapore-Australia FTA, and the many business and social linkages between our people,&nbsp;<st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has always been ready to conclude a full Open Skies Agreement (OSA) with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; A full OSA will enable Australian carriers to freely fly to and beyond <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, without any restrictions, to all points, including major European and Asian destinations.&nbsp; Likewise, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> carriers will be able to fly <p align=left>Column: 2699<p>to and beyond <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Specifically, the Australian public will also have more choices of airlines to choose from on the trans-pacific route to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; An OSA will be a win-win outcome for both <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Australian carriers. &nbsp; More importantly, it will bring significant benefits to both economies given the sizeable multiplier effects of increased air links between and beyond both countries.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp;<st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> was not ready to conclude an OSA in September last year as the global industry had just begun recovering then.&nbsp; Nevertheless, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> had agreed \"to continue to work towards the conclusion of an open-skies agreement and to consider further liberalisation, including trans-pacific rights, when there is greater stability in the global aviation environment\".</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the outlook for global aviation environment has been very positive. &nbsp; The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has in fact projected a growth of 7% in global passenger traffic this year. &nbsp; For routes within Asia Pacific, a growth of 14% can be expected because we are comparing against a very low base last year because of SARS.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qantas Airways has also reported positive financial results.&nbsp; &nbsp;It had announced that&nbsp;the company's businesses have returned to profitability and that it is in good position to take advantage \"of what appears to be a return to more stable market conditions\". &nbsp; As there are enough indicators that the global and regional aviation environment has stabilised, we are engaging our Australian counterparts on realising the full open skies agreement.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah has mentioned, Qantas Airways has recently announced its investment in a new low cost airline to be based in&nbsp;<st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. &nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> welcomes any foreign carrier to be <p align=left>Column: 2700<p>involved in a LCC venture in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, if the proposal strengthens our hub status.&nbsp; In the case of Qantas, we welcome their decision as it will entrench their existing hub operations in Changi.&nbsp; The low fares of the LCC will stimulate greater traffic volumes between <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and regional cities. &nbsp; It would also enable Qantas to bring in more long-haul travellers from <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> to transit and transfer through Changi to the region.&nbsp; It is likely that some of these new travellers will stop over in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, hence creating more jobs and boosting our tourism receipts.&nbsp; It is therefore in our national interest to have Qantas base its new LCC in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and continue growing its hub operations here.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The establishment of new LCCs in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other new airlines in the region will change the regional aviation landscape in the years ahead.&nbsp; However, SIA will continue to share a symbiotic relationship with Changi and must continue to play an important role in enhancing our hub airport status.&nbsp; Therefore, we will continue to further liberalise our air services agreements and increase our air rights with other countries.&nbsp; With more air rights available, both SIA and other new <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> carriers will be able to grow. In turn, their growth will strengthen Changi's role as a hub airport.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of these, about 8,000 are located in the non-mature estates such as Choa Chu Kang, Woodlands, Jurong West, Sengkang and Punggol.&nbsp; These are either flats previously built under the now-suspended Registration for Flat System, or are surplus SERS replacement flats that have become available after meeting the rehousing needs of SERS lessees.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2711<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pricing flats, HDB takes into account the attributes of the flats, such as the age, facing and storey height, as well as the prevailing resale prices of comparable flats.&nbsp; The prices of HDB flats are pegged below their equivalent market prices at the time of offer so that eligible flat buyers enjoy a subsidy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The large number of unsold flats is due to the economic downturn, when demand for flats dropped sharply.&nbsp; To take into account the weaker resale prices and the age of these flats, HDB has adjusted their prices downwards when re-offering them for sale.&nbsp; HDB has also implemented new modes of sale for these flats.&nbsp; Those that are in ample supply are offered under Walk-In Selection, which allows buyers to walk in and book a unit on the spot.&nbsp; The more popular flats, such as SERS replacement flats located in the mature estates, are offered through regular balloting exercises.&nbsp; These have proven effective in enabling HDB to sell its unsold flats.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB will continue to promote the sale of the unsold flats to eligible families, while scaling back new supply of flats.&nbsp; HDB has in fact stopped building new 5-room flats for sale to the public since 2002.&nbsp; It will do so until the current stock of unsold 5-room and larger flats is reduced.&nbsp; HDB will also&nbsp;employ various marketing initiatives, such as roadshows and media advertisements, to reach out to prospective buyers.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I presume the purpose of such a scheme, as proposed by the Member, is to help the families who are not eligible for loans to get a flat.&nbsp; First of all, I would like to assure the House and the Member that HDB does exercise flexibility and consider loans for such families on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; It will give them a concessionary loan after looking into the merits of the case and, if there are extenuating circumsances such as hardship, they will grant such a loan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are other alternatives available, including the financial assistance schemes offered by the HDB.&nbsp; Those who wish to downgrade can also make use of their proceeds to buy a smaller flat.&nbsp; In fact, for such families, I would say further that it makes more sense for them to buy than to rent.&nbsp; Because if they buy, they can actually make use of their CPF to pay for their mortgages, whereas they would need to use cash for their rentals.&nbsp; But having said that, there are those who still prefer to rent for whatever reasons, and here there are other schemes that are available for such families to rent, such as the Rent and Purchase Scheme.&nbsp; There is also the Public Rental Scheme.&nbsp; And we have recently revised the eligibility for the Public Rental Scheme.&nbsp; Then, of course, there are&nbsp;HDB flats which are available for rental, as a result of the relaxation of some of the rules for subletting that were introduced in October last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;with all these options available, I would say that the proposal of the Member for a hire-and-purchase scheme may not be so necessary at this stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final&nbsp;point I would just like to mention is, of course, that some of these flats that are being offered for sale are really not suitable for rental.&nbsp; They are not fitted out; they do not have proper flooring, lighting, etc.&nbsp; So it would require some effort to actually fit them out and to offer them for rental.&nbsp; But I would say that this is a practical problem which can<p align=left>Column: 2713<p> be overcome.&nbsp;

I come back to the main point, which is the 10,000 flats that are availabe in these estates.&nbsp; It is not a very large number and I guess, as the demand picks up, they will be sold.&nbsp; So, this is a temporary problem.&nbsp;

These are largely beyond our control, as in the recent hike in steel price. BCA helps the construction industry by monitoring the prices of key building materials such as cement, bricks and steel, and providing regular information updates to the industry</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, contractors should diversify their supply sources for the key construction materials so that they would not be caught by any steep price increases from any single source.&nbsp; To this end, BCA will continue to help explore and facilitate alternative sources of materials supply for the construction industry.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dr Teo's question on the actual construction cost increases in recent years, BCA's Tender Price Index showed that the increase was 2% from 2001 to 2002, and 6% from 2002 to 2003.</p></div></span><p align=left>Column: 2717<p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Teo Ho Pin</B>:&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary actually how many contracts were awarded with this fluctuating clause in the contract, and whether the inclusion of this fluctuating clause for materials will make it a fairer contract, in view of the very dynamic global conditions?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Some of the remaining applications are still being processed.&nbsp; Over 40% of these beneficiaries were successfully placed in employment.&nbsp; About 10% were referred for intensive employment-related counselling.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also pleased to say that the response to the HOPE scheme, which was launched in January this year, has&nbsp;been encouraging.&nbsp; For the first two months, the CDCs had received 370 applications of which over 65% were assessed to be eligible. While the response has been good, it is rather premature at this point to assess how the families have been faring.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor and support the families' progress through the mentoring programme.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor also asked what other measures will be put in place to help the disadvantaged.&nbsp; Earlier in March, my Ministry announced the Self-Reliance Programme which will replace two existing schemes - namely the Interim Financial Assistance and the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme with effect from January next year.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Programme will provide more targeted help for&nbsp; families <p align=left>Column: 2719<p>whose adult members are not able to work in the short term due to illness or care-giving responsibilities.&nbsp; The package of assistance includes cash allowances, utilities subsidies, educational allowances and medical subsidy and will be customised depending on the needs of the family.&nbsp; Families on the programme, particularly those with young children, will have to play their part to improve their own situation. They will be given case management support and will be required to follow the intervention roadmap drawn up by their case manager in consultation with them.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we will continue to strengthen our social safety net to provide more targeted help to those in need, it is equally important that the individuals and families understand the crucial role they play in lifting themselves out of the situation.&nbsp; They must play their part and make use of the opportunities to improve their situation.&nbsp; The Government's efforts alone are not enough.&nbsp; We certainly look to complementary support from our various community partners, such as the self-help groups, the CDCs and social service agencies. Community groups can help widen our outreach to these needy families and point them to the help available. Social service agencies play a critical role in the mentoring aspects of our programme - for example, by providing the guidance to families on the HOPE and the Self-Reliance Programme to enable them to work towards independence.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the recent Committee of Supply debate, some agencies have, on their own, started good initiatives to help low income families. We welcome more of such initiatives and will facilitate the sharing of effective interventions among our community partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is being done for the 50% unsuccessful<p align=left>Column: 2720<p> WAP applicants, some of whom, I am given to understand through my meet-the-people session, could be chronically unemployed in the long term.&nbsp; Are they transferred to other schemes?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

As more people venture into business, start-ups will become an increasingly important source of employment.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the development of new industries, such as the biomedical industry, as well as the expansion of services sectors like education and healthcare will create new jobs. We are also seeking to revitalise older industries, such as textiles, food and furniture. We will help companies in these sectors to upgrade and to gain a competitive foothold.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many jobs will be created, not all will be jobs that Singaporeans are accustomed to. Therefore, workers must have the right skills and attitude to take on new jobs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has been spearheading efforts to re-skill our workforce. For example, in recent months, WDA has placed and trained some 200 Singaporeans for the electronics sector. WDA is doing likewise to train Singaporeans for the aerospace industry.&nbsp; A National Skills Framework is being developed to identify the industry-specific skills needed for our workforce.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from skills, to create and maintain jobs, we must also ensure that wages are competitive, and adjust flexibly to changing business conditions.&nbsp; A survey commissioned by the Ministry of&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2725<p> Manpower in 2003 found that workers are now more aware of the challenges of global competition and are prepared to accept variable wages based on performance. This resilience and adaptability of our workforce, coupled with sound policy measures and continuous restructuring by companies, will allow us to respond quickly to fast-changing economic conditions, and to generate new jobs and to create new sources of growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry conducts a study to find out the key reasons for the relocation of SMEs and MNCs overseas and, if so, what have been the key reasons cited.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; IE&nbsp;Singapore, which is&nbsp;a statutory board with the mission of helping Singapore companies internationalise, conducted a survey in June 2003 of 200 companies and asked them for the reasons for overseas investment.&nbsp; About 87% of the respondents cited market seeking opportunities, while 49% cited lower cost of production.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons of venturing abroad include skilled labour at the investing destination and developed financial and technological infrastructure.</p></div></span><!--TITLE_NAME:SETTING UP OF CASINO--><p align=left>Column: 2725<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SETTING UP OF CASINO</span></B></div><BR><!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the specific factors leading to the Government's decision to now consider the possibility of setting up a casino when it was against the idea for many years;&nbsp; (b) whether it will consult the broad range of Singaporeans and weigh the social costs and implications before making a decision on the matter; and (c) when will the decision be finalised.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</B>:&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2726<p> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;during the Committee of Supply, Minister George Yeo said that we are prepared to consider having a casino as part of an international resort and residential development on the <st1:place>Southern Islands</st1:place> and Sentosa.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the Government has been averse to having a casino in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> because of its potentially negative social impact on our local population.

Given these readily available alternatives, with the indications that there may a different treatment of Singaporeans versus non-Singaporeans in terms of access to this casino that has aroused a lot of passion among several groups of Singaporeans, it is the principle, not the effect, as it were, I would like to ask the Minister, in the examples he has cited, like in London, etc, are these decisions made by the private operators in the interest of their business in terms of controlling access, or are they licensing conditions imposed by the authorities?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; There are two parts to this question.&nbsp; I will deal with the latter part, about London.&nbsp; I am not aware of the detailed regulations there, but I presume that, to a large extent, these are licensing impositions made by the authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier part of his question refers to alternatives which, unfortunately, exist even today as we talk about it.&nbsp; People can go to cruise ships, they can go across the causeway to Genting, they can go to Batam or&nbsp;travel overseas and do it.&nbsp; There is a limit to how much we can protect, insulate or prevent people from making these decisions.&nbsp; We can do our best to educate, advise and immunise, but we cannot have an absolute barrier.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The follow-on question to that line of reasoning then is that since there are alternatives, why bother to put any resistance at all in the way of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I must say&nbsp;I am not totally persuaded by that line of argument because, although something is available, it does not mean we need to go out of our way to facilitate it.&nbsp; Given the fact that we know that some people would be more susceptible, and perhaps unwisely so, I have made it very <p align=left>Column: 2729<p>clear in my answer that our objective, if at all we do embark on this, is to address the tourism market and, therefore, it is focused on tourists and not on our local market.&nbsp; As far as our local population is concerned, our chief preoccupation has been and remains the social impact of gambling on some susceptible members of our population.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we run a free economy in which people's access to goods and services consumed are affected by their earning potential or the assets that they have.&nbsp; This is an immutable fact of a free economy.&nbsp; So, we are not doing this to set up class consciousness.&nbsp; We are doing this, as I said earlier, if at all we do decide to go ahead with this,&nbsp;to&nbsp;broaden our tourism appeal to a wider segment of people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as tourists are concerned, I have also said that we are trying to attract a wide spectrum of tourists.&nbsp; We will build more 2- and 3-star hotels, because we recognise that, with the onset of low-cost carriers, it is quite likely, indeed we hope, that more tourists of perhaps a humbler background will also choose to come to Singapore.&nbsp; But we also have to recognise that there are other types of tourists who have, in a sense, money to burn or money to lose.&nbsp; And if they are going to lose that money, and&nbsp;lose it our way and in that way create jobs and help strengthen our own economy, then this is something which we should not, as a matter of reflex, <p align=left>Column: 2730<p>ignore.&nbsp; If we do so, we do so at our loss.&nbsp; So, all I am saying is that there are strong arguments, both for and against.&nbsp; There are good reasons to be cautious, but let us go into this with our eyes wide open, being very clear of our objectives, being very clear of the dangers, and also being very clear that there are some practical measures which we have to take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a time to indulge in creating or highlighting class consciousness or looking for social dispartity or creating cleavages within our population.&nbsp; I think if we adopt this in our uniquely Singaporean manner of being pragmatic, realistic and sensible about it, we might be able to fashion a win-win solution, although that is not typical of gambling.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The trends change.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we tightened up the land checkpoints,&nbsp;they&nbsp;came in by&nbsp;sea, and when we&nbsp;patrolled&nbsp;the coast,&nbsp;they now try to swim across. &nbsp;We try to keep a step ahead of them.</p></div></span><!--TITLE_NAME:ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD EXCHANGE--><p align=left>Column: 2735<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Discussions were also held with relevant Government agencies as well as the GPC for National Development.&nbsp; Useful features found in these foreign legislation as well as feedback from the industry and public have been incorporated in the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Amendments to the LTSA</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall now elaborate on the key amendments in this Bill, beginning first with those related to the LTSA.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Providing for Mixed-use Strata Developments</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present system for managing strata developments allows only one MC to be formed for each strata development.&nbsp; However, in a mixed-use development, eg, a mixed shopping, office and residential complex, there are various user groups whose interests and priorities are likely to be different.&nbsp; Each group would be more concerned about the management and maintenance of common properties that have a direct impact on it.&nbsp; The MC would have difficulty implementing improvements to common properties, as the benefits may be perceived to accrue more to a certain group than to others.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have a long enough experience in managing mixed-use strata developments.&nbsp; The LTSA was enacted only in 1967.&nbsp; Our laws have not adequately provided for such conflicts to be<p align=left>Column: 2745<p> resolved.&nbsp; Therefore, we have looked at more established strata management models in other countries, such as <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, which have a longer history.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill proposes to introduce an option of a two-tier MC system for mixed-use developments, adapted from the <st1:State><st1:place>British Columbia</st1:place></st1:State> model.&nbsp; There will be a main MC responsible for the property common to all subsidiary proprietors (SPs), while sub-MCs will manage the \"limited common property\" intended for the exclusive use of their respective user groups. These sub-MCs will have the right to levy contributions from them for its maintenance or improvement.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option will also be extended to residential developments with different types of strata lots.&nbsp; For example, a residential development may have high-rise tower blocks and low-rise walk-up blocks or town houses.&nbsp; There could then be one sub-MC for the high-rise towers and another sub-MC for the low-rise blocks or town houses.&nbsp; This would address the usual complaint that certain common properties serve only a particular group of residents, eg, lifts in high-rise blocks.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the intention is neither to create segregations within a community nor to encourage the proliferation of MCs.&nbsp; The spirit behind this provision is to allow for flexible management of strata developments, with clear differentiation in the interests of various user groups, and clear physical delineation of common properties.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start, the two-tier MC system will be applicable only to new developments. Once we gain more experience, we can consider applying it to existing developments.&nbsp; There is a provision allowing the Minister to approve the conversion <p align=left>Column: 2746<p>of an existing single MC to a two-tier MC, provided the MC is able to pass a comprehensive resolution for the conversion.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Improving Management Framework</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also proposes several other amendments to improve the clarity of the existing provisions and the effectiveness of the strata management framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the Bill explicitly sets out the documents that the developer has to hand over to the MC at the first AGM or make available for inspection. There were cases in the past where the MCs had to resort to legal action to obtain certain documents and records from the developers. With the provision in the Bill, I hope such disputes will no longer occur.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some MCs were also in the news lately. Various issues and allegations involving them were widely reported in the media.&nbsp; These include:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irregularities in collection of maintenance contributions;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing Agents (MAs) canvassing for votes on behalf of certain groups;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPs elected to office while in arrears of maintenance contributions; and</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Council members or MAs failing to declare their interests when making decisions on behalf of the MC.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill seeks to curb such abuses or undesirable practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; An SP, who is in arrears, would no longer qualify for election as a council member.&nbsp; MAs will not be allowed to canvass for votes on behalf of a SP or council member.&nbsp; To prevent any conflict of interests, SPs can serve as MAs only with the approval of the MC.&nbsp; For better corporate governance, the tenure of the treasurer in the council will be limited to no more than two consecutive terms.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2747<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To strengthen the management framework, the Bill also proposes to reduce the \"initial period\" when the developer is managing the development, from a maximum of 24 months to a maximum of 12 months or on the day of the first AGM, whichever is earlier. With this change, the MC can then take over the management of the development within a shorter time. The Bill also proposes to reduce the quorum for general meetings from 50% of the aggregate share value to either 30% of the share value or not less than 100 SPs present, whichever is lower, either in person or by proxy.&nbsp; The purpose of this is to make it easier for MCs to convene a general meeting on urgent issues.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Decriminalising Non-Compliance</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent with the objective of reducing Government intervention and enhancing self-regulation, the Bill proposes to decriminalise those offences in the existing law that do not have a significant impact on public interest. Only offences related to fraud and cheating or regulatory provisions where the obligation is to the Government would be retained, eg, furnishing false information, or failing to comply with the lawful demands of the Commissioner of Buildings.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples of offences that will be decriminalised are: failure of SPs to pay maintenance charges; breach of the by-laws by SPs; failure of the MC to provide information to SPs; and failure of any person to hand over records or information to the MC.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that such non-compliance is decriminalised, the aggrieved party could still seek recourse through the Strata Titles Boards or take civil action via the courts.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Enhancing the Powers of the MCs</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MC should be the supreme decision-making body of a strata development.&nbsp; However, when a common <p align=left>Column: 2748<p>property is altered that benefits any SP, the MC presently does not have the power to alter the maintenance contributions arising from that alteration.&nbsp; Under the Bill, the MC would be able to decide on changes to such contributions by passing a comprehensive resolution; in other words, obtaining the consent of at least 90% of the aggregate share value of all the lots in the development.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MC will also no longer need to obtain the Commissioner of Buildings's approval before altering or erecting structures on common property during the initial period, when the developer is still maintaining the strata development.&nbsp; The MC could proceed with the work by passing a special resolution, ie, obtaining consent of at least 75% of the share value of the valid votes at a general meeting.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will also empower the MC to lease out common property or confer special privileges for its use to SPs and others. Decisions on short-term leases of up to one year can be made without the need for a resolution to be passed at a general meeting.&nbsp; However, leases up to three years will require a special resolution, ie, consent of 75% of valid votes, while longer leases will require 90% of valid votes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Amendments in the BCPA</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to the key amendments related to the BCPA.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P><I>Making the developer contribute to the maintenance of unsold units</I><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the law is&nbsp;not clear on the liability of the developer to contribute to the maintenance of unsold units in a development.&nbsp; As a result, there are varying practices in the industry.&nbsp; Under the Bill, the developer would have to set up a maintenance fund when any<p align=left>Column: 2749<p> purchaser starts to pay contribution, and pay maintenance contributions to the fund for all unsold units, as well as for sold units that have not been handed over to purchasers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Furnishing copy of audited accounts of the maintenance fund to purchasers</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developers are currently required to furnish a copy of the audited accounts of the maintenance fund to the COB, but are not required to extend a copy to the purchasers. In fact, some developers have refused to do so upon purchasers' request. As the purchasers contribute to the maintenance fund, they have a legitimate right to know how the money is spent.&nbsp; The Bill will require the developer to furnish a copy of the audited account of the maintenance fund to purchasers upon request, as well as to allow them to view relevant records and documents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Removing the requirement for the developer to place a deposit</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An existing provision in the BCPA requires the developer to place a deposit with the COB that is to pay for any defects rectification in the common property occurring within&nbsp;three years after the certificate of statutory completion has been issued.&nbsp; Unused deposit would be released to the developer at the end of the period.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the introduction of this requirement in 1982, the COB has rarely been called upon to use the deposit.&nbsp; The obligation of the developer to rectify defects is already spelt out in the sale and purchase agreement.&nbsp; Where defects in the common property are concerned, recent court decisions have established that the MC could seek redress from the developers, even after the defects liability period. &nbsp;The administrative provision requiring developers to place deposits with<p align=left>Column: 2750<p> the COB is therefore of little value in today's context and will be removed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed Bill marks a milestone in the maintenance and management of buildings and common property of both strata title and non-strata developments in Singapore.&nbsp; It merges the existing Land Titles (Strata) Act and the Buildings and Common Property&nbsp;(Maintenance and Management) Act to form a new Act, which is the Building Maintenance and Management Act.&nbsp; The Act will be administered by one Ministry (ie, the National Development Ministry), instead of two Ministries presently.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five key amendments in the Bill as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Provision for the management of mixed-use strata developments;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Promotion of self-governance among management corporations;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Ensuring more equitable sharing of maintenance costs;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Definition of roles of all stakeholders; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Administration of the new legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendments will have impact on more than 2,600 management corporations and over 170,000 units of strata title and non-strata developments in Singapore.&nbsp; It will affect both existing and future subsidiary proprietors and property<p align=left>Column: 2751<p> owners.&nbsp; The impact will be more pronounced and differential for subsidiary proprietors of mixed-use strata developments.&nbsp; At the same time, various stakeholders of property development (ie, developers, managing agents, and management corporations) are also affected.&nbsp; As the Bill has a wide ranging impact on many interested parties, I would urge the Minister to consider&nbsp;committing the Bill to a Select Committee for public consultation and scrutiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Fundamental questions to address</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are three fundamental questions which need to be addressed before debating on the proposed Bill:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Is the concept of communal living in strata title developments&nbsp;successful in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Are subsidiary proprietors ready for self-governance in strata title developments?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Will the Bill affect the standard of maintenance of strata developments in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the concept of communal living in strata title development was introduced in the 70s, many subsidiary proprietors are still still not aware of their roles and responsibioities.&nbsp; The general lack of community spirit and apathy among subsidiary proprietors&nbsp; has posed much problem in the management of such developments.&nbsp; Common problems include lack of quorum to convene general meetings, lack of volunteers to be council members in the management corporations, lack of understanding of the roles of developers, management corporations, managing agents and subsidiary proprietors, abuses of powers resulting in corruption and malpractices, failure to comply to various statutory requirements and the lack of understanding of <p align=left>Column: 2752<p>the Land Titles (Strata) Act, resulting in disputes among various stakeholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These problems are further aggravated in mixed-use strata developments where the interests of various stakeholders are very different.&nbsp; As such, much time and resources were wasted to resolve these problems, and many stakeholders have called on the Government to review the Land Titles (Strata) Act.&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Minister can highlight to the House the key desired outcomes of this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in my opinion, there are three attribtues of success in strata title developments which will enhance professional management and strenghten communal living:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; We need a clear set of legislation defining the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders of a strata title development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; We need a strong community spirit and a \"give-and-take\" attitude among <p align=left>Column: 2753<p>subsidiary proprietors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; We must&nbsp;adopt a professional approach towards maintenance management by the management corporations and their agents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed Bill may address the first attribute by better defining the roles and responsibilities of owner developers, subsidiary proprietors, management corporations and managing agents.&nbsp; But it has not facilitated the development of a strong community spirit among subsidiary proprietors and provided adequate measures to increase the professionalism of managing such developments.&nbsp; Sir, let me now discuss the key items in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(1)</I>&nbsp; <I>Clearer definition of roles of stakeholders</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the various amendments to better define the roles of the owner developers, management corporations, council memebrs, managing agents and subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; The key objective of these changes is to ensure the election of council members with integrity and bona fide intention to look after the interests of all subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; It also laid out rules on the code of conduct and ethics of council members, managing agents and subsidiary proprietors so as to avoid corruption and malpractices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the amendment does not define clearly the role of the owner developer in handing over documents to the management corporation at the first Annual General Meeting.&nbsp; At present, the Act requires the developer to hand over \"all plans, specifications, certificates (other than certificates of title for the lots), diagrams and other documents relating to the parcel or building to the MC at the first AGM\".&nbsp; In practice, there are disputes between developers and management corporations concerning the definition of these documents.&nbsp; To avoid unnecessary or unreasonable demand from either party, it will be clearer if the Act can define these documents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in order to ensure that owner developers hand over all relevant documents to the management corporations, I would propose that we specify clearly the list of documents and items to be handed over to the MC at the first AGM in clause 25(4)(a).&nbsp; The proposed list should include the following:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 15pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 15pt\">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Building plans;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 15pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 15pt\">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Share value allotments;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 15pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 15pt\">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Strata title plans and strata roll;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp; As-built drawings on architectural, structural, M&amp;E and open area items;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Operation and instruction manuals;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2754<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp;&nbsp; Electrical diagrams and plumbing schematic drawings;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp;&nbsp; Guarantees/warranties/indemnities when assigned/novated to MCST;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8)&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificate for Statutory Completion;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9)&nbsp;&nbsp; Current insurance policies;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10)&nbsp; Legal covenant, caution and restrictions on use of land in the title, if any;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11)&nbsp; Current maintenance service contracts;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; Notices/directions from Government or any authorities, if any;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (13)&nbsp; Keys to all common properties;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (14)&nbsp; Inventory list of furniture and equipment in common areas and common properties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (15)&nbsp; Records of accounts and book-keeping;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (16)&nbsp; Audited accounts and reports related to the period after the MC is legally incorporated; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (17)&nbsp; Any other records relevant to the management of the strata development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this way, the MCs will be better positioned to maintain the property in a good and serviceable condition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also urge the Minister to further define the roles and responsibilities of&nbsp; subsidiary proprietors in keeping their strata title lots in a good and serviceable condition.&nbsp; Today, many subsidiary proprietors are still not familiar with their responsibilities to maintain their own strata title lots, and many are not sure which elements in their strata lots are common property or their own property.&nbsp; Such lack of understanding has led to many disputes <p align=left>Column: 2755<p>and unauthorised alterations in some strata developments which may pose safety hazards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent falling of external windows is an example which illustrates the lack of understanding of responsibilities of unit owners.&nbsp; Although the external facade of the windows comes under the responsibility of management corporations, subsidiary proprietors are responsible to keep the windows in a good and servicable condition, including conducting periodic inspections on the windows.&nbsp; Sir, we need to re-emphasise the individual responsibility of subsidiary proprietors in maintaining their own strata title lots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(2)&nbsp; Mixed-use strata developments</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill proposed a two-tier MC system for mixed-use strata developments and residential developments with different types of residential lots to provide more effective management.&nbsp; This serves to delineate areas to better cater to the needs of different users in mixed-use strata developments, and at the same time provides a more equitable maintenance contribution formula.&nbsp; These amendments arise mainly due to various problems faced by management corporations and subsidiary proprietors of mixed-use strata developments.&nbsp; The common problems may be listed as follows:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Different and conflicting interests among different users of mixed-use strata developments such as residential, commercial or office units;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Car parking problems such as allocation of car parks lots, car park fees, indiscriminate parking and congestion, and car park lots for visitors and the general public;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>The Bill proposes a similar approach in delineating the common property into two main categories, namely, common property and limited common property.&nbsp; This is based on the exclusive benefit of two or more subsidiary proprietors of those proposed lots in the land parcel.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Prima facie</I>, this arrangement seems to cater to the needs of different groups of users.&nbsp; But, it has the inherent \"divide and rule\" impact on the development.&nbsp; Thus, potential problems of cross-boundary conflicts may arise from the two-tier MC system.&nbsp; This arrangement is also unlikely to promote community spirit and bonding among the different tiers of MCs and subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; In today's apathetic climate among the subsidiary proprietors to serve in MCs, I am concerned whether a two or more tier MC system is a sustainable solution in managing mixed-use strata developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, instead of fixing the problems downstream where the design of the mixed-use strata developments has resulted in these problems, we should tackle the problems upstream at the planning and design stage.&nbsp; Many problems faced in mixed-use strata developments can be resolved through proper planning and design of the development.&nbsp; For example, clearer delineation of functional and physical common property, and the provision of separate facilities or <p align=left>Column: 2757<p>access will reduce potential conflicts among users.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should adopt a dispute avoidance strategy, instead of legislating, to manage disputes among subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; Potential purchasers of mixed-use strata developments must fully understand the implications (that is, the conveniences and the inconveniences) of staying in such developments before making purchase decisions.&nbsp; This will facilitate better understanding among subsidiary proprietors and the management corporations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, property buyers must be given more accurate information on the basis and amount of maintenance contribution at the time of purchase.&nbsp; Such transparency will help to avoid disputes at a later stage.&nbsp; I would urge all developers to be more transparent and provide more accurate representations of their developments when marketing their properties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(3) Promotion of self-governance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the move to promote self-governance by MCs and reduce Government intervention in the management of strate title developments.&nbsp; Except for safety and public health matters, we must empower the MCs to take on more responsibilities in the management of their estates.&nbsp; A common conflict among subsidiary proprietors is the allotment of share value and formula for maintenance contribution.&nbsp; The present method of allotting share value is a \"one size fits all\" computation based on floor area groupings in 100 square metres.&nbsp; Thus, a unit of 101 square metres and one of 199 square metres are allotted the same share value as they are in the same grouping.&nbsp; I would propose to amend the schedule for the share value allotment by the Commissioner of Buildings, as stated in clauses 10 and 11&nbsp;of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2758<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a more equitable method would be to compute the share value based on the built-up floor area of each lot.&nbsp; This will align the share value of each lot to be proportional to its built-up floor area.&nbsp; Thus, each subsidiary proprietor will contribute towards the maintenance fund based on the built-up floor area (rounded to the nearest square metre as stated in the Sale and Purchase Agreement).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the share value allotment is agreed and approved by the Commissioner, it should be made known to the purchasers by stating it in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.&nbsp; The share value should not be changed once it is accepted and should form the basis of contribution by all subsidiary proprietors towards the management of the development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I support the amendment in clause 40 to empower MCs to alter the maintenance contribution formula so that more equity could be achieved among subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; This is especially so when there are changes in the common property which benefit certain subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; As such, different groups of SPs may&nbsp;levy different maintenance contribution based on the circumstances and consensus of the subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; This empowerment includes the use and rental of common property.&nbsp; The amendment will also encourage SPs to take more ownership of their common property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(4) Professional management</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The management of a property to satisfy the needs of many owners is a complex task which requires professionalism and good management practices.&nbsp; If the Government were to promote self-governance in strata developments, we need to establish a framework to ensure that professional property management services are carried out to maintain these developments properly so as to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders and the <p align=left>Column: 2759<p>general public.&nbsp; Statutory compliance with regard to safety and public health must be complied and enforced stringently.&nbsp; The recent case of sewage water flowing into water tank clearly highlights the importance of statutory compliance and the need for professional property management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the \"cut throat\" competition among property management firms has resulted in severe fee undercutting.&nbsp; This has compromised the standard of professional services rendered, resulting in an unhealthy state of affairs in many MCs.&nbsp; While many SPs demand high standard of maintenance, not many are very forthcoming when it comes to paying for professional management and maintenance services.&nbsp; This dichotomy has led to a situation where SPs, MCs and MAs are all unhappy with the management of their developments.&nbsp; This situation is further compounded by the lack of understanding of council members of the Land Titles (Strata) Act and various abuses of power by some council members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, unless we adopt a professional approach towards maintenance, more disputes will surface in the future.&nbsp; These disputes are time consuming, and waste national resources.&nbsp; Many of these disputes have ended up in courts and soured relationships among SPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve the professional management of strata developments, we need to train and register property management professionals.&nbsp; The fact that we need to amend the Act to include a new clause, clause 67, to prohibit the activity of <p align=left>Column: 2760<p>managing agents in lobbying for votes clearly reflects the unprofessional conduct of some managing agents in practice.&nbsp; This clause will not be easily enforceable as it is onerous to gather evidence of managing agents lobbying for votes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I would urge the Minister to consider inserting a clause to appoint managing agents or property managers who are professionally trained and registered to manage strata title developments.&nbsp; The professional code of practice of managing agents or property managers can be clearly defined in the Act too.&nbsp; With professional management, the MCs will be properly guided to formulate maintenance policies which will look after the interests of all subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; This will avoid non-compliance with statutory requirements, abuse of powers, and unauthorised practices in strata developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill, but would urge the Minister to commit the Bill to a Select Committee for further refinements to better represent the interests of all stakeholders in strata title developments and, at the same time, to gain their support for the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, before I begin, I would like to declare my interest on this Bill as Chairman of the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, a professional organisation whose members include land surveyors, quantity surveyors, property consultants, valuers, agents and property managers, many of whom act as managing agents in property developments.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted by the Minister, the last major review of the&nbsp;LTSA relating to the maintenance and management of strata subdivided buildings was&nbsp;close to two decades ago in 1987.&nbsp; Over the years, whilst the legislation has helped to provide a sound framework for the maintenance and management of strata subdivided buildings in Singapore, various shortcomings have surfaced.&nbsp; For instance, the current floor area grouping method used for share value allocation in residential developments has led to complaints from smaller unit owners that it is unfair to impose the same maintenance charge on them as the owners of larger units in<p align=left>Column: 2761<p> the same grouping.&nbsp; Larger unit owners, on the other hand, say that it is inequitable that the smaller units should have the same share of the undivided common property and voting rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been complaints of abuse of power by MCs.&nbsp; The recent high profile People's Park Centre and People's Park Complex fiasco, where the MC Chairman managed to get re-elected year after year, despite owing substantial maintenance fees, are cases in point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After having run their course for nearly two decades without any major revisions, except in 1999 which relates specifically to collective sale, the LTSA together with the BCPA are clearly in need of urgent revision to ensure their continued efficacy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst I agree with the general intention and objectives of the Bill, as well as most of its provisions, I would like to highlight five provisions which warrant further consideration and refinements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, limited common property and subsidiary management corporations.&nbsp; Sir, again, as noted by the Minister, to facilitate the management of mixed-use developments and certain types of residential developments as well as address the operational problems currently faced by the MCs of such developments, the Bill proposes to introduce the option of a two-tier system.&nbsp; This is indeed a major fundamental change made to the present legislation, and may I venture to add, can be viewed positively as a 100% improvement over the current one-tier system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sub-MC for a user group will be responsible for managing the \"limited\" common property intended for the exclusive use of that user group, such as the use of&nbsp;the swimming pool by&nbsp;the residential user group.&nbsp; The sub-MC will<p align=left>Column: 2762<p> have the power to levy contributions for the maintenance and&nbsp;improvement of that \"limited\" common property.&nbsp; This should result in more equitable sharing of maintenance contribution in mixed-use developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 76(1) of the Bill explicitly spells out the formation of sub-MCs under three different scenarios, firstly, mixed-use developments, comprising residential and non-residential uses; secondly, non-residential developments, comprising different uses, such as shops and offices or shops and hotels; and thirdly, residential developments, comprising different types of residential units, like high-rise apartments and townhouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill, however, does not explicitly allow for the formation of separate sub-MCs for non-residential developments, comprising units of&nbsp;similar use, but which can be delineated as separate buildings,&nbsp;for instance, the five separate and distinct office towers in Suntec City and the two office towers in Ngee Ann City.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restricting the creation of one sub-MC per&nbsp;user group would not help resolve the&nbsp;problem where owners of an office tower may want to upgrade their lifts but are unable to do so as the owners of the other office towers are opposed to the idea.&nbsp; Presumably, this scenario could come under the ambit of&nbsp;clause 76(3) which allows the Minister to approve other forms of subsidiary MCs.&nbsp; However, such non-residential developments, comprising&nbsp;&nbsp;strata lots of similar use but located in separate buildings, are likely to become more and more common in the future, particularly with the development of the Business Financial Centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, to facilitate such developments and at the same time provide more clarity, I propose that&nbsp;clause 76(1) be amended to explicitly allow for the formation of sub-MCs, not just for subsidiary proprietors of non-residential lots if they use<p align=left>Column: 2763<p> their lots for significantly different uses, but also for lots located in buildings that can be delineated separately.&nbsp; However, to address the concern that if there is no restriction of one sub-MC per user group, there may be too many sub-MCs in a single development which could lead to more problems, a minimum total strata area of, say, 5,000 square metres, could be stipulated before such a sub-MC could be formed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, one too many types of resolutions.&nbsp; Under&nbsp;\"Interpretation\",&nbsp;clause 2(2) of the Bill, it has provided for six different types of resolutions.&nbsp; The six resolutions, of which the first three are found in the existing Act are: ordinary resolution, special resolution, unanimous resolution, 90% resolution, comprehensive resolution with 90% consent, and resolution without dissent.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if there is indeed a need to have so many different types of resolution.&nbsp; Can we not resolve to keep to just the three existing types of resolutions, that is, ordinary resolution, special resolution and unanimous resolution?&nbsp; Or, if we really need it, allow at most, say, four, including the comprehensive resolution required for the creation of limited common property or the changing of the maintenance contribution formula.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to bear in mind that MCs comprise owners of&nbsp;strata units who are often laymen and not lawyers.&nbsp; Therefore, the provisions of the Bill should be made as clear, concise and simple as possible to reduce ambiguities in interpretation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, I note that the definitions for special and unanimous resolutions have been changed in the Bill.&nbsp; For special resolutions, the definition is now changed to \"at least 75% of the aggregate share value of the lots of all eligible subsidiary proprietors vote for\", instead of the present \"not more than 25% vote against\".&nbsp; A similar change is also made to the definition of unanimous resolutions, where<p align=left>Column: 2764<p> it now stipulates \"everyone votes for\" instead of \"no one votes against\".&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be more expedient to have the existing definitions of special and unanimous resolutions retained.&nbsp; This is because the new definitions require supporters to make the effort to vote for the motion, which is more difficult to fulfil in practice than requiring those who object to vote against.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apathy of many individual owners has resulted in poor attendance at general meetings.&nbsp; In most instances, very few individual owners, besides the office bearers themselves, attend the general meeting.&nbsp; Moreover, very often, those who make the special effort to attend are normally those who may have some unhappiness over the way the development is managed and are therefore likely to vote against and not vote for.&nbsp; Of course, proxy votes can be used but, again, the general apathy of owners means that it would be easier to allow for the converse, ie, that as long as not more than a certain percentage vote against, the resolution can be carried through.&nbsp; This should also apply to the other resolutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, managing agents.&nbsp; The Bill provides for the appointment of managing agents by the MC and allows the latter to delegate all of its powers, duties and functions to the MA.&nbsp; However, the Bill does not stipulate some minimum qualifications and standards required of the MA.&nbsp; Hence, as it stands, anyone can offer his services as a managing agent.&nbsp; This is in contrast to the stringent requirements imposed for other professions, such as insurance agents and financial advisors.&nbsp; In fact, even maid agencies are now required to be accredited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the MC comprises owners who generally have neither the expertise nor the time to devote to the maintenance and management of the building, most, if not all the duties of the MC are commonly delegated to the managing agent.&nbsp; Further, <p align=left>Column: 2765<p>managing developments, particularly large-scale projects, requires some minimum knowledge and understanding of various technical fields, such as building and engineering services, legislation relating to property, and even the proper conduct of meetings.&nbsp; Ignorance or a lack of knowledge and understanding of property maintenance and management matters may lead to costly oversight and mistakes which can pose hazards to the occupiers of the premises, as well as affect the reputation and, ultimately, the value of the property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus proposed that the Bill should require that the managing agent engaged by the MC should possess at least a certain minimum qualification and standard.&nbsp; Alternatively, if the Ministry prefers a more hands-off approach, the Bill could simply require that the managing agents be accredited managing agents of recognised professional bodies representing them, such as the SISV and the Association of Property and Facility Managers.&nbsp; This will ensure that the managing agents appointed possess a minimum standard of competence and are subject to some control by the relevant professional bodies.&nbsp; The appointment and the regulation of managing agents could be provided for under clause 132 of the Bill, which allows the Minister to make regulations for carrying out the provisions and purposes of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, responsibility of the MC to maintain windows.&nbsp; Under clause 28(1)(iv), the Bill specifically places the onus of properly maintaining and upkeeping windows where a side of the window is part of the common property, ie, part of the external wall, on the MC.&nbsp; However, there ought to be a distinction in liabilities between windows installed on external walls which can be opened, and those which are fixed, such as curtain walling.&nbsp; In the case of windows installed on <p align=left>Column: 2766<p>external walls and which can be opened, I am of the opinion that the MC should not be held responsible for their maintenance.&nbsp; Instead, the individual owners or subsidiary proprietors should be responsible for maintaining such windows, since he has access to and controls the use of the windows, not the MC.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this will then be in line with HDB's current stated policy that HDB flat owners are responsible for maintaining their windows.&nbsp; Otherwise, as the Bill now stands, external windows are defined as common property.&nbsp; Hence, the onus of maintaining these windows will not rest on the individual HDB flat owners but the MA which, in this case, would be the town council.&nbsp; The MC should only be responsible for maintaining fixed external windows, such as curtain walling, where it would not be practical for the subsidiary proprietors to engage specialist contractors to clean the windows, eg, a gondola system may be required.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is then this vexing issue and dilemma regarding the need to consider third-party liability in the event of falling windows.&nbsp; While MCs should not be held responsible for external windows which can be opened and are essentially controlled by the owners, MCs are in a better financial position to purchase third-party insurance, unlike subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; In such instances, should the MC take up third-party liability insurance on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors?&nbsp; How then would the cost of this third-party liability insurance be apportioned and/or recovered?&nbsp; There is thus clearly a need to further explore these issues and provisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, it is noted that while the Bill specifically spells out the duty to maintain and upkeep windows and other common property, there is no specific provision as regards the penalty for failure to properly maintain such property, which could lead to damage, injury or death.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2767<p>With the recent concern over falling windows as well as the continuing concern over killer-litter from high-rise flats, should not the Minister consider including provisions in the Bill on the responsibilities of the appropriate parties to properly maintain and upkeep property, and their liabilities for failure to do so?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, jurisdiction of the Strata Titles Board (STB).&nbsp; The types of disputes which the STB has jurisdiction over are limited to those spelt out under clauses&nbsp;100 to 113 of the Bill.&nbsp; Disputes which are not covered under these clauses would have to be settled via the courts, which can be time-consuming and very costly.&nbsp; It is thus proposed that the STB's jurisdiction be widened to deal with conflicts relating to management and operation, so that parties need not resort to court proceedings.&nbsp; For instance, the Bill does not provide for the Commissioner of Buildings to approve the demarcation of boundaries for the limited common properties.&nbsp; Hence, disputes over boundaries between the main MC and sub-MCs or even between sub-MCs would have to be resolved via the courts.&nbsp; It would be more efficient if such disputes can be adjudicated by the Strata Titles Board.&nbsp; The STB could also be given the powers to adjudicate on operational conflicts between the main MC and the sub-MCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge that the amendments proposed in the Bill have been the culmination of extensive discussions and feedback with various stakeholders, including SISV, which is the&nbsp;institute I represent.&nbsp; These amendments, when adopted, will definitely make the legislation governing the maintenance and management of strata-title developments more relevant and effective, and overcome many of the shortcomings and loopholes of the present legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, further refinements, such as those I have highlighted amongst many others, are needed to make sure that the Bill takes into account all relevant <p align=left>Column: 2768<p>concerns and issues, and ensure its robustness when implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this is an important piece of legislation that will affect the more than 170,000 owners of private apartments and condominiums and other developments, as well as many more future property owners, I therefore propose that this Bill be committed to a Select Committee of Parliament to receive further feedback from individuals, managing agents and professionals, as was the case for the 1987 major revamp of the LTSA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Minister of State for National Development, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, noted, \"The issues in the review of the LTSA and BCPA can be complex and involve many stakeholders.&nbsp; It is important that all stakeholders are consulted and that the proposed changes be thoroughly considered from all perspectives.\"&nbsp; If past practices are anything to go by, it could be well another 10 to 20 years before this legislation is reviewed again.&nbsp; Hence, I urge the Minister to put this Bill to a Select Committee to allow all stakeholders to submit their views for careful consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that this Bill will result in more effective management of buildings and will improve the quality of management in strata title properties.&nbsp; The Bill also attempts to resolve the conflict between owners of residential units and owners of commercial properties in a mixed development.&nbsp; Sir, I have some specific issues which I hope the Minister will clarify.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause&nbsp;75.&nbsp; By virtue of this clause, it seems that the subsidiary management corporation and&nbsp;limited common property will only apply to new developments.&nbsp; But the Minister may publish in the <I>Gazette</I> to extend the application of this division&nbsp;to other developments.&nbsp; The Minister had <p align=left>Column: 2769<p>earlier explained the reason, and I think it is wise to apply to only new developments for the time being.&nbsp; But I would like to know under what circumstances the Minister will decide whether or not to extend this division to existing developments, and whether there is a timeframe in which this division will be extended to all existing developments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 79(4) requires \"At least one member of the executive committee of a subsidiary management corporation to be a member of the council of the management corporation.\"&nbsp; I want to know what is the role of this sole member of the council who sits on the executive committee of the subsidiary management corporation.&nbsp; This person's role, duties and powers are not spelt out in the Bill.&nbsp; Would there be legal complications, since the subsidiary management corporation by itself has its own legal status?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 81(1) states that \"A management corporation's by-laws shall apply to the limited common property\", but the subsidiary management corporation can make amendments.&nbsp; This seems more like adding to the conflict of interests than resolving them.&nbsp; One can make by-laws, but the other can amend them in relation to the limited common property.&nbsp; So, what is the intended objective of this clause?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the First Schedule, paragraph 3, on quorum of general meeting, it was stated that a quorum shall consist of either 100 subsidiary proprietors or 30% of the aggregate share values of all lots, whichever is lower.&nbsp; I wonder why specify the number of \"100 subsidiary proprietors\"&nbsp;instead of saying that the 30% requirement is applicable to all.&nbsp; In a large development, 100 subsidiary proprietors could be just 10% of the aggregate share values of all lots.&nbsp; Does the Minister deem this sufficient to form a quorum?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2770<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what this Bill seeks to resolve is the conflict in estate management between residential and commercial lots in a mixed development.&nbsp; We must also bear in mind that, in practice, there are many things that may not be divided so clearly between the management corporation and the subsidiary management corporation.&nbsp; Driveway access may be common to both.&nbsp; Other services, such as water supply pipes and electrical main switchboards may not be so easily divisible.&nbsp; In an economic sense, there are things which, when divided, will cost more to maintain.&nbsp; For example, external facade cleaning may be more expensive if done separately, and accessibility will involve more cooperation and coordination, since there are now two separate bodies, ie, the management corporation and subsidiary management corporation.&nbsp; What would be the implications when one portion of the development is well maintained while the other part is mediocre?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will probably see more mixed developments, as the URA sells more white sites, such as the development of the new Downtown and with the&nbsp;\"Work, Live and Play\" planning objective.&nbsp; This Bill is timely to ensure that the commercial part of an upmarket development stays vibrant and is able to cope with fast-changing retail market circumstances.&nbsp; I think it will also help to preserve the value of commercial properties in a mixed development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp;

Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of National Development for taking the bold step to review many of the issues arising from the management of mixed development strata properties. There are three areas which I wish to highlight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, effective use of the two-tier system.&nbsp; The two-tier MC system will only be offered to new mixed use strata developments as an alternative option to a single MC system.&nbsp; This option will not be offered to existing mixed use strata developments so as to allow time for MND to assess the effectiveness of the new system and then apply retrospectively to the existing developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already a built environment and there are many existing mixed developments.&nbsp; The amendments arise because of feedback of real issues on the ground, and hence the review.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Ministry to put these recommendations to a Select Committee.&nbsp; This will enable the amendments&nbsp;in the Bill to be extensively consulted and discussed to ensure the relevance of the amendments in the actual management of the MCs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider implementing this two-tier MC system not only to new mixed developments, but also to selected existing mixed developments. This would enable the review to be made at a faster pace. For any new development, it takes <p align=left>Column: 2772<p>about two years before the development forms its first MC to allow the two-tier system to work.&nbsp; It takes another few years for the MND to assess the effectiveness of this two-tier system. This would stretch the review to at least to 4-5 years before any effective review can be done. Even after the review, it takes perhaps one or two years for the Ministry to make its decision. This would end up in a really long wait for the existing mixed development MCs which had already been waiting for a long, long time for&nbsp;a review of these Acts so that they could manage effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two-tier system could be allowed to be implemented in some of the newly registered MCs of the mixed development, that is, developments that have been handed over by the developers to the MCs, the review of the two-tier MC system could be made faster and many of the issues arising from the existing mixed developments could be resolved, and the mixed developments can be better and effectively managed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, more equitable sharing of the maintenance contribution in mixed use developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the two-tier system, the developer is allowed to set up a main MC with several subsidiary MCs. All the unit owners of the development will be members of the main MC, which will be responsible for managing only the common property shared by all the unit owners.&nbsp; Examples quoted were the driveways and car parks.&nbsp; My contention is with the car parks. The car parks should not be classified as a common property of the main MC.&nbsp; Many mixed developments already have a separate designated car park for each of the different users.&nbsp; By classifying the car park as a common property of the main MC will not resolve the conflicting interest that&nbsp;many MCs face today.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;residents from the residential units would like to have the least visitor lots in the car <p align=left>Column: 2773<p>park, firstly, for ease of parking by residents and, secondly, for less maintenance requirements.&nbsp;However, for the commercial lessees, the car park is essential to the attraction of&nbsp;customers for the commercial units.&nbsp; It means business for the commerical units and this will translate into higher rentals for the commercial units as well.&nbsp; In deciding for the use of the car park and the charges, this is always in dispute and has always ended up with&nbsp;the decision made by the residents, rather than by the commercial lessees, in view of the majority of respresentations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the mixed developments have car park charges that are high and deter shoppers from patronising the commercial shops.&nbsp; Let me show you the sensitivities of the car park charges. We know how popular&nbsp;the IMM shopping centre in Jurong is because of the free car park facilities.&nbsp; We heard recently that when the new owner took over and decided to charge customers for the use of the car park, because he wanted additional revenue, the number of customers fell tremendously.&nbsp; And as a result, the car park was reverted to free parking the next day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry should consider the car park as a limited common property, intended for the exclusive use of the user group. This would allow the correct user group to decide on the charges and the need of the car park spaces.&nbsp; If, for the older development, where the car park is shared, the quantum of the car park lots for the regular users could be logically determined and sub-divided and classified as a limited common property under each of the sub MC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the relationships between the main MC and sub-MCs, the roles and responsibilities of the sub-MCs and in relation to the MCs,&nbsp;the main MC and vice versa.&nbsp; This is not clearly defined in the amendment Bill. Issues such as, if there is <p align=left>Column: 2774<p>an inefficient sub-MC resulting in a deficit in the sub-MC's funds or vice versa, how would this affect the main MC?&nbsp; If one of the sub-MCs did not efficiently and effectively manage the common property, resulting in deterioration in the maintenance or management of the mixed development as a whole, what is the role of the main MC or vice versa, the sub-MC then?&nbsp; If one of the sub-MCs has&nbsp;committed offences under the Act, what is the role of the main MC?&nbsp; Would the main MC be responsible for the acts of the sub-MCs or vice versa?&nbsp; Finally, would the decisions made by the main MC&nbsp;need to be adopted by the sub-MCs or vice versa?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;is for the Ministry's consideration.&nbsp; I support the review of the Acts and wish to request the Ministry to&nbsp;commit the Bill to a Select Committee of Parliament for further deliberations.&nbsp; These amendments&nbsp;in the Bill concern many buildings and developments, including implications on the management and maintenance of HDB flats by the Town Councils, as the Town Councils Act was originated based on these two Acts, ie,&nbsp;the Land Titles (Strata) Act and the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I share the concern of my parliamentary colleagues here that there should be a provision in the Bill to prosecute&nbsp;persons responsible for&nbsp;killer-litter, for example, falling windows and hanging flower pots which are still prevalent despite the many joint efforts by HDB and related agencies.&nbsp; This is most important and critical, as this&nbsp;is the review of the Building Maintenance and Management Bill for buildings.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I support the changes to be introduced in the new Building Maintenance and Management Bill, as well as the LTSA which are now required to ensure that we meet current needs to provide higher standards of maintenance and management of condominiums and other strata title developments.&nbsp; There is also the need to improve the clarity of existing provisions in the two Acts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last five years, there was a large increase in the number of condominiums and other strata title developments in my constitutency.&nbsp; And residents in these developments have, from time to time, sought my assistance on problems of poor management and maintenance of the common areas of their development by the developer or the Management Corporations and the Managing Agents they appointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the poor maintenance includes such things like unkempt grounds, mosquito nuisance, poorly maintained car parks, cracks and defects in certain parts of the buildings, leakages in the roof and so on.&nbsp; This led to disputes between the residents</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

The Commissioner of Buildings has been very helpful to help resolve some of these disputes.&nbsp; Now, with the changes in the Act, the Management Corporation should be better empowered to take decisions to deal with these issues.&nbsp; Sir, I hope that with the improvements in the clarity of the existing provisions as well as the introduction of new provisions which would provide clearer definition on the roles of&nbsp;developers,&nbsp;Management Corporations (MCs),&nbsp;Managing Agents (MAs)&nbsp;as well as the owners or occupiers of&nbsp;residences in&nbsp;condominiums and other strata title developments, the problems and disputes can be more expeditiously resolved.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2776<p>However, the MCs and MAs would have to improve their management and decision-making capacity, and they would also have to strengthen the community spirit in their developments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with my colleagues that Managing Agents would have to be accredited and that they should have at least minimum qualifications to manage&nbsp;properties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the proposal to amend the LTSA to introduce an option of a 2-tier Management Corporation system for mixed-use strata title developments, to provide for more effective management of different parts of the common property. I believe that this will help to prevent disputes between parties in the development arising from the perceptions or misperceptions of one party or group in the development that the MC is more concerned with the priorities or interests of only one group at the expense of the other.&nbsp; Although this will be limited to new developments, the Minister has said that with experience gained in the implementation of the system, it could be later applied to existing developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this Bill would be of interest to owners of units in the condominiums and other strata title developments,&nbsp;MCs, MAs and developers,&nbsp;I agree that we should give them the opportunity to provide their views, feedback and proposals on the Bill.&nbsp; So, I support the proposal that the Bill be committed to a Select Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should have safeguards that the common property and grounds of the condominiums and other high-rise strata title developments are safe, healthy and hygienic.&nbsp; This would be the case if the owners of the units in the developments take great care to maintain high standards of maintenance of their units and other premises in the buildings.&nbsp; For instance, as Members have mentioned, in view of the recent spate of falling&nbsp;windows and other&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2777<p>killer litter, we should consider a provision in the Bill to enable quick prosecution action against owners who fail to maintain their properties.&nbsp; After all, this is a Bill to provide for better management and maintenance of buildings.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider this proposal?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Building Maintenance and Management Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, a lot of work has gone into it.&nbsp; That is why it is such a thick Bill.&nbsp; This Bill is all about improving the efficiency of building management.&nbsp; It is also about allowing private individuals to have much greater freedom in the management of their own affairs with minimal Government intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a very timely recognition of the vast changes that have taken place in terms of our residential landscape, as has already been said that there has been a huge increase in terms of condominiums and also other shared housing developments.&nbsp; And now we are looking at technology parks which will combine factories and other residential as well as recreational facilities.&nbsp; So, as more and more Singaporeans get affected by laws governing such developments, it is timely to refresh the laws and to update them so that it can be made much easier and much more pleasant for people to live and to work together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill seeks to give much more authority to management corporations.&nbsp; It is good to see that they will have the ability to reformulate maintenance contributions, to have the ability to erect and alter structures and also have the ability to grant exclusive use or rental of common property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2778<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also seeks to decriminalise minor offences, and this is a positive step in the right direction.&nbsp; Because if you want to give more responsibility to people, then it is right that the law should not come down too harshly on them if they commit minor transgressions.&nbsp; But, of course, the option for the aggrieved party to take such people to court is always there, although now it does not become the duty for the State.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite apart from self-regulation and&nbsp;self-governance, this Bill seeks to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of management corporations.&nbsp; A more significant change, as has been said, is that of having 2-tier management corporations to recognise the mixed-use developments which we are now accustomed to in a residential versus commercial development.&nbsp; And this approach is in line with practices that have taken place elsewhere, and so it is a logical step towards addressing issues pertaining to conflicting interests because we have different groups of people.&nbsp; I should also add&nbsp; -&nbsp; this has also been brought up&nbsp; -&nbsp; that even among different groups of commercial occupants, it would be worth our while and&nbsp;advantageous for them to also have separate tiers of management corporations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people live together or work together, invariably, conflicts are bound to arise.&nbsp; In the case of residents having to cope with shopowners, they have diametrically opposite views.&nbsp; One would like, of course, privacy.&nbsp; The other would like bustling crowds.&nbsp; One would like security.&nbsp; The other would like unlimited access.&nbsp; So, this approach towards having a 2-tier, or even 3-tier management corporation, will seek to address some of these issues.&nbsp; It will not address all issues entirely, but it would give greater flexibility to groups of people to manage their affairs better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it has to be recognised that no one system can ever be perfect.&nbsp; And<p align=left>Column: 2779<p> although a multi-tier system will better address or cater to the differing needs of people, it will not be perfect.&nbsp; There will be problems and there will always be conflicts and sub-committees may well engage themselves in court, but let it be.&nbsp; Let there be flexibility and let there be greater ability for different groups of people to better manage their differing needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we call for more management corporations, it will also mean that we need more people to get involved.&nbsp; And given the generally high level of apathy, the question is whether we will be able to get enough people.&nbsp; But I think this is one challenge that Singaporeans ought to rise up to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwellers of condominiums are generally richer.&nbsp; They are usually much more successful in business.&nbsp; They are more successful in their careers.&nbsp; These are the very people we would like to encourage to step forward and contribute to their community.&nbsp; So, their immediate neighbourhood is perhaps a good place to start with, and these people can really help to&nbsp;resolve conflicts which are bound to arise when people live together and share common facilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These problems are not exactly unique to Singaporeans.&nbsp; I read in a recent article that in Britain, the one thing that people complain most about is their neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in&nbsp;these days, it is not so easy to live with one another, and we wish that we could all have the kampong spirit back, but we do not really wish to go back and live in a kampong.&nbsp; So, if gifted people can step forward and offer themselves in order to develop a more peaceful, a more caring and a more comfortable environment, I think we have a chance of reviving that kampong spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also seeks to bring about a much higher level of determining strata title and yet, at the same time, it also gives enough protection for minorities as well.&nbsp; With more freedom given to<p align=left>Column: 2780<p> management corporations, it is also hoped that management corporations would go beyond just managing premises and would also bring about the development of community spirit.&nbsp; We talk about how to cope with infant care, how to cope with after-school care, how to cope with elder care and so on.&nbsp; If management corporations can extend themselves beyond just looking after premises, I think we have a good chance of also developing the community spirit, which Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about earlier on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also seeks to equip management corporations with authority and to get things done.&nbsp; As I look through the provisions, consensus of approval is still required.&nbsp; A very high level of majority approval is still required.&nbsp; We talk about 90%, we talk about 75% and so on.&nbsp; These are still clearly very super majorities which, in this day and age, is very hard to attain.&nbsp; As many Members have asked for this Bill to be committed to a Select Committee, I wonder whether this super majority should also be reviewed because it is clearly not achievable and perhaps unrealistic too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to say that it is a good Bill, and we should all try to make it work.&nbsp; When we talk about self-governance and self-regulation and we have apprehensions about it, I think we ought to rise to the challenge.&nbsp; It is no use saying that we lack awareness and we lack experience, because it is really up to Singaporeans, at the end of the day, to make the society which we hope we like to belong to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, I would like to say that, at the end of the day, it is a matter of choice.&nbsp; If we choose to live in condominiums, if we choose to live and work in mixed developments, then we have to understand the limitations that come with it, and there is a clear need to compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;The law can only provide for provisions and guidelines as to how everybody can live and work happily toge<p align=left>Column: 2781<p>ther and therefore efforts made to make the laws much more flexible as well as to get people more fully involved in the management of their own affairs are clearly welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point<I>&nbsp;</I> is that the Bill also seeks to set general guidelines as to the&nbsp;type of people who should be on management committees.&nbsp; I think it is very crucial that we get the right people on management committees and therefore whilst the law can make provisions as to who can be left out and considered unsuitable to represent the constituents, it is more important for residents to choose with care who should be on management committees and able people should step forward and offer their services to serve their residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill which seeks to merge the Land Titles (Strata) Act and the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act, which is to&nbsp;be administered by the Ministry of National Development (MND).&nbsp; I think it is a very wise move.&nbsp; MND has rich experience in building and maintaining&nbsp; public housing. This Bill will enable the MND to have good and proper management over private properties as well.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Bill will also deal with arrears of management fees and the other problems. It will decriminalise such acts of violation and breaches of the rules. Under the Bill, these cases will be dealt with by the management corporation, which will decide whether it would institute civil actions against the offenders. The management corporation will have more space for consultation and negotiation between the subsidiary proprietors and the other parties.&nbsp; For example, the <p align=left>Column: 2782<p>management corporation may waive some of the management fees owing by subsidiary proprietors on ground of financial hardship, or allow them to pay the arrears&nbsp; by instalments, so as to avoid facing criminal sanctions.&nbsp; In this way, the management corporation will be in a better position to communicate with the subsidiary proprietors, and resolve their problems in a more humane manner, thereby creating a better and cordial living environment for all.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the new Bill also provides for the developer to pay the management fees of the unsold units to the management corporation.&nbsp; I think this is reasonable.&nbsp; At the moment, this is being practised in the public housing sector. When the Housing and Development Board has sold a block of flats, it shall be responsible for the payment of maintenance fees of any unsold units to the Town Council, and continues to do so until such time when the units are sold.&nbsp; Thereafter, the new owners will take over the payment of the S&amp;CC.&nbsp; Under this system, the Town Council will have sufficient funds to manage and maintain the buildings and the common property, thereby providing a better living environment for all the residents.&nbsp; This Bill brings the private housing estates in line with the present system of the HDB estates, thereby ensuring a better living environment for their residents. .</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, under this new Bill, all those who are in arrears of the maintenance fees will not be eligible to stand for election as members of the management corporation.&nbsp; This is very logical.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a member of the management corporation, the subsidiary proprietor concerned should set a good example, so that the other subsidiary proprietors will emulate.&nbsp; If the management committee members themselves are in arrears, and yet they are holding important positions in the management corporation, this will send a wrong signal to the others, and it will not<p align=left>Column: 2783<p> be easy for them to implement their policies and&nbsp;execute their duties.&nbsp; So, under this new provision, those who are in arrears will not be eligible to stand for election in the management corporation.&nbsp; I think it&nbsp; is very logical.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, the managing agents should not go around collecting the proxies from the subsidiary proprietors for the general meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;The managing agents'&nbsp; main duty&nbsp; is to help the management corporation look after the estate, using their professional expertise. They should look into the daily maintenance, accounting and other administrative work.&nbsp; They have no part to play in the election of management corporation members, nor shall they be involved in the canvassing or campaigning for votes for any particular group&nbsp;of candidates.&nbsp; I think this is a very good provision under this Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, under this Bill, there will be provision for two-tier management corporations.&nbsp; I have some reservation about this.&nbsp; In order to resolve some of the problems and disputes in multi-purpose property, I think this two-tier management corporation may not be the ideal way to settle these problems. In fact, the establishment of more sub-MCs will also give rise to more conflicts of interest and disputes.&nbsp; If the dispute arises because of money, I think we should look at it from the monetary aspect.&nbsp; Maybe we should import the concept of the Town Councils, ie, we set up just one management corporation, but we can have separate accounts for the various sub-groups.&nbsp; At the moment, Town Councils have to look after a great number of HDB flats as well as common property. There may be the Town Centre, the Neighbourhood Centre, the car park and the various maintenance work.&nbsp; The Town Councils set up different accounts for each aspect of their work, eg, one for car parks, one for landscaping, one for general cleaning, etc. This is quite similar to that undertaken by the manage<p align=left>Column: 2784<p>ment corporation of&nbsp; the private condominiums.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Town Council, our system has been working well.&nbsp; There has not been any dispute over these accounts. When the conservancy charges are received, they will be allocated to the various accounts for their specific purpose.&nbsp; So, as far as the accounts are concerned, they are very clearly divided.&nbsp; If the Town Council wants to do any maintenance work, it will just look into the financial situation in the respective accounts, and then plan the budget accordingly. This is very effective and transparent.&nbsp; I am sure this same method can be applied to the private condominiums.&nbsp; I think the management corporations can make a study of the system in the Town Councils - to set up separate accounts, rather than having sub-MCs.&nbsp; Otherwise, even if there are many sub-MCs, it will not be able to solve the matters.&nbsp; I think they will only complicate matters and give rise to more disputes.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister will consider my suggestion.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,&nbsp;let me thank all the Members who have spoken for their support of the Bill and for their very comprehensive and detailed comments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned in my Second Reading speech, we have had extensive consultations with members of the public, industry stakeholders, and&nbsp;members of the GPC for National Development.&nbsp; But I accept that this Bill is highly technical and the issues are very complex.&nbsp; In fact, the Bill itself runs to more than 200 pages.&nbsp; The provisions of this Bill have a far-reaching impact on many people in Singapore, not just those who live in strata title units, condominiums, etc.&nbsp; There are some 170,000 of these households and they form a significant proportion \u02c6\u2019 something like 15% \u02c6\u2019 of the total number of households or dwelling units in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, there are also the management <p align=left>Column: 2785<p>corporations (2,700 of them).&nbsp; There are the managing agents who have been hired by the management corporations to look after these units, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; So there are many stakeholders involved in this issue.&nbsp; Therefore, I agree with Members&nbsp;\u02c6\u2019 Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Othman Haron Eusofe, Mdm Cynthia Phua, and other Members \u02c6\u2019 that we refer this Bill to a Select Committee.&nbsp; This will allow the Bill to be more thoroughly&nbsp;scrutinised, and all relevant views, and&nbsp;views which have not yet been heard, can be so heard before it is finalised and enacted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since the Bill is going to a Select Committee, I will not address all the points that have been raised by the Members, especially some of the more technical ones.&nbsp; But I will respond very briefly to some of them, before I touch on the more general intent behind the proposed amendments in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin mentioned&nbsp;the various kinds of documents, what kind of documents as well as how many documents to hand over to the MCs.&nbsp; I think this is something&nbsp;the Select Committee can consider and discuss.&nbsp; He also asked how we&nbsp;allocate share values, and also what is the code of practice for&nbsp;managing agents.&nbsp; These are issues which I hope members of the public as well as members of the industry will raise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked under what circumstances we allow sub-MCs for new as well as existing developments.&nbsp; Again, as I have explained, we would like to start off with the new developments, because I do not think this&nbsp;is a totally trouble-free proposal, and&nbsp;I expect that there will be problems associated with creating another level of management corporation in mixed developments.&nbsp; Will they be in conflict?&nbsp; How will they delineate common property, and so on and so forth?&nbsp; So, I think it is wise for us to implement it first for new <p align=left>Column: 2786<p>developments and to learn from this experience and after a while, to then apply it to existing developments, if they&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to opt for it.&nbsp; This is a more cautious approach.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, the Bill also allows&nbsp;the Minister to approve existing developments which so wish to have multi-tier MCs under certain circumstances.&nbsp; These circumstances are many and, again, I would suggest the Member can raise these at the Select Committee hearing, and we can go into it in greater detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also asked, why so many resolutions?&nbsp; She counted six resolutions in all.&nbsp; In fact, this was a result of&nbsp;some feedback from the industry that, depending on the issue concerned, we need to have different levels of consensus.&nbsp; The more serious the issue, obviously the higher the level of consensus&nbsp;required.&nbsp; And I think this is a reasonable proposition.&nbsp; But, again, let us discuss this at the Select Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She mentioned another significant point, which is windows.&nbsp; Yes, it is correct that windows are currently considered to be part of common property.&nbsp; Dr Khor proposed that we should now make a distinction between those windows that can be opened and consider those windows to be the responsibility of subsidiary proprietors, and to make the fixed windows, such as curtain walls, the responsibility of management corporations.&nbsp; I think this is a good suggestion.&nbsp; But I think I should bring to her attention the fact that this decision to make windows part of common property was taken at the last Select Committee hearing in 1987 when&nbsp;the last major review of the Land Titles (Strata) Act was undertaken.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>And, in fact, this decision was made at the request of MCs of the SISV, as well as the Law Society, for&nbsp;I believe,&nbsp;aesthetic reasons, to make sure that the subsidiary proprietors do not change the windows.&nbsp; But I think times have changed and&nbsp;it is timely for us to relook at this provision.&nbsp; So, I <p align=left>Column: 2787<p>would like to thank her for this suggestion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point she made was whether we can widen the mandate or the ability of the Strata Titles Board to deal with different types of conflicts.&nbsp; I believe we can consider this, to widen the jurisdiction of the Strata Titles Board.&nbsp; But I would like to allow representations from the industry before we do this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked several very specific questions.&nbsp; I hope that these questions can be raised at the Select Committee.&nbsp; But I thought I should respond to a few of them.&nbsp; For example, why do we require a quorum of only 100 SPs?&nbsp; Why so few?&nbsp; Does it mean that the issue at hand is not so important?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The answer is a practical one.&nbsp; This is something that has been fed back to us which is that, for many large developments, the&nbsp;requirement to have 30% of SPs present&nbsp;to form a quorum is not very easy to achieve.&nbsp; In fact, say, for&nbsp;large developments of 1,000 units or more, 30% is equivalent to 300 SPs, and many a time, they find it very difficult to gather these 300 SPs.&nbsp; And this is the reason why, in the spirit of making it easier for AGMs to be convened, the quorum has been reduced to either a minimum of 100 SPs or 30%.&nbsp; But these are not hard and fast numbers.&nbsp; The industry has made this suggestion. &nbsp;There has been&nbsp;a consensus so far, but let us leave this for discussion at the Select Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua made the same point about whether we should implement, not just for new developments but also for existing developments, the idea of&nbsp;a two-tier MC. &nbsp;I have the same response I gave to Dr Amy Khor just now -&nbsp;let us start off with the new developments, learn&nbsp;from the experience and then, if necessary, we can transfer the experience and the lessons learned and extend it&nbsp;to existing developments subsequently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2788<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on the&nbsp;general intent behind the proposed amendments in this Bill.&nbsp; In putting forth this Bill, we recognise, as I have explained earlier, that we do not have a long history of&nbsp;strata title or managing strata developments.&nbsp; We&nbsp;enacted the LTSA only in 1967.&nbsp; This was 37 years ago. Then, the last major&nbsp;amendment to the LTSA was made in 1987, almost two decades ago.&nbsp; Since then, the&nbsp;number of strata units and&nbsp;the number of MCs, which already formed a significant percentage of total dwelling units,&nbsp;have grown and will continue to grow in the years to come.&nbsp; So the legislation needs further amendments to provide for more effective management of strata developments and to recognise that, with more mixed-use developments, there will be more differentiation of interests.&nbsp; There will be different interest groups within a particular development.&nbsp; And this is the reason why we introduce this option, and I stress the word, it is an \"option\" of a two-tier MC system.&nbsp; We can then provide flexibility to MCs to make decisions on common properties, on the one hand, that are used by everybody and also limited common properties that are used by specific groups.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stress that there is no intention to segregate groups within the strata development,&nbsp;a concern&nbsp;that was raised by Mr Ang Mong Seng.&nbsp; The interactions between the different groups can still be facilitated within this two-tier system through the main MC.&nbsp; The reason why we went through this exercise was because there has been a significant amount of feedback concerning the problems of mixed-use developments where you have got disputes between MCs, you have&nbsp;got management problems and, basically, many of these complaints relate to the governance of the MCs.&nbsp; So what we must do fundamentally is to recognise that the MC is the supreme decision-making body in the strata development which has been elected by the SPs to take charge of their well-being&nbsp;but, at the same time, we also<p align=left>Column: 2789<p> recognise that there are different interest groups.&nbsp; So it makes sense to empower the MCs to decide on issues related to the estates for the benefit of the subsidiary proprietors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the sentiments expressed by Members that the legislation should strive to enhance and strengthen the community spirit among the SPs.&nbsp; I think the point that was made very strongly by Dr Teo Ho Pin.&nbsp; I hope Members would agree with me, however, that this community spirit, like attitude change, like mindset change, cannot be legislated.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the sentiment behind what Mrs Fang Ai Lian was talking about - getting more people to be involved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strata developments are founded on the concept of community living -&nbsp;community living with shared ownership of common property and individual ownership of their own unit, their strata title.&nbsp; So, with this concept, community living must require of each resident a certain amount of give and take and it must require of each resident, of each subsidiary proprietor, a knowledge of what are his legal rights and responsibilities, what are his duties and liabilities.&nbsp; The legislation can only create a framework, one, which I have explained, will be based on self-governance and a clear definition of the demarcation of&nbsp; responsibilities among the different stakeholders.&nbsp; So, hopefully, this framework, together with a large dose of the give and take, will create and&nbsp;foster this conducive environment for various parties to work together to resolve issues and to do something for the common good of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this goal, SPs as well as other stakeholders will have to take on more responsibilities and they will have to exercise these responsibilities fairly and wisely within this framework of greater self-governance.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we have decided that we will<p align=left>Column: 2790<p> decriminalise many of the offences, those offences that will not generally affect public interest, and to reduce the extent of Government involvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I would agree with Mrs Fang Ai Lian that we should encourage strata title owners to be more aware of their rights and responsibilities of ownership to come forward and to get involved.&nbsp; I know it is very difficult to do so.&nbsp; Many condominium MCs have difficulty in getting people to come forward to serve.&nbsp; But it is their own property that they are being asked to manage.&nbsp; And if they abdicate this responsibility, they do not exercise those responsbilities, then the danger is that those who do come forward may actually do something that they may not agree with ultimately, and then it is too late for them to complain.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would ask the BCA, together with the industry associations like SISV, and so on, to take steps to educate owners, MCs, SPs, MAs, about how the changes in the Act will affect them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking about&nbsp;managing agents (MAs), I would agree with Dr Teo, Dr Amy Khor and others that there must be greater professionalism among the managing agents.&nbsp; Here, again, I come back to my point, Government can only provide the overall framework and we can facilitate the professional &nbsp;development of MAs.&nbsp; But the industry itself has to take the lead in this.&nbsp; And the issue of whether to legislate and, if so, to what extent, we can discuss this at the Select Committee.&nbsp; But I note that there are plans by industry associations, like the SISV, to accredit MAs in Singapore to help raise the standard of professionalism in the management of strata developments.&nbsp; I believe this is a step in the right direction, and I would support this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also share the views and the concerns of Members, like Mr Othman Haron Eusofe and Dr Teo Ho Pin, that we must do something about the mainte<p align=left>Column: 2791<p>nance culture in Singapore.&nbsp; There is, I believe, not a strong culture of awareness of maintenance in Singapore.&nbsp; If Members would recall recently, BCA had to enact legislation to make it compulsory for building owners and&nbsp;individual households to fit or refit the airconditioners in high-rise buildings.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;we had the problem of falling windows.&nbsp; I cannot emphasise enough the dangers that are posed by dislodged windows, falling airconditioners, tiles, or any other external parts of buildings, particularly in our&nbsp;predominantly high-rise developments.&nbsp; And this matter needs to be taken seriously because lives are at stake.&nbsp; So owners must assume responsibility for building maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I last spoke about the issue of falling windows in this House, I mentioned that we would be looking at ways to mitigate this issue.&nbsp; We have two choices.&nbsp; We can continue with public education alone, or we can&nbsp;strengthen the legislation to inculcate&nbsp;a strong maintenance culture.&nbsp; Or we can preferably do both.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, we reduce the dangers to the public of objects falling down from high-rise buildings, whether&nbsp;they are&nbsp;private or HDB flats.&nbsp; I suggest, again, that this matter be deliberated at the Select Committee, and&nbsp;we will consider introducing appropriate provisions in the&nbsp;Bill to prosecute owners who allow their fittings to fall and&nbsp;endanger the public, as has been suggested by several Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had also announced previously that BCA&nbsp;would be&nbsp;considering legislating the mandatory periodic inspections of windows.&nbsp; Having carefully considered the public and industry feedback on the subject, I wish to say that BCA will not proceed with the mandatory window inspection proposal at least for the time being.&nbsp; However, BCA will work towards introducing legislative changes to ensure safety standards upstream concerning the design,&nbsp;installation and&nbsp;retrofitting of windows, and this will involve separate<p align=left>Column: 2792<p> amendments to another Act, namely, the Building Control Act and Regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, once again, I thank Members for their very detailed inputs and I look forward to discussing this further at the Select Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill before the House contains six amendments.&nbsp; The first amendment relates to the Accounting and <p align=left>Column: 2793<p>Corporate Regulatory Authority.&nbsp; The second amendment concerns the transfer of reserves between entities governed by the Protection of Reserves Framework.&nbsp; The third amendment has to do with the Personnel Boards of the Public Service Commission.&nbsp; The fourth amendment deals with Singapore's contribution to the International Development Association (IDA).&nbsp; The fifth amendment pertains to grant of citizenship by descent, and the sixth amendment, pertaining to Article 22P, is technical in nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn first to the amendment pertaining to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.&nbsp; Currently, under Article 18, the Chairman of the Public Accountants Board is a member of the Presidential Elections Committee.&nbsp; As the Public Accountants Board was merged with the Registry of Companies and Businesses to form the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) on 1st April 2004, Article 18 is amended by changing the reference from the Chairman of PAB to the Chairman of ACRA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Transfer of reserves</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn now to the amendment relating to the transfer of reserves.&nbsp; Currently, Article 22B and Article 22D of the Constitution enable the transfer of reserves from <p align=left>Column: 2794<p>Fifth Schedule statutory boards and Fifth Schedule Government companies to the Government, and between Fifth Schedule statutory boards, without such transfer being regarded as a draw on their past reserves.&nbsp; The Constitution, however, has no provision to enable similar transfers of reserves from the Government to Fifth Schedule statutory boards and Fifth Schedule Government companies, and between Fifth Schedule statutory boards and Fifth Schedule Government companies, without such transfer being regarded as a draw on their reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting in place a more comprehensive framework for transfer of reserves between protected entities will enable more timely responses by the Government to changing economic or business conditions.&nbsp; For example, reserves may need to be transferred from the Government to new Fifth Schedule statutory boards and Fifth Schedule Government companies quickly to seize opportunities in new areas of growth&nbsp;and existing Fifth Schedule statutory boards and Fifth Schedule Government companies may need to be restructured, merged or corporatised to better deliver public services and manage Government assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 22B and Article 22D are therefore amended, and a new article 148I is inserted to complete the framework for the different transfers of reserves between protected entities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has been consulted and agrees with the above amendments of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Personnel Board</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I&nbsp;move now to the third amendment.&nbsp; This pertains to allowing every Personnel Board to delegate its authority to any of its members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The functions of the Public Service Commission (PSC) were devolved to a system of Personnel Boards by constitutional amendments in 1994.&nbsp; To facilitate decision-making, Personnel Boards often assign individual members the authority to decide on the appointment, confirmation and emplacement, promotion and transfer of the public officers under the Boards' purview.&nbsp; However, as the assigned member is only acting on behalf of the Board, the Board's covering approval is required.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2795<p>Consequently, each and every decision made by an assigned member on the appointment, confirmation and emplacement, promotion and transfer of an officer has to be circulated to all the other Board members for confirmation.&nbsp; If there are no objections after a certain timeframe set by the Board, the Board is regarded as having approved and adopted the member's decision as its own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This practice is increasingly impractical.&nbsp; For Personnel Boards that look after large Ministries like the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs, Board members receive many submissions each month on appointments, confirmations and transfers of officers, mostly straightforward, for their approval.&nbsp; The covering approval of the Board has become a formality and, in effect, has no material impact, as the decisions of the assigned members have consistently followed the Public Service Division's approved rules on such matters.&nbsp; Since 1995, no Board member has raised an objection to any decision taken by an assigned member, because there was no reason to do so as long as the rules have been followed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 110D of the Constitution is therefore amended to include three new clauses to empower each Personnel Board to delegate, in writing and subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, its powers to any of its members.&nbsp; The Board's member must exercise that power in accordance with the terms of the delegation.&nbsp; Any act or thing done by the delegate of a Personnel Board will have the same force and effect as if it had been done by the Personnel Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the amendment, any deviation from the approved rules and any adverse decisions will continue to be considered by the entire Board and the powers of the delegated member will be limited to following the rules laid down by PSD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2796<p><p><I>International Development Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I next move on to the fourth amendment, and this pertains to the International Development Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;The IDA Act is being amended to allow the Minister to make contributions other than membership subscriptions to the IDA, which is a World Bank lending facility for poverty reduction programmes.&nbsp; To do this, it is also necessary to amend Article 144(3) of the Constitution to add the IDA Act to the list of Acts for other international organisations, so that future IDA contributions can similarly be made using Article 144(1)(b) of the Constitution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Article 144(1)(b), the Government is allowed to make guarantees or raise loans, with the President's concurrence, to the list of statutes under Article 144(3).&nbsp; With this amendment, we will standardise our procedures for contributing to the IDA with those applicable to other international organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Citizenship</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, lastly, I move on to the fifth amendment.&nbsp; This pertains to relaxing the restrictions on grant of citizenship by descent and increasing the length of time a person may spend away from Singapore when considering the residence period for citizenship applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Articles in the Constitution on the grant of citizenship have largely remained unchanged since the 1960s.&nbsp; However, the world today is very different compared to then.&nbsp; Growing numbers of Singaporean men and women are travelling overseas to work, study or pursue their personal goals and starting their families abroad.&nbsp; Between 2000 and 2002, the number of foreigners who were granted Permanent Residence under the sponsorship of their Singaporean spouse increased from about 4,000 to almost 5,800, ie, within a space of just two<p align=left>Column: 2797<p> years.&nbsp; The number of foreign-born children granted citizenship has also gone up by 41% just over a decade, from about 1,900 in 1991 to about 2,700 in 2003.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs reviewed our citizenship laws last year. We studied the laws of other countries like the United Kingdom, which had addressed these issues.&nbsp; The Remaking Singapore Committee had also separately recommended that the provisions on the grant of Singapore citizenship to a foreign-born child be made gender neutral.&nbsp; Let me now highlight the key amendments in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Grant of citizenship by descent&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> I shall first touch on the grant of&nbsp;citizenship by descent.&nbsp; Article 122 of the Constitution governs the grant of citizenship by descent to a child of a Singaporean, when the child is born abroad.&nbsp; The child is conferred citizenship by descent as a matter of right if the parent applies within one year of the child's birth.&nbsp; Currently, a child is entitled to citizenship by descent only when the father is a&nbsp;Singaporean who is a citizen by birth or registration.&nbsp; It does not apply when the father is a Singapore citizen by descent, or when it is the mother who is a Singaporean.&nbsp; Female Singaporeans can only pass on citizenship by registration to their foreign-born child, and citizenship by registration is not conferred as a matter of right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments to Article 122 will, firstly, allow female Singaporeans to pass on&nbsp;citizenship by descent to their foreign-born child.&nbsp; This will make the grant of citizenship by descent gender neutral.&nbsp; Sections 12 and 15 of the Third Schedule to the Constitution will be amended consequentially to bring them in line with the gender parity introduced in Article 122(1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2798<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the amendments will allow Singaporean parents who acquired their Singapore citizenship by descent to pass on citizenship by descent to their foreign-born children, if these parents meet a residency criterion.&nbsp; They have to have stayed in Singapore for a total of five years or more before the birth of the child.&nbsp; Alternatively, they have to have stayed in Singapore for a total of at least two years out of the five years prior to the birth of the child, which is similar to the criterion used for determining Singaporean's eligibility to vote overseas.&nbsp; Currently, a Singaporean who was born abroad and acquired citizenship by descent, then grew up and worked in Singapore, then happened to have a child born abroad while he is temporarily overseas, cannot transmit his citizenship to the child by descent.&nbsp; This is unfair.&nbsp; The amendment overcomes this problem, but it imposes a residency requirement on the parent, so that we will not have generations of absentee Singaporeans with no real links to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Increase in absence period</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, increase in absence period.&nbsp; Currently, permanent residents need to meet a residential requirement before they can qualify to be&nbsp;citizens.&nbsp; Section 16 of the Third Schedule to the Constitution allows a person to be away from Singapore for up to six months when calculating the period of residence.&nbsp; Recognising that more of our citizens and permanent residents have to travel in the course of their work or study, the Government proposes to increase this to 12 months.&nbsp; For example, Article 123(2) of the Constitution provides that the wife of a Singaporean must be resident in Singapore for at least two years before she may obtain Singapore citizenship.&nbsp; With the amendment, she can now be overseas for up to one year during the 2-year qualifying period and still be eligible for citizenship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2799<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should stress that citizenship is a privilege that should not be taken for granted.&nbsp; Even with the proposed amendments, Singaporeans living and working overseas must make the effort to ensure that they and their children remain rooted and committed to Singapore.&nbsp; All Singaporeans, whether here or abroad, must continue to have a stake and share in the responsibility for the nation's success and future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a woman MP, I am greatly heartened by this Bill which, among other weighty constitutional changes, permits the child born overseas to&nbsp;a Singaporean mother to be deemed a Singapore citizen.&nbsp; This&nbsp;has been the subject of some unhappiness in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous&nbsp;position of conferring citizenship by descent only on the children of a Singaporean father was gender-biased.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the distinction?&nbsp; Do women contribute any less to the well-being of the country?&nbsp;&nbsp;On what basis do we&nbsp;implicitly conclude that the child of a couple with a Singaporean mother only is any less Singaporean in soul than one born to a Singaporean father?&nbsp; Why should the privilege be given on one side but not the other?&nbsp; The argument then was that ours is a patrilineal society, that the father is often the sole breadwinner and, just as the child adopts the surname of the father, so the nationality of the child must follow that of the father.&nbsp; I am therefore delighted that, as the Minister for Home Affairs had explained in the recent Budget debate, the Government is aware that times have changed.&nbsp; Our society is still patrilineal, but the wheel is turning, gently but also perceptibly.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the recent debate on procreation spotlighting the dilemma of the modern women, this amendment goes some way <p align=left>Column: 2800<p>towards equalising the official treatment of the two sexes in Singapore.&nbsp; I do not have the statistics, but it is observed and as has just been pointed out by&nbsp;DPM and Minister for Finance, that cases of Singaporean women marrying foreign spouses are on the increase.&nbsp; Moreover, very often, they belong to the better educated classes.&nbsp; An increasing number of these more qualified women have been unable to find suitable partners here because of educational mismatch and the marrying-down syndrome among Singaporean men.&nbsp; Therefore, pragmatically speaking, denying such families the right of citizenship for their children born overseas could represent a big loss to Singapore's already limited talent pool.&nbsp; Now that national boundaries have become so porous and we face a precipitous shortage of population to make our economic survival assured over the next 30 to 40 years, the larger perspective is that our</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

will become citizens and contribute towards our nation-building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we open our arms to foreign talents who come to our shores, we should not forget the sons and daughters of those already from our shores,&nbsp;even if the blood that crosses to their overseas children's veins&nbsp;is mixed.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Minister Lim Hng Kiang's Committee debates the issues about making citizenship count more, this amendment has come none too soon. It is also good that there is a residency requirement for the parent who is&nbsp;Singaporean by descent, so that there is at least some familiarity with the land to which he or she is linked.&nbsp;Hopefully, those years will be sufficient to endear this country to his or her heart and deepen the bonds to the land to the next generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2801<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this, I am very pleased to support the amendment.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I support the amendment to Article 122 of the Constitution to allow children born overseas to Singaporean mothers to acquire citizenship by descent.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a long overdue amendment.&nbsp; It accords the same value of citizenship to both father and mother.&nbsp; This is fair and it is a good move.&nbsp; My concern is about children born overseas whose parents are themselves Singapore citizens by descent. Under the proposed amendments, such parents will now qualify to have their children acquire Singapore citizenship provided that the parents have resided in Singapore either for a total of five years before the child is born or for at least two of the five years preceding the child's birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such parents were not born in Singapore. They may have just come back after reaching 21 to take the Oath of Allegiance and stay away for most of their lives.&nbsp; They may not know much about Singapore nor have they made contribution to the nation, except male citizens who have to perform National Service and reservist duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these amendments, such persons can also pass on Singapore citizenship to their children who&nbsp;are born to parents who hardly have connection with Singapore.&nbsp; Is this a desirable situation?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1985, the Government saw it fit to amend Article 135 of the Constitution to give itself powers to deprive Singaporeans of their citizenship if they live in another country for 10 years without returning. This applies even to citizens who are Singaporeans by birth.&nbsp; The rationale given in Parliament then by the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law was, and I quote him, that there were persons&nbsp;who \"for all practical purposes, had migrated with no intention<p align=left>Column: 2802<p> of ever returning to Singapore.&nbsp; They have grown up in an alien environment.&nbsp; They have not contributed anything to our economic development. Claiming to have been born in Singapore, they now want to come back, be recognised as citizens with all the rights and privileges and to enjoy the fruits of the labour of those Singaporeans who remain in Singapore. Quite clearly, those who have no skills or no family roots would have problems adjusting to our society and our way of life.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not a concern then, even more applicable, where neither the person nor even his parents were born in Singapore after the amendment has taken place?&nbsp; By mooting the present amendment, is&nbsp;the Government not contradicting itself on those principles?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, for at least a decade, the women in this House, past and present, have advanced various arguments to amend the Constitution so that its provisions are gender neutral.&nbsp; I am glad that at long last, this is coming to pass.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not want to sound churlish, but I think it is important to be clear on what is the principle that is guiding us in making this significant amendment today.&nbsp; Is it out of pragmatism because of changing circumstances,&nbsp;economic imperatives,&nbsp;declining birth rate, a trend of Singaporeans marrying foreigners, migration patterns, or is it something more fundamental that this past discrimination against women&nbsp;should be redressed as all citizens should be treated equally under the Constitution?&nbsp; I am not saying that the other factors should be discounted, but they should be contributing factors and not the deciding factors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need debates like this to remind us that when Singapore was founded, the vision of our founding leaders was to create a fair, just and equal<p align=left>Column: 2803<p> society and a better society for all.&nbsp; This is the original Singapore Dream. The idea that guided us through the early days of the Republic is the vision that has brought millions of immigrants, myself included, to a land where a better life is possible and to eventually want to become Singaporeans.&nbsp; Equality is a value that is fundamental to our national identity and hence to be defended and promoted vigorously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when we come across any policy or legislation that goes against this fundamental principle, our response must be to take the moral high ground and to raise a red flag&nbsp;- in our case, a red and white flag - and to rectify without undue delay. This sense of equality must be so ingrained in our national psyche that when we recite our national pledge, \"to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality\", it should resonate deeply, as it reflects our daily realities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, very often, however, we are told that we live in a patriarchal&nbsp;society and&nbsp;I dread raising this again because I can imagine the sighs of this House.&nbsp; But I would just like to caution against using such cultural arguments to justify any unequal treatment of our citizens.&nbsp; In the long run, people will not accept that citizenship can be fully practised other than among equals.&nbsp;When we now&nbsp;say&nbsp;today, \"We, the people of Singapore\" in our national pledge, we do not think of ourselves as women or men, but as equal citizens and that is necessary for a full sense of belonging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today marks an&nbsp;important step and milestone, a positive step forward for equality in Singapore.&nbsp; We know that the group of Singaporean women benefiting from this change is small, but the symbolic value is enormous for all of us as equal citizens of Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, for real advancement, however, these steps need to be placed on top of each other, with the sure-footedness of one acting on principle and out of conviction and not steps scattered haphazardly over the landscape<p align=left>Column: 2804<p> as and when opportunity knocks or the winds change direction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I must also point out that for a developed country which boasts&nbsp;of giving its people a first-world standard of living, we are quite behind in making this amendment. Britain changed its relevant laws in 1981 so that since 1st January&nbsp;1983, women have been able to pass on their British citizenship to their children who were born outside the UK in the same way as men.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are about 20 years behind. The US amended its laws in 1934 to provide the children of US female citizens born abroad before&nbsp;24th May 1934 and their descendants with the same rights to citizenship at birth as children born of male citizens abroad. That makes us 70 years behind. But then again, if we take the historical perspective, the concept of citizenship for Singapore is a relatively new one as we are a young&nbsp;independent country.&nbsp; But that is all the more reason, as a young nation, that we should always look for ways to strengthen the core of what it means to be a Singaporean in this globalised world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment also raises the question of the rights and responsibilities of being a Singapore citizen abroad compared to a citizen at home. The most fundamental rights of this external citizenship are those of diplomatic protection and of return to one's country of citizenship.&nbsp; Many states have added social welfare rights and political rights to this list.&nbsp; I believe that it is important for our citizens abroad to retain strong social ties with Singapore, especially since they will be able to vote from overseas. We should do more to engage overseas Singaporeans so that wherever they are, they share our national aspirations and can tune in to our national dialogue and make a positive contribution to our progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I support fully the residency criterion for the Singapore parent by descent before the citizenship can be transferred by descent to another generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2805<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Singapore citizenship comes with a bundle of rights and obligations.&nbsp; It also comes with a set of principles and ideals that defines what it means to be Singaporeans.&nbsp; By passing this amendment, the Constitution takes an important step towards enshrining one of&nbsp;our most precious ideals - equality - as one of our basic rights as a citizen.&nbsp; Today is indeed a very good day for all of us who believe in the Singapore Dream.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, I join my parliamentary colleagues in support of this Bill and applaud&nbsp;the Government for the long-waited but certainly positive response.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Government has put it, never mind the waiting, so long as there are results.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have asked what triggers this change of mind with regard to the amendment.&nbsp; Is&nbsp; it a number game with respect to increasing a declining population? Or it is to grant and restore equality to women, the same right and privilege granted to the men under the Constitution?&nbsp; &nbsp;Never mind that it could be for both reasons.&nbsp; However, some Singaporean women have commented that the changes must be for the right reasons, and not for some purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in particular, the amendment to&nbsp;item 5 has been long debated and awaited.&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporean women&nbsp;have given their thumbs up for what they call&nbsp;history in Singapore. Going forward, there&nbsp;are issues to tackle especially&nbsp;such as&nbsp;how to facilitate an effective understanding and implementation of the changes to a fundamental constitutional right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to raise several points for clarification.&nbsp;One of the issues is Government's stand on dual citizenship or foreign nationalities.&nbsp; Another issue has to do with the Government's stand with<p align=left>Column: 2806<p> respect to fulfilment or performance of National Service&nbsp;by these children born of foreign fathers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that these issues can be difficult, complex and even emotional.&nbsp; So, it is paramount that our Government introduces consequential amendments quickly to the respective laws so that Singaporeans can be clear about their obligations and&nbsp;decide appropriately and quickly on the citizenship&nbsp;issue for their children in such predicament.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other issue that we need to be concerned about is when the Singaporean mother, who after&nbsp;acquiring the Singapore citizenship for&nbsp;her children from overseas, may choose to continue staying overseas with their families.&nbsp; Given this scenario, does the proposed amendment provide for conditions that stipulate the requirement to return and reside in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> for the citizenship granted?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;would&nbsp;the current condition that a Singaporean citizen may be deprived of his/her citizenship if he/she has been ordinarily resident outside Singapore for a continuous period of 10 years, and during the period has not returned to Singapore, also apply to this group of foreign children?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, for these overseas children, who have stayed for a long time overseas, are there plans to require them to demonstrate awareness of the Singapore culture, the way of life and in certain cases, linguistic proficiency in any of the four official languages?&nbsp; This is necessary to ensure that we can re-integrate active returnees into our Singapore society.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, just as many Singaporeans have welcomed the proposed amendments with respect to citizenship conferment, many would like to better understand the rules and conditions.&nbsp; What steps would Government&nbsp;take after the Bill has been passed to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;public awareness?&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2807<p>Would the&nbsp;Government mount&nbsp;an educational&nbsp;programme in its outreach to Singaporeans, both local and overseas?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has taken big steps in the last few years to accord to women more privileges on their rights upon their persistent calls.

Sometimes, when something goes wrong&nbsp;-&nbsp;husband meets with an acci<p align=left>Column: 2809<p>dent, passes away or something happens&nbsp;- they have to come back to Singapore for good.&nbsp; They are our people and we have to look after them.&nbsp; As I have suggested from the numbers that I produced just now, more and more Singaporean women are doing this.&nbsp; A lot of our daughters who travel overseas and study overseas marry and live overseas.&nbsp; But they have parents here and they keep their links back here.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;it is necessary for us to amend our Constitution to reflect this situation.&nbsp; Is it still a patrilinear society?&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say, yes.&nbsp; It is as a&nbsp;statement of fact.&nbsp; You are MPs.&nbsp; You know, you have seen the cases.&nbsp; There are many women who come and say that their husbands have deserted them and are not supporting them.&nbsp; There are very few men who come and say that their wives have deserted them and are not supporting them, and have left them carrying the children.&nbsp; That is still the reality.&nbsp; But it is shifting gradually, as Mdm Ho says, and so we are also shifting slightly less gradually.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, it is not so gradual&nbsp;because, as Ms Irene Ng says, the UK moved 20 years ago.&nbsp; But the UK has&nbsp;had a Parliament for a thousand years.&nbsp; Even America has been around a few hundred years.&nbsp; So, we are only 20 years behind them.&nbsp; I think we are quite all right.&nbsp; Because if you are absolutely up at the leading edge in matters of social change, you are never quite sure whether the leading edge has taken a wrong turn,&nbsp;needs to back track and make a U-turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep a certain stability and ballast so that when&nbsp;we move,&nbsp;we have the advantage of the experience of people who have moved ahead of us.&nbsp; And when they have gone a strange way, we will&nbsp;wait and see and if after one or two generations, it still makes sense, and if yes, then we follow them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2810<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at the 1960s, the way&nbsp;the western society went with hippies and free love, it looked like a new spring time, but the hippies are now all balding and grey.&nbsp; It was not such a happy environment.&nbsp; And I think it is good that we did not go&nbsp;that direction.&nbsp; So, similarly, with other issues, we will make haste, but we will also watch and keep some ballast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked about dual&nbsp;citizenship.&nbsp; I think children born abroad do effectively have the privilege of two choices.&nbsp; Because if we grant them citizenship by descent, the country where they are born often also grant them citizenship by descent or maybe by geography.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>An hon.

The Bill before the House seeks to amend the International Development Association (IDA) Act to enable the Government to make future contributions to IDA beyond membership subscriptions.&nbsp; This amendment to the IDA Act will require a consequential amendment to the Constitution which the House has just debated and passed.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the IDA Act is only concerned with membership matters and is silent on the Minister's power to contribute to IDA Replenishments.&nbsp; Therefore, the Government has been relying on the Financial Procedures Act, instead of the IDA Act, to contribute to the IDA-13 Replenishment that we had pledged in 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not efficient.&nbsp; To streamline the process, we should amend the IDA Act to standardise our procedures for contributing to IDA with those existing for other international organisations (\"IOs\").&nbsp; For example, the ADB Act is used to contribute to the Asian Development Fund (ADF).&nbsp; Similarly, the IDA Act should be used for making IDA contributions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2816<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the amendments to the IDA Act and the Constitution, contributions to future IDA replenishments will be made using the IDA Act.&nbsp; The Minister, with the concurrence of the President under Article 144(1)(b) of the Constitution, will then be able to raise loans under section 6 on behalf of the Government (by the creation and issue of securities) to provide the sums required for making such contributions to the Association.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I wish to speak on this issue of charity practices as the recent developments over the National Kidney Foundation (NKF)'s reserves have highlighted practices that are too varying in nature, too polarised and, I think, this has already been spoken<p align=left>Column: 2817<p> on twice this year, in dire need of better governance.&nbsp; It is my hope that some of the issues I have raised here can be taken on board by the Council of Governance as they mediate on the guidelines that will be announced soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, NKF needs to be applauded for being creative, having long-term vision and for branding itself so well that so many people immediately can recognise what it does and donate generously.&nbsp; There are inherent good practices that one can learn from.&nbsp; Forward-planning and amazing reserves up to $189 million is not wrong in itself.&nbsp; But when it comes to such large charities, it must also be seen as an equal responsibility to exhibit good corporate social responsibility and be accountable to all their shareholders, that is, each and every donor.&nbsp; In reference to this particular comment, I would like to point out a few areas where I think corporate social responsibility means sharing with the public clear information.&nbsp; The most important criterion to a member of the public is what comes back to the beneficiary.&nbsp; In this case, NKF, in the public domain, has made two announcements of 52 cents coming back to the beneficiary, as well as 56 cents.&nbsp; One has been passed off as a computing error and the other has been accounted for as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am raising here with this incident is that different definitions do go into making up what comes back to the beneficiary in terms of a precise dollar value.&nbsp; There needs to be greater consistency in the factors that go into such computation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example - operational costs.&nbsp; Comparing an apple for apple, NKF cites an example of $31,200 per annum to help a patient on dialysis.&nbsp; Kidney Dialysis Foundation (KDF)'s figure is $15,079.&nbsp; The manpower resource for NKF is one person to two beneficiaries.&nbsp; And KDF works with <p align=left>Column: 2818<p>a much smaller manpower pool.&nbsp; The subsidies granted to the beneficiaries&nbsp;are also not very clear, from both the websites.&nbsp; Therefore, it becomes imperative that as these guidelines are being mediated by the Council, it is my hope that very clear criteria are spelt out so that the public will know once and for all what are the factors to look for, what goes into the computing, and then make a considered decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not wish to knock NKF here.&nbsp; But what I would like to point out, using them as a case study,&nbsp;is that it is difficult for the public to become a wise donor if basic issues on monetary value on each charity dollar given to the organisation, or operational and administrative costs, as depicted by the organisation, are not consistently applied.&nbsp; This includes transparency issues on salaries of top management - the CEOs.&nbsp; After all, public listed companies - the banks - recently announced what their CEOs are earning.&nbsp; And when we talk about mega dollar charity organisations,&nbsp;transparency issues should cover such areas too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second part of this is to highlight the proportion that is allocated to fund-raisers.&nbsp; It is currently at 70% back to the organisation and 30% - up to 30% - back to the fund-raiser.&nbsp; The recent NKF shows over the two weekends have reaped about $14 million from the very generous public - well and good!&nbsp; Thirty percent of that can roughly amount to $4 million, which is also well and good.&nbsp; Because this means we can really churn a good fund-raising industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some outcomes that one must be a bit cautious about.&nbsp; Bigger charities can throw bigger money to lure more money; sometimes crowding out, in the absence of enlightened donors, the smaller charities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, fund-raisers' creativity - after all, they have a 30% stake in this business - can lead to a staple fair of<p align=left>Column: 2819<p> stunts in some particular cases, as we recently saw, each more demanding than the last in an effort to lure the charity dollar.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the most important - what are we then leaving as our heritage to our children or to the next generation?&nbsp; A warped sense of values - as we are now dangerously close to linking charity-giving to how hard or how well they perform their stunts, what kind of celebrity performs the stunt.&nbsp; In the whole issue, as already mentioned by the Minister, there are issues here for governance on how funds are raised, if we are going to remain watchful on how values are going to be transmitted to our younger people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of fund-raising is cross-selling.&nbsp; The recent one, as in the papers, is Aviva (the insurance company) and NKF.&nbsp; Cross-selling and sharing of databases - this is an area which I would also hope that the Council will look into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third part of this that I would like to raise is the attention on how the charity dollar is used.&nbsp; We have seen in some organisations aquariums galore, in some instances, TV sets, plasma screens, plush surroundings, water features - nothing wrong with that at all.&nbsp; What is more important is the system with which the dollar was lured.&nbsp; Was the donor given a whole spectrum of things that are needed by the charity, so that the donor can make a considered choice of where to put his or her one dollar?&nbsp; And it was not told instead that, \"Here, this is our need.&nbsp; Could you please donate to this item?&nbsp; We need it badly.\"&nbsp; What I am talking about here is enhancing the capabilities such that the individual donor can make good and well-considered decisions.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, fourthly, the whole issue of the IPC status.&nbsp; We have big umbrella funds - health endowment fund and the education endowment fund - and it is sometimes an auto registration if you come <p align=left>Column: 2820<p>from a particular field closely related to health or education that you do get your IPC status.&nbsp; Maybe this needs a review under the guidelines that are to come.&nbsp; We have asked earlier when these guidelines are due.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that, in the interim, when the new set of guidelines comes on board, we still have instruments that will govern any practice that may not be so conducive, as it has already been acknowledged that the current guidelines are a little bit too broad.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, I totally agree with what the Minister said earlier.&nbsp; It is important to note that&nbsp;as Singaporeans become more sophisticated and&nbsp;ask the right questions, they want&nbsp;to know where to park the precious charity dollar.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Singaporeans themselves are&nbsp;too easy&nbsp;going on where they would like to place their&nbsp;charity dollar, then we are just opening the doors to charities&nbsp;which will&nbsp;work&nbsp;less hard in being as transparent as they ought&nbsp;to be in sharing the information with the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, lastly, it is my hope that&nbsp;bigger charities will allow&nbsp;smaller charities to piggyback on&nbsp;their fund-raising efforts so that both can share proportionately the goodies that&nbsp;Singaporeans&nbsp;are willing to give them.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have gone through this debate a couple of times, once in the Committee of Supply and, also, this afternoon during the Questions for Oral Answer.&nbsp; In responding to the Member, I would just like to clarify a few points.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the press release put up by NKF.&nbsp; I am not aware of the details.&nbsp; I think they put up the press release and explained the differences between&nbsp;52% and&nbsp;56% go to the beneficiaries.&nbsp; I recall also that they indicated in the press release that about 26% goes&nbsp;to the reserves.&nbsp; So, actually, if you add up the<p align=left>Column: 2821<p> two numbers, nearly 80% goes to the beneficiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that puts NKF on quite a sound record.&nbsp; The vast bulk of the money goes to the beneficiaries, both immediately as well as in the reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on the operation cost of running a dialysis centre.&nbsp;&nbsp; From my experience in the Ministry of Health, I can tell you that running a dialysis centre is very, very expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NKF looks after more than 2,500 patients and the average cost is&nbsp;more than $25,000 or $30,000 per patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason why the NKF requires a budget of $50 million&nbsp;to $60 million.&nbsp; These are not small sums to run the centres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned this afternoon, when NKF takes on a patient, it is committed to the patient for life.&nbsp; I have met patients, both locally and overseas, who have been on dialysis for more than 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical record of NKF is extremely good, better than world standards.&nbsp; So, the patients that go to&nbsp;NKF are actually treated to&nbsp;very high medical standards and therefore they live much longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason why they need more funds.&nbsp; And there is nothing wrong in putting these&nbsp;funds in the reserves because they are committed to the patients for their lifetime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the point about cost and salaries of CEOs, this is a decision by NKF whether to disclose the salaries of the CEOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I have some sympathy for their dilemma.&nbsp; If they do not disclose, then&nbsp;there will be critics who&nbsp;say they are not transparent.&nbsp; If they disclose, there will also be critics who will say that whatever they pay&nbsp;are too high.&nbsp; So I think they are caught between&nbsp;a rock and&nbsp;a hard place.&nbsp; I think it is their decision not to disclose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also discussed earlier this afternoon about the proportion of&nbsp;expenses towards fund-raising.&nbsp; And the <p align=left>Column: 2822<p>reason why we set the 20% rule is to have a reasonable cap that will facilitate fund-raising for the smaller charities.&nbsp; Smaller charities require high overheads in fund raising.&nbsp; So if&nbsp;we were to lower the cap to something below 20%, then I think&nbsp;we will constrain the smaller charities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of cross-selling and the sharing of databases, I think NKF has come up to clarify its position.&nbsp; So I see nothing objectionable to&nbsp;its position.&nbsp; What they are saying is that they will only release this data if there is consent from the donors.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think&nbsp;that is a very sensible position to take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On aquariums and TV sets,&nbsp;if you have been attending dialysis three times and each time it takes long duration, I think it is nothing wrong&nbsp;actually to have aquariums and TV sets to keep the dialysis patients occupied.&nbsp; We do have aquariums and TV sets also in our blood donation centres.&nbsp; So these are not unusual, I would say,&nbsp;distractions for the patients to keep them busy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the running of the IPCs, our administration is to appoint administrators for different groups.&nbsp; So it is not true to say that if you belong to the education or the health group, you get your IPC status automatically.&nbsp; The fund administrator in each group has certain criteria by which he evaluates applicants who want IPC status, and these criteria are set by IRAS, and we make sure that people who apply have to qualify before they are given this IPC status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying that it is not a zero sum game.&nbsp; I think there&nbsp;is room for the big charity organisations and there is room for the smaller charity organisations.&nbsp; And if both groups go out and convince Singaporeans, I think Singaporeans have big hearts and are willing to donate to the wide range of charities.&nbsp; We have 1,300 charities registered in Singapore and we have 820 IPCs.&nbsp; So there are<p align=left>Column: 2823<p> more than 2,000 organisations out there doing good for Singaporeans, largely run by volunteers.&nbsp; And Singaporeans, by and large, if you convince them of the worthiness of the causes,&nbsp;will open up their wallets.&nbsp; So I do not see this as a zero sum game.&nbsp; I urge all the VWOs to continue their good work and&nbsp;continue to solicit the donations from Singaporeans.&nbsp; One way to do so is, of course, to have good corporate governance and to be transparent as to how the donation dollar is going towards the beneficiaries.&nbsp; The more people are convinced that the money which they contribute goes directly to the beneficiaries, I think the more they will be willing to donate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the smaller charities, I think there is a case to be made for them by combining their resources so that they go out and operate as a group or as a cluster.&nbsp; I think there are&nbsp;efforts made by the<p align=left>Column: 2824<p> Community Chest and other groupings so that clusters of&nbsp;smaller charities can go out and solicit the donation dollar as a group.&nbsp; So these are some of the ways in which they can get a bigger share of the pie.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> <B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</B> <I>rose ---</I></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from <st1:date Month=\"4\" Day=\"5\" Year=\"2004\">5th April 2004</st1:date>, the operating hours of Neighbourhood Police Posts or NPPs were changed from <st1:time Hour=\"12\" Minute=\"0\">noon</st1:time> till <st1:time Hour=\"22\" Minute=\"0\">10 pm</st1:time> daily.&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema Mathi asked why we changed the operating hours.&nbsp; The change was part of Police's ongoing efforts to optimise the deployment of its officers to deal more effectively with crime and potential terrorist threats.&nbsp; Our records over the last five years show that demand for services at the NPPs has dropped by half.&nbsp; Many people now go to one of the 31 Neighbourhood Police Centres instead, as these provide a broader range of services and are open round-the-clock.&nbsp; Our records also show that 75% of the transactions at the NPPs take place between <st1:time Hour=\"12\" Minute=\"0\">noon</st1:time> and <st1:time Hour=\"22\" Minute=\"0\">10 pm</st1:time>.&nbsp; It therefore makes sense to change the operating hours to cater to this demand pattern.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this change in NPP operating hours, we can now put 65 more officers on active neighbourhood patrols, instead of having them at the NPPs.&nbsp; A more mobile police will more effectively project police presence on the ground, for example, at markets and other high-traffic areas to deter crime.&nbsp; At night, these officers can be deployed to patrol crime-prone areas and conduct anti-crime patrols and ambushes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Mathi asked about the nature of the transactions at the NPPs.&nbsp; The vast majority of transactions at NPPs are not urgent or critical.&nbsp; These include changes of addresses, lost and found reports, and traffic reports.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For urgent matters, the public should contact the Police using the 999 hotline.&nbsp; In addition, when the NPPs are closed, the public can use the Emergency Communications System found outside the NPPs or go to any of the 31 Neighbourhood Police Centres.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Mathi asked about the savings resulting from this change in the operating hours.&nbsp; This change is to enhance operational effectiveness, not secure manpower savings.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Ms Mathi asked about the number of officers stationed at the Neighbourhood Police Posts during the new opening hours. The number remains unchanged.&nbsp; We will continue to have at least one officer stationed at every Neighbourhood Police Post during opening hours.&nbsp; Additional officers will be present as and when required.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Subsidies are given based on the means testing framework as well, for needy clients.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Residential Institutions</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a disabled person requires full-time care that cannot be catered for in the community, there are residential options.&nbsp; A person who is assessed to have rehabilitation potential can be admitted to Community Hospitals for short term in-patient rehabilitation to improve functional abilities.&nbsp; Long-term care facilities such as chronic sick hospitals or nursing homes cater to those who have maximised their rehabilitation potential and still require continuing and nursing care.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCDS also works with Voluntary Welfare Organisations to set up and run Homes for disabled adults at all ages.&nbsp; Besides providing long-term residential care for persons with disabilities who are either destitute, neglected or whose caregivers are unable or incapable of caring for them, these Homes also provide short-term respite care for families who require the service.&nbsp; Residents are subsidised according to their household income.&nbsp; MCDS is currently doing a review of the Homes for disabled adults.&nbsp; One of the objectives of the review is to standardise referral and admission criteria and procedures to the Homes.&nbsp; This will ensure that the service is made available to people who require it.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 2831<p><B><!--TITLE_NAME:'A' LEVEL EXAMINATIONS--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
