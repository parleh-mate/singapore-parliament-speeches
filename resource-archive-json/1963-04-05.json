I am making this Statement before answering the\r\n\r\nseveral  questions that have been tabled in order  that\r\n\r\nwhen I come to answer these questions, Members can  see\r\n\r\nthe issues against a wider perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the White Paper and the formal exchanges of\r\n\r\nletters  were  all  finalised  in  November  1961,  the\r\n\r\nworking party of officials did not start meeting  until\r\n\r\n5th December last year. This was because the Federation\r\n\r\nofficials  were  occupied with the  Sabah  and  Sarawak\r\n\r\nnegotiations  and  they wanted  to  complete  the  main\r\n\r\nframework  of  the  Borneo  side  before  tackling  the\r\n\r\ndetails of the Singapore side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team of officials, which consisted of the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General,  the  Permanent  Secretary   to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Home Affairs (Mr Stewart), the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary, Finance Division (Mr Howe Yoon Chong),  the\r\n\r\nActing  Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment   (Mr  Sim  Kee  Boon)  and  the   Cabinet\r\n\r\nSecretary (Mr Wong Chooi Sen), met the Federation team\r\n\r\non  22  occasions  from  5th December,  1962,  to  14th\r\n\r\nFebruary   this   year.  They  reached  agreement   and\r\n\r\nsubmitted   joint  recommendations  on  most   of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  to be incorporated in the new  Constitution\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation of Malaysia and  of  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However,  on  a  number  of  points   which\r\n\r\nincluded   banking,  insurance,  shipping,  navigation,\r\n\r\nbroadcasting, television, constitutional guarantees and\r\n\r\nfinance,  the  Federation and the  Singapore  teams  of\r\n\r\nofficials were unable to reach agreement. These matters\r\n\r\nwere  therefore  referred  to  the  Ministers.  Plenary\r\n\r\nmeetings of Ministers and officials took place on three\r\n\r\noccasions - 28th February and 1st March in Kuala Lumpur,\r\n\r\n21st  and  22nd March in Kuala Lumpur and 2nd April  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report that except for finance nearly\r\n\r\nall  the  points left unresolved by the official  teams\r\n\r\nhave now been agreed. There remain only a few points to\r\n\r\nbe tidied up by the draftsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of them is the question of Singapore retaining day-to-day  control  of  programmes and  administration  of\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  and  television whilst following  overall\r\n\r\nFederal policy. A special constitutional agreement  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  drawn  up to spell  out  the  rights  and\r\n\r\nobligations of the State Government of Singapore vis-a-vis the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the spelling out of State autonomy\r\n\r\nwith   the   consequential  provision  that   Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are also Singapore citizens  cannot  have\r\n\r\ndouble  enjoyment  of  both State autonomy  in  matters\r\n\r\nlike  education  and labour and at the same  time  have\r\n\r\nfull  enjoyment of education and labour rights  in  the\r\n\r\nother States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but by no means least remain the financial\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to report to the House in brief\r\n\r\nand broad outline the points that have been agreed.  At\r\n\r\nour first plenary meeting of Ministers on 28th February\r\n\r\nand  1st  March, the important questions of acquisition\r\n\r\nand  deprivation  of  citizenship were  discussed.  All\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens will become citizens of Malaysia  by\r\n\r\noperation of law. The Federal Government shall have the\r\n\r\npower  over  acquisition  of Singapore  citizenship  by\r\n\r\nnaturalization  after Malaysia. All  such  acquisitions\r\n\r\nshall   be   with   the  agreement  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There shall be a provision in  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule of the Federal Constitution to the effect that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government  must  be  informed  of  all\r\n\r\nacquisitions of citizenship by naturalization  approved\r\n\r\nby  the  Federal  Government. The Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nwill,  however,  retain power over the  acquisition  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by  registration. As these  citizens  will\r\n\r\nautomatically become Malaysian citizens,  it  shall  be\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  of  the  Singapore  Government  to\r\n\r\ninform  the  Federal Government of all acquisitions  by\r\n\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deprivations of citizenship are on national\r\n\r\nconsiderations, and hence the Federal Government  shall\r\n\r\nhave power of deprivation on all grounds. The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment should have the right to deprive on  grounds\r\n\r\nof fraud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  State  or  under  Article  25  (1)   (c)   on  a\r\n\r\nconviction. There will also be a provision  in  section\r\n\r\n10  of  the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution\r\n\r\nto  the  effect  that  both the Federal  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments   should  keep  each  other   informed   of\r\n\r\ndeprivations  of Singapore citizenship on all  grounds.\r\n\r\nThe  Federal Constitution should contain the  following\r\n\r\nprovision:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A citizen of Singapore shall by virtue of such\r\n\r\ncitizenship be a citizen of Malaysia;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A citizen of Singapore who renounces his\r\n\r\ncitizenship  of  Singapore except  on  acquiring\r\n\r\ncitizenship of Malaysia by registration  in  one\r\n\r\nof  the other States shall cease to be a citizen\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  and  shall not,  except  with  the\r\n\r\napproval  of the Federal Government, be eligible\r\n\r\nfor registration as a citizen of Malaysia or  of Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Birth or residence in Singapore will count for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of acquiring citizenship of Malaysia\r\n\r\nthrough citizenship of Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Federal Government would have exclusive\r\n\r\nauthority     to     grant    citizenship     by\r\n\r\nnaturalization, but in the case of a  person  to\r\n\r\nbe  naturalized  as a citizen of Singapore  only\r\n\r\nwith    the   concurrence   of   the   Singapore Government;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The Federal Government would have authority to\r\n\r\ndeprive persons of Malaysian citizenship on  all\r\n\r\ngrounds;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Deprivation or renunciation of Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizenship  of  a  citizen of  Singapore  would\r\n\r\ninvolve loss of Singapore citizenship; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) A person who has renounced or been deprived of\r\n\r\nhis  Malaysian citizenship would not be eligible\r\n\r\nto  be  registered  as  a citizen  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nexcept   with   the  approval  of  the   Federal Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Constitution will contain the following\r\n\r\nprovisions  which  could  not be  amended  or  modified\r\n\r\nwithout the approval of the Federal Parliament:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Citizenship of Singapore by birth;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Citizenship of Singapore by descent;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Citizenship of Singapore by registration of\r\n\r\ncitizens of Malaysia who are not citizens of Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Citizenship of Singapore by registration of\r\n\r\npersons resident in Singapore on Merger Day with the\r\n\r\nagreement of the Federal Government;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Citizenship of Singapore by registration on\r\n\r\nmarriage;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Citizenship of Singapore by registration of\r\n\r\nminors;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) Renunciation of citizenship of Singapore; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) Deprivation of citizenship of Singapore on\r\n\r\nthe grounds of fraud, mistake and conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a subsequent meeting, it was also agreed that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  shall for a period of two  years  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Day have the power to deprive  anyone  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship on any grounds provided  such\r\n\r\ngrounds  arose before Malaysia Day.

Articles 8 (2)  and 12 (1)  should\r\n\r\nbe  modified  in  their application to Singapore  after\r\n\r\nmerger  to  enable the Singapore Government to  provide\r\n\r\nfor   the  advancement  of  Malays  in  Singapore.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I would like to pause there and  explain\r\n\r\nthis.   Under   the  Federation  Constitution   it   is\r\n\r\nunconstitutional  to discriminate in  education  policy\r\n\r\nbetween  Malays and other races. However, in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwe have at present a policy which does discriminate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween Malays and other races in favour of the Malays,\r\n\r\ngiving  them  free secondary and university  education,\r\n\r\nand  therefore, Article 8 (2)  and Article 12  (1)   will\r\n\r\nhave  to he amended in order to allow this practice  to\r\n\r\ncontinue. Article 8 (3) - no discrimination in favour  of\r\n\r\nsubject  of  the Ruler of any State. Article  8  (4) - no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  by  any public authority.  Article  11 -\r\n\r\nFreedom of religion; Article 13 - Rights of property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 (1), which prohibits banishment of any\r\n\r\ncitizen, shall apply in Singapore. The same applies  to\r\n\r\nfreedom  of movement under Article 9 (2); but  subject,\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  Singapore, to  the  proviso  that  the\r\n\r\nCentral   Government  may,  if  it   so   desires,   by\r\n\r\nlegislation in respect of labour or education or  other\r\n\r\nmatters  in  which Singapore citizens  enjoy  autonomy,\r\n\r\nprevent  the double enjoyment of both rights  of  State\r\n\r\nautonomy in Singapore and again full enjoyment of equal\r\n\r\nrights  with  other Malaysian citizens  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nlabour and education again in the other States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other legal technical matters concerning navigation,\r\n\r\nshipping, banking, insurance, have all now been  agreed\r\n\r\nand  they  will remain as listed in the White Paper  as\r\n\r\nconcurrent   rights.  In  other  words,  administrative\r\n\r\npowers  and  legislative powers will be with  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  over-riding  legislative powers  in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament. It has also been agreed on the 2nd of April\r\n\r\nthat, first, the provisions of Article 153 relating  to\r\n\r\neducation  should not apply to Singapore after  merger.\r\n\r\nThat  is  in order to allow us to continue giving  free\r\n\r\neducation  to Malays. At the same time, it  was  agreed\r\n\r\nthat  on application of Article 153 to Singapore  after\r\n\r\nmerger,  the following conditions will apply. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  first,  no  proportion of posts  in  a  Federal\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  in  Singapore  will  be  reserved  for\r\n\r\nMalays;  second,  recruitment in Singapore  to  Federal\r\n\r\nPublic  Services  will  be  open  to  all  citizens  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia;  and  three,  no  proportion  of  permits  or\r\n\r\nlicences for the operation of any trade or business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be reserved for Malays; and  four,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Malays\" for purposes of Article 153 will be amended to\r\n\r\ninclude Singapore Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Mr Speaker, Sir, this means that Malays in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will continue to enjoy their special  rights\r\n\r\nas   at  present  with  particular  reference  to  free\r\n\r\neducation  from  primary school to university  and,  if\r\n\r\nthey  choose  to  go  to the other States,  will  enjoy\r\n\r\nspecial  rights as for Malays there. In  this  way,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to  maintain the  principle  of  free\r\n\r\ncompetition in Singapore for employment in  the  public\r\n\r\nservices  and  for businesses like taxi  licences,  bus\r\n\r\nlicences, trade licences and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to finance. This is one outstanding\r\n\r\nproblem which is basic to the whole of the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the State and the Central Government It is  the\r\n\r\nview  of the Singapore Government that if Singapore  is\r\n\r\nto  have autonomy, not only in name but in practice and\r\n\r\nsubstance, in the many subjects ranging from education,\r\n\r\nlabour, social welfare, health and so on, then we must,\r\n\r\nin  the  words of the White Paper, retain  the  present\r\n\r\nmachinery  for  the  collection of  taxes  and  make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  Central Government  for  Federal\r\n\r\nservices. I quote these words from the White  Paper  in\r\n\r\nthe exchange of letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is our view that there is no equivocation that the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  taxes must he done  by  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nrevenues  collected, whether they be Federal  or  State\r\n\r\ntaxes,  after  Malaysia should be  kept  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore's   contribution  to  Federal   services   in\r\n\r\nSingapore like Police and Prisons and its share of Pan-Malaysian  services for the whole region  like  defence\r\n\r\nand  external  affairs can be a  first  charge  on  the\r\n\r\nrevenues collected.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped by today to be in a position to report to\r\n\r\nthe  House on the agreement reached and to disclose the\r\n\r\nformula  on which Singapore will pay for its  share  of\r\n\r\nFederal services in Singapore and its proportion of Pan\r\n\r\nMalaysian services for the whole region. I hope I  have\r\n\r\nmade   that   clear,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Police   and\r\n\r\nPrisons - we pay in full for what Singapore maintains  in\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Prisons  Force  and  the  necessary  other\r\n\r\nestablishment and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital charges. Defence and external affairs,  we  pay\r\n\r\nfor our proportion of what Malaysia spends as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the 28th of\r\n\r\nFebruary  and  the 1st of March, it became  clear  that\r\n\r\nthere  was basic disagreement between the views of  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry  in Kuala Lumpur  and  those  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry in Singapore. The Finance Ministry  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  envisaged  an arrangement  whereby  they\r\n\r\nwould  take over the functions of the Singapore Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry in respect of all taxes, and year by year make\r\n\r\nsuch  payments to the State Government as is  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  its  discharge of its other duties. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry's view is the exact opposite.  Having\r\n\r\nall  these years efficiently and effectively discharged\r\n\r\nits  functions, it has not the slightest doubt that  it\r\n\r\ncan  continue to do so as envisaged in the White  Paper\r\n\r\nand   make  its  yearly  contribution  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment for Federal services. I need hardly say that\r\n\r\nstrong  views  were held on both sides. However,  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to say that this did not prevent discussions from\r\n\r\nbeing  held  to  explore every possibility  of  a  fair\r\n\r\narrangement  whereby the Federal Government  will  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  guarantees on the efficiency and efficacy  of\r\n\r\ntax collection by the Singapore Finance Ministry and  a\r\n\r\nfaithful and accurate audit of every item collected and\r\n\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our second plenary meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the\r\n\r\n21st and 22nd of March, we discussed a paper put up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Finance Ministry on the subject.  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  to say that the paper was not acceptable  to  us\r\n\r\nas,  in  our view, it was not in accord with the  clear\r\n\r\nterms  of the White Paper with regard to responsibility\r\n\r\nfor   collection  by  Singapore  and  then   making   a\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  Central Government  for  Federal\r\n\r\nservices. We undertook to submit a paper for a  meeting\r\n\r\nin  Singapore scheduled for the 1st and 2nd  of  April.\r\n\r\nOur  paper  was submitted on Friday the 29th of  March.\r\n\r\nInstead of the plenary session originally scheduled for\r\n\r\nthe  1st  of  April,  informal  discussions  were  held\r\n\r\nbetween the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance Ministers then in Singapore and between myself,\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister of the Federation  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Internal Security of the  Federation.  We\r\n\r\nthought  on Monday evening the 1st of April that  broad\r\n\r\nagreement   in   principle   had   been   reached    on\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  collection  and  that   all   that\r\n\r\nremained  was  an equitable method of working  out  our\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  Federal Government  for  Federal\r\n\r\nservices. In other words, apportioning money from taxes\r\n\r\nlike  Income  Tax and Customs duties which will  become\r\n\r\nFederal  taxes and Pan-Malaysian after Malaysia between\r\n\r\n(1)  the Federal Government for our contribution and (2) \r\n\r\nthe rest for our own use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plenary session was held on the 2nd of April.\r\n\r\nSeveral  of the outstanding items regarding fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  in the Constitution, establishment matters  and\r\n\r\ncontinued   application  of  the  principle   of   free\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  Singapore without special  preferences\r\n\r\nwere  agreed.  There was a great deal of  understanding\r\n\r\nand  a  common  desire  for fair  play.  However,  when\r\n\r\ndiscussions  were resumed on finance in the  afternoon,\r\n\r\nwe  discovered  that what we thought had  already  been\r\n\r\nagreed    on   principle   on   1st   April   regarding\r\n\r\nresponsibilities for collection of Federal  taxes  was,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  not  agreed  and the meeting  ended  without\r\n\r\nagreement. The respective positions of the two  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistries  remained  as on the  21st  of  March.  Sir,\r\n\r\nMembers  are aware that financial arrangements are  the\r\n\r\nkey  to  all the other relations between the State  and\r\n\r\nthe  centre. Amendments to the Federal Constitution and\r\n\r\nthe State Constitution of Singapore cannot be finalised\r\n\r\nuntil  this matter has been resolved. The present time-table  is  that  all  these  constitutional  amendments\r\n\r\nshould be ready by May or, at the latest, by early June\r\n\r\nin order that they can be tabled before and approved by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and then incorporated in a treaty to  be\r\n\r\nsigned in London in June so that, on the 31st of August\r\n\r\nthis   year,  all  that  remains  will  be  the  formal\r\n\r\nproclamation of independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are thankful for the practical approach of the Federation Deputy Prime Minister to these problems. But for his understanding that Singapore's autonomy in labour, education, health and social services should he accompanied by the financial means to implement our policies, further discussions at inter-governmental level would have been pointless. At\r\n\r\nour  next meeting, we hope to work out the basis of the\r\n\r\nformula to he spelt out to apportion funds collected by\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  from  Federal   taxes   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  between  (a)   Singapore's  contribution  for\r\n\r\nFederal  services, and (b)  the balance to  be  used  by\r\n\r\nSingapore for State expenses and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will realise the urgent necessity of our\r\n\r\nfinding   a   just   formula  for   working   out   our\r\n\r\ncontribution.  If this is not done before  the  end  of\r\n\r\nMay,  then the London treaty may be delayed to the  end\r\n\r\nof  June  or  even the beginning of July,  since  after\r\n\r\nagreement some time will be needed by the draftsmen  to\r\n\r\nframe these amendments to the Federal Constitution  and\r\n\r\nsome  further  time will be taken by this  Assembly  to\r\n\r\ndebate and adopt them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation Deputy Prime Minister informed me\r\n\r\nyesterday  afternoon that he would be  leaving  shortly\r\n\r\nfor  Washington  and  he  would  like  another  plenary\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  Ministers and officials  in  Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nbefore  he  leaves. We hope that these two meetings  on\r\n\r\nthe  10th and 11th of April will produce the basis  for\r\n\r\nsuch  a  formula.  Our official party of  Treasury  and\r\n\r\nEstablishment officers will be leaving for Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\ntomorrow for preparatory talks to prepare the  way  for\r\n\r\nthis plenary session. Because of his heavy commitments,\r\n\r\nthese are the only two available dates the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has before he leaves for Washington. In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, our original intention to  proceed  with\r\n\r\nour  Assembly sittings until the 11th of April (the eve\r\n\r\nof the Easter holidays) has to be changed and the House\r\n\r\nwill  have to adjourn on the 9th of April.

In   the   new\r\n\r\nconstitution, who will decide, for instance, the tariff\r\n\r\npolicy  applicable to Singapore, income  tax,  customs,\r\n\r\nthe  question of pioneer certificates, and the over-all\r\n\r\nquestion of economic and fiscal policies of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish\r\n\r\nto  go into the details of what are extremely intricate\r\n\r\nand   delicate   negotiations.  As  I   have   already\r\n\r\nindicated, strong views are held on both sides  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject.  All I need refer the hon. Member  to  is  the\r\n\r\npresence  of  the  Rueff  Commission,  the  World  Bank\r\n\r\nMission  here  to advise the respective Governments  on\r\n\r\nthe  conditions for a common market. I need hardly  say\r\n\r\nthat the financial arrangements, our contributions  and\r\n\r\nthe  balance of apportionment between the State and the\r\n\r\ncentre  all  hear very closely on these  common  market\r\n\r\nmatters.  I  would  like  to  state,  as  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple,  that we would like to carry our fair  share\r\n\r\nof  Federal responsibilities. Further, if common market\r\n\r\nconditions are such as to make it possible  for  us  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise and increase our prosperity, then  it  is\r\n\r\nour  intention  that that prosperity should  be  shared\r\n\r\nwith  the Central Government. The Finance Ministry  has\r\n\r\nworked out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   formula  called  \"The  Census  of  Production   and\r\n\r\nEmployment  Increases.\" [Interruption] No. The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  drafted  it.  In some quarters  he  has  been\r\n\r\nthought of as being academic: but in other quarters  he\r\n\r\nis  believed  to have propounded an extremely  workable\r\n\r\nand  very valuable incentive for the Central Government\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that Singapore industrialises. Because,  by\r\n\r\nthis  formula,  as  more  industries  are  created   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   more  workers  get   jobs,   so   our\r\n\r\ncontributions to the Federal Government will  increase.\r\n\r\nAs  less  workers get jobs and less factories open,  so\r\n\r\nour contributions will decrease. Therefore. I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim, as an accountant, will understand\r\n\r\nthat  these are related matters, and at the appropriate\r\n\r\ntime  no  doubt we will he able to disclose to him  the\r\n\r\nformula by which we ensure that it is worth everybody's\r\n\r\nwhile   to  make  sure  that  Singapore  survives   and\r\n\r\nprospers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

May I repeat it a little more\r\n\r\nclearly? It is this: we have from time to time received\r\n\r\nnews,  seeping  through the newspapers,  of  conditions\r\n\r\napplying  to  merger  both of Borneo  and  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nconditions extremely favourable to those territories in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  powers  that they  have,  inter  alia\r\n\r\nindicating  that  they will have 40 representatives  in\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Parliament, thereby having a very  strong\r\n\r\nvoice  in  the Central Parliament quite apart from  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation that Brunei would have, of which  we  do\r\n\r\nnot have details yet, which would add to about three to\r\n\r\nfour  times  per  capita representation that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  have  in the Central Parliament irrespective  of\r\n\r\nthe   manner  in  which  they  are  elected,   reducing\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  its  people to  insignificance  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal   Parliament.

We are  insisting - not  only\r\n\r\nasking - on fair play. I think the city of Singapore that\r\n\r\nhas  thrived for over 100 years under solemnity of  the\r\n\r\ncontract  will  appreciate the point  that  a  contract\r\n\r\nhaving been made has to be honoured. In this case,  for\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  I have enumerated, we feel - regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Anson feels - that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  with  us  in  this,  that  it  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant we control our finances and retain more  than\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of our revenue and pay our  contribution\r\n\r\nto  the  centre  and have 15 seats as  agreed  than  to\r\n\r\nreopen any of those items, running the risk thereby  of\r\n\r\nreopening the financial arrangements which have already\r\n\r\nbeen agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody knows that if you sell rubber short and the price goes up, then you lose money; and vice versa. Singapore understands this. If\r\n\r\nyou  go to Change Alley and buy an imitation Parker  61\r\n\r\nfor  $5  and  the day after that the market is  flooded\r\n\r\nwith  more imitation Parker 61s and the price goes down\r\n\r\nto  $1, you cannot go hack to the shop and ask for your\r\n\r\nmoney  back.  Similarly in this case, we have  come  to\r\n\r\nthis  agreement  in which we feel we bought  a  genuine\r\n\r\nParker  61  for a sum of money and we are keeping  more\r\n\r\nthan three-quarters of our revenue, and I mean keep.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not mean that this Assembly will remain a truncated\r\n\r\nappendix of some Central Parliament. We shall have  the\r\n\r\npower of dispensation. The Member for Anson will, after\r\n\r\n31st  of August, have the power to have his say on  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure of a vast sum of money every year  -  more\r\n\r\nthan  $500  million. Of that, an estimated $70  million\r\n\r\nmay  go  to  the  centre for Federal services,  police,\r\n\r\nposts, telecommunications and so on. It may be more: it\r\n\r\nmay  be less.

The  Bill  seeks  to   enable   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  enter into one or more agreements  with\r\n\r\nthe World Bank for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloans  to  finance  capital projects  undertaken  by  a\r\n\r\nStatutory Authority. The World Bank will lend  only  to\r\n\r\nmember  Governments  or  to non-member  Governments  or\r\n\r\ninstitutions if such loans were guaranteed by a  member\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It is quite normal for the World  Bank  to\r\n\r\ntake one year or more to process a loan application. It\r\n\r\nhas  to  satisfy itself that the loan granted is indeed\r\n\r\nto  finance  a  capital project. Such  a  project  must\r\n\r\ncontribute towards the reconstruction or development of\r\n\r\na  country.  It is also necessary to satisfy  the  Bank\r\n\r\nthat   such   a   project  will  be   implemented   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently managed by a statutory authority that will\r\n\r\nbe  efficient  and  competent. The statutory  authority\r\n\r\nrunning  it  will not only be able to provide  for  its\r\n\r\nproper supervision and management but will also be able\r\n\r\nto  operate  on  a sound commercial basis  to  annex  a\r\n\r\nreturn  of  profits not only to cover  maintenance  and\r\n\r\nloan   repayments  but  also  to  provide  for   future\r\n\r\nexpansion. The World Bank will also have to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  loan  is  made to a country that  is  economically\r\n\r\nstable  and  that  the  guarantor  country  is   in   a\r\n\r\nsufficiently  sound financial position  to  honour  its\r\n\r\npledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Government has been\r\n\r\nnegotiating with the World Bank for a loan for the  new\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang  Power Station. These negotiations  have\r\n\r\nreached  a stage when the World Bank is ready  to  sign\r\n\r\nthe  loan  agreement; and indeed, it was only two  days\r\n\r\nago  that the Singapore negotiating team returned  from\r\n\r\nWashington  after  having completed their  negotiations\r\n\r\nwith the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank has expressly required that before such a\r\n\r\nloan  agreement  could be signed  and  made  effective,\r\n\r\nlegislation  must  be  enacted  to  provide   for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a statutory authority -  in  this  case\r\n\r\nthe  Public Utilities Board - to which the loan will  be\r\n\r\nmade.  We  must  also have legislation  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to borrow from the World Bank and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat certain of the requirements in regard to guarantee\r\n\r\nare  sufficiently safeguarded. It is necessary for  the\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities Bill, therefore, to be passed, as well\r\n\r\nas the Loans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(International   Bank)  Bill  to  be   enacted   on   a\r\n\r\nCertificate   of  Urgency  because  of  the   impending\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  Malaysia. The  Prime  Minister  will\r\n\r\ntoday  introduce the Public Utilities Bill, also  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is not a member of the World\r\n\r\nBank,  and al, though it has been negotiating with  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank for a loan, one of the requirements was that\r\n\r\na  loan  should  be  guaranteed by the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If,  however,  the  signing  of  the  loan\r\n\r\nagreement  is delayed until very near to Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom Government may find it embarrassing  to\r\n\r\nstand  guarantee for this loan on the  ground  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  more proper for such a loan to be guaranteed\r\n\r\nby   the  Central  Government  of  Malaysia  after  its\r\n\r\nformation. In this case, the World Bank may want to re-examine  and  reassess  the whole  situation  all  over\r\n\r\nagain,  and  this may well mean that the  efforts  that\r\n\r\nhave been put in over the last two years or so would be\r\n\r\nfutile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary now to take both the Loans\r\n\r\n(International Bank) Bill and the Public Utilities Bill\r\n\r\nthrough all stages on a Certificate of Urgency in order\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore Government can enter into  a  loan\r\n\r\nagreement that has been negotiated with the World Bank,\r\n\r\nand  to complete the signature of this agreement at the\r\n\r\nearliest  possible date in order that the loan  can  be\r\n\r\neffective for the financing of the Pasir Panjang  Power\r\n\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not rise to oppose\r\n\r\nthe   position  where  the  Government  seeks  to   get\r\n\r\nauthority to borrow monies from the World Bank,  hut  I\r\n\r\nrise  to say a few things on what I consider to be  the\r\n\r\ninherent powers of the Legislative Assembly insofar  as\r\n\r\nloans are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Constitution, all public debts become statutory expenditure, and any statutory expenditure cannot be debated when the Estimates are presented to the House, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  virtue  of  the Constitution itself, any  items  of\r\n\r\nstatutory expenditure are by themselves passed  without\r\n\r\ndebate  in  this  Assembly.  If  that  is  the  correct\r\n\r\nposition  - and I submit it is the correct position - what\r\n\r\nthis  Bill seeks to do then is this. Under clause 3  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill it seeks to give to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\npowers to borrow from the Bank such sum or sums as  may\r\n\r\nbe  required by a statutory authority for the  exercise\r\n\r\nof  its functions. We all know, of course, that this is\r\n\r\nmerely  a  constitutional way of saying that where  the\r\n\r\nCabinet thinks fit then the Government of Singapore may\r\n\r\nborrow from the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 3 (6), it\r\n\r\ngoes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any of the provisions of the loan agreement are\r\n\r\ninconsistent or in conflict with any law  in  force  in\r\n\r\nthe  State, the provisions of the loan agreement  shall\r\n\r\nprevail.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, on page 4 of the Bill, in clause 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All sums borrowed under the powers conferred by this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  all interest and other charges  thereon\r\n\r\nshall he a charge upon and shall be payable out of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  revenues  and assets of the  State  which  are\r\n\r\nhereby appropriated to the purpose.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words,  these loan monies  will  be  charged\r\n\r\nagainst  the Consolidated Fund in so far as  repayments\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  and, as I have said  before,  once  it\r\n\r\nbecomes statutory expenditure, then the Assembly ceases\r\n\r\nto have any control or say over such expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 8:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding any written law, the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara may exercise all such powers and authorities and\r\n\r\ndo or cause to be done all such things as appear to him\r\n\r\nto  be necessary for giving full and complete effect to\r\n\r\nthe loan agreement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, what this Bill seeks to do is to give\r\n\r\nto the Government absolute powers of borrowing from the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank, and when the Government chooses to  borrow\r\n\r\nfrom  the World Bank, the Legislative Assembly  becomes\r\n\r\nabsolutely powerless. I wonder whether that is  a  good\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise on the same issue.\r\n\r\nI  am  in complete agreement with the principle of  the\r\n\r\nBill. I naturally support the powers sought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  purposes  of  obtaining loans for our  development\r\n\r\nplans,  but  I  view with genuine alarm the  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  Bill which  in  fact - maybe  not  in\r\n\r\nintent - brush away at one stroke the entirety of the law\r\n\r\nof the State. It provides not only for a loan agreement\r\n\r\nto  be  made  with the International Bank but  it  also\r\n\r\nprovides   for   guarantees  by  the   United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment and any other government. Incidentally, Sir,\r\n\r\nit says -  attention has been drawn to it by the previous\r\n\r\nspeaker - \"notwithstanding  any  written   law   to   the\r\n\r\ncontrary\", anything that the Government may put in that\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the  Bank and the  guaranteeing  State\r\n\r\nwould be law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be completely abdicating all our powers,\r\n\r\nSir, it seems to me, quite unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the Minister has indicated that the\r\n\r\nBill  takes the form of enactments in other independent\r\n\r\nterritories which \"we have become\", according  to  him,\r\n\r\nbut whether we are independent or not is not the point.\r\n\r\nThe  point is, are there really any such provisions  in\r\n\r\nany   country?  Is  there  any  legislature  which  has\r\n\r\npermitted itself to pass a law whereby it abdicates its\r\n\r\npowers  and  puts  them  into the  hands  of  a  single\r\n\r\ndictator who may do what he pleases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, it will be urged, and no doubt properly\r\n\r\nurged, that it is not intended to abuse the powers that\r\n\r\nare  given,  for  the  Bank may wish  to  know  without\r\n\r\nreferring  to  our  laws that the  provisions  of  that\r\n\r\nagreement will be binding. Sir, if necessary, it  could\r\n\r\nbe said, \"notwithstanding any laws to be made\", so that\r\n\r\nyou  could  not pass laws which prejudice  an  existing\r\n\r\nagreement; but to say \"notwithstanding any law\", wiping\r\n\r\naway  seemingly your own constitution and any laws that\r\n\r\nare   in  existence,  I  find  it  very  difficult   to\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, and I feel that this requires  further\r\n\r\nclarification.  As  you see, Sir,  it  causes  me  some\r\n\r\nanxiety,  and I have tabled amendments before  you  for\r\n\r\nthat  purpose. I do hope that the Government will  take\r\n\r\nthese  criticisms in the spirit in which they are being\r\n\r\noffered as being helpful and for purposes of proceeding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitutionally. I am not suggesting that they  do  in\r\n\r\nfact seek to obtain, through a Machiavellian manoeuvre,\r\n\r\npowers whereby they can then destroy all our laws,  but\r\n\r\nin  law,  that is what is happening, even  though  that\r\n\r\npower may not be exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard the Minister for Finance giving his reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the  Certificate of Urgency on this Bill  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  point out that since the Government  came  to\r\n\r\npower,  more  than three years have elapsed,  and  they\r\n\r\nwant  this House to pass this Bill in a hurry in  order\r\n\r\nto borrow money from the World Bank. If a loan from the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  is  in  the interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then  on principle we will  not  raise  any\r\n\r\nobjection.  But in the context of the entire  Bill,  we\r\n\r\ncan see that the Bill seeks to ignore and disregard the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people to raise questions on the\r\n\r\njustifiability of the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in the Bill that when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara thinks fit, that is, if the Government\r\n\r\nthinks  fit, the Government may borrow money  from  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank and enter into agreements thereunder before\r\n\r\nthe amount of the loan is made public to the Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided in this Bill that the Government\r\n\r\ncan enter into this agreement first, and then within 30\r\n\r\ndays   report  to  this  House  the  contents  of  this\r\n\r\nagreement. But let us take this present Session of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  There  has been a period of  several  months\r\n\r\nwhen  we  did not meet. If during this period when  the\r\n\r\nAssembly was not in session the Government had borrowed\r\n\r\nsome  money from the World Bank, we would not have been\r\n\r\nable  to know how much the Government had borrowed from\r\n\r\nthe World Bank, and we would not have been able to know\r\n\r\nthe contents of the agreement entered into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that to get a loan of this nature we have to pay interest, and the interest has to be paid out of revenues of the Government collected from the people. The interest should be approved, in the first place, by this House before it can be paid by the Government to the party concerned. Since that is\r\n\r\nthe position, Members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  House will have every right to understand,  before\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  is signed, what is to  be  incorporated\r\n\r\ntherein, what will be the conditions to he attached  to\r\n\r\nthis  loan by the World Bank, and what is the  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest.  All such things must be made public  to  the\r\n\r\nMembers of this House. This is very important.  But  in\r\n\r\nthe Bill tabled by the Minister for Finance, all we can\r\n\r\nsee from it is that until the Minister for Finance,  or\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of  Singapore, has already  signed  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with the World Bank or any other government,\r\n\r\nthen we will be able to know; so by then it will be too\r\n\r\nlate  for  us  to  raise any objection because  a  fait\r\n\r\naccompli  has  already  been  made,  an  agreement  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  signed, and we cannot do anything  about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point I would like to raise in connection with this Bill is that, according to the Minister for Finance, Singapore is not a member nation of the World Bank, and so to make a loan from the World Bank, we must have another nation to stand as guarantor before such a loan can be made available to\r\n\r\nus.  I  want  to ask him if lie will assure this  House\r\n\r\nwhether   the   guarantor  nation,  i.e. the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment,  will in the meantime have  any  conditions\r\n\r\nattached to this guarantee when it is prepared to stand\r\n\r\nas  guarantor. I would like him to tell this House  the\r\n\r\nposition regarding this matter. We would also  like  to\r\n\r\nknow whether the guarantee made by this nation will  be\r\n\r\nagainst  the  interests  of the  people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBefore  our people make great sacrifices, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has to consider such a nation carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand\r\n\r\nthe  urgency of having such a Bill in order  to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  loan  to  be raised with the World  Bank  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects which the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nin  mind. Surely it would not be difficult for  him  to\r\n\r\ntell  this House now what loan he has in mind  and  for\r\n\r\nwhich  purpose  this Bill is introduced,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nAssembly will have an opportunity to know what the Bill\r\n\r\nis intended to effect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  to what extent will it commit the Assembly.

Its funds are from  an\r\n\r\ninternational  source, and when  it  enters  into  loan\r\n\r\nagreements with State Governments, it wants  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the agreements into which it enters are not  held\r\n\r\nto  be void by Municipal courts on the grounds that the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the loan agreements are inconsistent  or\r\n\r\nin conflict with any Municipal law. It is only on these\r\n\r\nterms  that the International Bank is willing to  enter\r\n\r\ninto loan agreements with State Governments and the sub-clause  which has been challenged gives effect to  this\r\n\r\nintention. The Bank will also not agree to granting any\r\n\r\nloan  unless the Government seeking the loan  has  full\r\n\r\npower to implement all the terms of the agreement. I am\r\n\r\nadvised,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, by  the  State  Advocate-General that such clauses appear in all Municipal Bills\r\n\r\nproviding   for   the  raising  of   loans   from   the\r\n\r\nInternational  blank  and  we  are  not  in   any   way\r\n\r\nintroducing new precedents in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether I\r\n\r\ncan speak on a point of clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Too late.

We\r\n\r\nhave  two lawyers on the Opposition Benches who,  while\r\n\r\nthey agree with the general purpose of the Bill, are in\r\n\r\nsome  doubt  whether the absolute power to borrow  from\r\n\r\nthe  World  Bank is a good thing. Now, I think  in  all\r\n\r\narguments  regarding  the merits  or  demerits  of  the\r\n\r\nclauses, one should remember that the World Bank  is  a\r\n\r\npre-eminent international institution in this world and\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is extremely selective in regard to the loans  that\r\n\r\nit  makes  to  countries. I can assure the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park that the tests that are required before the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank agrees to advance money to any country  are\r\n\r\nextremely  rigid and there is absolutely no  danger  at\r\n\r\nall  that this will open the flood-gates of finance  to\r\n\r\nthe State of Singapore. If only that could be the case,\r\n\r\nif  only  the fears of the Member for Farrer  Park  are\r\n\r\ngenuine,  then nobody would he happier than  I  myself,\r\n\r\nbut the position is that the procedures are strict, the\r\n\r\ncriteria and standards set are extremely high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has raised a number of\r\n\r\npoints.  I  do  not propose to reply  to  all  of  them\r\n\r\nbecause they do not seem to have any real relevance  to\r\n\r\nthe  issues  posed  by the clauses in  this  Bill.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  he says that this Bill is defective  because\r\n\r\nit  enables  the Government to enter into an  agreement\r\n\r\nand  commit  the State before elected Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - before the people's representatives,  in  his\r\n\r\nown words - can pronounce judgment on whether the rate of\r\n\r\ninterest is fair and just and whether the loan  project\r\n\r\nis  a  good one. With respect, Mr Speaker, Sir,  these\r\n\r\nare  matters of administration and execution. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  matters  which could be properly debated  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has further raised the point about the\r\n\r\npowers of the guarantor government - whether there is any\r\n\r\nrisk that some sinister strings or conditions might not\r\n\r\nbe  attached to the powers of the guarantor. The powers\r\n\r\nof  the guarantor government are laid out and specified\r\n\r\nin this Bill and they are quite clear-cut and precise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Cairn-hill.

That   is\r\n\r\nperfectly  legitimate on the part of the  Bank,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  the constitutional position can be met  in  this\r\n\r\nState  whereby both parties can be satisfied by  seeing\r\n\r\nto  it that this Assembly is informed beforehand of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  loan and has  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ndebate  it openly. I do not think that there is  really\r\n\r\nany  grave obstacle to that. Fortunately, loans, unlike\r\n\r\ncustoms, taxes and income taxes, are not matters  which\r\n\r\nneed  be kept terribly secret until they are finalised,\r\n\r\nand  here  no damage could possibly be done by advising\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly beforehand of the exact nature\r\n\r\nof  the  loan  agreement which would  be  tabled  as  a\r\n\r\ndocument  and  which  could be  approved  by  a  simple\r\n\r\nmotion. Then the constitutional position would  be  met\r\n\r\nwhereby we have taken the responsibility for the  terms\r\n\r\ntherein      contained      and      therefore      the\r\n\r\nwords - \"notwithstanding any written law to the contrary\"\r\n\r\nor \"in conflict with any law in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforce  in  the  State\" - those provisions are  no  longer\r\n\r\nunconstitutional  because we have ourselves  considered\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  which might possibly be  conceived  as\r\n\r\nbeing contrary to any of our laws, and we are satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  them and we have approved them; not that we would\r\n\r\napprove  any  provision which is contrary  to  existing\r\n\r\nlaws, Sir,It would at that stage then be obvious  that\r\n\r\nthese provisions are not so much provisions whereby our\r\n\r\nown  laws  are being set aside, but are provisions  for\r\n\r\nsatisfying the International Bank that in fact our laws\r\n\r\nhave   been   complied  with.   That   is   the   major\r\n\r\nconstitutional  distinction.  It  is  a   very   simple\r\n\r\nprocedure.  All I seek is that instead of  tabling  the\r\n\r\nloan  agreement  under clause 7, which  would  then  be\r\n\r\ndeleted,  you  table the loan agreement  before  it  is\r\n\r\nsigned;  you  seek  the  approval  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly and thereafter the provisions of clauses 6 and\r\n\r\n8 will have effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be suggested that there may be matters of\r\n\r\nurgency when the Assembly is not sitting. However,  you\r\n\r\nhave  heard, Mr Speaker, as indicated, that  the  Bank\r\n\r\ntakes  about a year to process our request for  a  loan\r\n\r\nand  if we can wait a year for such processing, we  can\r\n\r\nwait  a  year  and one month or maybe a  year  and  two\r\n\r\nmonths,  Sir, in order to obtain that loan. But  I  can\r\n\r\nsay for myself, and I hope I can speak for the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  Members  here, that where there  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nurgency   requiring   a  substantial   loan   for   our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes, the Cabinet should not  hesitate\r\n\r\nto reconvene this House exclusively for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do urge the Government to recognise that, as it\r\n\r\nstands, the provisions here go against the grain of the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law and that there is a very simple procedure\r\n\r\nto meet the needs of the Bank and to meet the spirit of\r\n\r\nthe Rule of Law and that is to table the loan agreement\r\n\r\nin  this  House and obtain approval by a simple  motion\r\n\r\nbefore execution thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\ninserted, be there inserted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on the general observations\r\n\r\nmade by the Member for Anson that some of these clauses\r\n\r\nreally,  go against the grain, I think he, as a lawyer,\r\n\r\nprobably knows that it is quite invalid. In fact, it is\r\n\r\nvery  common for two parties to sign an agreement which\r\n\r\nprovides that notwithstanding any provision of the law,\r\n\r\nthey  will do such and such a thing. For instance,  the\r\n\r\nparties  may say that they will send all their disputes\r\n\r\nto  arbitration  in a certain manner although  the  law\r\n\r\nprovides that arbitration will be conducted in  another\r\n\r\nmanner. So to that extent, the Assembly itself  as  the\r\n\r\nsupreme legislative authority in this State can  decide\r\n\r\nin  this instance that they will observe the conditions\r\n\r\nof  the  loan agreement even though it might not square\r\n\r\nwith  some  minor  laws or Municipal by-laws  or  local\r\n\r\nregulations that may be in force. I think my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Law, has made that clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the proposal that the loan agreement\r\n\r\nshould  be approved in the Assembly before it is signed\r\n\r\non  behalf of the Government, I think it is a pity that\r\n\r\nwe  are  under  some difficulty over this.  First,  the\r\n\r\npresent  programme is extremely tight. As I have  said,\r\n\r\nthe U.K. Government is prepared to extend its guarantee\r\n\r\nonly within a matter of weeks from now: and if it comes\r\n\r\ntoo  close to Malaysia, then they say it should he  the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government  which  should  take   on   the\r\n\r\nguarantee. That means a delay of some considerable time\r\n\r\nbecause the Federation Treasury will want to go through\r\n\r\nthe  whole process all over again. The net result  will\r\n\r\nbe  very damaging to our expansion plan. But that is  a\r\n\r\npractical difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one difficulty which will certainly stem\r\n\r\nfrom  the World Bank philosophy itself. The World  Bank\r\n\r\nhas always wanted to make its operations independent of\r\n\r\npolitical considerations. In other words, it  judges  a\r\n\r\ncountry not by the colour of its Government but by  the\r\n\r\nsoundness  of  its currency, its economic institutions.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that the World Bank would want to happen\r\n\r\nwould  be  for  the terms of the agreement  to  be  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  a  political  debate  in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly. It can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  happen  that certain parties may  take  political\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  some of the terms in  the  agreement  as\r\n\r\nbeing unduly onerous or as being unduly difficult.  But\r\n\r\nthe terms of the World Bank are standard. They apply to\r\n\r\nall  countries which want to borrow from the Bank,  and\r\n\r\nvariation is allowed only within very narrow limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, of course, if the Assembly were to make\r\n\r\nany  variations to the terms of the loan agreement,  it\r\n\r\ncould well mean that the whole proposal then would have\r\n\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one of my difficulties here is that this is the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  that we are negotiating a  loan  with  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  and it would be natural that  Members  may\r\n\r\nthink  they  are  being expected to  support  something\r\n\r\nwhich is quite unknown. I can sympathise with that sort\r\n\r\nof  attitude.  As  against  that,  I  put  forward  the\r\n\r\nargument that the World Bank is a respectable authority\r\n\r\nand  further that the terms and conditions  are  fairly\r\n\r\nstandard.  In  fact,  the area for negotiations  as  we\r\n\r\nfound   out  is  extremely  narrow  and  most  of   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions that took place in Washington were  in  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  discussing  the future  revenue,  cost  and\r\n\r\nfuture  expansion  programme of  The  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard.  So far as the terms are concerned, as  I  said,\r\n\r\nthey  are pretty standard, and I do not think that much\r\n\r\npurpose would be served by requiring that the agreement\r\n\r\nbe   approved   by  the  Legislative  Assembly   before\r\n\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a valuable\r\n\r\nBill  and  I  can but regret that I seem to be  raising\r\n\r\ntechnical  objections to it.

They  really\r\n\r\nare  grave, Sir, when you ask the Assembly to say  that\r\n\r\ndespite any laws the Government can enter into any kind\r\n\r\nof  financial agreement irrespective of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthat  agreement is being entered into with an extremely\r\n\r\nresponsible and respectable body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this august Bank would not\r\n\r\nwish  to  be  sullied by any debate in the Assembly  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  terms  of  this  agreement.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has itself provided in this Bill under  sub-clause  (7)  of clause 3 that that agreement  should  be\r\n\r\ntabled  and should be made public to this Assembly  and\r\n\r\nto  the people, and consequently there is nothing  then\r\n\r\nin  the  law to prevent a full debate on the  terms  of\r\n\r\nthat  agreement  and the conduct of the  Government  in\r\n\r\nentering  into  it.  So  why are  you  preventing  this\r\n\r\nagreement from being made the subject of a debate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is suggested that there are practical\r\n\r\ndifficulties of an immediate character. I repeat,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat it will be the duty of this Assembly - and I am sure\r\n\r\nit will consider it a duty which it would react to with\r\n\r\nalacrity - to attend when the agreement is ready, if  for\r\n\r\nbut  a  short  while and as a matter of  formality,  to\r\n\r\napprove  that  loan agreement in order  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to execute it whenever it might be ready. On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, if the Government is somewhat  nervous\r\n\r\nin  the  context  of other political  animosities  that\r\n\r\nexist,  then I suggest that this Bill should be limited\r\n\r\nto  six months - an unhappy alternative. I would  rather\r\n\r\nsee  the  Bill,  to  whose other  features  I  have  no\r\n\r\nobjection, remain a permanent feature of our law, as it\r\n\r\nshould  be, and not a permanent breach of the  rule  of\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfrom the explanation given by the Minister for Finance, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  see  why  he cannot accept this amendment.  His\r\n\r\nonly  reason is that the British Government has  agreed\r\n\r\nto act as a guarantor - this was only a few weeks ago. If\r\n\r\nthe  time were to be after this, the British Government\r\n\r\nwould not be willing to act as our guarantor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the Minister has said that\r\n\r\nSingapore's delegates to negotiate with the World  Bank\r\n\r\nhave  just returned and that all terms of the agreement\r\n\r\nhave  been  reached. Therefore, I cannot  see  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not accept this amendment because the\r\n\r\ndelegates  can  still go there to negotiate  and  reach\r\n\r\nagreement. At the same time, if in the next week or the\r\n\r\nnext  month the Government finds it necessary  or  very\r\n\r\nurgent  to  get a loan, then I am sure that Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House will be very willing to have another sitting\r\n\r\nconvened to discuss the matter, say before the  7th  of\r\n\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the loan by the Government from the World Bank will not be a very small sum; it will amount\r\n\r\nto  several million dollars. According to the Minister,\r\n\r\n$45 million will be borrowed for the development of the\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang Power Station. Now, this is a  big  sum.\r\n\r\nThis  sum,  in  the end, will have to be  paid  by  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. Therefore, it is necessary for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to let this House know the amount  and  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of the loan to get the Assembly's  approval\r\n\r\nbefore  going  ahead with the loan.  Without  such  an\r\n\r\napproval  by this House, the Government will be  giving\r\n\r\nthe  impression to the people that there might be  some\r\n\r\ninside  story - otherwise why can the Government not  let\r\n\r\nthe  loan be approved by the Assembly first before  the\r\n\r\nMinister goes and signs the agreement for the loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion therefore that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  accept  this amendment in order to  enable  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people and the people themselves\r\n\r\nto  know exactly the amount the Government is going  to\r\n\r\nborrow  and also the conditions to be embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nagreement for the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Assembly is a\r\n\r\nsovereign Legislature in that within its powers it  can\r\n\r\nmake  laws for the peace, order and good government  of\r\n\r\nthe State, and those powers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot under any circumstances be questioned.

In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  life of this Bill is for five months.

Could it go beyond\r\n\r\nthat? That is the point. So far as I am concerned,  all\r\n\r\nI  am  interested in is this. The Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  told us that he has only two projects in  mind  on\r\n\r\nwhich he is going to the World Bank for a loan: one  is\r\n\r\nthe  electricity project; and the other  is  the  water\r\n\r\nproject. I take it that the water project is the Johore\r\n\r\nRiver  scheme  and  that the electric  project  is  the\r\n\r\nextension  to the Pasir Panjang Power Station.  Insofar\r\n\r\nas   the  electricity  extensions  are  concerned,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has indicated that the loan will  be  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  $45  million. On  that  score,  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nsatisfied. The terms of the agree-merit, the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich repayment is to be effected, that is a matter,  I\r\n\r\nthink, we must leave to the Minister to achieve.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  interested  in that. What I am interested  on  the\r\n\r\nwater side is, how much money does the Minister hope to\r\n\r\nraise from the World Bank? If I am satisfied that those\r\n\r\namounts  are  well within the paying capacity  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  so far as I am concerned, I will support  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Two points were raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park. First, the life of  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nWell,  the  Bill will have validity after the  31st  of\r\n\r\nAugust this year because after the 31st of August  this\r\n\r\nyear   the   Government  that  will  be  the  guarantor\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be  the  Central  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, and therefore this  can  go  on\r\n\r\nbecause  the British Government then will have no  more\r\n\r\nresponsibility to guarantee any loans asked by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards the water project. Perhaps I can\r\n\r\nmention  that the World Bank will pay only the  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontent  of the total cost of the development  project.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, the Power Station in Singapore will cost\r\n\r\nmuch  more than $45 million. But $45 million represents\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of equipment and services we have to  import\r\n\r\nfrom abroad. In fact, this is really the payment of the\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  counterpart  of  the  cost  of  this\r\n\r\ndevelopment  project. Now, so far as the power  station\r\n\r\ngoes, it is a very high percentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, for water it is a very low percentage\r\n\r\nbecause most of the work consists of earthworks,  pipes\r\n\r\nand  so  on which are made locally. So I am afraid  the\r\n\r\namount  of loan we can get from the World Bank for  the\r\n\r\nwater project will represent a very small proportion of\r\n\r\nthe total cost. How much it is I do not know. That is a\r\n\r\nmatter  which  their experts will come  and  work  out. [Pause]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot to reply to some of the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson. The Member for Anson seems to  think\r\n\r\nthat  this is in some way unconstitutional and  against\r\n\r\nthe  Rule  of Law, that we are trying to close  a  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  World Bank without the Assembly  giving  its\r\n\r\napproval. I know of no independent country in the world\r\n\r\nwhich  provides that a World Bank loan shall be subject\r\n\r\nto the approval of the legislature. What the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  is  asking for the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  is\r\n\r\nsomething unique in legislative experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, in page 3, to\r\n\r\ndelete the whole of sub-clause (6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is with regret that I find that I have not been understood in my efforts to attract the attention of this Government to the appropriate constitutional procedure in a constitutional spirit, and that is that before this Assembly can abdicate its powers in respect of any particular law it should know what that law is and, if only nominally, that agreement\r\n\r\nshould be approved by it. I cannot, Sir, now that  that\r\n\r\nprovision  has  been  defeated, in  conscience,  permit\r\n\r\nmyself  to  agree  to sub-clause (6)   which  permits  a\r\n\r\nMinister to sign an agreement which supersedes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  law.

Our experience  has  been\r\n\r\nbefore  and  after  Delhi that their  words  are  never\r\n\r\ntranslated into acts. Actually you can always count  on\r\n\r\nthis  Government  to  deprive the  legislature  of  its\r\n\r\npowers  and  to  channelise all powers  into  a  single\r\n\r\ndictatorship.  This is it. Whether it  is  utilised  or\r\n\r\nnot,  in  law,  by  passing  sub-clause  (6),  we   are\r\n\r\nabdicating  our  right to pass laws, because  we  would\r\n\r\ngive them the right not only to ignore any existing law\r\n\r\nbut to take precedence over any future law.

But if we look at\r\n\r\nthis  legislation in the proper perspective, we may  be\r\n\r\nable  to  have a better appreciation of the reason  why\r\n\r\nsuch  a  clause is necessary. Sir, this  is  a  law  to\r\n\r\nenable   the  Government  to  borrow  money  from   the\r\n\r\nInternational Bank, and the International Bank  is  not\r\n\r\njust  a `business corporation where it will do its best\r\n\r\nto  get the best terms possible out of borrowers. It is\r\n\r\na  bank of international standing meant to help develop\r\n\r\ncountries  which are in need of finance  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nprojects  in  which the International Bank  itself  has\r\n\r\nconfidence that such development would be in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterests  of the economy of the country. So the  Bank,\r\n\r\nbefore  lending money to any government to help develop\r\n\r\nthe country, will want to satisfy itself that the money\r\n\r\nis  going  to  help  the  country  in  its  development\r\n\r\nprojects  and  not  to  help the government  to  remain\r\n\r\nlonger  in  office, or to help the government  to  hold\r\n\r\nsome  more rallies around the rural areas to  meet  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This  is  for  a definite development  project\r\n\r\nmeant  for  the  economic uplift of the  country.  And.\r\n\r\ntherefore,  once  the  Bank  has  decided  to  lend   a\r\n\r\ngovernment  large sums of money to help the country  to\r\n\r\nraise  its economic standard, surely I do not  consider\r\n\r\nit  wrong that the lender should want to see that there\r\n\r\nis sufficient protection that that money which has been\r\n\r\nloaned i well protected by law. I do not think that the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank will be wanting to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemand  from  any borrowing government terms  that  are\r\n\r\nimmoral  or  terms that are going to tie the government\r\n\r\nto   the  chariot  wheel  of  any  particular  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  why all the worry at all? What we  want  to\r\n\r\nknow  is,  do  we want this money to help  develop  the\r\n\r\ncountry? If we do, and if those are the terms on  which\r\n\r\nthe  International Bank can only lend us the money, let\r\n\r\nus   face   it:  let  us  accept  the  terms   of   the\r\n\r\nInternational Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be left out,\r\n\r\nbe left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 17; Noes, 32; Absent, 1.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n   Ayes                           Noes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBani, S.

It was committed to Select Committee and reported by the Select Committee without amendment. However, the Assembly was prorogued before the Report could be adopted and the Bill read a Third time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains nearly all the same provisions as\r\n\r\nthe  Bill introduced in the last Session except for two\r\n\r\nchanges. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst is contained in clause 40 (2)  which requires that\r\n\r\na  certificate be issued by the Minister as  conclusive\r\n\r\nevidence of the transfer and the vesting in the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board  of  the water,  gas  and  electricity\r\n\r\nundertakings  of the City Council and their  respective\r\n\r\nassets and liabilities should such evidence be required\r\n\r\nin  a statutory form: for example, by the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nStocks in which the City Council has invested. This has\r\n\r\nbeen done at the request of and after consultation with\r\n\r\nthe  City Treasurer and is intended to provide a  means\r\n\r\nto  dispel  any  dispute  that  might  arise  over  the\r\n\r\nidentity  or  amount of the former City Council  assets\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Public Utilities Board.  A  similar\r\n\r\nprovision  to  cover the assets to  be  transferred  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  is also included in clause  5  (3)   of  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government Integration Bill which is  not  being\r\n\r\nproceeded  with  on a Certificate of  Urgency  because,\r\n\r\nunlike  this Bill, it does not need to be so  proceeded\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second new proviso is clause 40 (2) which gives\r\n\r\npower  to the Minister to direct any person to transfer\r\n\r\nto  the service of the Public Utilities Board, to  give\r\n\r\nsuch  advice  and  to carry out such  acts  as  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired  in relation to or arising out of the transfer\r\n\r\nto  and the vesting in the Government of the assets and\r\n\r\nliabilities  of the City Council and Rural Board.  This\r\n\r\nprovision  has been put in at the request of  the  City\r\n\r\nTreasurer  to enable that officer, who will become  the\r\n\r\nChief  Financial Officer of the Public Utilities  Board\r\n\r\nwhen  formed, to complete the winding-up of the  former\r\n\r\nCity   Council   accounts,  divide   the   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities and transfer such to the Government and the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board respectively.  The  final  City\r\n\r\nCouncil accounts were closed as at 31st December, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I see from the notice of amendments on  this  Bill  that the Member for Anson has  proposed certain  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendments.<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19630405/19630405-fn-1963-04-05 Col 115.txt\"\">*</a> \r\n\r\nMay I say to him simply this? I  will  be\r\n\r\nquite  happy  to consider the merits of the  amendments\r\n\r\nand  I  give  an undertaking that after the  amendments\r\n\r\nhave  been considered, if they are valid, we shall move\r\n\r\nan  amending  Bill in respect of those amendments.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why  the  Bill  has been proceeded  with  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency is that the World Bank will  not\r\n\r\nlend  unless we move the Bill in its present  form,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have  agreed.  If  I  were  to  make   any\r\n\r\namendments,  even  though  they  may  not  affect   the\r\n\r\nsubstance of the Bill insofar as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  concerned, it may lead to endless  arguments\r\n\r\nwith  the World Bank Authority as to whether or not  it\r\n\r\nhas  deprived them of their security on the loan. There\r\n\r\nare  two conditions on which they give such a loan. One\r\n\r\nis  that the public utilities are vested in a statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation,   which  is  sufficiently  divested   from\r\n\r\nGovernment  control to a statutory body to ensure  them\r\n\r\ncertain  guarantees as to the economic running  of  the\r\n\r\ncorporation  which  will  take into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nrepayment of the loan. The other is the guarantee by  a\r\n\r\nmember  nation. My colleague, the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nhas explained the guarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I would like to say on the first point is that\r\n\r\nwhilst there may be merit in some of the amendments  he\r\n\r\nhas  proposed,  I  think I will be put  to  unnecessary\r\n\r\nargument with the World Bank to show that, in fact,  it\r\n\r\nhas not materially altered the worthiness and guarantee\r\n\r\nof  the  independent  statutory nature  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board. I therefore ask the Member to consider\r\n\r\nthis  point, that we allow this Bill to go  through  in\r\n\r\nits  present  form  and,  after  consideration  by  the\r\n\r\nS.A.G's Chambers in consultation with the World  Bank,\r\n\r\nif  there are any amendments which the Member wishes to\r\n\r\npress, we shall proceed on an amending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am startled by the\r\n\r\ncourtesy of the Prime Minister and I trust he will  not\r\n\r\ntake that as a discourteous reply. I am indeed startled\r\n\r\nand I appreciate it. I would like to co-operate as much\r\n\r\nas  I  can.  Can I have some indication,  if  you  will\r\n\r\npermit, Sir? There is one matter of major gravity - I am\r\n\r\nprepared  to  concede  the  others -  the  question   of\r\n\r\nministerial interference which I have sought  to  amend\r\n\r\nin  departmental affairs, particularly  the  danger  of\r\n\r\nhaving  the  Minister  responsible  for  salaries   and\r\n\r\nemoluments, which would make it a political issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main value of having a public utility is that the\r\n\r\ntrade unions can deal with a statutory body and not  on\r\n\r\na  political  basis. Those are some  of  the  important\r\n\r\npoints.  But the major one is clause 20 which  deprives\r\n\r\nthe  citizen of his right to sue the Board, and I  feel\r\n\r\nquite  certain that the intention was not there. But  I\r\n\r\nam  satisfied in my own mind, Sir. They have copied  it\r\n\r\nfrom section 396 of the Municipal Ordinance, which  was\r\n\r\nmodified'   in  section  50  of  the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and now he has copied - just one copied  from\r\n\r\nthe other, Sir. They forgot that in the first Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   they  were  dealing  with  human   beings - Commissioners -using the word \"them\",  whereas  in  this\r\n\r\nBill  they are using the word \"Board\", which  is  \"it\".\r\n\r\nForgive me for being technical for the moment. I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the gist of it is that neither the Board\r\n\r\nnor  any of its members, nor any of its employees would\r\n\r\nbe  liable for any breach of contract or tort,  or  for\r\n\r\nnegligence in respect of any duties bona fide  executed\r\n\r\nby  him. So that, Sir, if I am an employee of the Board\r\n\r\nand  I go to test your meter and I ram your wall and  I\r\n\r\nbring  down  all your furniture and I injure  all  your\r\n\r\nchildren,  the Board is not liable, and  a  great  many\r\n\r\nother  eventualities of that character.  I  feel  quite\r\n\r\ncertain,  Sir, that after the passage of the  1955  Act\r\n\r\nwhich   repealed  the  Public  Authorities   Protection\r\n\r\nOrdinance, that that is not the intention and  that  it\r\n\r\nis,   shall  we  say,  inadvertent.  I  am  not  always\r\n\r\nattaching the worst possible connotation to the conduct\r\n\r\nof  the Government. I trust that I am at times, if only\r\n\r\nat  times,  reasonable, Sir. Here this is a very  grave\r\n\r\ninroad  into the security and rights of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If  the  Prime Minister  will  give  me  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  an opportunity by way of  an  amending\r\n\r\nBill  will  be  given  at  the  next  sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, I will be very happy to concede, in  view  of\r\n\r\nhis urgent request that the amendments be not proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  today. And if I might have the further assurance,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  feel  he would be prepared to give,  that  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  any  people  deprived  of,  shall  we  say,\r\n\r\nlegitimate  rights  in the interim  period  due  to  an\r\n\r\ninadvertent  section  which  deprives  them  of   those\r\n\r\nrights,  then  the  amending Ordinance  would  be  made\r\n\r\nretrospective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No Member wishing to speak on the Second\r\n\r\nReading?

Unfortunately,  this\r\n\r\nonly  applies to the City Council area. The Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nto provide for similar powers to deal with unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures  in  the  areas administered  by  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are extremely concerned with the spate of\r\n\r\nunauthorised  structures that are being  built  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas in utter disregard of structural and health\r\n\r\nrequirements,  and  even fire safety requirements.  The\r\n\r\ndifficulty  is that to go by the ordinary processes  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  would  take anywhere between  three  and  six\r\n\r\nmonths, by which time somebody would already have  been\r\n\r\nswindled  into buying the house, gone into  occupation,\r\n\r\nand there is all the unpleasantness and the unhappiness\r\n\r\nof  having  to  evict  him from  what  is  an  unlawful\r\n\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are purely transitional. It re-enacts\r\n\r\nsections 170 and 170A of the Local Government Ordinance\r\n\r\nso  that  the  powers contained in these  two  sections\r\n\r\ncould be extended to the rural areas. The Bill will not\r\n\r\nbe  required  any  longer  when  the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nIntegration  Bill, the First Reading for  which  notice\r\n\r\nhas been given, has been introduced and becomes law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in connection with\r\n\r\nthe   Rural   Board   (Unauthorised   Buildings)   Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  the Government, which will  extend  its\r\n\r\npowers  to the rural areas, the time indeed is  reached\r\n\r\nwhen  proper  control  is  required  over  unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures. We have supported the steps to  look  after\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the public. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  power will be extended  to  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands - the  Southern Islands comes  under  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard - I ask the authorities concerned to implement this\r\n\r\nBill  in such a manner as to give due consideration  to\r\n\r\nthe  conditions prevailing in the areas  concerned.  In\r\n\r\nthe  application of these -by-laws, no mercy should  be\r\n\r\nshown   to   those  people  who  put  up   unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures  solely for the purpose of  profiteering  at\r\n\r\nthe,   expense  of  the  innocent  victims.   But   due\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to those victimised. What\r\n\r\nI  mean  is that, firstly, the reason why such  victims\r\n\r\ncommit this offence is that they are in the dark  about\r\n\r\nthe  existing regulations. Also, because they are  hard\r\n\r\npressed with certain conditions. For instance, a family\r\n\r\nwhich  is  increasing will require  more  floor  space.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  conditions, how car' they strictly  follow\r\n\r\nthe   regulations -  regulations  which   they   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  which  they  break  intentionally   or\r\n\r\notherwise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that the officers implementing these by-laws should make the people understand these\r\n\r\nregulations and not intimidate or threaten them. I know\r\n\r\nof an instance where a resident in the Islands extended\r\n\r\nhis  dwelling house without complying with the approved\r\n\r\nplan.  When  this  came to the notice  of  the  officer\r\n\r\nconcerned, the house owner was informed that his  house\r\n\r\nmust  be reconstructed to conform to the approved plan,\r\n\r\nfailing  which  action would be taken to  demolish  the\r\n\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this method of implementing the rules or\r\n\r\nregulations amounts to intimidation or threatening  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  do not know the rules and regulations.  On\r\n\r\nsuch  matters, Mr Speaker, the officers concerned must\r\n\r\nuse  their discretion and enforce rules that should  be\r\n\r\nunderstood by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nabout  this Bill relating to unauthorised buildings  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas, as has been explained by my colleague\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for the Southern Islands, we  cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthat proper control is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that this Bill is to be introduced on a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Urgency. Therefore, I must  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to tell this House how these rules  should\r\n\r\nbe  enforced on the defaulters. What is the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  word \"unauthorised\" in the real sense of the  word\r\n\r\nin  relation  to  dwelling  houses?  Does  it  mean  an\r\n\r\nunauthorised dwelling built without a permit  on  other\r\n\r\npeople's land, and built without regard to lire hazards\r\n\r\nand  health  considerations? In  my  constituency,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  from  my  experience from  the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government up to the present Government, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult for people to build houses, and those  houses\r\n\r\nthat were built were illegally built. Can we apply  the\r\n\r\nterm \"unauthorised\" to these houses, or can we allocate\r\n\r\nthem house numbers? Mr Speaker, most of the people  in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency at this moment have bought sites  from\r\n\r\nlessees, and they have paid for these sites with  money - from  $600  to $2,000 - as \"gratuity\". What concerns  me,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, is that the intention of these people  is\r\n\r\nto  build  houses,  but  the lessees  cannot  sign  any\r\n\r\ndocuments for the purpose of obtaining permits from the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Surveyor's Department. The  lessees  are  not\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and so the victims are the ordinary  people\r\n\r\nwho have been cheated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I appeal to the authorities, through the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to consider this aspect of the  matter.  I\r\n\r\nhave personally experienced it, and I think it has been\r\n\r\nbrought  to  the  notice of the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  that the Government, as a Government,  can\r\n\r\nconsider the position of the victims. These victims not\r\n\r\nonly  paid  a \"gratuity\" or coffee money but they  also\r\n\r\npaid  other expenses as well. So I hope the authorities\r\n\r\nwill  give serious consideration to this matter. It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  these  people  have  become  the  victims   of\r\n\r\nunscrupulous people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I agree with the\r\n\r\nsentiments  expressed  by the Member  of  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands and the Member for Kampong Kembangan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think the purpose of this Bill is to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  innocent victim does not suffer. If we  can  smack\r\n\r\ndown  an  illegal  building  fast  enough  before   the\r\n\r\ncontractor or the illegal building operator has  had  a\r\n\r\nchance  to sell it to the poor victim, the chances  are\r\n\r\nthat  only the illegal building operator who can afford\r\n\r\nto  suffer  will bear the loss of having his  wood  and\r\n\r\nnails torn asunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, after listening to the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan  and  the Member  for  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands, that, in fact, it is an indictment against our\r\n\r\nsociety  that  many of these victims, in  buying  these\r\n\r\nillegal  houses are consciously taking a risk.  Vaguely\r\n\r\nthey  know  that  something is  not  quite  all  right,\r\n\r\nbecause the contractor usually wants them to move  into\r\n\r\noccupation in the middle of the night. Usually they  do\r\n\r\nmove  in  the  middle  of  the night  because  building\r\n\r\noperations  are  conducted  in  darkness  and  wherever\r\n\r\npossible  on the following morning there is  already  a\r\n\r\nfamily in occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this assurance to the Member for the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands,  that where a family is already in  occupation\r\n\r\nof these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses,  then  of  course  humanitarian  considerations\r\n\r\napply. And in the administration of this Bill, we shall\r\n\r\nhave   to  consider  the  question  of  human  feelings\r\n\r\ninvolved in having to evict physically a person from  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  on  which  he  has probably  spent  his  life\r\n\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am happy to report that in the city areas,\r\n\r\nwhere  similar provisions have applied, partly  because\r\n\r\nof  the  promptness  of the Chief  Building  Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment  and partly because of the large  number  of\r\n\r\nflats  which  have been built, such operations  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger profitable, and I hope similar provisions ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
