Film distributors, Government\r\n\r\nofficials  and the ordinary cinema-goers  have  all\r\n\r\nbeen  involved  in the discussion one  way  or  the\r\n\r\nother  on  this matter. So far there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nconsensus of opinion among the parties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned  on a system of film classification,  and\r\n\r\non  whether  or  not the system will definitely  be\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the existing film censorship.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that systems of film classification have been\r\n\r\nin  operation  for quite some time  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  the United States of America and  certain\r\n\r\nother  industrially  more advanced  countries,  but\r\n\r\nthere has been no indication that the standard  and\r\n\r\nquality  of  films  have improved  because  of  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the systems. In fact, it has become\r\n\r\nmore  and  more apparent that the contrary  is  the\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many big film production companies in Hollywood\r\n\r\nwhich  have been responsible for the production  of\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  finest films we have ever  seen  are\r\n\r\nbeing  forced  to  wind up business  because  films\r\n\r\nproduced by them at high cost have not been able to\r\n\r\ncompete  with low-budget films produced by  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies   or   even   individuals   who    peddle\r\n\r\npornography. There is no doubt that there has  been\r\n\r\na  sustained degeneration in the standard of  films\r\n\r\nsince   the   introduction   of   the   system   of\r\n\r\nclassification  in  the western  countries.  It  is\r\n\r\nthese  facts that have made us hesitant  in  taking\r\n\r\nthe plunge, for although we do not want to deny our\r\n\r\nadult citizens the pleasure of watching some of the\r\n\r\nfilms  born  out  of a permissive  society,  it  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  our wish to turn our  city  into  a\r\n\r\npornographic jungle like New York or Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alarmed at the bad state of affairs in the United\r\n\r\nStates,  President  Nixon  recently  called  for  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  clean  up  the  smut  that  has  been\r\n\r\ngenerated since the relaxation of censorship there.\r\n\r\nHe  was afraid that the warped and brutal portrayal\r\n\r\nof  sex  in books, plays and movies, if not  halted\r\n\r\nand  reversed,  could  poison the  well-springs  of\r\n\r\nAmerican and western culture and civilisation.  But\r\n\r\nthe  harm has been done and it is now difficult  to\r\n\r\nundo  it. This is a good lesson that we must learn.\r\n\r\nWe  must  not  allow the American disaster  in  the\r\n\r\nexperiment of culture to be repeated in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also conscious of the fact, however, that\r\n\r\nif  our  present system continues, there  will  be\r\n\r\nfewer  and  fewer films suitable for  the  general\r\n\r\naudience.  We  are  therefore  trying  to  find  a\r\n\r\ncompromise   in  devising  a  simple   system   of\r\n\r\nclassification.  We cannot say as  yet  when  this\r\n\r\nsystem can be implemented, because there are  many\r\n\r\nproblems  which  have yet to be settled,  problems\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  age limit for the  audience  for  a\r\n\r\nparticular  category of films; how the  system  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be enforced; who should be responsible to\r\n\r\nsee that persons of the right age will be admitted\r\n\r\nto  watch the right category of films; whether the\r\n\r\nsystem  will be acceptable to all cultural  groups\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  and  so  on.  Until  we  can  find\r\n\r\nsolutions for these problems, all we can  now  say\r\n\r\nis  that we are travelling towards that direction,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  hoped that details can be arrived  at\r\n\r\nlater in the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out at this juncture that\r\n\r\nfilm   classification  will   not   replace   film\r\n\r\ncensorship. It will be a useful complement to film\r\n\r\ncensorship. With film classification, it is likely\r\n\r\nthat the film censors will not need to cut out  as\r\n\r\nextensively  as before, at least as far  as  films\r\n\r\nfor adults are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UPPER THOMSON ROAD HOUSING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BOARD COMPLEX</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Completion date and allocation of premises)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nand National Development if he will ascertain from\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board when the  Upper\r\n\r\nThomson  Road Shopping Centre will be  ready;  and\r\n\r\nif,  in the allocation of shophouses, etc., in the\r\n\r\nCentre,  preference will be given to  shop-keepers\r\n\r\nand  residents affected by the widening  of  Upper\r\n\r\nThomson  Road  and  to  hawkers  living  in   that\r\n\r\nConstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

What is being done is to  require\r\n\r\nthe    licensees   to   remove   the   unauthorised\r\n\r\nextensions, structures and obstructions  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to their original stalls. The  standard\r\n\r\nsize of a stall has always been 6 feet by 4 feet as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstipulated  in  the  Environmental  Public   Health\r\n\r\n(Markets)  Regulations. I would advise  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Kallang   to   read  these  regulations,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, the Third Schedule on licence fees. Not\r\n\r\nonly should the stalls be of standard size, but the\r\n\r\nfees  are  also fixed at a minimal sum. Looking  at\r\n\r\nthe licence fees, he can see that they are a highly\r\n\r\nsubsidised form of rental charged by Government for\r\n\r\na market stall or site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second part of the Member's question,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  has been assured by the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board that the existing Rayman  Market\r\n\r\nwill  not be demolished until the new market to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt    nearby   is   completed.   All    licensed\r\n\r\nstallholders  will  then be given  suitable  stalls\r\n\r\ninside  the  new  market.  In  fact,  I  gave  this\r\n\r\nassurance  in  writing  in  November  1969  to  the\r\n\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Member knows that it is Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  to resite unlicensed hawkers from roadsides\r\n\r\nand unauthorised places in indoor accommodation and\r\n\r\nmarkets.  Rayman Market can accommodate 236  stalls\r\n\r\nand  pitches, of which 101 are vacant. The  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  thus propose to license and  resite  by\r\n\r\nballot  the 115 unlicensed hawkers now carrying  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  near the market and along Balestier  Road\r\n\r\ninto  the  market.  This  will  not  only  minimise\r\n\r\ncompetition from the unlicensed hawkers outside but\r\n\r\nwill  also  bring people who buy from them  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\ncan  the Minister assure me in this House that both\r\n\r\nthe  old and new licensees will be given places  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  market  to be built by  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nquite  get  the  point the Member for  Kallang  has\r\n\r\nraised.

A  quick look at the main economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  indicators which are given  in  summary  in\r\n\r\nTable I will be sufficient to confirm this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exceptionally prosperous last two years\r\n\r\nof  the  Sixties, we entered the new decade of  the\r\n\r\nSeventies  with  some diffidence  as  to  what  the\r\n\r\nfuture  would  hold  for  us.  The  major  external\r\n\r\nfactors then looming over the horizon and likely to\r\n\r\naffect  the  economy during the first half  of  the\r\n\r\ndecade  were  the  continued  instability  of   the\r\n\r\ninternational  monetary  system,  depressed   share\r\n\r\nprices  combined  with inflation in  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries    and,   in   consequence    of    these\r\n\r\nuncertainties, the expectation of a  gradual  slow-down  in  the  growth of world trade. Domestically,\r\n\r\nthere were the expected consequences of the British\r\n\r\nGovernment's decision to withdraw all its  military\r\n\r\nforces from Singapore by the end of 1971. Added  to\r\n\r\nthis  was  the uncertainty as to the effects,  both\r\n\r\neconomic and political, of the accelerated run-down\r\n\r\nof American Armed Forces in Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, whilst there was some cause for our\r\n\r\napprehensions, the worst has been avoided  in  1970\r\n\r\nlargely by a coincidence of favourable factors. The\r\n\r\ndecision   by  the  Labour  Government  for   total\r\n\r\nmilitary   withdrawal  from  South-east  Asia   was\r\n\r\nreversed  by the victory of the Conservative  Party\r\n\r\nin  the  United Kingdom elections. The Conservative\r\n\r\nGovernment  intention  to  maintain  an   effective\r\n\r\npresence  in  the area has given added strength  to\r\n\r\nthe  Five-Power Defence arrangements  for  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand   Singapore.   It  has  resulted   in   greater\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  businessmen and  investors  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  both countries. Instead of an  expected\r\n\r\n$150  million  loss  in income,  the  reduction  of\r\n\r\nBritish military spending also proved to be  slight\r\n\r\nin  1970. (But the drop will be all the sharper  in\r\n\r\n1971!) World trade in value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms  continued to expand, not in accordance  with\r\n\r\nearlier  GATT  (General Agreement  on  Tariffs  and\r\n\r\nTrade) estimates of a 4-8 per cent rate, but at the\r\n\r\nrelatively high rate of 13 per cent. This  is  only\r\n\r\nslightly less than the 14 per cent rate in the boom\r\n\r\nyear  of 1969, but account has to be taken  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that because of the increase in manufacturers'\r\n\r\nexport prices, the increase in the actual volume of\r\n\r\nworld  trade was somewhat less than this. The  rate\r\n\r\nof   growth   of   world  trade   was   nonetheless\r\n\r\nimpressive,  particularly in view of the  recession\r\n\r\nwhich hit the American economy during 1970 and  the\r\n\r\nprognostications of a possible world recession as a\r\n\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these fortuitous circumstances,\r\n\r\nour  economy in 1970 was able to more than maintain\r\n\r\nthe healthy level of economic activity achieved  in\r\n\r\nthe  previous  two years. According to  preliminary\r\n\r\nestimates, which are given in Table II,  the  Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product,  our best indicator  of  overall\r\n\r\neconomic  health, reached $5,565 million at  factor\r\n\r\ncost,  an increase of $730 million over 1969.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  increase of some 15 per cent compared  with\r\n\r\nthe  average  annual growth of 14.5  per  cent  for\r\n\r\n1968-69 and of 9.5 per cent for the past decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall want to look more closely at the\r\n\r\ncomponents  which  make  up  the  total  of  $5,565\r\n\r\nmillion  Gross Domestic Product shown in Table  II,\r\n\r\nbut  before doing so, it may be of interest to note\r\n\r\nthe  related or twin indicator of economic  health,\r\n\r\nthe  Gross Domestic Expenditure shown in Table III.\r\n\r\nThis  gives  the  expenditure  on  all  goods   and\r\n\r\nservices  in  the economy. At $5,707  million,  the\r\n\r\nGross   Domestic  Expenditure  shows  an   absolute\r\n\r\nincrease of $928 million or, percentage-wise,  16.3\r\n\r\nper cent over 1969. More than half of this increase\r\n\r\nin  Gross  Domestic Expenditure is attributable  to\r\n\r\nthe   growth  in  Fixed  Capital  Formation,  which\r\n\r\nreached $1,403 million, a hefty increase of 41  per\r\n\r\ncent over 1969. Not only will this large investment\r\n\r\nensure a sustained rate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof economic growth for the future, but it is strong\r\n\r\nevidence  of investors' confidence in the political\r\n\r\nstability  of  Singapore  and  its  potential   for\r\n\r\nprofitable  economic investment. Table  IIIA  shows\r\n\r\nthat the largest portion of the Gross Fixed Capital\r\n\r\nFormation  was in machinery and equipment,  and  in\r\n\r\nconstruction,   both   indicative   of   industrial\r\n\r\ninvestment. It may also be of interest to note that\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector share of both consumption  and\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure is some 80 per cent. This ought\r\n\r\nto  allay  any  incipient fears such as  have  been\r\n\r\nexpressed sometimes of over-intrusion by Government\r\n\r\ninto  what  is properly the private sector  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now return to the Gross. Domestic Product\r\n\r\nand examine the contribution of the various sectors\r\n\r\nshown in Tables II, IIA, and JIB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agriculture and fishing sector continues to\r\n\r\nshow  the  small  but nevertheless  welcome  yearly\r\n\r\nincrement. Its potential may, however, be  limited.\r\n\r\nVigorous  efforts  will  continue  to  be  made  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping the Jurong Fishing Port and in promoting\r\n\r\ndeep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sector, manufacturing, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, continues to play an increasingly larger role\r\n\r\nin  the economy. In 1970 more than one-third of the\r\n\r\ngrowth in Gross Domestic Product was the result  of\r\n\r\nthe  growth in manufacturing output. Our industries\r\n\r\nare   gradually  moving  away  from   the   limited\r\n\r\npossibilities of import substitution on to the more\r\n\r\npromising fields of export promotion. We  shall  so\r\n\r\ngain  a  larger share in the benefits of  expanding\r\n\r\nworld  trade  in manufactures. The  time  has  long\r\n\r\npassed   since  Singapore  relied  solely  on   her\r\n\r\ntraditional   entrepot  outlets  for   her   export\r\n\r\nmarkets. Singapore products in increasing range and\r\n\r\nquality  are  now finding their way to  markets  in\r\n\r\nEurope  and  America. In Table V, the figures  show\r\n\r\nthat  direct  exports  of  manufactures  rose  from\r\n\r\n$1,265 million to $1,708 million in 1970, a gain of\r\n\r\n35  per  cent  over  1969. The steady  increase  in\r\n\r\ninvestment,  increasing the productive capacity  of\r\n\r\nnew industry and expanding existing industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in an increase in value-added  output\r\n\r\nto  $1,104 million in 1970 (see Table V). The Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product  figures  for  manufacturing  and\r\n\r\nquarrying in Table II show a growth of 29 per  cent\r\n\r\nin   1970  as  compared  with  the  average  annual\r\n\r\nincrease  of 22 per cent for 1965-69. Manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries now comprise slightly more than a  fifth\r\n\r\nof the national economic cake compared to less than\r\n\r\none-tenth a decade ago - see Table I1B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their contribution to total employment is also\r\n\r\nsignificant.   Preliminary  census  data   covering\r\n\r\nestablishments  with  10 or more  workers  indicate\r\n\r\nthat  there were about 126,500 workers employed  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries in 1970. This  represents\r\n\r\nan  increase of some 25,000 workers or 25 per  cent\r\n\r\nover  the  previous year's 100,758 and against  the\r\n\r\naverage  increase in employment for  1968-69  which\r\n\r\nwas about 21,250.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilities sector's contribution of $136\r\n\r\nmillion to the Gross Domestic Product reflects  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  industrial consumption, particularly\r\n\r\nof electric power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry played the most dynamic role in the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  our  economy. Because of  the  stimulus\r\n\r\ngiven  by  industry towards trade  in  manufactured\r\n\r\nproducts, trade was the largest contribution to our\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic  Product, 30  per  cent  for  1970.\r\n\r\nHowever, entrepot earnings in 1970 dropped  by  4.5\r\n\r\nper  cent  or  about $30 million  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nprevious year. And total entrepot earnings made  up\r\n\r\nabout 11 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product  in\r\n\r\n1970   as  against  19  per  cent  in  1960.   This\r\n\r\npercentage  may be expected to decline  further  as\r\n\r\nour  industrial  and  economic  base  expands  with\r\n\r\ndomestic  trade  keeping  up  its  steady  rate  of\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two factors may, however, explain the poorer\r\n\r\nentrepot  performance  in 1970  relative  to  1969.\r\n\r\nFirst,  despite  the  remarkable  growth  of  world\r\n\r\ntrade,  the prices for rubber registered a downward\r\n\r\ntrend  in  1970. Consequently, the value  of  crude\r\n\r\nrubber exports fell by about $250 million. This was\r\n\r\na fall of 17 per cent compared with the increase of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62  per cent in 1969 when rubber prices were on the\r\n\r\nuptrend.  Secondly, our exports  to  South  Vietnam\r\n\r\nfell  by  about  $100 million. In  spite  of  these\r\n\r\nadverse developments, however, there has been  some\r\n\r\nslight increase in total export earnings because of\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in the export of manufactures.  This\r\n\r\nincrease  amounted  to  $433  million,  more   than\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  offset the fall  in  the  value  of\r\n\r\nexports of rubber and exports to Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst export growth has been sluggish, imports\r\n\r\nhave  been buoyant. Concern has been expressed over\r\n\r\nthe   widening  trade  deficit  and  its   possible\r\n\r\nrepercussions on our balance of payments  position.\r\n\r\nHowever,   analysis  of  the  trade  and   payments\r\n\r\naccounts  suggests  that there  need  be  no  undue\r\n\r\nanxiety  because  of the following  considerations.\r\n\r\nFirst,  for  an economy with a small resource  base\r\n\r\nenjoying  rapid industrial growth, the buoyancy  in\r\n\r\nimports  is  due  largely  to  the  fast  pace   of\r\n\r\ninvestment in imported capital goods. This is borne\r\n\r\nout  by the statistics which show that between 1968\r\n\r\nand  1970, total imports increased by less than  20\r\n\r\nper  cent on an annual average, whilst in the  same\r\n\r\nperiod   capital  expenditure  on   machinery   and\r\n\r\nequipment  in Gross Domestic Expenditure  increased\r\n\r\nby  more than 50 per cent. Secondly, the outflow of\r\n\r\npayments  for  capital  goods  is,  by  and  large,\r\n\r\nbalanced by the inflow of foreign long-term capital\r\n\r\nfor investment in Singapore. This has generated the\r\n\r\ndemand for the capital imports. Thirdly, because of\r\n\r\nimperfect data, the trade deficit in the balance of\r\n\r\npayments  is  thought to be smaller than  shown.  A\r\n\r\npart of the positive large amounts for \"errors  and\r\n\r\nomissions\"  in the balance of payments  figures  in\r\n\r\nTable  VII  is  believed to be due to  the  trading\r\n\r\naccount.  Finally, and the most conclusive  factor,\r\n\r\nour  foreign reserves have been rising steadily  in\r\n\r\nrecent   years.  Official  overseas   assets   have\r\n\r\nincreased from $2,278.9 million in 1968 to $3,556.4\r\n\r\nmillion  at  the  end  of 1970.  For  the  present,\r\n\r\ntherefore, there is no need for alarm at our  large\r\n\r\ntrade deficit. That is not to say, however, that an\r\n\r\nimprovement in export performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould   not   be   necessary.   Our   traders   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  should  make  greater   efforts   to\r\n\r\npenetrate  more  markets and  make  more  sales  in\r\n\r\nhigher  value  goods.  Greater  promotion  efforts,\r\n\r\nincluding participation in trade fairs, would help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the building industry which has a\r\n\r\ntraditional role in pump-priming sagging economies,\r\n\r\nour  original use of it in the last few  years  was\r\n\r\nintended  to  mitigate the effects of  the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary   withdrawal.  The  stimulus   which   was\r\n\r\nprovided  through incentives such as  property  tax\r\n\r\nreduction or payments by easy instalments has  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  perhaps  somewhat over-successful,  in\r\n\r\ngetting investors to build hotels, shops and office\r\n\r\naccommodation and other urban renewal projects.  As\r\n\r\nan   indication  of  the  brisk  activity  of   our\r\n\r\nconstruction industry, preliminary figures for  the\r\n\r\nConstruction  Sector in the Gross Domestic  Product\r\n\r\navailable  indicate an increase of 36 per  cent  in\r\n\r\nvalue-added  output. This is the  highest  rate  of\r\n\r\ngrowth   recorded  since  1961  for  the  industry.\r\n\r\nStatistics on the production of broken granite  and\r\n\r\nof  cement show an output increase of 19  per  cent\r\n\r\nand 19 per cent respectively compared to 7 per cent\r\n\r\nand  13 per cent in 1969 and substantiate the  high\r\n\r\nlevel  of  activity of the industry.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  however, the smaller increases recorded  for\r\n\r\nthese   building   materials  indicate   that   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry's 36 per  cent  increase  in\r\n\r\nearnings may be constituted partly by higher profit\r\n\r\nmargins and only partly by increased constructional\r\n\r\ncapacity.  It could also be due to an  increase  in\r\n\r\nconstructional labour costs. This is suggested also\r\n\r\nby  the  acute  shortage of  skilled  building  and\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers. One of the  consequences  of\r\n\r\nthis has been an unprecedented rise in the cost  of\r\n\r\nnew  buildings  reflected  also  in  the  value  of\r\n\r\nexisting  buildings  such as dwellings  and  office\r\n\r\nblocks. However, some hotels have declined in value\r\n\r\nfor  other reasons. The situation is being  closely\r\n\r\nwatched   to   prevent  the  cost   increase   from\r\n\r\ndeveloping  to  serious  proportions.  It  may   be\r\n\r\nnecessary  also  to take other measures  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrun-away escalation in costs does not occur in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding industry. This could have serious  effects\r\n\r\non our total development effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be convenient at this point to refer to\r\n\r\nthe  ownership  of dwellings sector  in  the  Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic Product. The increase in earnings  of  $22\r\n\r\nmillion  over 1969 appears to be commensurate  with\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure on dwellings shown for 1970 in the\r\n\r\nstatistics at Table IIIA. In keeping also with  the\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure, the earnings year by year show\r\n\r\na  steady rise in absolute terms and make a  useful\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the economy. In percentage  terms,\r\n\r\nhowever, there has been a slight decline to 3.7 per\r\n\r\ncent in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made earlier to the reduction of\r\n\r\nBritish  military  spending. Preliminary  estimates\r\n\r\nindicate this reduction last year to be small, only\r\n\r\n$30 million. The final figure could well be larger.\r\n\r\nBut  for  1971, the reduction in spending  will  be\r\n\r\nconsiderable  as British force levels  go  down  to\r\n\r\njust over 2,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the areas of economic activity which were\r\n\r\nfostered  and developed during 1970 to  offset  the\r\n\r\nloss  in foreign exchange and other effects of  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  run-down, one of the most  promising  was\r\n\r\nthe tourist industry. The statistics of sea and air\r\n\r\npassenger   arrivals  indicate   the   very   rapid\r\n\r\nincreases  in  passenger traffic to Singapore  from\r\n\r\n306,000 in 1965 to 562,131 in 1969, and 716,139  in\r\n\r\n1970.  If  we exclude local passengers  from  these\r\n\r\nfigures,  we find that 521,654 tourists arrived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in 1970. This represents an increase  of\r\n\r\n110,000 or about 25 per cent more visitors than  in\r\n\r\n1969.  The  exceptional  increase  may  be  due  to\r\n\r\nvisitors  going to or returning from Expo  `70  and\r\n\r\npassing  through  Singapore. With  this  inflow  of\r\n\r\ntourists  into Singapore, and in spite of the  much\r\n\r\nincreased number of 62 tourist hotels in  1970,  it\r\n\r\nis  possible  still  to keep  the  monthly  average\r\n\r\noccupancy  rate  above 70 per  cent.  This  figure,\r\n\r\njudged  by more developed tourist countries, should\r\n\r\nensure    a   more   than   profitable   operation.\r\n\r\nPreliminary  estimates  of  earnings  from  tourist\r\n\r\nservices in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal $272 million. This is about 5 per cent\r\n\r\nof  Gross  Domestic Product. A decade ago, earnings\r\n\r\nfrom tourism contributed less than 1.5 per cent. We\r\n\r\nhave  moved  away from the thinking that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be unable to attract tourists in significant\r\n\r\nnumbers because of a dearth of tourist attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to the sector of \"other\r\n\r\nservices\"  which make up some 15 per  cent  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  Among  these  \"other  services\"  must  be\r\n\r\nreckoned those of the financial institutions  which\r\n\r\nmake   possible  our  trade,  industry  and   other\r\n\r\neconomic activity. Our instrument for the issue  of\r\n\r\ncurrency  remains the Currency Board with  its  100\r\n\r\nper  cent  backing by external assets of all  money\r\n\r\nissued  by the Board. It is an automatic regulation\r\n\r\nmechanism  of money with foreign exchange earnings.\r\n\r\nAt  the end of the year, there were $726 million of\r\n\r\ncurrency  notes  in active circulation.  With  $875\r\n\r\nmillion  also  of  demand deposits  (excluding  the\r\n\r\ndeposits  of  the Government in the  banks),  money\r\n\r\nsupply matched the overall pace of progress in  the\r\n\r\neconomy, increasing by 15 per cent in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I mention the action which was taken in the\r\n\r\npast    year    to   strengthen   other   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions?   I   refer   specifically   to   the\r\n\r\nestablishment   of   the  Monetary   Authority   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the arrangements to reorganise  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  Stock Exchange  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore Act was\r\n\r\ngassed. Opportunity was also taken to revise and re-enact  the  Banking  Act, which  put  on  a  proper\r\n\r\nfooting the licensing and control of banks, and the\r\n\r\nregulation  of  their  business  by  the   Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore. The many activities we have\r\n\r\nand  are  expecting  to develop  in  the  financial\r\n\r\nsphere  --the  Asian Currency Unit or Asian  Dollar\r\n\r\nmarket,  the  gold  market, the  numbered  accounts\r\n\r\nsystem, merchant banking all these will ensure that\r\n\r\nwe  have a firm framework for these operations, The\r\n\r\nMonetary Authority commenced functioning on the 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1971, and the first Board meeting was held\r\n\r\non the 5th February, 1971, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrange for the management and routine business  of\r\n\r\nthe   Authority.  A  Managing  Director  has   been\r\n\r\nappointed and staff is gradually being recruited It\r\n\r\nis hoped that the Authority will move shortly under\r\n\r\nOne  roof, albeit in temporary premises, until  the\r\n\r\npermanent  site  at  the  Central  Provident   Fund\r\n\r\nbuilding can be ready by 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the functions of the Commissioner of Banking\r\n\r\nhave now been assumed by the Monetary Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  will  now be  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of the banking sector. The  year  1970\r\n\r\nhas  been  one of steady progress for that  sector.\r\n\r\nTable  VI statistics indicate that commercial  bank\r\n\r\ndeposits  by  the end of 1970 rose  by  about  $500\r\n\r\nmillion   to   $3,195  million.  Though   this   is\r\n\r\nequivalent  to an increase of 16 per  cent,  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  a somewhat lower rate of growth than the  19\r\n\r\nper  cent  for  1969 or 26 per cent for  1968.  The\r\n\r\nslower  growth  is partly because of  the  drop  in\r\n\r\nentrepot   earnings.  Bank  loans   and   advances,\r\n\r\nhowever,  to  the private sector grew at  the  much\r\n\r\nfaster  rate of 26 per cent to reach $2,168 million\r\n\r\nby  the end of the year. Bank loans and advances to\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries grew even faster, by  more\r\n\r\nthan  50 per cent from $448 million in 1969 to $739\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1970. Manufacturing loans and  advances\r\n\r\nnow  constitute  34  per cent  of  bank  loans  and\r\n\r\nadvances as compared with 26 per cent in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Dollar market, which has become a part\r\n\r\nof the banking system, continued to expand in 1970.\r\n\r\nTotal  resources are now estimated at about  US$400\r\n\r\nmillion, and this despite declining interest  rates\r\n\r\nconsequent  upon  the  fall in  interest  rates  in\r\n\r\ninternational financial centres during the last few\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the  year. When the  market  was  first\r\n\r\nestablished,   most  of  its   funds   were   being\r\n\r\nreinvested  in  Euro dollars and  U.S, dollars  in\r\n\r\nLondon,  European financial centres and the  United\r\n\r\nStates.  However, there is a growing awareness,  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of the very large number of creditworthy\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  Southeast Asia, of the possibilities\r\n\r\nof borrowing from the Asian Dollar Market for their\r\n\r\nbankable projects. Our policy will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto encourage the channelling of more and more Asian\r\n\r\nDollar funds into regional uses. The lower rates of\r\n\r\ninterest  now  payable  for  Asian  Dollars  should\r\n\r\nassist in such use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Stock Exchange, I need not\r\n\r\nrepeat the reasons for the legislation now known as\r\n\r\nthe  Securities industry Act, 1970, and the related\r\n\r\nCompanies (Amendment) Act, 1970. Conditions in  the\r\n\r\nStock  Market had led to such a loss of  confidence\r\n\r\nthat  legislation was needed. I am glad to say that\r\n\r\nthe  market  has  reacted not unfavourably  to  the\r\n\r\nlegislation.  Close consultations  are  being  held\r\n\r\nbetween  officials of my Ministry and the Committee\r\n\r\nof  the  Exchange as to how best to  implement  the\r\n\r\nvarious  provisions  of  the  legislation  and  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Ferris  Report.  There  are\r\n\r\nindications  that  similar  legislation  is   being\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  Malaysia and the  Bank  Negara  has\r\n\r\nbegun discussions with the Exchange on the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic price level remained fairly stable\r\n\r\nwithin   the  pattern  of  economic  and  financial\r\n\r\ndevelopments  I  have just outlined.  The  Consumer\r\n\r\nPrice  Index  with 1960 as base o 100 registered  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  average  of 111.5 for 1970  compared  with\r\n\r\n111.1 for 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative stability in the overall index does\r\n\r\nnot   mean,  however,  that  there  were  no  price\r\n\r\nmovements   during  the  year.  There   were   such\r\n\r\nmovements  but they largely offset each other.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  sub-index, for example, moved up by  about\r\n\r\ntwo  percentage points because of a tax  on  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board bills, but there was a decline  in\r\n\r\nthe  sub-index  for food items. In particular,  the\r\n\r\nprices   of  rice  and  other  cereals   showed   a\r\n\r\nsignificant decline as shown by the fall in the sub-index for these items from 115 for 1969 to 109  for\r\n\r\n1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Future Prospects</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the less predictable subject of our\r\n\r\nfuture  prospects.  Can we sustain  the  very  high\r\n\r\ngrowth rate of 15 per cent for 1969 and 1970 in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoming  year? To deal with this question,  we  must\r\n\r\ntry  to  learn  from the analysis of  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation which we have made of the past year,  and\r\n\r\nearlier  years,  and from the experience  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  First of all, growth rates  of  15  per\r\n\r\ncent  are very exceptional. They are far in  excess\r\n\r\nof  the  six per cent per annum target of  the  new\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  Second  Development  Decade.   Our\r\n\r\ncomparison  should  not, however,  be  the  average\r\n\r\ndeveloping   country.  More   relevant   ones   for\r\n\r\ncomparison  are  our keenest competitors  in  Asia.\r\n\r\nTaiwan  with corresponding figures of 9.9, 9.3  and\r\n\r\n10.3  per cent, South Korea with 13.4, 8.9 and 13.1\r\n\r\nper  cent,  and Hong Kong for which Gross  National\r\n\r\nProduct figures are not available but whose  export\r\n\r\ntrade expansion of 15.8, 15.3 and 14.2 per cent for\r\n\r\nthe  same  three  years indicated  a  similar  high\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate. Then Japan with its sustained  growth\r\n\r\nrate  of  12.3,  12.9 and 14.3 per  cent  of  Gross\r\n\r\nNational Product growth in real terms for the years\r\n\r\n1966, 1967 and 1968 respectively. In an analysis of\r\n\r\ntheir   very  high  growth  rates,  Mr  S.  Okita,\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the Japan Economic Research  Centre,\r\n\r\nattributed  the  high growth  of  the  first  three\r\n\r\ncountries to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) rapid growth of manufacturing industries;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) export-oriented economic growth;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) cost consciousness of the business\r\n\r\nenterprises about their products;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) widespread small and medium sized\r\n\r\nindustries   developed   mainly   by   private\r\n\r\ninitiative;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) relatively efficient and productive\r\n\r\nagriculture;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) relatively high standard of education and\r\n\r\npublic administration;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) paucity of indigenous natural resources\r\n\r\nwhich  necessitates  exports  of  manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) aggressive importation of foreign know-how and its adaptation to local conditions;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) frequent cases of the separation of\r\n\r\nimported  know-how  from imported  capital  or\r\n\r\nmanagement participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were like-minded with Mr Okita in emphasising\r\n\r\nthe  development  of export-oriented  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries for countries wishing to attain a  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic  growth. Exceptions would, of  course,  be\r\n\r\ncountries   with  rich  endowments  of   exportable\r\n\r\nnatural resources such as oil and minerals.  Larger\r\n\r\ncountries also can depend more on domestic  markets\r\n\r\nas  compared to smaller countries. For us, however,\r\n\r\nthere  is no choice. It is comforting to know that,\r\n\r\naccording to the examples and results of  the  high\r\n\r\ngrowth  countries I have mentioned, we have roughly\r\n\r\nbeen  charting the right course. All we need do  is\r\n\r\nkeep the Singapore ship steady as she goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are signals of storms ahead. On the\r\n\r\ninternational  horizon the dark clouds  consist  of\r\n\r\ncontinued  inflationary conditions in some  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor  industrial countries, and the threat to  the\r\n\r\nstability  of  the  international  monetary  system\r\n\r\ncaused by pressures on these economies' balance  of\r\n\r\npayments.  The  international climate  may  not  be\r\n\r\nentirely favourable to growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further cloud consists of the uncertainty over\r\n\r\nthe state of the U.S, economy. Because of its size,\r\n\r\nit  exercises  a very powerful influence  upon  the\r\n\r\neconomies  of  the rest of the world. Its  economic\r\n\r\nhealth  and  the measures its Government  takes  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  it  are  therefore of universal  concern.\r\n\r\nJudging  by  the index of Stock Exchange  business,\r\n\r\nwith  its sustained trend over many months  towards\r\n\r\never-increasing share prices, there are encouraging\r\n\r\nsigns  of a healthy recovery of the economy. Policy\r\n\r\nmeasures being adopted to stimulate the economy are\r\n\r\nmuch  more pragmatic and less doctrinaire and ought\r\n\r\nto   have   beneficial   results.   Official   U.S.\r\n\r\neconomists' prediction is of a 9 per cent  rise  in\r\n\r\nGross   National  Product  at  current  prices.   A\r\n\r\nmoderate  recovery  is considered  by  others  more\r\n\r\nlikely,  with  a 3 - 4 per cent real  growth,  with\r\n\r\nlower inflation rates of 4 - 4 1/2 per cent, and  with\r\n\r\nunemployment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfalling   slightly.   Notwithstanding   this\r\n\r\nimprovement,  a  slight  downturn  in  world  trade\r\n\r\nprospects  is  expected, as the U.S, recession  of\r\n\r\nlast  year  would, according to expert opinion,  be\r\n\r\nfelt  in  its delayed effects on world  trade  only\r\n\r\nthis year. GATT forecasts are that world trade will\r\n\r\ngrow between 7 and 11 per cent in value and between\r\n\r\n5  and 7 per cent in volume in 1971. This would not\r\n\r\nbe  unsatisfactory.  But it  will  not  sustain  an\r\n\r\nincrease   in   Singapore's  trade  of   the   same\r\n\r\nproportions as in 1970. Further, a disruption could\r\n\r\nbe  caused  by  measures in the  U.S.  Congress  to\r\n\r\nreintroduce  the legislation, better known  as  the\r\n\r\nMills'  Bill,  which seeks to impose restraints  on\r\n\r\nthe  import of textiles, shoes and other  articles.\r\n\r\nIts  passage  could lead to retaliatory  action  by\r\n\r\nJapan,  the  OECD  (Organisation for  Economic  Co-operation and Development) and other countries  for\r\n\r\nsimilar  restraints  against  U.S, imports,   with\r\n\r\nadverse   consequences  also   upon   world   trade\r\n\r\ngenerally. The restrictive climate could jeopardise\r\n\r\ninternational  co-operation  in  expanding   trade,\r\n\r\ngains  made  by the Kennedy Round cuts, the  scheme\r\n\r\nfor generalised preferences for the manufactures of\r\n\r\nless  developed countries, and the tendency towards\r\n\r\ngreater liberalisation of trade and investments  in\r\n\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home is the accelerated run-down of the\r\n\r\nBritish military bases which is due to commence  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of this month and to be completed  by  the\r\n\r\nend  of the year. British military spending in 1970\r\n\r\nis  put, by preliminary estimates, at $350 million.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this will be lost by the end of\r\n\r\nthe  year. Some 15,000 civilian employees and 2,000\r\n\r\nlocally  enlisted personnel will lose  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nUnemployment  in  such numbers  and  a  decline  in\r\n\r\nnational income of the order of $250 - $300 million\r\n\r\nbetween  1971 and 1972 must affect the economy.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have  more counter recessionary measures,  in\r\n\r\naccelerated  public sector development in  building\r\n\r\nand   construction,  and  further  induced  private\r\n\r\ninvestment  should  cushion  some  of  this  shock.\r\n\r\nAnother  adverse  factor  is  that  entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nearnings  can  be expected to decline further.  Our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  more  and more of the processing of  their  own\r\n\r\ncommodities  and  enter more and more  into  direct\r\n\r\ntrading  relations  with  consumer  countries.   We\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  national  aspirations  and  wish\r\n\r\ntheir  policies  success which is likely  if  their\r\n\r\ndecisions  are  based  on economic  considerations.\r\n\r\nSingapore  can still have a vital role to  play  in\r\n\r\nthe   provision   of   financial,   transportation,\r\n\r\nmarketing and other services. The present depressed\r\n\r\nprices   in   rubber   and   some   other   primary\r\n\r\ncommodities,  aggravated by higher  freight  rates,\r\n\r\nwill  accentuate the decline in our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\nWith   the  withdrawal  of  American  forces   from\r\n\r\nVietnam,  entrepot  trade in  petroleum  and  other\r\n\r\nproducts will also be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the clouds on the horizon are not\r\n\r\nall  dark.  A new international factor, which  will\r\n\r\nhave considerable influence in South-east Asia,  is\r\n\r\nJapan's  rapidly increasing economic strength.  She\r\n\r\nis the largest economic power after the U.S, in the\r\n\r\nnon-Communist world. She is likely to  continue  to\r\n\r\nexpand  at  around eight or more per cent  in  real\r\n\r\nterms  - the Japanese economy would possibly  reach\r\n\r\nthe present level of the United States economy in a\r\n\r\ndecade, according to some American predictions. She\r\n\r\ncan  therefore  become a major determinant  of  the\r\n\r\nrate of economic development of nearby countries in\r\n\r\nAsia and in the Pacific. Japan already represents a\r\n\r\nvery  large  market for the products of  South-east\r\n\r\nAsia, particularly for those in which she will have\r\n\r\nlost  her  competitive  edge  in  labour  intensive\r\n\r\nproduction.  Countries  like  Korea,  Taiwan,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  Singapore and others with lower  wage  costs\r\n\r\nwill   increasingly  take  over  from  Japan.   Her\r\n\r\nintentions in regard to increasing her aid  to  one\r\n\r\nper cent of her Gross National Product by 1975 will\r\n\r\nhave an increasing impact on the prosperity of  the\r\n\r\ncountries she will be assisting with such aid. This\r\n\r\nshould  be  in  the region of US$4,000  million  by\r\n\r\n1975, at one per cent of US$400,000 million in  GNP\r\n\r\ndouble that of her 1970 GNP of US$200,000 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manufacturing, the leading growth sector in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  economy, a record  number  of  very\r\n\r\nlarge    projects   by   well-known   international\r\n\r\ncompanies were announced in 1970 and are now in the\r\n\r\npipeline.  The amount of such commitments  in  1970\r\n\r\nexceeds the total of all foreign investments in the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industry made in Singapore  to  date.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1971, it was estimated that the\r\n\r\nfigure  for  total  foreign direct  investments  in\r\n\r\nfixed assets in manufacturing industries, including\r\n\r\napproved   commitments,  stood  at  nearly   $1,700\r\n\r\nmillion, compared with an actual cumulative  figure\r\n\r\nof $600 million at the beginning of 1970. These new\r\n\r\nprojects will take two to five years to reach  full\r\n\r\nproduction.   However,  both   quantitatively   and\r\n\r\nqualitatively,  in  the  next  few  years  as  they\r\n\r\ncommence   production   and   expand,   they   will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  contribute towards a  continuing  high\r\n\r\nrate   of   growth.  They  will  also  extend   the\r\n\r\ndiversification of our manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing benefits will be derived from the\r\n\r\nprogressive implementation of committed projects in\r\n\r\nthe  pipeline.  Then there are hopeful  signs  that\r\n\r\ncontinued  progress will also be made with  further\r\n\r\nnew  industrial projects. Some of the main  reasons\r\n\r\nfor optimism are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflationary trends in all industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries  will  continue  to  exert  pressure   on\r\n\r\ninternational  companies to readjust  their  global\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  distribution  strategies.  This\r\n\r\nwill   probably   accelerate   the   tendency    to\r\n\r\ndecentralise   and   to  adopt   a   multi-national\r\n\r\napproach,  in which careful calculation of  optimal\r\n\r\ncost   and  distributional  advantage  will  figure\r\n\r\nstrongly.   So   it  is  crucial   that   reputable\r\n\r\ninternational    companies,    especially     those\r\n\r\ninterested in long-term growth, should continue  to\r\n\r\nfind  Singapore an efficient base with  an  overall\r\n\r\ninvestment climate that is hospitable and conducive\r\n\r\ntowards  long-term growth. In particular,  if  they\r\n\r\nfind in Singapore adequate physical infrastructure,\r\n\r\nnecessary  commercial facilities and communications\r\n\r\nservices which are continuously being expanded  and\r\n\r\nmodernised, if they see the growing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  and  diversification  of  our  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries and engineering services, if  they  find\r\n\r\nthat  the high general education level and  quality\r\n\r\nmake   our  workers  readily  trainable  in  modern\r\n\r\nskills, then the bigger international companies, in\r\n\r\nplanning their long-term world-wide strategy,  will\r\n\r\ninvariably  consider  Singapore  one  of  the   key\r\n\r\nlocations.  This  will be particularly  so  if  our\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the  unions  are  educated   to   the\r\n\r\nrealities of our economic life, keen to make  their\r\n\r\ncontribution to the transformation of  our  society\r\n\r\nwith  high Industrialisation and sophistication  in\r\n\r\ntechnology. Already a large and growing  number  of\r\n\r\nsuch  international companies,  having  done  their\r\n\r\nsurveys, have indeed decided that Singapore is  the\r\n\r\nplace   where   they  can  sink   deep   roots   by\r\n\r\nestablishing    projects   in    which    long-term\r\n\r\nconsiderations play a major part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stimulate overall growth, our strategy towards\r\n\r\npromoting this most important sector of the economy\r\n\r\nis   important.  In  response  to  the   increasing\r\n\r\ninterest  of international companies in  investment\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  we  have expanded  the  network  of\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development  Board  offices  overseas  to\r\n\r\nserve such companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get the greatest advantage and to\r\n\r\nmaximise  benefits from these new trends,  however,\r\n\r\nSingapore  must also readjust priorities to  evolve\r\n\r\nwhat may be called an optimum investment policy. In\r\n\r\nthis   connection,  two  aspects,  in   particular,\r\n\r\ndeserve special consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in promoting new industrial projects, it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to be more selective.  Increasingly,\r\n\r\nemphasis will have to be placed on those industries\r\n\r\nwith world-wide markets, with scope for progressive\r\n\r\ngrowth in technological content. We must now select\r\n\r\nindustries  with  greater  capacity  to  contribute\r\n\r\ntowards  the  development of modern skills  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels.  Indeed, we are already restricting certain\r\n\r\ntypes of industry with low technology which are set\r\n\r\nup purely on short-term considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the important question of training. To\r\n\r\nsustain the accelerating pace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  industrial  development, manpower  with  modern\r\n\r\nskills  is  required  not only  to  meet  immediate\r\n\r\ndemands  but  also to create a large  reservoir  of\r\n\r\nskills  at all levels to ensure continuing  growth.\r\n\r\nThis  calls  for a crash programme which  can  meet\r\n\r\nboth short-term and long-term needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At higher levels of skill, for managerial and\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff,  industrial  firms  now  find  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  filling immediate requirements.  As\r\n\r\nopportunities  expand, increasing  numbers  of  our\r\n\r\ngraduates  abroad are now returning.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nwith  the  liberalisation of immigration,  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board centres abroad  find  increasing\r\n\r\nresponse   by   many  professionals,   particularly\r\n\r\nAsians, of all categories of skills who are willing\r\n\r\nnot  only to come and work in Singapore but to take\r\n\r\nroot  here  as their permanent home.  In  the  long\r\n\r\nterm,   of   course,   we  have   to   expand   our\r\n\r\nuniversities,  the Polytechnic, Ngee Ann  Technical\r\n\r\nCollege,  and other institutions of higher learning\r\n\r\nand technical training, which we are now doing, and\r\n\r\nI  shall further elaborate when I deal with the the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for middle level skilled personnel, such as\r\n\r\nforemen,  craftsmen  and workers  with  specialised\r\n\r\nskills,  who  are equally important,  we  have  now\r\n\r\nintroduced   three   measures.   First,   we    are\r\n\r\nimplementing  joint  Industry-Government   training\r\n\r\nprogrammes   in   co-operation  with  international\r\n\r\ncompanies  who  are  starting sizable  projects  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  such programmes, costs  are  shared\r\n\r\nbetween the Government and the sponsoring firm,  on\r\n\r\ncondition  that  it will undertake  to  train  more\r\n\r\nworkers  than  its own requirements,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nsurplus may be released to upgrade the general pool\r\n\r\nof  skills in Singapore. Another condition is  that\r\n\r\nthe training programme and t he standards of skills\r\n\r\nto be achieved are approved by the Government. Such\r\n\r\njoint training programmes are valuable not only  in\r\n\r\nsupplementing the instructors and facilities in the\r\n\r\nregular educational system. Even more, they help to\r\n\r\nensure  a much greater realism and practical  value\r\n\r\nin the content of courses. For the firms concerned,\r\n\r\nsuch programmes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  advantage of  being  much  more\r\n\r\nclosely geared to their specific requirements,  and\r\n\r\nalso ensure them the requisite skilled manpower  at\r\n\r\nreasonable  cost.  Secondly,  we  will  also   give\r\n\r\nsimilar  encouragement and support  to  the  longer\r\n\r\nestablished  firms  in  Singapore  which  have  the\r\n\r\ncapability   and   readiness  to  introduce   joint\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes along the same lines. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nwe are intensifying the programme whereby firms are\r\n\r\nsupported in sending trainees abroad to the  parent\r\n\r\nplants.  Such trainees have already been placed  in\r\n\r\nWest   Germany,   Switzerland,  Japan   and   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Here  again, the  Government  shoulders\r\n\r\npart of the costs, provided the training programmes\r\n\r\nmeet  agreed skill standards and will provide  more\r\n\r\ntrained  workers than the firm's own  requirements.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, the Economic Development Board\r\n\r\nis   directing  its  efforts  towards  placing  the\r\n\r\ntrainees not only in firms which have already  made\r\n\r\ncommitments in manufacturing projects in Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  those firms which have Singapore  in\r\n\r\nmind   as  a  location  for  their  future   global\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme. The response from both these\r\n\r\nkinds of firms is most encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the implementation of these\r\n\r\ncrash    programmes   will   require   considerable\r\n\r\nfinancial  support  from the Government.  For  this\r\n\r\npurpose, I propose to use part of the revenue  from\r\n\r\npayroll  tax.  I shall refer to this again  when  I\r\n\r\ncome to the Revenue Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps more important than financial support,\r\n\r\nthe  success  of all these programmes depends  upon\r\n\r\ncareful  pre-selection of the trainees. Appropriate\r\n\r\ntests  will be given to ensure that they  not  only\r\n\r\nhave  adequate educational standards but also  have\r\n\r\nsuitable  mechanical aptitudes to benefit from  the\r\n\r\nspecific training programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these efforts, we should be able not only to\r\n\r\nmeet  the immediate requirements of existing  firms\r\n\r\nbut,  more  important, in the  next  two  to  three\r\n\r\nyears,  they  would provide the necessary  pool  of\r\n\r\nskilled manpower by which we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nderive the maximum benefits from the more demanding\r\n\r\noperations  that are being set up, and also  ensure\r\n\r\ncontinuing  success  in the  promotion  of  further\r\n\r\nprojects      of      progressively      increasing\r\n\r\nsophistication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any assessment of our future prospects must give\r\n\r\ndue  weight  to  developments of our  other  growth\r\n\r\nsector -tourism. By the end of this decade, tourist\r\n\r\nand  passenger  traffic at Paya Lebar International\r\n\r\nAirport will have doubled itself twice in the  ten-year period. Investments for further development of\r\n\r\nthe Airport are necessary and have been authorised.\r\n\r\nWith  the  advent of the airbus and other types  of\r\n\r\nlarger  and  faster  passenger  aircraft,  new  and\r\n\r\nsophisticated  air  control and  air  communication\r\n\r\nfacilities  will  be  required.  Work  has  already\r\n\r\ncommenced  on  improvements  to  the  present   air\r\n\r\nterminal   building.  The  first  stages   of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and extension of the  runway  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  implemented. External sources of funds  have\r\n\r\nbeen sought from the Asian Development Bank to help\r\n\r\nin this development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tourists arrive, a good proportion I\r\n\r\nhope  by M.S.A, planes, they will want to know what\r\n\r\nthere  is  to  see  in Singapore. The  considerable\r\n\r\nattractions  of our shops, hotels and  restaurants,\r\n\r\nour  garden  city  atmosphere and  our  interesting\r\n\r\nmixture  of races with their different customs  and\r\n\r\nexotic cuisines, will delight many tourists, but we\r\n\r\nmust  cater for all other tastes as well.  We  have\r\n\r\nalready  in operation the Bird Park in Jurong,  but\r\n\r\nwe should shortly have Chinese and Japanese gardens\r\n\r\nalso  in Jurong, a zoo in Seletar, a Marineland  or\r\n\r\nAquarama in Bedok, and cable cars from Mount  Faber\r\n\r\nto Sentosa, where other facilities for tourists are\r\n\r\nbeing planned. A team of international consultants,\r\n\r\nMessrs.   Dillingham  Overseas   Corporation,   was\r\n\r\nappointed to study the development of Sentosa  into\r\n\r\na  tourist centre. Their report, which recommends a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and far-reaching plan for public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  investment  in the island,  is  now  under\r\n\r\nstudy. Two projects recommended by them, an 18-hole\r\n\r\nGolf Course and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwimming-Boating    Lagoon,    are    now     under\r\n\r\nconstruction. The total investment involved  is  in\r\n\r\nthe region of $300 million to $400 million. Because\r\n\r\nof  the major part the Government will have to play\r\n\r\nin initiating the plan, the details have to be very\r\n\r\nfully  examined  and assessed. On  the  whole,  the\r\n\r\nreport  is optimistic that Sentosa can be developed\r\n\r\ninto  an  attractive and profitable tourist  centre\r\n\r\nwith   consequent  benefits  to  the   economy   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly foreign exchange  to  help\r\n\r\neven out the deficit in our trade balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these facilities and with the number of\r\n\r\nhotels  already in operation and in the last stages\r\n\r\nof  completion, we are in an excellent position  to\r\n\r\ntake  advantage  of the growth in tourist  traffic.\r\n\r\nBut  if  the  progress  is  to  continue,  tourists\r\n\r\narriving  at  the  Airport,  the  harbour  and   at\r\n\r\nWoodlands  must meet with nothing but courtesy  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.  They must be treated by  taxi-drivers,\r\n\r\nhotel receptionists, porters and workers in hotels,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and  shops in a friendly,  polite  and\r\n\r\nefficient  manner and the standard  of  cleanliness\r\n\r\nmust  be  high.  The  cuisine  must  be  excellent,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the exotic Asian dishes. Efforts by\r\n\r\nour Tourist Promotion Board for the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthese   standards  and  for  other  promotion   are\r\n\r\ncontinuing,   including  increasing   our   tourist\r\n\r\nattractions with historical sites, which have  been\r\n\r\ngiven  some publicity in the press recently. But  a\r\n\r\nmore direct and more business-like effort would  be\r\n\r\nthat  which  is  being  seriously  considered,   of\r\n\r\ndeveloping    Singapore   into   a    centre    for\r\n\r\ninternational    conventions    and    conferences.\r\n\r\nSingapore is ideally situated for this purpose, and\r\n\r\nthe   availability   of  first-class   hotels   and\r\n\r\nconvention  facilities and an efficient network  of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  are added advantages.  We  have\r\n\r\nthe    necessary   experience   to   organise   big\r\n\r\ninternational   conferences  like  the   E.C.A.F.E.\r\n\r\nPlenary Session in 1969 and the Commonwealth  Heads\r\n\r\nof   State   Conference  in  January   this   year.\r\n\r\nPreparation  for the Annual Meeting  of  the  Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank in April this year is  now  under\r\n\r\nway. What is now needed is an intensive and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsustained  international promotion  drive  and  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a convention servicing unit to handle\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our tourist industry develops as we hope, it\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  at  the expense of our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.  I mentioned earlier in my  speech  that\r\n\r\nExpo  `70  had  indirectly  increased  our  tourist\r\n\r\ninflow  in 1970. Similarly, any increase in tourist\r\n\r\ntraffic  to one country in the region can  only  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial to others in that region. The full scope\r\n\r\nfor  regional co-operation in promotion of  tourism\r\n\r\nis  being  studied  by A.S.E.A.N.  (Association  of\r\n\r\nSouth-east  Asian Nations). Immediate  arrangements\r\n\r\ncan,  however,  be made to organise  more  regional\r\n\r\ntours   on   a  package  basis  and  I   hope   our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs in the tourist industry will get down\r\n\r\nto doing this in a big way with other entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nin other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to summarise this part of my budget statement, all-out efforts will be made domestically to achieve once again the high growth rate of the preceding years, with emphasis on developments in the sectors of trade, manufacturing and tourism. Our success or failure will depend on\r\n\r\nour efforts, although external factors, outside our\r\n\r\ncontrol,  particularly in their  effects  upon  the\r\n\r\ntrade  sector,  can  upset  our  best  plans.   Our\r\n\r\neconomic  strategy for further diversification,  of\r\n\r\nmarkets  as well as of industrial products, should\r\n\r\nhelp  to  reduce our vulnerability to such  adverse\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, 1971-72</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the essential, if more mundane part\r\n\r\nof  today's business, the Estimates of Revenue  and\r\n\r\nExpenditure for the financial year 1971-72, The two\r\n\r\nMemoranda*  which\r\n\r\nMembers already have, one  on  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary Estimates and the other on the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, give the reasons for the major  changes\r\n\r\nin the provision and allocation of funds as well as\r\n\r\nthe forecasts on the basis of existing taxation  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  yields  in the next financial  year.  They\r\n\r\nalso contain information on revenue and expenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*Papers Parl.

As   detailed\r\n\r\nexplanations  in these documents are  available  to\r\n\r\nMembers,  I  do  not propose `to  go  into  a  very\r\n\r\ndetailed  commentary on the Estimates. I need  only\r\n\r\nset  out  the  policy framework  within  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has drawn up the budget for 1971-72  and\r\n\r\nhighlight some of the noteworthy items in both  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary and Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Estimates of Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision proposed for 1971-72 is\r\n\r\n$1,306.8  million which is 25.5 per cent more  than\r\n\r\nthe  1970-71 provision but 28.1 per cent higher  if\r\n\r\ncompared  with  actual  expenditure  in  1970.  The\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  1970 was in  turn  35.1  per  cent\r\n\r\nhigher than `that in\r\n\r\n1969.   Therefore,  the  increased  provision   for\r\n\r\n1971-72 is not exceptionally high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the policies adopted this year are the\r\n\r\nsame  as  those which determined `the last  budget.\r\n\r\nThe building-up of our defence capability maintains\r\n\r\ntopmost priority. However, there is a limit to what\r\n\r\nwe  can  afford even in the initial years of  rapid\r\n\r\nbuild-up  from zero capability. It is desirable  to\r\n\r\npeg the provision for defence needs to no more than\r\n\r\n10  per  cent  of our Gross Domestic  Product.  The\r\n\r\nprovisional estimate of Gross Domestic  Product  at\r\n\r\nFactor  Cost  for  1970  is $5,564  million.  Total\r\n\r\nprovision for defence purposes in the Ordinary  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates is $530.0 million  which  is\r\n\r\n9.5  per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.  This,\r\n\r\nhowever,  does not take into account  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  available  to  the  Ministry  of   Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  which  definitely  are  complementary   to\r\n\r\ndefence needs but are not readily apportionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other provisions in the Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates, as in the last few years, care continues\r\n\r\nto  be  exercised  over the expenditure  on  social\r\n\r\nservices. The provision for this group of  services\r\n\r\nis  increased by 7.6 per cent. For 1971-72,  health\r\n\r\nservices are allowed the highest increase  at  12.0\r\n\r\nper  cent. Even this figure is understated in  that\r\n\r\nthe provisions for the new Alexandra and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSembawang Hospitals are meant for eight and nine\r\n\r\nmonths  respectively. Expenditure on  education  is\r\n\r\nincreased by 9.8 per cent. The health and education\r\n\r\nservices  together take up 84.2  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal provision for social services as against 82.0\r\n\r\nper cent in 1970-71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consonance with our economic growth policy,\r\n\r\nadequate  provision has been made for all  economic\r\n\r\nservices  as  these help not only to  maintain  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  increase the momentum of growth. Next  to\r\n\r\ndefence and internal security, economic services as\r\n\r\na group have been allowed the most rapid expansion.\r\n\r\nThe total provision for this group for 1971- 72  is\r\n\r\n20.5    per   cent   higher   than   for   1970-71.\r\n\r\nTransportation  and communications claim  41.1  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the provision as against 38.4 per cent  in 1970-71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory expenditure is 11.6 per cent more than\r\n\r\nin  1970-71, mainly because of additional  interest\r\n\r\npayments and contributions to sinking funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the major changes in the provisions under\r\n\r\neach  Ministry. The Prime Minister's Ministry needs\r\n\r\na   smaller  provision  because  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  Public Health Division  will  take\r\n\r\nover  the maintenance of public health in the areas\r\n\r\ntaken  over  from  the  British  authorities.  This\r\n\r\ndecrease  is partly offset by additional provisions\r\n\r\nrequired  for the new Anti-Pollution Unit which  is\r\n\r\nnow   properly  established  and  geared  to  begin\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology requires\r\n\r\nmore funds mainly because\r\n\r\nof  the promotional activities to be undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe newly-appointed Metrication Board. Actually the\r\n\r\nprovision  in  respect of this Ministry  is  higher\r\n\r\nthan  is apparent because the contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nScience  Centre Board which, prior to the formation\r\n\r\nof  the Board, took the form of \"Staff and expenses\r\n\r\nof  the Popular Science Centre\", is now shown under\r\n\r\nthe Contributions and Charitable Allowances Head of\r\n\r\nExpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Defence is now shown as a separate\r\n\r\nHead  of  Expenditure in the 1971-72 Estimates  and\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  are  not readily  comparable  with\r\n\r\nthose shown under the former Ministry of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterior  and  Defence Head of Expenditure.  Whilst\r\n\r\nthe  Armed Forces will continue to be built up, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  be  concentrating  increasingly  on\r\n\r\nconsolidation. Three of the Deputy Secretary  posts\r\n\r\nare upgraded and two new units are established. One\r\n\r\nof  these is the Direction of Employment Department\r\n\r\nestablished to enforce provisions of the  Direction\r\n\r\nof  Employment Ordinance. However, because  of  the\r\n\r\nrapidly    expanding   employment    opportunities,\r\n\r\napplications from employers for exemption from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this Ordinance are freely  granted.\r\n\r\nThe other is the Science and Management Group which\r\n\r\nwill provide the technical and managerial expertise\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry for dealing with such problems  as\r\n\r\nevaluation  of  weapons systems, implementation  of\r\n\r\ncontracts, etc. In view of the very large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney which are being spent on defence, any greater\r\n\r\nscientific  or economic precision on evaluation  of\r\n\r\nmilitary   expenditures  should  result   in   very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  savings. Also, a number  of  civilian\r\n\r\nposts  at artisan, craftsman and technician  levels\r\n\r\nare   provided   to   give  the  Ministry   greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in recruiting supporting staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block provision for \"Armed Forces\" is $354\r\n\r\nmillion as compared with $208 million in 1970-71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a decrease of $171,940 in the overall\r\n\r\nprovision for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This\r\n\r\nis  largely  achieved through closer estimation  of\r\n\r\nthe  resources likely to be needed by the Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe  creation  of  32 new posts  for  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nheadquarters   and   Overseas   Missions,    annual\r\n\r\nincrement   of  salaries  and  increases   in   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  Overseas  and Children's  Allowances\r\n\r\nrequire  an  additional  half  a  million  dollars.\r\n\r\nHowever,  a  more  realistic  estimation  of  funds\r\n\r\nrequired based on past expenditure on Special Make-up  Allowances,  emoluments of officers  on  leave,\r\n\r\netc., passage and miscellaneous expenses result  in\r\n\r\na net decrease in the total provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in overall provision under the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour of 3.5 per cent should be viewed\r\n\r\nin the light that expenditure on the Hotel Training\r\n\r\nSchool now comes within the purview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the  Technical  Education  Department  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education. The main  factor  for  the\r\n\r\nincrease in the overall provision for this Ministry\r\n\r\nis the strengthening of the Factory Inspectorate to\r\n\r\ncurb the rise in industrial accidents. Thirty posts\r\n\r\nhad  to  be created urgently under an Establishment\r\n\r\nWarrant in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As may be expected in view of its importance to\r\n\r\neconomic     development,    the    Ministry     of\r\n\r\nCommunications is given a significant  increase  in\r\n\r\nprovision.  The Ministry headquarters is  given  12\r\n\r\nnew   posts,  mainly  in  the  Administrative   and\r\n\r\nExecutive  grades,  so that the  Ministry  can  co-ordinate  as  well  as  guide  its  ever  expanding\r\n\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Department has not only to\r\n\r\nexpand and improve facilities at Paya Lebar Airport\r\n\r\nbut  also  to manage Seletar Aerodrome. It  has  to\r\n\r\nprepare for the taking over of Changi Aerodrome and\r\n\r\nprovide fire-fighting services at Tengah Aerodrome.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is necessary to train Aircraft\r\n\r\nSurveyors as aircraft registration work will be  of\r\n\r\nincreasing importance in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Department has also experienced a\r\n\r\ntremendous increase in workload over the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears.   This   department  requires  more   postal\r\n\r\nClerical Assistants and postmen to maintain a  high\r\n\r\nstandard  of  service. For 1971-72, a total  of  98\r\n\r\nadditional posts will be available. Funds  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  provided  for  the department to  progressively\r\n\r\nclear   accumulated  liabilities  in   respect   of\r\n\r\ntransport and freight of postal articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Telecommunications Department will be making\r\n\r\npreparations to become a corporation by April 1972.\r\n\r\nDuring  1971-72,  the department  needs  additional\r\n\r\nadministrative staff to ensure that the  transition\r\n\r\nwill  be smooth. At the same time, additional staff\r\n\r\nare   required   in   the  development,   planning,\r\n\r\nengineering, maintenance and operation sections, so\r\n\r\nthat  even as the department is undergoing a  major\r\n\r\nreorganisation, it will be able to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nrapidly increasing work-load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Vehicles will also have a heavy\r\n\r\nprogramme in reorganising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  road transportation system. The Registry  will\r\n\r\nmainly  depend on the new Enforcement Unit and  the\r\n\r\nstrengthened  Investigation Unit to carry  out  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education gets an increase of 9.8\r\n\r\nper  cent  in  total provision. Over the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears,  there  has  been  a major  reallocation  of\r\n\r\nresources from general to technical education. This\r\n\r\nwill  continue  in 1971 - 72 although  we  are  now\r\n\r\napproaching   the   limits   within   which    such\r\n\r\nreallocation may be made. For 1971 - 72,  a  number\r\n\r\nof  not  insignificant adjustments are made to  the\r\n\r\nteacher  posts. The main objective is to  cut  down\r\n\r\nthe  number  of non-graduate teachers and  increase\r\n\r\nthe number of graduate teachers in order to step up\r\n\r\nthe  general  standard  of  teaching  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools. A sizable number of supernumerary posts is\r\n\r\nalso   provided  and  these  will  be  reduced   as\r\n\r\nvacancies  arise so that the number of non-graduate\r\n\r\nteachers  bears  a  closer  relationship   to   the\r\n\r\nenrolment   in  the  primary  and  lower  secondary\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase given to the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nis  not  entirely for schools. Grants  to  the  two\r\n\r\nUniversities, the Singapore Polytechnic,  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege  and  aided  schools account  for  about  a\r\n\r\nquarter of the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is given additional posts\r\n\r\nfor  the National and Queenstown Libraries and  the\r\n\r\nnew Anti-Smoking Advertisement Unit. The Government\r\n\r\nPrinting  Office  will increasingly  operate  as  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  organisation and eight  new  posts  are\r\n\r\ngiven for this. The Government Printing Office  has\r\n\r\nbeen   very   successful  in  securing  jobs   from\r\n\r\nstatutory   bodies   and   commercial   firms   and\r\n\r\nconsequently  it  is given a larger  provision  for\r\n\r\nprinting supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Social Affairs, the amounts\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Social  Welfare  Department  for\r\n\r\npublic   assistance   and  Tuberculosis   treatment\r\n\r\nallowances  in  1971  -  72 are  expected  to  drop\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  trend in recent  years.  Also,  the\r\n\r\nSports Division and Stadiums and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPools  Division  of  the Ministry  have  ceased  to\r\n\r\nfunction with the formation of the National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board. The Prisons Department,  however,\r\n\r\nrequires  more funds but these are mainly  for  the\r\n\r\nPrisons  Industries and for bread-making at  Changi\r\n\r\nPrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development gets\r\n\r\na  fairly big increase of 18.6 per cent mainly  for\r\n\r\nthe  National Development Division and  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department.  Under the National  Development\r\n\r\nDivision,  $1.6  million is for the  administration\r\n\r\nexpenses of the Urban Renewal Department for  which\r\n\r\nprovision   was   made,  it  is   considered   less\r\n\r\nappropriately,  in  the  Development  Estimates  in\r\n\r\nprevious  years.  The Public Works Department  will\r\n\r\ntake  over  responsibility for the  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  installations handed  over  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by the British authorities. It has taken\r\n\r\nover  the  maintenance of all roads in  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation's estates, the Toa Payoh New Town\r\n\r\nand  some  new  private housing  estates.  It  will\r\n\r\nmaintain  catchment  drains and  canals  previously\r\n\r\nlooked after by the Ministry of Health. Its own new\r\n\r\nsewerage pumping stations and treatment works  will\r\n\r\nbe  coming into operation. For these and other  new\r\n\r\nactivities,  the  department  requires   additional\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is also given a\r\n\r\nsubstantial increase. Part of the increase  is  due\r\n\r\nto  the  impending  takeover of the  Alexandra  and\r\n\r\nSembawang  Hospitals  from  the  British.  However,\r\n\r\nexisting  hospitals are given a total  of  445  new\r\n\r\nposts  and larger provisions for equipment so  that\r\n\r\npatients  will get a higher standard  of  treatment\r\n\r\nand  doctors  will  be able to  work  under  better\r\n\r\nconditions. For the Public Health Division, 157 new\r\n\r\nposts  are provided, with the largest single  share\r\n\r\nfor  the  School Health Branch. This Division  also\r\n\r\nrequires additional funds to pay for public utility\r\n\r\nservices  and to extend public cleansing and  anti-mosquito  measures to areas which  will  be  handed\r\n\r\nover to the Government by the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has an increase in\r\n\r\nprovision of $39.7 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering, however, that the allocation  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  alone  has  increased  by   $40\r\n\r\nmillion,  there  is a net decrease  in  the  other\r\n\r\nprovisions  under this Ministry. This  is  largely\r\n\r\ndue to the fact that a number of units such as the\r\n\r\nOverseas Investment Section, Banking Control  Unit\r\n\r\nand the Office of the Commissioner of Banking have\r\n\r\nbeen  transferred  to  the Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These  are  to  some  extent  counter-balanced  by  new  posts  for  engineers   to   be\r\n\r\nrecruited  from  abroad for  assignment  to  other\r\n\r\nMinistries,  posts for the new Career  Development\r\n\r\nand Training Section and other posts to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe Organisation and Methods Branch as well as the\r\n\r\nCentral  Supplies  Unit.  A  smaller  subsidy   is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  required  by  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board but this decrease is  more  than\r\n\r\noffset  by  a  new  subsidy for  the  building  of\r\n\r\nstandard cargo vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departments under this Ministry which are\r\n\r\ngiven  substantial  increases  in  staff  are  the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue and Customs Departments. The Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue Department has a net increase of 41  posts\r\n\r\nto   enable  it  to  reorganise  its  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDivision.  The  Customs Department  gets  116  new\r\n\r\nposts to man new points such as the Naval Base and\r\n\r\nSeletar  Aerodrome, new units  such  as  the  Cess\r\n\r\nCollection Unit and the Motor Assembly Plant Base,\r\n\r\nand  to reinforce the personnel at the Central Sea\r\n\r\nStores  Warehouse, the Dutiable  Parcels  Section,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Ministry of Home Affairs is given\r\n\r\nadequate funds to pay for 329 new posts which  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  support the reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice.  Additionally, $875,000  is  provided  for\r\n\r\nradio  patrol  cars, stand-by engines  for  Marine\r\n\r\nPolice  launches, uniforms and training  equipment\r\n\r\nfor Police Cadet Corps in schools. The Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment   gets  67  new  posts   to   man   new\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  as  well as to cover existing  check-points more adequately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes a quick survey of the Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates.  I  will now deal with the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates for 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hon, would you like me to\r\n\r\nsuspend  the  sitting now, because your  voice  is\r\n\r\ngetting soft?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Yes, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The total proposals submitted  were  for\r\n\r\n$849.85  million. It has been possible to allocate\r\n\r\nto  the  social  sector 39.5 per cent,  or  $61.74\r\n\r\nmillion,  of  their requests, while  the  economic\r\n\r\nsector has been allocated 68.3 per cent or $114.06\r\n\r\nmillion.  Defence and Administration,  because  of\r\n\r\nover-riding considerations, receive 93.92 per cent\r\n\r\napproval,  or $111.61 million requirements.  Loans\r\n\r\nto  statutory  bodies  and  companies  will  total\r\n\r\n$348.55  million,  after  reduction  from  $407.55\r\n\r\nmillion.  Tables  IX, IXA and  IXB  show  how  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates provision of $635.9  million\r\n\r\nis distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, a large part of the expenditure\r\n\r\non Government development projects is allocated to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Law and National Development. Out\r\n\r\nof the total budgetted provision of $287.5 million\r\n\r\nfor  Government, this Ministry will receive  $96.4\r\n\r\nmillion  most  of  which will  be  for  the  major\r\n\r\nschemes  of land reclamation administered  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  at the East Coast Reclamation. Phases  I\r\n\r\nand  II  of this scheme, totalling 1,125 acres  of\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land,  are almost completed.  Two  more\r\n\r\nphases will be carried out in 1971 - 72. Phase III\r\n\r\nwill  provide  165 acres of land  fronting  Nicoll\r\n\r\nHighway, and Phase IV will provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  1,025 acres of land stretching from  Bedok\r\n\r\nto  Tanah  Merah Besar. The two phases are expected\r\n\r\nto  cost  a  total of $67.8 million of which  $16.8\r\n\r\nmillion is required in 1971 - 72. At Kallang Basin,\r\n\r\nreclamation  will continue. A total  of  400  acres\r\n\r\nhave  so  far  been reclaimed and in 1971  -  72  a\r\n\r\nfurther  92 acres will be reclaimed, A sum of  $2.1\r\n\r\nmillion   is   needed   for   such   works.   These\r\n\r\nreclamations  will  enable us to  redevelop  a  sea\r\n\r\nfront which gives maximum use by the people of  the\r\n\r\nsea and maintains the highest aesthetic skyline for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  avoiding the mistakes of  past  private\r\n\r\nand public developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very worthy project is that of urban\r\n\r\nrenewal which has been gathering momentum over  the\r\n\r\npast  year,  and for which $13.1 million  has  been\r\n\r\nprovided.  Redevelopment  of  the  Crawford,  Sepoy\r\n\r\nLines   and   Havelock  constituencies  is   almost\r\n\r\ncompleted  and  attention has now  moved  to  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  the Central Area.

In the Estimates  of\r\n\r\nRevenue for the next financial year, total receipts\r\n\r\nare   expected   to  be  $1,307.2  million,   which\r\n\r\nrepresents  an increase of 10.6 per cent  over  the\r\n\r\nactual  receipts  for  1970. All  the  increase  is\r\n\r\nexpected from the normal growth without any changes\r\n\r\nin  existing taxes or the imposition of new  taxes.\r\n\r\nWhile all the major sources of revenue are expected\r\n\r\nto  perform  better,  it is  anticipated  that  the\r\n\r\nannual  increase may not be as buoyant  as  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years in view of an expected slowing down\r\n\r\nof  world  trade  and the massive run-down  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish Armed Forces in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Direct Taxes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four direct taxes, namely income tax,\r\n\r\nproperty  tax,  payroll tax  and  estate  duty  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to yield $430.8 million, which represents\r\n\r\n32.9  per  cent of the total revenue estimates  for\r\n\r\nthe next financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax, which forms a little over done-fifth\r\n\r\nof  the  total revenue, is expected to  yield  $280\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  is $28.5 million  higher  than  the\r\n\r\nprevious  year. As the income tax is based  on  the\r\n\r\nprevious  year's income, and 1970 has been  a  good\r\n\r\nyear for the manufacturing, building and commercial\r\n\r\nsectors,  the  growth of revenue from  this  source\r\n\r\nwill be maintained. The administrative capacity  of\r\n\r\nthe  Inland  Revenue Department has  been  improved\r\n\r\nwith  recruitments  during the past  year  and  the\r\n\r\noperations  of  the Anti-Evasion  Unit  during  the\r\n\r\ncourse of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue from property tax is expected to\r\n\r\nincrease   by  $16.6  million  to  $124.8  million,\r\n\r\nreflecting  the  rapid  ,growth  of  the   building\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate for payroll tax is $17\r\n\r\nmillion.  Here  I have news which employers  should\r\n\r\nwelcome.  The proceeds of the payroll tax  will  be\r\n\r\nused  to  lighten  the burden of employers  in  two\r\n\r\nareas.  Firstly,  the  proceeds  will  be  used  to\r\n\r\ncompensate  employers for the  \"make-up\"  pay  when\r\n\r\nnational servicemen are called up for their  annual\r\n\r\ntraining exercises with the Singapore Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nand  they  do  not  work  in  their  factories  and\r\n\r\noffices.   Secondly,  it  is  proposed   to   allow\r\n\r\nreimbursements  to  industrialists   for   approved\r\n\r\ntraining  or apprenticeship schemes in  skills,  of\r\n\r\nwhich there is a critical shortage in the Republic.\r\n\r\nDetails of the approved schemes will be worked  out\r\n\r\nby  the Economic Development Board and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Indirect Taxes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate from indirect taxes is\r\n\r\n$385.2  million, which represents 29.5 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  total estimated revenue for the next financial\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport sector is expected to yield $16\r\n\r\nmillion  more  next  year than the  previous  year,\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  $2.8 million from  road  tax,  $3.9\r\n\r\nmillion  from special tax on diesel vehicles,  $2.9\r\n\r\nmillion  from  ad  valorem  registration  fees,  $3\r\n\r\nmillion from petrol, $2.5 million from import duty,\r\n\r\nand  $0.9  million from passenger vehicles  seating\r\n\r\nfees. The other increases are expected from tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non Public Utilities Board bills ($2.4 million), tax\r\n\r\non  Singapore Telephone Board bills ($0.9  million)\r\n\r\nand Customs duty on sugar ($1.3 million).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates show a decline in the revenue from\r\n\r\nCustoms  duty on liquors and tobacco,  two  of  the\r\n\r\noldest  sources of revenue. In the case of liquors,\r\n\r\nthe  expected  decline is due to the  large  stocks\r\n\r\nbeing  available arising from speculative  releases\r\n\r\nin  the first quarter and the last quarter of 1970.\r\n\r\nIf  the  ban  on  advertisements of cigarettes  and\r\n\r\nsmoking of cigarettes in designated places has  the\r\n\r\nexpected salutary effects, the revenue from Customs\r\n\r\nduty on tobacco will decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Sources</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of goods and services by Government\r\n\r\ndepartments   will   yield  $10.1   million   more,\r\n\r\nconsisting    of    $5.4    million    from     the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department,  $1.9  million  from\r\n\r\nthe  Postal Department and $2.8 million from  other\r\n\r\ndepartments.   Regulatory  charges  (administrative\r\n\r\nfees)  are  expected to yield $19.1  million  more;\r\n\r\ninterests and dividends are expected to yield  $9.9\r\n\r\nmillion  more; stamp duty is expected to  yield  $4\r\n\r\nmillion more than last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates show a decline in the revenue from\r\n\r\nland  sales and premium by $15.4 million  and  $8.2\r\n\r\nmillion from Japanese Special Aid as compared  with\r\n\r\nthe previous year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On existing taxation, therefore, the revenue\r\n\r\nyield  from  all  these sources  will  be  $1,307.2\r\n\r\nmillion.  Since we have planned for an  expenditure\r\n\r\nof  $1,306.8 million on current account, there will\r\n\r\nbe  a  small  surplus of $0.4 million,  even  after\r\n\r\ntaking  into  consideration a contribution  of  $80\r\n\r\nmillion to the Development Fund for expenditure  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates for the financial year\r\n\r\n1971  - 72 provide for a total expenditure of  $636\r\n\r\nmillion,   which,  as  Table  VIII  indicates,   is\r\n\r\nexpected to be financed largely from domestic loans\r\n\r\namounting  to  $250 million. This  is  expected  as\r\n\r\nusual to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  mainly from the Central Provident  Fund.  The\r\n\r\nappropriation   from   current   revenue    already\r\n\r\nmentioned   of   $80  million  and   debt   service\r\n\r\nrepayments  of  $115  million  added  to  the  $250\r\n\r\nmillion  loan  will  together total  $445  million,\r\n\r\nleaving a balance of $191 million. Part of this can\r\n\r\ncome   from  external  loans,  interest  and  other\r\n\r\nreceipts  totalling  some  $91  million.   If   all\r\n\r\ndisbursements take up the full provisions, which is\r\n\r\nunlikely,  the overall deficit will be  about  $100\r\n\r\nmillion. This can be financed, if necessary, by new\r\n\r\ntaxation  or  borrowing  or  by  running  down  the\r\n\r\nbalances  in  the  Development  Fund  which  it  is\r\n\r\nestimated will stand at about $500 million  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the financial year 1971-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which now remains to be considered\r\n\r\nis  whether, on current needs both for ordinary and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditures, new taxation  or  higher\r\n\r\nrates  on existing taxation should be imposed.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  of  promoting  fast  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment has paid off. Existing tax yields  have\r\n\r\nincreased  so  that  they have been  sufficient  in\r\n\r\nrecent   years  to  meet  the  needs  for  ordinary\r\n\r\nexpenditures. A modest contribution to  development\r\n\r\nexpenditures has also been possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure requests, however, have\r\n\r\nbeen increasing in size from year to year. Some  of\r\n\r\nthe needs in the coming years for projects like the\r\n\r\nMass  Rapid Transit System or for renewal of  urban\r\n\r\nareas will be for sums beyond anything we have been\r\n\r\naccustomed   so  far  to  consider.  The   balances\r\n\r\nremaining  in the Development Fund and the  present\r\n\r\nsources   for   replenishing  these  balances   are\r\n\r\nunlikely to be sufficient to meet all these  future\r\n\r\nneeds.  Some  of  the  development  projects   are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  self-financing or can assist in producing\r\n\r\nbetter economic returns on other projects. For such\r\n\r\nprojects, borrowing would be appropriate and public\r\n\r\nauthorities  or companies concerned could  probably\r\n\r\ntap  additional sources of funds such as suppliers'\r\n\r\ncredits or borrowing in international\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarkets. The Government itself can  borrow\r\n\r\nmore externally. Singapore's public debt at present\r\n\r\nstands at only $1,168 million and sinking funds are\r\n\r\navailable to offset these by some $438 million. Our\r\n\r\ndebt  servicing  charges at $181 million  represent\r\n\r\nonly  13.7  per  cent of our total ordinary  budget\r\n\r\nappropriation,  or  3.7  per  cent  of  our   Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic   Product.  Our  credit   worthiness   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, high. When opportunity occurs,  it  will\r\n\r\nbe   our   intention   to  float   loans   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational money markets. New taxation or higher\r\n\r\nrates on existing taxes appear to be unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1971, therefore, unless tax yields fall very\r\n\r\nconsiderably below our expectations or sudden large\r\n\r\ncalls  for contingency financing are made,  no  new\r\n\r\nmeasures are being proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, add that from time to time over\r\n\r\nthe  year,  it  may  still be necessary  to  remove\r\n\r\nanomalies  in taxation, improve tax procedures  or,\r\n\r\nwhere   a  case  is  clearly  established,   accord\r\n\r\nprotection in the earlier stages of industry  being\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament\r\n\r\napproves the financial policy of the Government for\r\n\r\nthe  financial year 1st April, 1971 to 31st  March,\r\n\r\n1972.\" In accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing\r\n\r\nOrder No. 84, the debate now stands adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hon, debate to be resumed what day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> On 17th March, 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to the 16th day\r\n\r\nof March, 1971.\"-[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty minutes to Six o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">16th March, 1971.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1971/19710308/19710308-HA-0300593.pdf\"\">Appendix to Annual Budget Statement (Col.549) (Col 593-634) </a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
