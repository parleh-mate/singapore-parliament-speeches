At present, people\r\n\r\nwho  are  staying on private land, if they have to remove  or  to\r\n\r\nrebuild their houses, are still faced with difficulties. Also  it\r\n\r\ntakes  a  long  time for their applications to be considered  and\r\n\r\napproved  in  order  to  rebuild their houses.  According  to  my\r\n\r\ninformation,  there  are certain people whose  applications  have\r\n\r\ntaken  six  months  before  they have been  looked  into  by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned, thus causing them great inconvenience. Perhaps,  this  delay  has  something to do  with  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the authorities and the applicants. Perhaps it also  has\r\n\r\nsomething to do with the landowners concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Assembly sitting, the Prime Minister, in answer to\r\n\r\nmy  question,  said that the Government cannot  allow  people  to\r\n\r\nbuild chicken runs or pig sties on any piece of ground they like,\r\n\r\nso  as  to  extend their structures; because when the  Government\r\n\r\nwants  them to remove, it will then have to pay more compensation\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the same principle is applied to applicants who\r\n\r\nwant  to extend their houses. In the case of occupiers of  houses\r\n\r\nwho  are  on good terms with the landlord and who have  paid  him\r\n\r\nsome  tea  money, they will usually get his permission to  extend\r\n\r\ntheir   houses.  But  the  situation  is  different  with   other\r\n\r\noccupiers. When the landlord refuses their applications, they are\r\n\r\nfaced with great inconvenience and difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just mentioned that there are certain people who have\r\n\r\nwanted  to  apply  for an extension of their  houses,  but  their\r\n\r\nlandlord  has  asked them to apply to the Building Survey  Department  and  the Department has asked the applicants  to  submit  a\r\n\r\ndetailed plan. In certain cases the applications have taken about\r\n\r\nsix months to be considered and approved. I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether it is a good thing for the authorities concerned\r\n\r\nto delay the approval of such applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the alteration of houses. Normally houses have\r\n\r\nthe  kitchen separated from the hall and the bedrooms.  When  the\r\n\r\noccupiers ask for approval to separate the kitchen from the hall,\r\n\r\nthey have to seek the approval of the landlord concerned. Without\r\n\r\ntheir   approval,  the  applicants  cannot  even  apply  to   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned  to  have such  alteration  to  the  house\r\n\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, about removal from one place to another within the same\r\n\r\nmukim  - not more than 10 feet - the purpose of which is  normally\r\n\r\nto improve the situation of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such improvements or alterations to the building structure have\r\n\r\nalso to be approved by the landlord.

The  Member's  difficulty,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  him, is that he feels that landlords  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nhinder  applicants in their requests for permission to repair  or\r\n\r\nenlarge  the house. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we all  agree  that\r\n\r\nownership  of  land in Singapore confers upon the  owner  certain\r\n\r\nrights.  Therefore,  whether the owner is willing  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ntenant to extend or repair the house is a matter between him  and\r\n\r\nthe tenant. It is something which the Government cannot force the\r\n\r\nowner to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's allegation that we are always making it\r\n\r\ndifficult for people who want to repair their house, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask, what are the difficulties which they encounter with  the\r\n\r\nChief  Building Surveyor's Department?

This Department\r\n\r\napproves certain plans of houses which are a bit complicated and\r\n\r\nwhich involve a building cost running into a few thousand\r\n\r\ndollars. But the houses allotted to the farmers cost only about\r\n\r\n$1,000 in the resettlement area. I wonder whether the Department\r\n\r\nconcerned can approve the applications by the farmers to build\r\n\r\nsuch houses for themselves, and whether the plans for these\r\n\r\nsimple houses can be approved by the Building Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment so that the farmers themselves can build the houses on\r\n\r\nthe same lines and pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in our resettlement\r\n\r\nprogramme,  we  have  certain standard houses  which  cost  about\r\n\r\n$1,000 to build.

The  question  is  not whether  the  applicants  have\r\n\r\nfollowed the regulations or not. In fact, they have. There is  no\r\n\r\nambiguity about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am talking about is this: after they have complied with\r\n\r\nall  the  regulations  and yet are faced with  difficulties,  the\r\n\r\npower  to  approve  their  applications  lies  either  with   the\r\n\r\nlandowners themselves or with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about the alteration to the plans of a\r\n\r\nhouse.  The Minister has not given a full reply to this question.\r\n\r\nAs regards the conferment of certain rights on the landowners,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  deny  such rights. But the landowners'  rights  are  not\r\n\r\nabsolute.  It  is not correct to get approval from the  landowner\r\n\r\nwhenever a tenant wants to alter his house. If his house is in  a\r\n\r\npoor state, of course, he has to repair it.

This is  also\r\n\r\none of the rights of landowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the construction and alteration of houses, if the\r\n\r\nlandowners  do not give their approval for them, then  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen to the tenants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I have said that the\r\n\r\nlaw  of the land respects the rights of ownership, and the  owner\r\n\r\nof  land has certain rights.

If the Government\r\n\r\nis  concerned  with  the interest of the landlords,  the  problem\r\n\r\nwould  be  whether it has made provisions to rebuild without  the\r\n\r\napproval of the landlord. If the Government does not protect  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then they will not be able to rebuild their houses.

That is why I now wish to stress that if any site is to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  there  should  be a certain  suitable  criterion.  It\r\n\r\nshould  be  according to stipulated conditions. Otherwise,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be cause for ill-feelings and sentiments.

There should also be a  fair  and  just\r\n\r\nstandard,  otherwise the green belt areas after development  will\r\n\r\nbecome  developed  areas  and the price of  land  will  increase.\r\n\r\nSuperficially,  the  rural areas may look  developed.  There  are\r\n\r\nskyscrapers everywhere, but the houses are at prices that  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  bought by the people. The people have lost their land to  the\r\n\r\nlandlords  as  a  result  of  which they  are  faced  with  great\r\n\r\ndifficulties   in  earning  their  livelihood.  Undoubtedly   the\r\n\r\nconsequences  will  be construed to mean that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nbenefiting  from the landlords; this runs contrary  to  socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green belt areas are mostly areas where the poorer people\r\n\r\nlive.  Every  year, they have to pay rentals, and  after  certain\r\n\r\nexpenses  they can start their agricultural activities and  build\r\n\r\ntheir  huts  and  homes on the sites to maintain themselves.  But\r\n\r\nonce these green belt areas are developed, then these people will\r\n\r\nmeet with difficulties. Even if they want to take up residence in\r\n\r\ncheap  Government flats, they will find it difficult  to  do  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  are  considerations  like  making  their  living.\r\n\r\nTherefore, before the Minister decides on the green belts  to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  he  should take proper steps to  consult  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned   and  ensure  the  protection  of  their   livelihood,\r\n\r\notherwise the superficial development and prosperity will not  be\r\n\r\nin keeping with socialist principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government has the\r\n\r\ninterest  of every section of the public at heart. We see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  in  our  efforts  to  bring about  a  more  democratic  and\r\n\r\nprosperous  society in any development programme, no  section  of\r\n\r\nthe public suffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Bukit Merah that the last thing I\r\n\r\nwant  to see is the private developers making large sums of money\r\n\r\nout  of  our development. I think he is quite aware that  we  did\r\n\r\nintroduce the Planning (Amendment)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  where development charges  will  be  levied  on\r\n\r\nprivate  developers. This is just to ensure that whatever  profit\r\n\r\nthe  developers  may make, a part of it will be returned  to  the\r\n\r\npublic through development charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thankful that the hon. Member has said that he has\r\n\r\nconfidence  in me, and I can assure him that his confidence  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  misplaced,  because I am not the only  one  who  decides\r\n\r\nwhether  an area should be developed or not; it is decided  by  a\r\n\r\nteam  of  experts - experts in traffic and experts in\r\n\r\nplanning  - and  all  of  them are technicians who are able to plan  \r\n\r\nfor  the increase in population that we envisage in 1990. Before we decide\r\n\r\nwhether a green belt should remain so or whether there should  be\r\n\r\na  change  of  use,  the  effect that the precinctal  development\r\n\r\naspects  will have on our livelihood, traffic problem  and  total\r\n\r\ndevelopment will be taken into consideration. So I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  the decision to change the use of any place will depend  on\r\n\r\nthe  decision of one man. It will have to be thoroughly discussed\r\n\r\nby a team of experts. Moreover, when the Master Plan is \r\n\r\nrevised - and  it  will  be  revised  at  the  beginning  of  next\r\n\r\nyear  - representations  from the public will be received  before  it  is\r\n\r\nfinally  approved. Therefore, on that score,  I  think  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember can set his qualms at rest. It is not the decision of  one\r\n\r\nman, and therefore he cannot be influenced or bought over by  any\r\n\r\nlarge land-owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the aim of this Government to raise the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living of our people. I will say that we  will  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded to some extent if we can plan our industrialisation  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  present so-called farmers who are eking out  a  living\r\n\r\nfrom  the land will be able to change to a new way of life  which\r\n\r\nwill  give  him a better return. I am sure hon. Members  opposite\r\n\r\nwill  not like to see the same living conditions under which  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  are  eking  out  a living in the  open  green  space  to\r\n\r\ncontinue. I think they will like to see that the farmers  have  a\r\n\r\nhigher standard of living.

In this respect,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  there  must be some anomalies in the routine  work  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  concerned; otherwise it could be  the  fault  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. I think the site for an electricity plant  can\r\n\r\nbe  obtained because there are organisations, such as  the  Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural Services Consultative Committee, which can try to find\r\n\r\na  suitable locality. Yet the Minister said on the 12th  of  this\r\n\r\nmonth that electricity supply could not be provided for that area\r\n\r\nbecause  no  site  was available. There seems  to  be  some \r\n\r\nmal-administration as the school is on a piece of land  that  belongs\r\n\r\nto the P.W.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I feel that this Department is not functioning\r\n\r\nefficiently to show quick results. For instance, the  project  at\r\n\r\nBraddell Road from Tampines Road 10 m.s. to Thomson Road  4  m.s.\r\n\r\nhas been going on for a long time - for almost two years - and it\r\n\r\nis  not  finished  yet. What is the reason? At the  rate  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing, if our country is as large and extensive as China, a  road\r\n\r\nfrom  the  north  to the south will take thousands  of  years  to\r\n\r\ncomplete!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the question of metalling of roads. I would like to\r\n\r\nknow how long the metalling of a road can last before remetalling\r\n\r\nis  necessary. To my knowledge, the newly laid layer of metalling\r\n\r\nof  certain roads in my constituency from Upper Serangoon 6  m.s.\r\n\r\nto  9  m.s. has come off after a period of only three months.  The\r\n\r\ntop  and  lower layers are exposed after several weeks  of  heavy\r\n\r\nrainfall; the roads are in bad condition. I do not understand why\r\n\r\nthis is so. Perhaps the Minister can explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the P.A.P. are jointly in control of public funds. I hope\r\n\r\nthey will manage the money of the people carefully and not try to\r\n\r\nwaste it unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  drains and bridges are normally subjected to  flooding\r\n\r\nafter  heavy rains. Not only will this cause loss and  damage  to\r\n\r\nagricultural  produce, but traffic is also  obstructed.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister  whether  the  Government  has   any\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan to investigate the whole situation so  that  a\r\n\r\nremedial  plan can be formulated. Because the farmers  and  other\r\n\r\npeople  feel  that such bridges and drains are of  great  use  to\r\n\r\nthem, they should not be subjected to the bad effects of constant\r\n\r\nflooding  after heavy rains. I hope the Urban and Rural  Services\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee can also pay atention to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan Kayu has taken such an interest in the work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  P.W.D. I am at one with him there in trying to speed  up\r\n\r\nwork  in  the P.W.D. it is a large organisation and  I  think  it\r\n\r\ntakes  some time to wake them up. But I can say this: during  the\r\n\r\nlast  year,  there  has been a quickening in the  pulse  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers in the P.W.D. and I hope to be able to keep it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the question of roads. I think the Government here is\r\n\r\ndoing its very best to give us very good roads. In fact, some  of\r\n\r\nthe roads that we see in Singapore are about the best that we can\r\n\r\nfind  in  South-East Asia. Knowing that we are going  to  have  a\r\n\r\npopulation of 4 million by 1990 and that the number of cars  that\r\n\r\nwill be using our roads will be trebled or more by that time,  we\r\n\r\nare  very  conscious of the inadequacy of our  roads.  Therefore,\r\n\r\neverytime,  wherever we can, we are trying to enlarge  our  roads\r\n\r\nand make them better and better as we go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of widening Thomson Road has been exercising our\r\n\r\nminds,  for quite some time. The only reason which has  prevented\r\n\r\nus  from starting on it is the large number of squatters on  both\r\n\r\nsides  of the road. It is because of our feeling for them, it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want to try to see in what way we can resettle  them\r\n\r\nwithout much disturbance to their livelihood, that we are going a\r\n\r\nbit  slow on that project. But I can assure him that it is always\r\n\r\nin our minds to build as good roads as we can in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is that we have no heart in supplying\r\n\r\nelectricity  to the 11th milestone Yio Chu Kang because  we  have\r\n\r\nsaid that we could not get a site for a substation as the site we\r\n\r\nhave  chosen is within the compounds of a Chinese Primary  School\r\n\r\nand that there were objections. I think in the reply given by  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to him on the 12th, we did  say  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  on  the lookout for another site. The moment we can  get  a\r\n\r\nsite, we will see to it that that area gets electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing which must be clear in the minds of Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition. We never differentiate. There is no question\r\n\r\nof  not  doing it in your area and only doing it for  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nboys.

He sees no results  -  two\r\n\r\nyears,  three years, the building of the road is still going  on.\r\n\r\nThat  thing  exercises my mind too, Mr Speaker. I was wondering,\r\n\r\nwhy  does  the P.W.D. take months or years to do a road?  I  have\r\n\r\nlooked  into  it. We have hastened the tempo. But  there  is  one\r\n\r\ntechnical point. In building a road, one must allow time for  the\r\n\r\nground  to  consolidate.  The Member did  say  that  at  the  9th\r\n\r\nmilestone  Upper Serangoon Road, the top layer peeled  off  after\r\n\r\nrain  and after a week. That exactly is the reason. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthere  must be a minimum time to allow for consolidation.  But  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him.  We  could increase the  tempo,  the  speed  of\r\n\r\ncompletion by the P.W.D. That I agree with him\r\n\r\nheartily, and I will chase them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand his last point about bridges and drains.\r\n\r\nWe  are  doing  our best. We have spent millions  of  dollars  to\r\n\r\nalleviate flooding. In fact, I think during the last two years we\r\n\r\nhave  seen that, in spite of heavy rain, the flooding was not  as\r\n\r\nbad as it would have been if we had not done all the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I want\r\n\r\nto clarify one point. I was saying that the road is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  9  to  12\u00bd milestone Yio Chu Kang Road,  linking  with\r\n\r\nThomson Road. Construction of this road was begun during the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock regime, and it has been going on for five or six  years\r\n\r\nnow,  and  yet  it  has not been completed. Not only  the  people\r\n\r\naround there are asking for it to be completed, but the people in\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon Road and people who want to go to the Federation\r\n\r\nhave  to  pass  through it. Some of the plans  for  bridges  were\r\n\r\ndrafted by the old Government, and yet they have not started work\r\n\r\non them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many housewives have told me that at the 9 milestone, there is\r\n\r\na maternity hospital which looks after their health. They have to\r\n\r\ngo  through  that road. Because buses pass over  that  road  very\r\n\r\nfast, it is very inconvenient for the housewives there to walk on\r\n\r\nit  and  also  because it is not level. What I want  to  know  is\r\n\r\nwhether the Government can expedite the work here and complete it\r\n\r\nin time so as to make it comfortable to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the substation for the electricity, now that the\r\n\r\nSchool  Management Committee has given permission for a piece  of\r\n\r\nland  to  be  used as a site for the substation,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould not shirk its responsibility. Electricity mains were  laid\r\n\r\nbefore  the elections. The work has been completed over  a  year,\r\n\r\nand yet there is no supply of electricity to that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.W.D. is entrusted with building bridges in the rural\r\n\r\nareas.  But these bridges have not been made with good  material.\r\n\r\nAfter  a  few years, these wooden bridges have rotted, and  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  cannot  pass  over  them.  That  shows  the  Department\r\n\r\nconcerned  has  not looked after them carefully. When  the  roads\r\n\r\nhave been completed, the Government should send someone there  to\r\n\r\ninspect and maintain them so that traffic will not be held up. In\r\n\r\nmany  rural  areas, the drains have been blocked  up  by  floods.\r\n\r\nSince there are many members of the Work Brigade, why should  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not send them there to repair the drains, so that they\r\n\r\nwill not be flooded during the rainy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseason, and not keep the Work Brigade idle?

The  Ministers   and   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries are paid thousands of dollars a month, and  they  are\r\n\r\nduty  bound  to  serve  the people.

In\r\n\r\nevery  P.A.P. constituency, if a road is constructed, the  Member\r\n\r\nof  that constituency will invariably go there to announce it.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know what the motive is, but it seems that the roads  are\r\n\r\nconstructed by the P.A.P. and not the Government. I hope that  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  the  work that is carried out by the Government  is  not\r\n\r\nheralded  by P.A.P branch members.

There is a contractor in my constituency who has  a\r\n\r\ngang  of  workers  to carry out road work. They  have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nexperience  in making roads in that area. They asked me  why  the\r\n\r\nmetalling of roads wore out in such a short time. The reason,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  that  the  roads had not been properly  constructed.\r\n\r\nThere have been irregularities and malpractices. If a road is properly  metalled, even a heavy steamroller cannot break it  up.  I\r\n\r\nwant to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment looks after public funds, they cannot misuse them.

Not only roads in the Jalan Kayu constituency have not been\r\n\r\ncompleted  for a long time, but there are also similar  instances\r\n\r\nin  other constituencies. These roads are in different degrees of\r\n\r\nrepair, and some of them are even in a worse condition than  they\r\n\r\nwere originally. When these roads become worn out, the stones are\r\n\r\nexposed. This shows how easily they can deteriorate. Has the  Government  been  guilty of using public funds  to  please  its  own\r\n\r\nmembers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some foreign firms which have tendered $3 per\r\n\r\nsquare  foot.  I  believe  that some local  contractors  who  are\r\n\r\nsomewhat related to the P.A.P. got these tenders easily.  Whether\r\n\r\nthese  successful  tenderers constructed the roads  according  to\r\n\r\nregulations, I am in doubt. But according to usual practice, road\r\n\r\nconstruction  cannot be carried out during rainy days.  But  such\r\n\r\nthings  have  been  going on. I believe that  the  materials  are\r\n\r\nspecified  in  the contracts; the widths and the  depths  of  the\r\n\r\nmaterials are specified. I understand that a big company which is\r\n\r\nsomehow  related  to  the  P.A.P. has been  guilty  of  such  malpractices.  [Interruption] These are your  own  affairs.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned wants to investigate this, he can  set  up  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry. If he wants me to give names and facts,  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  had  better  not become the Minister.  The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be in a better position than Opposition Members to  understand, because all the files are in their hands. You can set up a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to look into such matters. But I would like\r\n\r\nto ask whether, if there is any doubt about any irregularity, the\r\n\r\nMinister will set up a Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, after hearing\r\n\r\nthe speeches from the Party in power, I feel I must say something\r\n\r\non the expenditure in regard to this Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now my colleagues, the Member for Jalan Kayu and\r\n\r\nothers, have suggested many things to the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  these  suggestions  have been  ignored  by  them.  We  hope,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  they  will pay attention  to  them  in  order  to\r\n\r\nexpedite the improvements for the benefit of the people. When  we\r\n\r\nput  forward  our suggestions, the Party in power counter  us  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  we are merely carrying out publicity work  and  propaganda, when in actual fact we are trying to be constructive  by\r\n\r\nputting  forward  our suggestions. They term our suggestions  and\r\n\r\ngood intentions as \"propaganda\". I still urge the Government that\r\n\r\nit  should properly look into the use of public funds and not try\r\n\r\nto  gain  publicity  for  itself. Who has  been  guilty  of  this\r\n\r\npublicity? I think it is the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister toured the constituencies, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  and  branches drew up programmes indicating which  areas\r\n\r\nshould  have  roads, standpipes, etc. They submitted  them  as  a\r\n\r\nrequest to the Prime Minister during his tours. For instance, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  had  to go along certain roads  or  paths  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain  constituency. The P.A.P. immediately went to investigate\r\n\r\nbefore  the Prime Minister arrived there, and purposely  improved\r\n\r\nthe  general appearance of the roads and paths through  which  he\r\n\r\nhad  to  pass.  They did this in advance of the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\ntour.  But  in  other  areas, they did  nothing  to  improve  the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  the  roads.  Even in my  constituency,  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain roads which are in a very bad condition. The farmers have\r\n\r\nto  go along such roads, and in rainy days it is even worse! When\r\n\r\nthey  asked  for  repairs  to be carried  out,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational   Development   and  the  Urban   and   Rural   Services\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee paid no heed to their request.  They  are\r\n\r\nmerely interested in improving roads or paths in areas where  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister will be touring. Mr Speaker, I would like to give\r\n\r\nsome examples. In ancient Chinese history, there lived an Emperor\r\n\r\ncalled  Sui Yang. Before he toured the country, a road was  built\r\n\r\nfor  him.  He was very notorious. So it is the same with  present\r\n\r\nday  Singapore. Before the Prime Minister goes on a tour, a  road\r\n\r\nis built specially for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister for National Development has said that\r\n\r\neverything  they do is fair. The Jurong area, he said,  benefited\r\n\r\nmost  from  the  Development Estimates. The  Industrial  Site  in\r\n\r\nJurong  is  quite good and it is looked after by the  Government.\r\n\r\nBut  when the Government spends money on the Jurong project, that\r\n\r\nshould not be construed as benefiting the people of Jurong. As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  development  there, the people  have  been  asked  to\r\n\r\nremove.  Before they can even get any benefits, they are  already\r\n\r\nsuffering inconveniences, difficulties and financial loss!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will not try to talk irrelevantly and claim\r\n\r\nthat  the Jurong project has benefited most of them.

With\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation from 1st of August this year, it was  made  a\r\n\r\nstandard  charge for all the 26. In other words, where previously\r\n\r\n14  outpatient dispensaries were free, they came in line with the\r\n\r\nremaining  12  outpatient dispensaries, so that all  the  26  out\r\n\r\npatient  dispensaries were levying what I would  call  a  nominal\r\n\r\ncharge  of  50  cents. In introducing this nominal charge  of  50\r\n\r\ncents for all the 26 dispensaries, certain classes of people were\r\n\r\nexempted  from this nominal charge. This was made  known  to  the\r\n\r\npublic over a period of at least one month, that those who are in\r\n\r\nreceipt  of  social welfare assistance would be exempt  from  the\r\n\r\ncharge. It is quite easy to apply this, because those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  receipt of social welfare assistance need only produce  their\r\n\r\nsocial welfare assistance cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of people who are exempt from this nominal\r\n\r\ncharge  are  those  who  need prolonged medical  treatment  after\r\n\r\ndischarge  from  the  hospital.  They  include  people  with  the\r\n\r\nfollowing diseases: diabetes, which is a long running disease and\r\n\r\nwhich requires, I think, daily injections; diseases like leprosy;\r\n\r\nmental  disorder - a great number of them; those  suffering  from\r\n\r\ntuberculosis   and  receiving  injections, and   even   venereal\r\n\r\ndiseases, so as not to spread this disease to innocent victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third large category who are also exempted from this nominal\r\n\r\ncharge  are Government servants and their families; this is  part\r\n\r\nof  their  employment privileges. I might say that it  is  nearly\r\n\r\nfour  months  now since the reorganised Outpatient services  have\r\n\r\nbeen  running  and that about 25 per cent of those attending  the\r\n\r\ndispensaries belong to these exempted classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is not true, firstly, that because of Malaysia, the charge\r\n\r\nwas introduced, because Malaysia took place more than a year ago.\r\n\r\nI  am most grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for drawing attention to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  perhaps we should know what the amount  is.  The\r\n\r\namount  is this nominal sum of 50 cents. I do not think  that  50\r\n\r\ncents is a very heavy charge for anyone who is seriously ill.  We\r\n\r\nknow  of  cases when it was free in certain dispensaries,  and  a\r\n\r\ngood  number of those who were not really ill, but pretending  to\r\n\r\nbe  ill  and wanting to get a medical certificate, blocked  those\r\n\r\nwho  were  really ill and who wanted attention. So much  so  that\r\n\r\nthere was serious congestion in the Outpatients Department of the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital, where something like 2,000 to  3,000  persons\r\n\r\nturned  up  daily, and although they got free service,  yet  they\r\n\r\nmight  have  to wait for five or six hours because of  the  large\r\n\r\ncrowds there which prevented them from getting medical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention   quickly.   But  now  with  the   reorganisation   and\r\n\r\ndecentralisation into 26 outpatient dispensaries  throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland,  it is possible for anyone who is ill, by just paying  50\r\n\r\ncents,  to get treatment within 15 minutes and not wait for  five\r\n\r\nor  six  hours without any treatment. From objective  reports,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the public are very satisfied with the reorganisation.  It\r\n\r\nis  also  satisfactory from the point of view of the  doctors  in\r\n\r\nservice.  In  the  past,  they had very little  time  to  examine\r\n\r\npatients  to find out what was really wrong with them.  They  had\r\n\r\nonly a very cursory glance at patients before they prescribed the\r\n\r\nmedicine.  But now there is less harassment by crowds waiting  to\r\n\r\nbe  examined by doctors. Doctors are very much happier, and  that\r\n\r\nincludes  the nursing staff and the technicians as  well  as  the\r\n\r\ndispenser, because each dispensary is now well able to look after\r\n\r\nthose  who turn up. So much so that doctors can spend about  five\r\n\r\nminutes  to examine each patient. So doctors are happy,  patients\r\n\r\nare   happy,   and   our  staff  are  happy   in   this   general\r\n\r\nreorganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member's last question, whether this 50 cents\r\n\r\ncharge will be a permanent charge or a temporary one, I think  it\r\n\r\nis a little too early for me to make a pronouncement, because, at\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  the medical services unfortunately  are  very  much\r\n\r\nunderstaffed.  We  have  26 outpatients dispensaries.  For  ideal\r\n\r\nstaffing of them, we should have 70 doctors. But, at the  moment,\r\n\r\nwe have only 44. So until I am able to have a full establishment,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, 70 doctors in charge of my 26 dispensaries, I  am\r\n\r\nnot  in  a position now to make a statement. So I prefer to  just\r\n\r\nleave it open for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning this\r\n\r\noutpatient  charge,  the  reasons, according  to  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nreply,  gave me the impression that the charge cannot be reduced.\r\n\r\nIf  that is so, it is not logical. He gave an example that  there\r\n\r\nwere  people  who,  because of certain  reasons,  wanted  medical\r\n\r\ncertificates. They went to the outpatients department to see  the\r\n\r\ndoctor. It could be that these people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  not  want  to go to work. But these were but a  few  of  the\r\n\r\npatients.   If  there  are  people  who  want  to   get   medical\r\n\r\ncertificates  in order to stay away from work, then  the  medical\r\n\r\nofficer  should  examine them carefully before deciding  to  give\r\n\r\nthem  two or five days' leave. But if these people are well,  the\r\n\r\nmedical  officer  should not give them medical  certificates.  If\r\n\r\nsuch  is  the case, I cannot see how, by charging a nominal  sum,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  less  patients, so  that  medical  officers  and\r\n\r\npatients  will be happy. The Minister says the patients  will  be\r\n\r\nhappy  because  they will not have to wait too  long.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthere  will not be people who pretend to be sick and  go  to  the\r\n\r\nOutpatients Department to see the doctor. I know that in the past\r\n\r\nthere were certain departments which charged a certain fee. These\r\n\r\nwere  run  by  the  City Council, like the  maternity  and  child\r\n\r\nclinic.  If the Government wanted to standardise things,  why  do\r\n\r\nthey  not  standardise and not collect this 50 cents? Would  that\r\n\r\nnot  be  better?  I  would  like  to  know  also  whether,  after\r\n\r\nimplementing this plan of collecting 50 cents, the Government has\r\n\r\ncalculated  to see how much could be obtained within a  year?

Member for Thomson would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know the reasons why a nominal charge of 50  cents  was\r\n\r\nintroduced to bring all the other dispensaries in line  with  the\r\n\r\n12  outpatient dispensaries that were already charging this rate.\r\n\r\nThey  were eight of the former City Council dispensaries and four\r\n\r\nof  the  new  Government dispensaries. One reason was  to  reduce\r\n\r\nattendances. I think he is much too naive to think that  lots  of\r\n\r\npeople will not turn up when the dispensary is free and just  ask\r\n\r\nfor  medical certificates. But that is the true situation. It was\r\n\r\nin  order to stop the congestion at the General Hospital and  get\r\n\r\nthe public to go to the 26 outpatient dispensaries that this move\r\n\r\nwas  made.  Because,  at  the same time  as  we  reorganised  the\r\n\r\noutpatient services, we established an emergency admission unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  the General Hospital, which previously was cluttered up  with\r\n\r\nall the thousands who turned up daily for colds and stomach aches\r\n\r\nand  so  on. You could not tell the difference between a  serious\r\n\r\ncase  and a mild case. Now it is possible with anyone turning  up\r\n\r\nat  the  emergency unit of the General Hospital, and this is  400\r\n\r\nper  day  -  200 on the average, from casualties arising  out  of\r\n\r\naccidents,  another  200  serious medical  cases  recommended  by\r\n\r\ndoctors  whether  in Government or in private  practice  are  now\r\n\r\nreceiving  immediate medical attention when they  arrive  at  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital.  I  think these are  the  people  who  deserve\r\n\r\npriority  in  attention to others who have very  simple  ailments\r\n\r\nwhich  can be attended to at the outpatient dispensaries.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  in the maternal and child health centres the  service\r\n\r\ncontinues to be free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has asked what will be the rough estimate\r\n\r\nof  the revenue that will be obtained with the reorganisation  in\r\n\r\nAugust  of the outpatient services. I have already said  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  past there were 12 outpatient dispensaries which charged the\r\n\r\n50  cents rate and, on the average per annum, the income was over\r\n\r\n$200,000. Now with the nominal charge of 50 cents applying to all\r\n\r\nthe  26  outpatient dispensaries, we believe that  for  one  full\r\n\r\nyear,  the  revenue would be around three-quarters of  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars, or an increase of half a million dollars per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, because the\r\n\r\nGovernment has in the Outpatient Department been levying a charge\r\n\r\nof 50 cents, I would like to know whether this charge has already\r\n\r\nbeen levied in the Kandang Kerbau Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu, I think, is anticipating the next question, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.

They have levied a charge.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen said that the charge is just 50 cents. But I would like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  the  majority  of  the  people  who  go  to  the\r\n\r\nOutpatients Department are poor. They are poor people coming from\r\n\r\npoor villages. Because they are poor, they cannot afford to go to\r\n\r\nprivate  practitioners. They are not like the Ministers who  have\r\n\r\ngot  their  own  consultants to look after  them  and  give  them\r\n\r\ninjections. These poor patients, when they feel unwell,  have  to\r\n\r\ngo to the Outpatients Department where the charge is low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government has now decided to increase the charge. This\r\n\r\nis  a  big burden on the poor people. I do not wish to touch  any\r\n\r\nmore  on  the circumstances of Malaysia, but will only  say  that\r\n\r\nthese  people in the lower income group have heavy burdens.  They\r\n\r\nnow  have less income, and because of the rising cost of  living,\r\n\r\nthis  charge  of 50 cents for medical services is  an  additional\r\n\r\nburden on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is often said that the best things in life are free. But here\r\n\r\nin  a  realistic  world where you want to get  medical  services,\r\n\r\nsomebody has got to pay for them. Nothing is free. If the patient\r\n\r\ndoes not pay for it, then somebody has to pay, because doctors do\r\n\r\nnot  give free services, nurses have to be paid for, and medicine\r\n\r\nmust be bought and paid for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite untrue to say that the imposition of the small\r\n\r\ncharge  of  50  cents  is the result of Malaysia.  The  resulting\r\n\r\nincome is quite trifling. The real reason is that when things are\r\n\r\nfree, you get all sorts of people with minor stomach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naches or headaches jamming up the clinics and preventing the real\r\n\r\npatients from  getting sufficient medical attention.  In,  say,\r\n\r\nsocialist countries both of the European Scandinavian type and of\r\n\r\nthe Russian East European type, these services are not free. They\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  paid for. There is a deduction from  the  workers'\r\n\r\nwages  every week. A certain amount is deducted and put into  the\r\n\r\nmedical  fund  that  goes  to pay for the  medical  services.  In\r\n\r\nEngland,  for instance, if I recollect correctly, the  deduction\r\n\r\nfor  health  services is something like $3 or $4  per  week  per\r\n\r\nworker.  That  amount is deductible and is put  into  the  social\r\n\r\ninsurance  fund to pay for the medical services.  So  nothing  in\r\n\r\nthis  world  is  free, Mr Speaker, Sir, except  to  people  like\r\n\r\nPresident Soekarno who can go to Vienna at State expense  to  get\r\n\r\nan operation on whatever is wrong with his inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

We know\r\n\r\nvery well that this counter argument has always been the way  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  explain  their own deeds.  They  will  always  cite\r\n\r\nexamples  of  foreign  countries to make  a  comparison  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext. This is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has claimed that no medical services are\r\n\r\ngiven free, even in Communist countries. I understand  this. But after \r\n\r\nthe deduction, if the workers are ill, as mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance, they are being looked after  properly.\r\n\r\nBut are the same conditions of treatment obtained here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the number of people visiting the outpatient clinics,\r\n\r\nthese  people are themselves taxpayers, and therefore the medical\r\n\r\nservices  are a right to which they are entitled. Is the Minister\r\n\r\ntrying  to say that it is proper to levy a further charge  of  50\r\n\r\ncents  on  these people in addition to the taxes which  they  are\r\n\r\nalready paying?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0502 be reduced by the\r\n\r\nwhole sum in respect of subhead 1371.*\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is of the same nature, although the Minister will\r\n\r\nnot  acknowledge  it as a consequence of Malaysia,  resulting  in\r\n\r\nincreases  in  all  charges. Just now we were talking  about  the\r\n\r\ncharge  of 50 cents for outpatient services. Now, in respect  of\r\n\r\nKandang Kerbau Hospital services, the patients have to pay  more.\r\n\r\nThey have to pay a head tax of $10 per head for new-born babies.\r\n\r\nFor  non-citizens, the charge is $50. Perhaps the Government  may\r\n\r\nclaim  that  the charge is made for them to provide  certain  services. But the question does not just end there. Many people want\r\n\r\nto go to Kandang Kerbau Hospital to deliver their babies, because\r\n\r\nif  they  were to go to private maternity hospitals,  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay $50 to $60 for delivery charges. That is  why  they\r\n\r\nprefer  to  go to Kandang Kerbau Hospital because they are  poor.\r\n\r\nThus  an increase of $10 will cause a greater burden on them,  as\r\n\r\nthey  might not have calculated their budget in advance, and they\r\n\r\nnow  might  have to squeeze other resources to meet the  expenses\r\n\r\nfor the newborn baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how much is the charge, but just now there was a\r\n\r\nmention  of 50 cents for outpatient services, which would  amount\r\n\r\nto $750,000 per year in revenue. Now, for this item under Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital charges, I think the total charges cannot be less\r\n\r\nthan  that figure, but much more. So perhaps the Minister can  enlighten\r\n\r\nus and say how much the revenue will be for this charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of this charge of 50 cents for outpatient services, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  not replied whether it will be made permanent.  So\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask  whether this additional charge will be permanent  or\r\n\r\ntemporary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I have to begin\r\n\r\nby saying that the Member for Thomson is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong  when he says that \"C\" class patients at the Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital receive free attention. They have to pay $3 for the cost\r\n\r\nof sanitary towels and toilet paper when they get admitted to the\r\n\r\nhospital. The proposed new all-in charge of $10 will be effective\r\n\r\nfrom  the  first of next month - a fortnight from now - and  will\r\n\r\nreally mean an increase of $7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But again there are exemptions, Sir, - exemptions for those in\r\n\r\nreceipt  of  social  welfare assistance and those  in  Government\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for this are the same as in the case of introducing\r\n\r\nthe  nominal  charge of 50 cents for outpatient dispensaries,  to\r\n\r\ncut down on the numbers turning up at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital\r\n\r\nfor delivery. Because the establishment of doctors and nurses  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that the hospital is grossly understaffed to cope with  the\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers  that turn up each year to deliver  their  babies.\r\n\r\nThere  are as many as 40,000 babies per annum, or one baby  every\r\n\r\nten minutes. Kandang Kerbau certainly has the reputation of being\r\n\r\nthe largest maternity hospital in the world. We would be proud to\r\n\r\nhave  this appellation, but for the fact that our staff  are  not\r\n\r\nable  to  cope  with it without great cost to  their  health  and\r\n\r\nefficiency. Some doctors have had to be on duty for more than  30\r\n\r\nhours, which is very inhuman and unreasonable. As Minister, it is\r\n\r\nmy duty to see that such dedicated officers are not being made to\r\n\r\nwork till they drop. So the reason for introducing the charge  is\r\n\r\njust to stem the tide of mothers making a beeline for the Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Maternity Hospital, it is not true that if a mother cannot\r\n\r\nafford the $10, she will not be able to deliver her baby, because\r\n\r\nwe  have  a free domiciliary midwifery service. We have  midwives\r\n\r\nwho  are  being  trained to deliver babies, and such  service  is\r\n\r\navailable at home. So we try to impress upon mothers that  unless\r\n\r\nthere  is  something which may not be normal birth, such delivery\r\n\r\ncan  take  place at home free of charge. Therefore,  the  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau  Maternity  Hospital  should,  as  far  as  possible,   be\r\n\r\nrestricted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  cases where the doctor, after ante-natal examination,  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  it is preferable for the mother to have her child delivered\r\n\r\nthere,  and not every one wanting to deliver her baby in  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital. The task of having to deliver 70 per cent of the\r\n\r\nbabies  that  are born in Singapore is, I think, unreasonable  to\r\n\r\nexpect  from our dedicated doctors, nurses, and midwives in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards revenue, if the all-in charge of $10 is introduced,\r\n\r\nwe anticipate that the net revenue will only come to $200,000 per\r\n\r\nyear, because we would then do away with the charge of $3 for the\r\n\r\nsanitary  towels  and toilet paper which are now  purchased,  not\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government but from a retailer at the hospital who gets\r\n\r\nthe  contract by way of a tender, in which case, Government would\r\n\r\nthen have to provide sanitary towels and toilet paper for mothers\r\n\r\nto  deliver their babies at Kandang Kerbau Hospital as \"C\"  class\r\n\r\npatients, which we anticipate would cost $100,000 per annum. We\r\n\r\nmight get a revenue, of. Say, $300,000 per year less $100,000 for\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  sanitary towels and toilet paper, which  therefore\r\n\r\nshould  bring  in  $200,000 net revenue for  the  Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, we anticipate that by bringing in this all-in\r\n\r\ncharge,  there  would  he a reduction in the  number  of  mothers\r\n\r\ndelivering their babies for the forthcoming year. But it may  not\r\n\r\nprove to be correct. Whether it will be a permanent charge  or  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  charge, here again I am not in a position to  give  an\r\n\r\nanswer.  I would prefer to allow the system to run for, say,  one\r\n\r\nyear  before  I  provide  an answer to the  Member  for  Thomson.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  sometime next year, if he is still with us, I will  give\r\n\r\nhim the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It seems to me that the increase in\r\n\r\nthe  charges at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital by $7, as  stated  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister, was to reduce the number of expecting mothers going\r\n\r\nto the hospital. But I think if that was the only reason, then it\r\n\r\nis not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite  realistic.  If the expecting mothers were  to  deliver  at\r\n\r\nhome,  there  should  be  certain hygienic  facilities.  In  many\r\n\r\nfamilies,  the condition of the households is very  dirty.  There\r\n\r\nmay  not be any equipment, or facilities like electric appliances\r\n\r\nand  other  things necessary for delivery. All these  things  are\r\n\r\nvery important for delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the increase of the charge to $7, this may perhaps not be\r\n\r\nvery  important to the rich, but it is not so to the poor, it  is\r\n\r\nnot easy for poor families to have basins and boiling water ready\r\n\r\nat  a  moment's  notice, without which the newly  delivered  baby\r\n\r\nwould  not  have water to bathe. I feel that perhaps the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  ignored such questions. He has given his answers at  random.\r\n\r\nThere  is also the necessity to go to the Kandang Kerbau Hospital\r\n\r\nfor first delivery. I think doctors will ask that mothers with  a\r\n\r\nfirst case of delivery should go to the hospital for delivery for\r\n\r\nfear  of any risk or complications. All in all, I would say  that\r\n\r\nthe reasons given by the Minister cannot hold water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the increased charges will not be imposed.\r\n\r\nThere  are also increased charges for the outpatient services.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Government will pay attention to the fact that there are\r\n\r\nmany people who are going downhill with regard to their financial\r\n\r\nposition,  especially at this time of the year. This  is  a  fact\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. Members must also admit. If this difficulty  is\r\n\r\nadded  to  their other difficulties, I think they cannot shoulder\r\n\r\nany  more burden. I feel there should be a temporary measure  for\r\n\r\ntheir  improvement, and this should be implemented for a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod  of time. There should not be this imposition of increased\r\n\r\ncharges.

Or is it more? After, these inspectors  were\r\n\r\ndismissed,  the  P.A.P. did  not  give  any  reason  for   their\r\n\r\ndismissal.  The  only reason given is that they were  a  security\r\n\r\nrisk  and that they were a menace to security. As a result, these\r\n\r\ninspectors have lost their jobs. From where do the P.A.P. want  to\r\n\r\nemploy new hawkers inspectors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui)</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I do\r\n\r\nnot know whether or not these people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   been   dismissed   because  of  their   inefficiency   and\r\n\r\nincompetence. The reason given by the Government is that they are\r\n\r\na  security risk. But I would like to point out that since  these\r\n\r\nhawkers inspectors were dismissed, where is the Government  going\r\n\r\nto  recruit  new hawkers inspectors? The Government has  not  yet\r\n\r\npublished any advertisement for the recruitment of hawkers inspectors.  They  merely want to recruit them through negotiations.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand there is one hawker inspector who is a branch official\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. One official has now been appointed. The dismissal\r\n\r\nof  these  hawkers inspectors is solely aimed at  recruiting  new\r\n\r\nhawkers inspectors who are supporters of the P.A.P. Those who are\r\n\r\nsupporters of the Barisan Sosialis, of course, will not have  any\r\n\r\nhope of being recruited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I understand, none of the five hawkers inspectors is a\r\n\r\nmember of the Barisan Sosialis. Now the P.A.P. has engaged one of\r\n\r\nits Party officers as a hawker inspector. If they feel that Party\r\n\r\nofficials  cannot  become civil servants, why should  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nengage their own Party members to be civil servants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Mr Yong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I have to stand\r\n\r\nup and say that the Opposition Member from the Barisan \r\n\r\nSosialis - in  this  case, the Member for Bukit Panjang - is just\r\n\r\nlike  his colleague, the Member for Thomson, who makes a statement \r\n\r\nwhich is untrue  when  he says that I spoke at a meeting at  the  Victoria\r\n\r\nTheatre  in which the Prime Minister addressed a number of  civil\r\n\r\nservants on Saturday. I did not speak at that meeting; I was just\r\n\r\npresent  to  listen to the views of the Prime  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\ncivil servants, who discussed matters on Public Health. But I did\r\n\r\nissue a statement which happened to be published at the same time\r\n\r\non the question of the appointment of the Director of the Central\r\n\r\nComplaints  Bureau  to take charge of the reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nHawkers and Markets Department of the Ministry of Health. In that\r\n\r\nstatement I did say that the hawker problem is tied up  with  the\r\n\r\nsocial problem and the public health problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that the Member for Bukit Panjang actually spent a lot of\r\n\r\ntime  talking about the dismissal of 5 temporary - I underline  the\r\n\r\nword  \"temporary\" - Assistant Hawkers Inspectors in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health.  It  is  true  that  I dismissed  these  5  temporary\r\n\r\nAssistant  Hawkers Inspectors in the public interest, and  I  was\r\n\r\nrather amazed that the Member for Bukit Panjang went so far as to\r\n\r\nsay  that  these temporary hawker inspectors were not members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. Well, whether they were  members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis or not is a matter for his Party and the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned, but I think it is just typical of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nin regard to their \"expendables\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, after the 5 temporary Assistant Hawkers Inspectors were\r\n\r\ndismissed, temporary replacements were appointed which were duly\r\n\r\nprocessed through the Public Service Commission. At this moment,\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission itself is appointing not just the\r\n\r\nreplacements for the 5 temporary Assistant Hawkers Inspectors but\r\n\r\nas many as 45 Assistant Hawkers Inspectors who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  then form the core for a reorganisation of the Hawkers  and\r\n\r\nMarkets Department of the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the standard of\r\n\r\npublic health in Singapore is deteriorating. It is a fact, it was\r\n\r\nnot due to the disturbances in July and September. The situation\r\n\r\nexisted even before the occurrence of the two disturbances and\r\n\r\nthere is much left to be improved in the field of public health.\r\n\r\nThere was a cholera epidemic in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government tries to pass the buck to the civil servants for\r\n\r\nhaving failed in their duties. This is not correct. Let us\r\n\r\ndiscuss one matter. Recently the Minister for Health tried to\r\n\r\ncarry out a campaign to clean Singapore city. I cannot quite\r\n\r\nremember the exact name of the campaign. In carrying out this\r\n\r\ncampaign, they did nothing apart from giving some publicity to it\r\n\r\nover the radio and in the Press. It was mere publicity, because\r\n\r\nthey achieved very little from the campaign. They did not\r\n\r\nmobilise the people in Singapore to implement the campaign\r\n\r\nthoroughly to clean up the city. Many people have complained\r\n\r\nabout the bad situation in public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday when the Prime Minister talked to the heads of\r\n\r\ndepartments concerning public health, he said that certain\r\n\r\ndepartments had ignored the complaints of the public. As a matter\r\n\r\nof fact, the Government should not put the blame on the civil\r\n\r\nservants. It is the P.A.P. who should shoulder their responsibility. I should like to quote one example. In Queenstown\r\n\r\nthere is a market named \"Princess Market\". It is a big market\r\n\r\nwith more than a hundred hawkers' stalls, but so far the Government has not taken steps to clear the rubbish around this market.\r\n\r\nBefore the general election the Minister for Labour, when meeting\r\n\r\nthe hawkers in that area, had assured them that after his\r\n\r\nelection he would look after the problem of cleanliness in the\r\n\r\nmarket and would arrange to remove the market rubbish. However,\r\n\r\nafter his election up till now, he has not done such a thing. Up\r\n\r\nto July this year, when the Minister for Labour attended a dinner\r\n\r\nand was approached by some of the citizens there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nwho raised questions on the cleanliness of the market, he\r\n\r\npromised to help them, but after that he forgot about his promise. Now, the rubbish is piling up in that market. Of course, I\r\n\r\ndid not quote this example to show that the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nis not responsible, but since he has given such pledges, he\r\n\r\nshould fulfil them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who had complained to the Prime Minister and he\r\n\r\nhad accepted such complaints and had promised to deal with them,\r\n\r\nbut later on he forgot about them. This is his responsibility. On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, he has blamed the civil servants by saying that\r\n\r\nthey have not looked after the public health of Singapore. This\r\n\r\nis very irresponsible of him. Our Ministers are busily engaged in\r\n\r\ndelivering speeches or giving publicity or going to the Cameron\r\n\r\nHighlands to play golf, or to eat `satay' there. They have time\r\n\r\nto go to the Cameron Highlands to enjoy themselves. Yet, on the\r\n\r\nother hand, they accuse their civil servants of failing in their\r\n\r\nduties. There is a saying, \"When the top is not upright, then the\r\n\r\nlower structure will be out of shape.\" There are some Government\r\n\r\ndepartments which the P.A.P. can influence and to which they can\r\n\r\nappoint their own people. On the other hand, some responsible\r\n\r\ncivil servants have been dismissed while they have appointed\r\n\r\ntheir own people there. These people have no confidence in their\r\n\r\nwork and have to \"kowtow\" to the pressure of Government\r\n\r\nappointees. All these important factors cannot he ignored by the\r\n\r\nMinister. The Government wants to claim credit for itself but it\r\n\r\nalso wants to shed all responsibility by putting the blame on\r\n\r\nother people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nquestion of public health.

This shows that the\r\n\r\nstandard and condition of public health is very poor, as was\r\n\r\nadmitted by the Prime Minister. From what the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nhas said, it would appear that there have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties in dealing with the problems of hawkers in  relation\r\n\r\nto public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ballyhoo of the Prime Minister and the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth on the question of public health, it would appear that\r\n\r\nthey are putting the blame on the hawkers for the present\r\n\r\ncondition of public health. The inference is that they can, from\r\n\r\nnow, take steps to persecute the hawkers further. Here I should\r\n\r\nlike to caution them - if they are to engage in such a move, then\r\n\r\nit will be highly improper. The Minister for Health should see to\r\n\r\nit that steps are taken to improve the conditions of public\r\n\r\nhealth to protect the people and not try to put the whole blame\r\n\r\non the shoulders of the hawkers and to persecute them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I ask the Minister concerned, up\r\n\r\nto now who is the Director or Head of the Political Study Centre?\r\n\r\nIs he still the same expatriate, Mr G. G. Thomson? I believe that\r\n\r\ncertain  episodes by this gentlemen have been mentioned  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  the past at various sittings of the House. As  to  the\r\n\r\nappropriateness of the appointment of this gentleman as  Head  of\r\n\r\nthe  Political Study Centre, we have raised our queries  and  the\r\n\r\nParty  seems not to have paid any attention to them. In the past,\r\n\r\nthere   was  criticism  that  this  gentleman  might  have   some\r\n\r\nconnection with British\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntelligence. If this is true, then such a person as Head of  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre amounts to giving power to a British agent\r\n\r\nto control such an important institution, because he may make use\r\n\r\nof  his  position  to influence directly the  public  service  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, is there really no capable person suitable\r\n\r\nto fill this important post? Is it really necessary to have such\r\n\r\nan expatriate gentleman in this post? I believe that it has been\r\n\r\nquite a few years now since this gentleman was appointed. If the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are really sincere in the appointment of a local man, they\r\n\r\nwill not meet with any difficulties. It looks as though the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have great confidence in this particular person. Or\r\n\r\nperhaps they feel that this person can very well be a useful tool\r\n\r\nto provide them with information. We have heard what has been\r\n\r\nuttered by Alex Josey, and perhaps the P.A.P. would like to take\r\n\r\nits cue from Mr G. G. Thomson in regard to information given by\r\n\r\nhim. But the situation now after Malaysia is different. What we\r\n\r\nneed is an Asian who can understand the aspirations of the people\r\n\r\nand the situation in South-East Asia. We need such a person in\r\n\r\nthe post, and not one who has been a colonial tool in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is becoming a hardy perennial, and I\r\n\r\nfeel tempted to ask you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for a copy of last\r\n\r\nyear's Hansard so that I can read from it my reply last year.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Gentleman says that Mr Thomson is an agent of\r\n\r\nBritish Intelligence. Of course, no evidence is given. I am quite\r\n\r\ncertain that the Gentleman will not repeat this allegation\r\n\r\noutside, without the privilege of this Chamber. But for the sake\r\n\r\nof argument, let us assume that Mr Thomson is an agent of the\r\n\r\nBritish Intelligence Service. Now what can the British\r\n\r\nIntelligence Service get out of this? Mr Thomson is not party\r\n\r\nto any important decision of the State Government, and is\r\n\r\ntherefore not in a position to give any information of value to\r\n\r\nthe British Government.

As we have explained year in and year out, the syllabus\r\n\r\nof  the  Political Study Centre has been worked out  between  the\r\n\r\nDirector, the Minister for Culture and me. It has been  found  to\r\n\r\nbe  of great value in past years in bringing to the notice of our\r\n\r\ncivil servants - who have led quite a protected life and who  were\r\n\r\ntherefore quite innocent of the great changes that were going  on\r\n\r\naround them - the vast changes that were going on in Asia;  great\r\n\r\nsocial  revolutions, either under the leadership of  a  Communist\r\n\r\nParty, or the leadership of a nationalist Party. And the approach\r\n\r\nhere  is one of detached academic analysis. Now the courses  that\r\n\r\nare  run by the Political Study Centre have proved so popular and\r\n\r\nits  reputation has been so widespread that we have had  requests\r\n\r\nfrom other territories of Malaysia for the staff of the Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre  to  carry out courses for the  officers  of  their\r\n\r\nrespective  State Governments. For instance, the Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre  has over the last two years run five courses in  Kuching,\r\n\r\ntwo  in Sibu, one in Jesselton, one in Tawau, one in Sandakan and\r\n\r\none  in  Kuala Lumpur. To give an example of the content  of  the\r\n\r\ncourses, the first course in Kuching consisted of 15 lectures and\r\n\r\n10  discussions. It was attended by 36 officers  of  the  Sarawak\r\n\r\nState  Government  at  the  Sarawak Government's  Staff  Training\r\n\r\nCentre.  The  subjects  included The  Evolution  from  Colony  to\r\n\r\nNations,  The Coming of Politics, The Civil Servant in a Changing\r\n\r\nWorld,  The  Lessons of Singapore's Experience,  The  Lessons  of\r\n\r\nMalayan Experience, Towards Malaysia, The Democratic Approach  to\r\n\r\nPolitics,  The  Communist  Challenge,  The  Marxist  Theory,  The\r\n\r\nStrategy and Tactics of Parliamentary Democracy, The Strategy and\r\n\r\nTactics  of  Communism,  The  Marxist-Leninist  Conspiracy,   The\r\n\r\nEconomic Planning of a Nation, The Indian National Movement,  The\r\n\r\nChinese  Revolution:  (a)  The Nationalist  Revolution.  (b)  The\r\n\r\nCommunist Take-over, and finally, The Asian Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in addition to giving lectures to Government servants\r\n\r\nnot  only in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore, Sarawak, Sabah, Kuala Lumpur and  so  on,\r\n\r\nthey  have  been running courses for senior business  executives,\r\n\r\nbecause banks and big companies have asked the Government to  run\r\n\r\nsuitable courses for senior business executives. In the  last  15\r\n\r\nmonths,  five such courses have been organised. And more will  be\r\n\r\norganised as and when necessary. Now, of course, we do not expect\r\n\r\npro-Communist open front organisations like the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nto  take  kindly  to  these activities on our part,  because  the\r\n\r\nprincipal purpose of the Political Study Centre is to make people\r\n\r\naware  that the democratic system does not succeed automatically,\r\n\r\nthat there are enemies - a closely-knit conspiracy - in our midst\r\n\r\nwho  make use of social democratic freedom to harass the  elected\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the  day, bringing it into  disrepute,  creating,\r\n\r\ncomplete  disorder and chaos by any means possible,  and  thereby\r\n\r\nbringing a breakdown, a collapse of orderly organised government.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why the political position in Singapore is  as\r\n\r\nstable as it is now today is that there is widespread recognition\r\n\r\namong  members of the public of the dangers which the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  faces  and  the  need for people  at  various  levels  of\r\n\r\nleadership to take cognizance of this danger, to work together to\r\n\r\nensure that neither the conspirators nor their undercover leaders\r\n\r\nwould be allowed to undermine the democratic State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> (In Mandarin): The Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nnot  given a point-by-point answer to my questions.

G. Thomson is the Director of the Political Study  Centre.\r\n\r\nThat being so, the present position is that a local person is not\r\n\r\nin  occupation of that post. It is no use for the Barisan to  try\r\n\r\nto  champion the cause of the senior officers. Nobody is taken in\r\n\r\nby  that  sort  of propaganda line. Now, let me  make  clear  the\r\n\r\nposition  of the civil service and give it a certain perspective.\r\n\r\nAbout  six  or  seven  years ago, there were  no  less  than  550\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers in all government departments. Today,  except\r\n\r\nfor  a  handful, mostly in technical departments - in  the  Marine\r\n\r\nDepartment  and Marine Surveys - all these posts are occupied  by\r\n\r\nlocal  officers. To bring about such a major change in  personnel\r\n\r\nin  so  short  a time without a major decline in the standard  of\r\n\r\nefficiency speaks well for the local officers. But I do not think\r\n\r\nwe  can  deceive ourselves into believing that we  have  anything\r\n\r\nlike the number of senior civil servants with the experience  and\r\n\r\ncapability  that  we would like to have. Competent  people  there\r\n\r\ncertainly  are.  Naturally there is also  mediocrity  as  in  any\r\n\r\norganisation.  We also have men of outstanding  ability.  But  in\r\n\r\nthis  major  reshuffle of personnel, getting rid of 540  European\r\n\r\nofficers  and replacing them with local officers in  just  a  few\r\n\r\nshort  years has been a major operation. And all the able  people\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  we  keep  in policy-making  and  policy-executing\r\n\r\nfunctions. Now, a post\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  that of the Director of Political Study Centre,   I do  not\r\n\r\nconsider  a vital post in the administration. He does not  assist\r\n\r\nMinisters  to work out important policies; he does not carry  out\r\n\r\npolicy  decisions.  He is there to explain the general  political\r\n\r\nbackground  against which the country finds itself.  For  such  a\r\n\r\npost  we  need  an  officer with some academic background,  some\r\n\r\nerudition,  widely read, and particularly an ability  to  express\r\n\r\nhimself clearly, in terms which his audience can understand,  and\r\n\r\nthe   present  incumbent  is  eminently  qualified  to  do  this.\r\n\r\nEventually,  of  course, we have to find a local  officer  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  There  are  in the Political Study Centre  now  two  local\r\n\r\nofficers  who are working with the Director. Whether one  or  the\r\n\r\nother, or somebody recruited elsewhere, will take over the post I\r\n\r\ndo not know. We will make the decision at the right time when the\r\n\r\nright person conies along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  says that many expatriate officers have left our service\r\n\r\nand  the remaining few are in the technical service. He also  continues  to  hint  that the post of Director  of  Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre is not so important as to warrant a local man to fill  it.\r\n\r\nBut  to  me  the  question still remains  whether  this  post  is\r\n\r\nimportant or  not. To me, the grade of the post, Grade E, drawing  a\r\n\r\nsalary  of  $1,670 per month, shows the importance  of  the  post\r\n\r\nitself. The Minister for Finance has no desire whatsoever to fill\r\n\r\nthis  post with a local man. Even up to now he is not giving  any\r\n\r\nconsideration. Instead he is trying to give all sorts of  excuses\r\n\r\nto  cover  up the continuation of an expatriate officer  in  this\r\n\r\npost. Perhaps he has some difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not want to prolong this argument over\r\n\r\nwhat  to  me is a very trivial matter. I will give an example  of\r\n\r\nthe  sort  of  thing we can do. Now, a Grade E post  is  very  important.  By a strange coincidence, there is another person  -  a\r\n\r\nlocal  officer - who could very well have filled this post -  Grade\r\n\r\nE,  Director  of Political Study Centre. There is an  outstanding\r\n\r\nman in the Treasury.

The vote of $375,000 in last year's Estimates   was   the   Singapore   Government's   dollar-for-dollar\r\n\r\ncontribution  towards the cost of the memorial to  civilian  victims of the Japanese occupation. It has not been entered in  the 1965\r\n\r\nEstimates as it is not anticipated that the memorial will be\r\n\r\npaid  for  in 1965. It is likely that the memorial will  only  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  in 1966 or 1967. Nonetheless, I would like  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House  that up to date the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce  has\r\n\r\nalready  collected  a  sum  of approximately  $140,000  from  the\r\n\r\npublic.  The Chamber has written to say that this amount will  be\r\n\r\npaid  into  a  deposit account with the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nafter  1st  December, 1964, with interest accruing. An equivalent\r\n\r\nsum will then be paid into the same account by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following discussions with representatives of various religious\r\n\r\nbodies,  it  has been decided to bury the remains of the  victims\r\n\r\nand  not  to cremate them as originally proposed. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  design of the memorial has to be altered, doing  away\r\n\r\nwith  the  vaults.  This will lead to a saving  of  approximately\r\n\r\n$100,000  in  the cost of the memorial. When the  amended  plans\r\n\r\nhave  been  agreed by the Memorial Committee and the  Government,\r\n\r\nconstruction of the memorial can progress, and as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  donations are raised by the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will in the course of next year ask the  Assembly\r\n\r\nto  vote  the remainder of the Government's share of the cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  memorial.  The  estimated  cost  is  $650,000,  less  public\r\n\r\ncontribution  in  1964  of $140,000, less Government  \r\n\r\ndollar-for-dollar  contribution  in  1964, $140,000  leaving  a  balance \r\n\r\nof $370,000 to be accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-half of this balance, i.e. $185,000, will be paid by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to match the other half to be collected  from  public\r\n\r\ndonations.

His question was whether the small sum of $l5,000 is  due\r\n\r\nto  the fact that the hospital is dealing with fewer patients  or\r\n\r\nnot. If he will be good enough to look at the two columns of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates for 1964 and 1965 for all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations in respect of which  grants  are  being\r\n\r\nmade  for  the  Ministry of Health, he will find  that  they  are\r\n\r\npractically  standstill grants, not only for Kwong Wai  Siu  Free\r\n\r\nHospital  but also for all the other organisations.  The  history\r\n\r\nbehind this is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in 1962 that a token grant of $15,000 was granted to this\r\n\r\nfree  hospital and it has remained at this same figure. They  did\r\n\r\napply  this  year for a grant of $50,000 but we  were  unable  to\r\n\r\nimprove on the previous grant for various reasons. First, because\r\n\r\nthe  Government itself is spending considerable sums in improving\r\n\r\nthe  hospital facilities; secondly, it is probably known  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar that this particular hospital, which has  a\r\n\r\nlong  history  as far back as 1910 when the first  Ordinance  for\r\n\r\nKwong  Wai  Siu Hospital was enacted provides for a  free  public\r\n\r\nhospital  for  the treatment and maintenance of indigent  persons\r\n\r\nconnected with the Kwong Chow, Wai Chow and Siew Heng prefectures\r\n\r\nof  the  Canton Province of China. It is true that they  are  prepared to give outpatient treatment to anyone who turns up at this\r\n\r\nhospital,  but it is practically reserved as a hospital  for \r\n\r\nin-patients,   for  those  of  Cantonese  extract.  Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  preferred to have a standstill  grant  for  this\r\n\r\nparticular  hospital, and it is the same for the other charitable\r\n\r\norganisations.  There have been no increases  made,  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  making  a  great  effort  to  improve   hospital\r\n\r\nfacilities for the public as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the other organisations. I am  not  saying  that\r\n\r\ncontributions to the other organisations have increased,  whereas\r\n\r\nthe  contribution for Kwong Wai Siu Hospital has not. My  concern\r\n\r\nis  that this hospital functions on a large scale. It is near the\r\n\r\nRumah Miskin area and is catering for popular needs. As far as  I\r\n\r\nknow,  the  expenses  incurred  by  the  hospital  are  met  from\r\n\r\nvoluntary  contributions and donations. This  hospital  not  only\r\n\r\ncaters for the ordinary patients but also for pregnant women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, and since the hospital is expanding, one must\r\n\r\nreasonably  expect  that  the expenditure  for  it  should  also\r\n\r\nexpand. As far as I know, there are more and more patients  going\r\n\r\nto this hospital. In fact, there are more and more pregnant women\r\n\r\nbeing  attended to by this hospital because of the population  increase. So the question now is whether one can consider that this\r\n\r\nhospital is catering for the needs of the people to some  extent.\r\n\r\nIf  that  is  so,  then  it  is the duty  of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontribute more towards the expenses of this hospital, because it\r\n\r\nlooks after the interest of the people. I urge the Government  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  more towards this hospital so that it can  expand  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  footing as that of the Thomson Road  Hospital  or  any\r\n\r\nother  Government-run hospitals. With the help of the Government,\r\n\r\nthis free hospital will be better able to look after the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  patients,  and  the problems and  difficulties  of  this\r\n\r\nhospital  will  be  solved to some extent.  In  my  opinion,  the\r\n\r\n$15,000  vote  is  only a token vote. It does  not  help  to  any\r\n\r\nmaterial extent. This is a hospital that is actually helping  the\r\n\r\npeople  and the Government should therefore pay more towards  its\r\n\r\nexpenses.  The Prime Minister himself is entitled to $10,000  for\r\n\r\nhis  transport  expenses; so compared to this figure  of  $15,000\r\n\r\nthere  is a wide difference. If you look at the vote for the  St.\r\n\r\nAndrew's Hospital, you will see it is $129,000. This is also  too\r\n\r\nsmall.  So I urge the Government to consider giving more  aid  to\r\n\r\nhospitals  like  the Kwong Wai Siu Free Hospital  because  it  is\r\n\r\nactually  catering for the needs of the people. I am  doing  this\r\n\r\nnot  out  of political interest - in fact, it has nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  politics. So I urge the Government to try to  increase  the\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already\r\n\r\nexplained   that  there  are  always  requests  from   charitable\r\n\r\norganisations  and, generally speaking, the Government  tries  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  them  and make the necessary grants  but  sometimes\r\n\r\nthere are difficulties in the way. For example, the Kwong Wai Siu\r\n\r\nHospital asked for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$50,000, but because of the policy of standstill arrangement,  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  stick to $15,000. In respect of the St. Andrew's Mission\r\n\r\nHospital,  they asked for $174,000, but we stuck to $129,000.  It\r\n\r\nmust not be forgotten that we shall be expanding the Thomson Road\r\n\r\nHospital  from a 180-bed hospital to a 500-bed hospital,  besides\r\n\r\nother  improvements to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  a  Specialist\r\n\r\nHospital for chest diseases where development charges and  so  on\r\n\r\nwill  be  to the tune of millions of dollars, and we are thinking\r\n\r\nof  a  third General Hospital for the second Five-Year Plan which\r\n\r\nhas yet to be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will say this, that I am all in agreement with the Member\r\n\r\nfor Paya Lebar that we should try to assist them. But perhaps  he\r\n\r\ncan  put  his words into action by coming forward to support  the\r\n\r\nKwong  Wai  Siu Free Hospital when they do have charitable  shows\r\n\r\nand  giving  his support and encouragement so that they  can  get\r\n\r\nmore funds from the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just\r\n\r\nnow  the  Minister for Health has said that if I come forward  to\r\n\r\ndonate  money  to  this Hospital, perhaps it  could  get  a  good\r\n\r\nresponse.  But the point is this, the Government is  well  within\r\n\r\nits  powers to give generously to this Hospital. In the past, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  asked for a larger vote for anything, and  if  it  is\r\n\r\nsincere in helping the Hospital, it should table a motion and we,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Party, will support. Just now the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  has  asked me to set a good example by donating  to  this\r\n\r\nHospital, but the point is that the Government is well within its\r\n\r\npowers  to help the Hospital. This is not a responsible approach.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government can well afford to do so, it  should  give  a\r\n\r\ngreater sum to the Hospital. It should not put the responsibility\r\n\r\non  individuals. There was a festival at Peck San Teng two  weeks\r\n\r\nago where the Prime Minister spoke quite a lot. This hospital  is\r\n\r\nto cater for the poor, and in order to improve it, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  help  it. The Prime Minister is also concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of this hospital. He says the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  ask individuals to be responsible for the donations.\r\n\r\nWell, if Government cannot afford to give a greater sum, then  it\r\n\r\nshould, of course, explain why. It should not ask individuals  to\r\n\r\ntake the lead in asking the public to contribute to the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,553,660 for Head 0604 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0701 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0701 he reduced by\r\n\r\n$100.*\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P.

The P.A.P., in order to safeguard the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people, cancelled the registration of certain\r\n\r\ntrade unions and suppressed certain progressive trade unions, for\r\n\r\nexample, the Naval Base Union, the Harbour Board Workers' Union\r\n\r\nand other big trade unions, one of which was the General\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union. All these unions have been banned. Many workers\r\n\r\nhave lost their unions. Therefore, the employers can further\r\n\r\nexploit then. But the P.A.P., in collusion with certain trade\r\n\r\nunions, forced the workers to join unions led by Mr Devan Nair\r\n\r\nand Mr Gomez. The then Minister for Labour made use of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's power to suppress those unions which could really\r\n\r\nlook after the interests of the workers by forcing the workers to\r\n\r\njoin other trade unions which they do not like. This shows how\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. increases its own forces and nurtures those trade\r\n\r\nunions which support them, resulting in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweakening  of the trade union movement. Now we can see  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  have  been forced by the P.A.P. to join  the  pro-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions. What is the situation now? Can the workers' interests  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded by those new trade unions? In other words, can  these\r\n\r\ntrade  unions - for example, the unions led by Mr Gomez and  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan Nair really safeguard the interests of the workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you some facts. As far as I can remember, before\r\n\r\nthose  unions were banned, their leaders worked for the  workers.\r\n\r\nThese  unions had accumulated large sums of money and these  sums\r\n\r\nof money had been confiscated by the Government. We want to know,\r\n\r\nafter  the  implementation of this new policy, how  far  the  new\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  have gone in looking after the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Devan Nair recently tried to leave\r\n\r\nthe S.T.C. As far as I know the reason why he wanted to leave the\r\n\r\nS.T.C.  Union  was that the Executive Council had put  forward  a\r\n\r\nclaim  for a three weeks' bonus. However, this three weeks' bonus\r\n\r\nhad  been negotiated for last year and agreed to by the employer.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  new  claim.  Mr Devan  Nair,  however,  was  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the Executive Council. He said that because of the\r\n\r\ndisturbances  the company was not in a position to  give  such  a\r\n\r\nbonus.  He said the workers had no right to ask for such a bonus.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this, he tried to resign from the S.T.C. Union.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, if Mr Devan Nair did not know whether  the\r\n\r\nemployer  could give bonuses to the workers, how did he  come  to\r\n\r\nknow that the employers had no such right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the S.T.C. have bought a lot of new buses. If the\r\n\r\nCompany is losing money, it will not buy new buses. Did Mr Devan\r\n\r\nNair  know the real position? If he did, he would have come to  a\r\n\r\ncompromise with the employer. He wanted to resign from the S.T.C.\r\n\r\nUnion,  but realised that to resign from it was a false move.  In\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of the workers, he was not fighting for their benefit.\r\n\r\nFor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  he  was asked to go back to the  S.T.C.  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil and continue with the negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain leaders in the S.T.C. Union expressed their views\r\n\r\nthat  the  S.T.C. wanted to give them the  three  weeks'  bonus.\r\n\r\nNegotiations  for  this had been going on for years.  During  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  negotiations, the Company's management had agreed  to\r\n\r\nthe bonus. But, on the other hand, Mr Devan Nair claimed that it\r\n\r\nwas  not possible to give the workers a bonus. As leader  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  he  should  not have behaved in  such  a  manner.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour should have condemned him for selling out the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers. Therefore, Mr Devan Nair at last  went\r\n\r\nback  to  the S.T.C. Union and admitted his error. When  he  went\r\n\r\nback,  he  raised one condition, that is, to sack the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor. In fact, when the P.A.P. wanted to  make  use  of\r\n\r\nhim, they sent him to Peking and put him in as the leader of  the\r\n\r\nS.T.C. Union. But when they did not want to make use of him, they\r\n\r\njust sacked him. Now, what has the Minister for Labour done about\r\n\r\nthis? Perhaps he is their own people and he will not do anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another absurd thing is that under the P.A.P.'s labour\r\n\r\npolicy - co-operation between employer and employee - the management\r\n\r\nshould  not  exploit the workers and the workers must  try  their\r\n\r\nbest  to  work  for  the  employer so as to  bring  about  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit.  This  is what their labour policy is  for.  Mr  Gomez,\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion,  who advocated co-operation between employer and employee,\r\n\r\nsaid, because  of  the  disturbances, employers  have  run  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties and the employees should make up for the  losses  by\r\n\r\nworking   overtime.   But  workers  also  suffered   during   the\r\n\r\ndisturbances. They lost their jobs and also incurred losses. Many\r\n\r\nworkers,  during  the  disturbances, had  to  borrow  from  their\r\n\r\nrelatives  or  friends in order to tide over the  period  of  the\r\n\r\ndisturbances. However, the employers have not been affected and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Gomez's  Union put forward the scheme to help the  employers\r\n\r\nmake up for their losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in shops and factories, there is a break of 15 minutes at\r\n\r\nten  o'clock;  at 12 o'clock there is an hour for lunch;  and  at\r\n\r\nhalf-past  three, there is a break for tea. But under the  scheme\r\n\r\nto  boost  production, the workers have been asked  to  sacrifice\r\n\r\ntheir  15 minutes tea-time and work for the employers. They  have\r\n\r\nto  cut  down  their normal lunch time to half an hour.  This  is\r\n\r\nabsurd.  Saturday is a half-day and they are entitled to overtime\r\n\r\nif  they  work a whole day; but according to the new scheme,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are asked to work for the whole day on Saturday but  are\r\n\r\nnot paid overtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that the workers should not ask for sick\r\n\r\nleave.  They should try to cut down on their sick leave, that  is\r\n\r\nto  say, even if they are sick, they should not get leave.  Women\r\n\r\nworkers should not get their maternity leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is this boosting production\r\n\r\nscheme? And our Minister for Labour has said nothing about  this.\r\n\r\nAll this has been done in the name of the P.A.P.'s labour policy.\r\n\r\nThis  had been carried out by the trade unions which support  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the unions which profess to work for the workers. This is\r\n\r\na betrayal of trade unions. What is the result of the cooperation\r\n\r\nmovement?  From among the workers there is very poor response  to\r\n\r\nthis scheme. Therefore, this scheme is a flop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because of the P.A.P.'s own interests,\r\n\r\nthey make use of all means to deal with their political opponents\r\n\r\nand  to  ban all those trade unions which do not toe their  line.\r\n\r\nBut  they foster those unions which bow to them, kow-tow to them,\r\n\r\nand  those  workers  who do not join these  unions  will  not  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to the benefits conferred by labour laws. For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union has  been  in\r\n\r\nexistence for eight or nine years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 8-year history of the S.M.M.W.U., no worker has ever\r\n\r\nwanted to join it. Mr Gomez was sacked by the General Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  He then led the Singapore Manual and Mercantile  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion.  Because the workers have come to know him well,  that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  they do not like to join this union. But the P.A.P., because\r\n\r\nof  their  own interest, foster the S.M.M.W U. In spite of  this,\r\n\r\nmany  workers know that this particular union will not  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to help them. Mr Devan Nair used Mr Gomez --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Order. The hon.

Mr Devan Nair,\r\n\r\nwas mentioned. I think it will be unfair if I do not rebut the\r\n\r\nfalsehoods uttered by the Member for Paya Lebar. He said that\r\n\r\nMr Devan Nair resigned from the S.T.C. Union because he refused\r\n\r\nto fight for the three weeks' bonus for the workers. He went on\r\n\r\nto say: How can Mr Devan Nair know that the S.T.C. was unable to\r\n\r\npay for the three weeks' bonus when he did not check the accounts\r\n\r\nof the S.T.C.? This shows that the Barisan Members did not know\r\n\r\nwhat had been going on. I am very closely associated with Mr Devan Nair, \r\n\r\nand I know that the accountant, a professor, and Mr Devan Nair himself - \r\n\r\nthree of them - had asked the General\r\n\r\nManager of the S.T.C. to produce the accounts to show whether\r\n\r\nthe company had the capacity to pay a three weeks' bonus to the\r\n\r\nworkers. After investigating and checking the accounts, the\r\n\r\nprofessor, the accountant and the adviser of the union, were\r\n\r\ncompletely satisfied that they were not in a position to give a\r\n\r\nthree weeks' bonus to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the adviser and his two colleagues still pressed on to\r\n\r\nget  the  bonus  for  the workers. But why  did  Mr  Devan  Nair\r\n\r\nresign? It was due to the plot of a handful of Barisan chaps and\r\n\r\nthe Alliance workers --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

As a result the workers did not accept Mr Devan  Nair's\r\n\r\nadvice, and as a trade unionist he did not want to put them  into\r\n\r\ntrouble, unlike the Barisan who helped the workers to close  down\r\n\r\nmany firms in Singapore. I think the Barisan have to shoulder the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the hardships and difficulty that these people\r\n\r\nare  now suffering. They are still unable to get jobs. Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair  is  an  intelligent  trade  unionist.  He  will  fight  the\r\n\r\nmanagement argument for argument. He has been the adviser to  the\r\n\r\nS.T.C.U. from 1954 to 1964.

Why do I  say  that  the  N.T.U.C, is\r\n\r\nindependent? The facts show today that although the  A.U.P.E, is\r\n\r\nan  affiliate of the N.T.U.C., yet it is fighting the  Government\r\n\r\nfor better benefits, better pay, and so on. If, as the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers have said, the N.T.U.C. is P.A.P.-controlled, it will not\r\n\r\nfight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst the P.A.P.

I would point out\r\n\r\nthat  the  Hock Lee Union at one time was with S.A.T.U. Mr  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee Suan was at one time its adviser. He negotiated a collective\r\n\r\nagreement with the Hock Lee Bus Company for an annual 18-day sick\r\n\r\nleave  for his bus workers, whereas in our Labour Ordinance,  the\r\n\r\nprovision for sick leave is 28 days.

This is unprecedented in the history  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement in Singapore. There has never been a true trade unionist\r\n\r\nwho  argues the cause of the employer, claiming that the employer\r\n\r\nis not in a position to improve the lot of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we seen in regard to the incident of the S.T.C. bus\r\n\r\nworkers  union?  We see that the workers' conditions  of  service\r\n\r\nhave not been improved, although the S.T.C. itself is flourishing.\r\n\r\nLook at the working conditions of these workers and those working\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese bus companies! We can see the disparity  between\r\n\r\nthe  two sectors. In spite of the fact that the S.T.C. buses  are\r\n\r\nrunning on profitable routes, while the Chinese buses are not  so\r\n\r\nfortunate,  the  S.T.C. employees  are  getting  worse   working\r\n\r\nconditions. Cannot the S.T.C. employers provide better conditions\r\n\r\nfor the workers? Their present conditions are worse than those in\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese bus companies. So the claims by the S.T.C. employees\r\n\r\nare justified in view of the rising cost of living. In truth,  if\r\n\r\nthe  trade unionists and leaders of this S.T.C. union are  really\r\n\r\nsincere  in looking after the interest of the workers, then  they\r\n\r\nshould not try to be slaves of the white --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

But  all  these\r\n\r\nprotestations  have been proved to be not so by  concrete  facts.\r\n\r\nThe facts have shown that the P.A.P. are actually serving the  interests of the foreign capitalists. Incidents have been many  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  concrete facts and evidence for us to  show  how  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P, labour policy has been detrimental to the interest of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that last year in Singapore there was a\r\n\r\ntrade  union,  namely, the Singapore Naval Base  Workers'  Union,\r\n\r\nwhich had a long history, say, more than a decade. The workers of\r\n\r\nthis union raised claims for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter service conditions. Their boss was the British Naval Base\r\n\r\nauthorities, the colonial rulers. The claims by the workers had\r\n\r\nbeen the unanimous opinion and wishes of the workers and decided\r\n\r\nupon by the workers themselves. There had been several\r\n\r\nnegotiations with the employers' side. Because of the stubbornness of the employers, the claims were not settled\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily. In the end, it led to a strike by the workers to\r\n\r\nassert their claims. In this matter, the Prime Minister, who had\r\n\r\nclaimed to be adviser to trade unions, had not shown any sympathy\r\n\r\nfor the workers. On the contrary, he adopted measures to break up\r\n\r\nthe strike and deregister the union concerned. After that, we\r\n\r\ncame to know that the military and police had been sent there to\r\n\r\nbeat up the workers with their batons. That is the P.A.P.'s \r\n\r\npro-labour policy. I, under such circumstances, when the workers\r\n\r\nreported for duty on the following day, the Naval Base authorities sacked a number of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them about 38 workers did not receive any compensation and\r\n\r\ntheir  employment  was terminated by the Naval Base  authorities.\r\n\r\nThey were given a small chit saying. \"Your post is now terminated\r\n\r\nbecause of your participation in the illegal strike in the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase.\"  But  16 of them did not receive this chit  and  yet  were\r\n\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their dismissal, they approached the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nLabour.  They pointed out to him the unjust action taken  by  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base  authorities  and asked for  remedial  steps  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  workers. But the Labour  Department  did  not\r\n\r\nproceed according to the stipulations of the labour laws for negotiations between the workers and the Naval Base authorities.  The\r\n\r\nLabour  Department  did  not take any  action  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  workers or to act on their  behalf.  Yet  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour told the workers that they received  a  note\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Naval  Base  authorities saying that  because  of  the\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  conduct  of  the  workers,  they  had  had  their\r\n\r\nservices terminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis attitude on the part of the Labour Department is comparable\r\n\r\nto the attitude of the employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask them whether such an attitude is correct. Were their\r\n\r\nactions compatible with the stipulations of the provisions of the\r\n\r\nlabour laws? Because under the labour laws, if workers are to be\r\n\r\nretrenched or dismissed, they should get three months'  wages  as\r\n\r\ncompensation and notice in lieu of compensation. But in this case\r\n\r\nthe Naval Base authorities did not comply with the provisions  as\r\n\r\nlaid down in the labour laws. The law provides that if a worker's\r\n\r\nhealth  is  affected during the course of work, or his efficiency\r\n\r\nis  lowered and he is found unsuitable for his job, then  if  the\r\n\r\nemployer  wants to dismiss him he should give him notice.  If  an\r\n\r\nemployee has served for more than seven years, the minimum notice\r\n\r\nshould  be  two  months; and if it is less than seven  years,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be one week. These are the provisions applicable  to  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base  authorities. It is also stipulated that  regulations\r\n\r\ngoverning  working conditions and service should be in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  labour legislation in Singapore. Yet the dismissal  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  was  not carried out in accordance with  regulations  as\r\n\r\nvalid  at the time. The Naval Base authorities should have  given\r\n\r\none week or two months' notice before dismissing the workers. But\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  comply  with  the  regulations.  Of  the  workers\r\n\r\ndismissed,  there  were  some  who had  more  than  seven  years'\r\n\r\nservice.  But did the Ministry of Labour do anything to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers or represent them? No, not at  all.\r\n\r\nInstead  they  were  on the side of the Naval  Base  authorities,\r\n\r\nspeaking  for  the  employer, and claiming that  the  Naval  Base\r\n\r\nworkers  were  not justified in going on strike. In fact,  during\r\n\r\nthe  strike  the  workers were dismissed not in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nnormal  practice.  The  reasons  for  their  dismissal  were  not\r\n\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to mention in regard to the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nself  proclaimed pro-labour policy is that concerning the  recent\r\n\r\nGian Singh trade dispute before the Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Labour referred the matter to the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  What was the result of arbitration? It was to the effect\r\n\r\nthat  if the workers did not work in accordance with their  terms\r\n\r\nof  employment, they should be liable for dismissal. What did  it\r\n\r\nmean?  It meant that unless the workers obeyed all the conditions\r\n\r\nlaid  down by the employer, even if they were reasonable measures\r\n\r\nsuch  as working to rule and a go-slow policy, which action could\r\n\r\nbe construed as not complying with the terms of employment of the\r\n\r\nworkers, then their just claims or actions would be thwarted  and\r\n\r\nthey  would not be able to resort to industrial action  to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir grievances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 77 of the industrial Relations Ordinance provides\r\n\r\nthat  if workers resort to industrial action, the employer should\r\n\r\nnot  dismiss  them,  but  should wait for  the  decision  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court. I do not understand that.  Is  the\r\n\r\nlaw  meant for the workers, or is the P.A.P. for the workers?  That\r\n\r\nis  what I want to ask. If the so-called P.A.P. pro-labour policy\r\n\r\nis such and since the Minister for Labour has been shouting about\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialism,  then such kind  of  democratic  socialism\r\n\r\nshould be thrown to the dogs; but even dogs would not feed on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to raise another matter,\r\n\r\nnamely, the P.A.P. wanted to prevent workers from choosing  their\r\n\r\nown trade union and refuse them --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> remained standing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I think the Member for Bras Basah, who is Chairman of the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.,  has  answered  some of the charges  quite  adequately.\r\n\r\nThere are other points which we should bring to your attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member of the Barisan Sosialis has made repeated charges\r\n\r\nagainst  Mr  Devan Nair, the Secretary-General of the  N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  is  not in a position to answer in this  House. It  is\r\n\r\nunfair that such personal attacks have been made. It is said that\r\n\r\nMr  Devan  Nair has sold out the interests of the workers.  This\r\n\r\ncharge does not warrant any lengthy answer. It is very simple. If\r\n\r\nMr Devan Nair had sold out the interests of the workers, then in\r\n\r\nApril this year he should not have been elected by the people  to\r\n\r\nthe Central Parliament. But the facts are that during the general\r\n\r\nelections in the Federation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Devan Nair, who represented the P.A.P., contested against a\r\n\r\nMember of a Party allied to the Barisan Sosialis (Mr David)  who\r\n\r\nwas supposed to he the hero of the workers [Interruption] and  it\r\n\r\nwas  Mr Devan Nair who was returned, and not the so-called  hero\r\n\r\nwho   suffered  a  shameful  defeat  [Interruption]  during   the\r\n\r\nelections.  If Mr Devan Nair had been a traitor to the  workers,\r\n\r\nthen  how  could  he  have obtained so  much  support  from  the\r\n\r\npeople?

I will not have these interruptions  from\r\n\r\nboth sides of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr Speaker, if the\r\n\r\npeople can see for themselves, then how is it that your hero, the\r\n\r\nhero  of  the Barisan Sosialis, did not get any support from  the\r\n\r\npeople? That is one point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also mentioned the trade dispute in Gian\r\n\r\nSingh  which was dealt with in the Industrial Arbitration  Court.\r\n\r\nHe  said that this has not been fair. We know, Mr Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nthis  trade  dispute  was  dealt with  by  the  I.A.C. which  is\r\n\r\nindependent, and the decision of this Court should give  rise  to\r\n\r\nno  doubts  whatsoever.  If  they feel  that  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court has not arrived at a fair decision, then  it  is\r\n\r\nfor the union to boycott the I.A.C. instead of resorting to it to\r\n\r\nfurther their claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are there for us to see. More and more unions are\r\n\r\ngoing  to the Industrial Arbitration Court for help. From October\r\n\r\nlast  year  up to October this year many cases were referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Arbitration  Court.  The  collective  agreements\r\n\r\nregistered by the Industrial Arbitration Court number  some  199.\r\n\r\nOf  this  number, 105 came from the N.T.U.C. group and  from  the\r\n\r\nother group that is in support of the Barisan Sosialis there were\r\n\r\nabout 94 agreements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  gave  protection to about 8,849 workers belonging  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  camp.  If  they  say  that   the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court is no good, then why should they ask their  own\r\n\r\nworkers  to come forward to the Industrial Arbitration Court  for\r\n\r\nprotection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to judge whether the labour policy of a Government is\r\n\r\ngood  or  bad,  there are two conditions which  one  can  use  as\r\n\r\ncriteria. One is whether the labour laws of this Government  have\r\n\r\nthe interest of the workers at heart and the other is whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment is respecting the rights of the trade union  movement.\r\n\r\nOtherwise all criticisms will be subjective and unrealistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Barisan Sosialis Members were still in the P.A.P., they\r\n\r\npraised the P.A.P.'s labour policy. Now that they have left, they\r\n\r\ncondemn the P.A.P.'s labour policy. Obviously, such behaviour and\r\n\r\ncriticisms  are  very  improper,  subjective,  unilateral  and  a\r\n\r\ntravesty  of facts. When the Barisan Sosialis Members were  still\r\n\r\nwith  the P.A.P., it did not mean that the P.A.P.'s labour policy\r\n\r\nwas  perfect. On the other hand, it does not mean that once  they\r\n\r\nhave left, the P.A.P.'s labour policy has gone to the dogs. It is\r\n\r\nuseless to shout slogans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has not changed its labour policy, which is\r\n\r\npro-labour. We have contended in the past, we contend now and we will\r\n\r\nstill contend in the future that there should be industrial peace\r\n\r\nthrough industrial justice. It is our policy to pursue this  aim.\r\n\r\nWe  have  not changed our policy. It is the Barisan Sosialis  who\r\n\r\nhave changed their stand because they have sold out the interests\r\n\r\nof  the workers. After they betrayed the P.A.P., they have  tried\r\n\r\nvery  hard to turn the trade union movement and trade unions into\r\n\r\ntools  for the Barisan Sosialis. They have tried to suppress  the\r\n\r\nworkers of Singapore; to bring the trade unions in Singapore into\r\n\r\na pro-Indonesian and anti-National United front. This act is most\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to the majority of our workers because  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosiahis  put the trade union movement in a state of crisis  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time. As a result, the trade unions are unable to  deal\r\n\r\nwith labour and management disputes, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  sometimes made use of for their political aims. In fact, the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have drawn into the political whirlwind the rice\r\n\r\nbowls  of the workers because they are pro-Indonesian and  \r\n\r\nanti-national.  The united front that they have formed is  detrimental\r\n\r\nto the workers of our nation. This is very clear, Mr Speaker. It\r\n\r\nis  they who are the traitors of the workers. It is they who  are\r\n\r\ntrying to sell out the interests of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the business of the trade union movement in Singapore to\r\n\r\ntry  to  shake  away from the control of these  traitors  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. In this respect, it is the duty of the Government to try\r\n\r\nto give the innocent workers every help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Mr Speaker, that there are two conditions by\r\n\r\nwhich  one could judge whether the Government's labour policy  is\r\n\r\ngood or bad. The first one is whether the labour laws are in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the majority of the workers. We can say  today  with\r\n\r\nsome  satisfaction that our labour legislation is very  excellent\r\n\r\ncompared to all others in South-East Asian countries. There is no\r\n\r\nother  nation  which can rival us in our labour legislation.  The\r\n\r\nmost  important one that we have made is the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which was passed in 1960. This sets up the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court.  One  can see that ever  since  the  law  was\r\n\r\npassed, industrial relations in Singapore are heading for greater\r\n\r\nand  greater  stability.  There are  less  and  less  strikes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Workers  can  now try to improve  their  lot  through\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  mediation and arbitration. They  do  not  have  to\r\n\r\npicket  under  the  hot sun during strikes. Both  management  and\r\n\r\nlabour  can  talk over their terms peacefully and calmly  in  the\r\n\r\ncool   chambers  of  the  Arbitration  Court,  without  incurring\r\n\r\nunnecessary losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that after the establishment of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court, some 801 collective agreements have\r\n\r\nbeen registered by the Court, benefiting 111,830 workers. It must\r\n\r\nbe  pointed  out  that agreements registered  by  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  have the protection  of  the  law.  Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, we are quite satisfied with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the Industrial Relations Ordinance.  We  went\r\n\r\nthrough the experimental stage, which is the first stage of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation,  and we are gathering our experiences  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmake further improvements in this Ordinance. We are now in active\r\n\r\ncontact  with  the Singapore Employers' Federation, the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nand  the  President of the Industrial Arbitration Court.  We  are\r\n\r\nstudying trade union problems together and, at the right time, we\r\n\r\nshall make the necessary detailed amendments in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the second condition by which one may judge the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Government,  that is,  whether  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  has the respect of the Government, I must say that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. comes  from  the democratic trade  union  movement.  This\r\n\r\ndemocratic  trade union movement is represented by  the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nSome  of our members, the P.A.P. members and the Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  such as the Member for Bras Basah, are closely  connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  N.T.U.C. But it does not mean that we are dictated  by\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C. or  the  N.T.U.C. is under  the  control  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  have  the  same  objectives,  and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a Malaysian nation. We want to try to  establish\r\n\r\na  socialist system within the whole territory so that there will\r\n\r\nbe no exploitation of man by man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aim can be carried out in two different ways. On the one\r\n\r\nhand,  the  Government can realise this aim through its financial\r\n\r\npolicy  and measures governing taxation. On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  trade  union  movement  is  trying  to  organise  and\r\n\r\nmobilise the working class to realise this aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the pro-Communist trade union movement has a long\r\n\r\nstanding  in  the  history of Singapore, whereas  the  democratic\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement is still in its infancy. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the Government to be very careful  in  trying  to\r\n\r\nfoster the healthy growth of the democratic trade union movement.\r\n\r\nThe  democratic  trade union movement is facing difficulties.  It\r\n\r\nhas  to  put  up with a shortage of properly trained  cadres  and\r\n\r\nleadership. The lower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstratum  of this movement comes from the Chinese-speaking workers\r\n\r\nwhereas the leadership of this movement is English-speaking. As a\r\n\r\nresult of the language difficulties and differences in education,\r\n\r\nthere  are some conflicts and barriers between them, and we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  help  the  democratic movement to  overcome  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties in the years to come. Suitable leadership  and  support  for the democratic trade union movement will encourage  its\r\n\r\ngrowth and make it flourish. This will help the industrialisation\r\n\r\nscheme  of  the Government. The recent reshuffle in the  National\r\n\r\nTrade Union Congress is worthy of our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  the  next few minutes to answer the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  He  says that the trade union movement in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nvery   progressive.   He  says  that  the   Government's   labour\r\n\r\nlegislation is the most excellent in South-East Asia. But I  want\r\n\r\nto remind him that if it is so, it is not due to him that we have\r\n\r\nthis  progressive legislation. It is through the struggle of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  that  we  have come to the present stage.  How  can  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government claim credit for such progress in  the  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation?  In some advanced countries, it is  true  that  some\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders have been imprisoned and that  success  and\r\n\r\nprogress  have  been  achieved.  He  has  said  that  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  do  not have to picket under the hot sun during  their\r\n\r\nstrikes.  He  seems to suggest that the workers  want  to  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike  for no rhyme or reason at all. I suggest to him that  the\r\n\r\nworkers are forced to resort to strike because they are unable to\r\n\r\nsolve  their  dispute  by other means. If  you  want  to  achieve\r\n\r\nindustrial peace, then you must look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers rather than the interests of the foreign capitalists. The\r\n\r\nMinister  seems to have spoken in defence of foreign capitalists.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  P.A.P. who  is trying to disrupt  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the workers and the capitalists. As a result, the workers\r\n\r\nare suffering misery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has talked about the present trade union movement\r\n\r\ntrying to shake itself away from the control of the pro-Communist \r\n\r\nelements. I would like to tell him that the question is not  that\r\n\r\nsimple.  There  is no question of shaking away from pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements. The question is that the P.A.P. is adopting suppressive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  try to silence some existing trade  unionists  and\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. They are putting them under their control  against\r\n\r\nthe  wishes of the people. We know very clearly the case  of  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base  Union  which  was banned and  deregistered  so  that\r\n\r\nanother  union was put up for the original members of  the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase Union. But there was no support for the new union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers of the P.A.P., together with their Backbenchers,\r\n\r\ntried  to help the small group of trade unionists in running  its\r\n\r\nnew  union  and the Prime Minister found one day that he  had  to\r\n\r\nofficiate at the opening ceremony of the so-called new union.  So\r\n\r\nit is the policy of the P.A.P. to support and foster unions under --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

They misuse public  funds\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengaging in the publication of their party propaganda. This is  a\r\n\r\nvery clear example. I have here a publication by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  a small pamphlet, which was published with public  funds\r\n\r\nbut  not with the P.A.P. funds. This pamphlet contains statements\r\n\r\nwhich praise the Prime Minister --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May we have the title of the pamphlet? Just give\r\n\r\nthe name on the cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The pamphlet is entitled \"One\r\n\r\nHundreded Years of Socialism\". It does not deal with the problems\r\n\r\nof  Singapore; otherwise we would not criticise it. It deals with\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s own affairs. In the Merger White Paper, no provision\r\n\r\nwas  made  for  the State Government to retain  its  powers  over\r\n\r\nforeign  policy.  In what capacity did the Prime Minister  attend\r\n\r\nthe Conference? Did he attend it in the capacity of a diplomat or\r\n\r\nin  the capacity of a Party leader, and is it right to use public\r\n\r\nfunds  to publish this pamphlet which is mainly for the publicity\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P.? If they say that the State has powers over foreign\r\n\r\npolicy,  of  course,  it  may be right for  them  to  issue  this\r\n\r\npamphlet which has been published with public funds. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  P.A.P. have banned and suppressed  all  healthy  and\r\n\r\nprogressive  publications and magazines;  even  our  Party  organ\r\n\r\nBarisan  has  been subjected to all sorts of interferences.  They\r\n\r\nhave threatened certain printing shops and coerced them into  not\r\n\r\npublishing it. Now the printing shops have no political motive in\r\n\r\naccepting our publication; they are interested only in  making  a\r\n\r\nprofit.  There  are hundreds of printing shops in Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of coercion these shops do not want to print  our  Party\r\n\r\norgan.  Why  do  they not want to print our Party  organ?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause they do not want to make a profit? No. It is because they\r\n\r\nare  forced  by the P.A.P. Government not to print it because  if\r\n\r\nthey  do  so,  their  licence will be  cancelled  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. can say that we have freedom of publication, we have\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  we have freedom of the Press, and we can continue  to\r\n\r\npublish our Party organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  may claim that they have not suppressed our Party  organ.\r\n\r\nHowever,  they  have tried their best to prevent  it  from  being\r\n\r\nprinted by the printing shops. This amounts to allowing a  person\r\n\r\nto  live but not allowing him to eat. This is because the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare afraid and they therefore try to prevent our Party organ from\r\n\r\nbeing printed. They have accused the Barisan Sosialis, over the\r\n\r\nradio  and  in the Press and even in this House, of  having  told\r\n\r\nlies  and deceiving the people and the workers. But why are  they\r\n\r\nafraid  to  reveal the truth? They say that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  deceiving  the people, but why should they he afraid?  They\r\n\r\nshould  allow our Party organ to he published. If we deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  and the workers, we should be judged by them. Why  should\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P, be  afraid? Therefore, I, feel  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  publication in Singapore. It  belongs  only  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. They have abused the freedom of publication for their  own\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

And if no printing  firm  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  undertake  the printing of their  publication,  the\r\n\r\nreason  is  obvious. Any printer who publishes anything  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to take the consequences of infringing the law  of  the\r\n\r\nland.

P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member has misunderstood the Minister.\r\n\r\nI think the Minister was trying to explain the reason why a\r\n\r\npublisher might not want to publish certain papers. I do not\r\n\r\nthink he was accusing the Barisan Sosialis of having committed\r\n\r\nanything. Mr Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you, Sir, for clarifying what I have said\r\n\r\na few moments ago. The real reason is that no responsible printer\r\n\r\nwill dare undertake any publication by the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nespecially in view of the fact that they are known throughout the\r\n\r\ncountry for plugging Indonesia's line, advocating the cause of\r\n\r\ntreason. Also in view of the fact that internal security is in\r\n\r\nthe hands of the Central Government, no printer is prepared to\r\n\r\nundertake any publication by the Barisan Sosialis. We ourselves\r\n\r\nhave placed no particular pressure except to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof every printer that he is responsible for whatever he prints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, again the complaint is that freedom of publication\r\n\r\nbelongs only to the P.A.P. As far as I know, the P.A.P. publishes\r\n\r\nonly one regular newspaper, the \"Petir\". Are the Sin Chew Jit\r\n\r\nPoh, the Nanyang Siang Pau, the New Life, the Straits Times, the\r\n\r\nMalayan Times - to take the daily newspapers - P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnewspapers? It is quite true that we have banned certain\r\n\r\nnewspapers. Everybody knows what publications they are. We banned\r\n\r\nthe Fajar - the Internal Security people are responsible for\r\n\r\nsecurity. Many of its leading lights are either under detention,\r\n\r\nor have left the country to study law. We also banned the\r\n\r\nUniversity Tribune and the Partai Ra'yat publications. The Partai\r\n\r\nRa'yat and many of its members are known to be the advance guard\r\n\r\nof Indonesia's invasion forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left this country and joined and betrayed us to Indonesia;\r\n\r\nthey  came to kill our own people. A publication by any party  or\r\n\r\nany organisation like that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the interest of the country, must be banned because they  are\r\n\r\nnot  preaching democracy or expressing legitimate differences  of\r\n\r\nviews.  They are advocating treason. They are mouthing Indonesian\r\n\r\npropaganda,  Indonesian  hostility  towards  us.  Therefore,  any\r\n\r\npublication  like that, whether it is by the Barisan  or  by  any\r\n\r\nother  group must be banned. But we have never banned  papers  or\r\n\r\npublications which genuinely are against us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lack of healthy publications, can the Barisan name, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  these known pro-Communist publications, what other  healthy\r\n\r\npublications  we  have banned? Can they give us the  names?  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Members are all University graduates; they  should  know\r\n\r\nwhat kind of healthy literature, good books should be read by the\r\n\r\npeople  and  which we have banned, in fact, last year,  the  same\r\n\r\nquestion  came  up on the lack of literature, reading  matter.  I\r\n\r\nrefer  to  Hansard,  Volume 22 No. 9, of 14th December,  1963,  I\r\n\r\nasked  them,  Sir, at column 580, because they had  been  talking\r\n\r\nabout healthy reading matter, to give us a list - and I was quite\r\n\r\nconfident;  I could take a bet that there would not he  a  single\r\n\r\nlist  of  titles  coming from them - of healthy reading  matter.\r\n\r\nThat  was one year ago. Sir, and as far as I know, they have  not\r\n\r\nsubmitted  one title, one magazine, one book, which they  believe\r\n\r\nis not pro-Communist, not against the interest of the country and\r\n\r\nwhich should be imported into the country. They have never given\r\n\r\nme  a  list. I ask them again: if there is healthy reading matter\r\n\r\nwhich  they  genuinely  believe will help us  to  make  ourselves\r\n\r\nbetter  Malaysians, better citizens and which should  he  brought\r\n\r\ninto the country in any language - Malay, Tamil, Chinese or English\r\n\r\n-  if  they feel that there are such books which we are withholding  and  which should be let into the country, then I  shall  be\r\n\r\nprepared to consider them. But I know that the list of books that\r\n\r\nhave been banned - apart from sexy books which I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthey  do not want us to bring in - the other banned publications,\r\n\r\nwhether  produced  locally  or imported  from  abroad,  are \r\n\r\npro-Communist  literature, literature which advocates  the  cause  of\r\n\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what we have\r\n\r\nsaid just now is that the Ministry of Culture has exercised its\r\n\r\npower to suppress certain printing shops for printing our Party\r\n\r\norgan. The Minister for Culture has said that if publications are\r\n\r\npro-Communist in content or laud the praises of foreign\r\n\r\ncountries, they should be banned. Such publications, of course,\r\n\r\nin the end, will be banned by the Government. In so far as our\r\n\r\nParty organ is concerned, we raise our points of view in the\r\n\r\ninterest of all the people of Singapore. If our \"Barisan\", the\r\n\r\nParty organ, is not in the interest of the country, then the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government may have cause to take action. But all action\r\n\r\ntaken by the Government should be open to all without having to\r\n\r\nresort to behind-the-scenes manoeuvring and prohibiting the printing shops to publish our party organ. Such action is only done by\r\n\r\nmean persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Culture mentioned\r\n\r\none  point - that as regards the banning of certain publications,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  organisers or sponsors of these publications  have\r\n\r\neither  run away or disappeared to foreign countries.  This  only\r\n\r\nserves to smear such people. Now, what other significance did  he\r\n\r\nconvey? He uses words like \"pro-Indonesia\" or \"Communists\" as his\r\n\r\nanswers  to  all  questions. Last year he used  the  word  \"Communists\". This year he also uses the word \"Communists\" in answer to\r\n\r\nall  the questions raised by the Opposition Members. This is most\r\n\r\nirresponsible for a Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government treats the people of this\r\n\r\nState  in  such a way as not to give them freedom of  speech  and\r\n\r\npublication, then the wishes and aspirations of the youths cannot\r\n\r\nbe  expressed  through  publications or  in  the  Press.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were to penalise the youths, it would only lead to the\r\n\r\nyouths  losing  their  confidence  in  the  Government  and   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic   system.  This  would  amount   to   the   Government\r\n\r\nsuppressing the youths and forcing them into a tight corner where\r\n\r\nthey  are  to  carry  on  their political  struggle  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction  by  the Government will cause the youths of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nlose their confidence in constitutional means and that would only\r\n\r\nreflect on the P.A.P.'s dictatorial actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we have\r\n\r\nseen the Barisan Members restating their past attitude and\r\n\r\npractice in this House of crying about the death of democracy in\r\n\r\nSingapore and claiming that there is no freedom of publication\r\n\r\nand speech. In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\nnow enjoying such freedom. Not only have they not made proper use\r\n\r\nof their rights, but they have also been misusing these rights\r\n\r\neven in this House. They have on many occasions praised foreign\r\n\r\ncountries and have now become the loud-speakers for Indonesia in\r\n\r\nthis House. Mr Speaker, in a democratic country the people\r\n\r\nwithin the purview of the law should enjoy all the rights of\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech and publication. These rights are most obvious.\r\n\r\nBut the Government will have to do its duty to look after the\r\n\r\npeople of this country and to see to their security, especially\r\n\r\nat this stage when we are faced with internal and external\r\n\r\nthreats. Internally, there are many anti-national elements making\r\n\r\nuse of this freedom to mislead our people in order to overthrow\r\n\r\nour legally constituted Government. We not only respect the\r\n\r\npeople's rights, but we also see to it that good publications\r\n\r\nwhich are beneficial to the people are safeguarded at all costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to spend some time talking about\r\n\r\nthe procedure for publications. Basing on principles of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, first of all, an applicant will have to get a licence\r\n\r\nfrom the authorities concerned. Later the publishing house can\r\n\r\nproceed to publish the publication. After that the Government\r\n\r\nwill review the publication. Censoring is done only after it has\r\n\r\nbeen published. Usually there are certain anti-national elements,\r\n\r\nand it is very clear from the Barisan Party organ that the rights\r\n\r\nof publication have been misused. If we were to have censoring\r\n\r\nbefore publication, then I think that the first publication to he\r\n\r\nbanned would be their Party organ!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI will briefly reply to the Minister for Culture.

He\r\n\r\nsays that the Barisan Sosialis have not been able to give a list\r\n\r\nof the publications which have been considered by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis as healthy reading matter. At that time the Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers asked the Minister for Culture to set up a Committee to\r\n\r\nlook into the list to see which was healthy reading matter and\r\n\r\nwhich was not and should be banned.
