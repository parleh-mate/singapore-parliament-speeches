The\r\n\r\nAct  serves to regulate persons who conduct the sale of goods\r\n\r\nor any other properties through open bidding.  We have looked\r\n\r\nat  the  relevance of licensing auctioneers today,  and  have\r\n\r\nconcluded that there is no need to license auctioneers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auctioning is a mode of sale. A good sold by auction\r\n\r\ncould  be  similarly  sold by direct sale,  telemarketing  or\r\n\r\nexhibition  sale.  Other modes of sale such as direct  sales,\r\n\r\ntelemarketing  or  exhibition sales  are  not  licensed.   An\r\n\r\nauction  sale  is  open and subscribes to willing  buyer  and\r\n\r\nwilling  seller  principles.  Buyers and sellers  enter  into\r\n\r\nmutually agreeable contractual terms in the sale.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  the  position to determine what  are  mutually\r\n\r\nagreeable  terms of sale without the need for another  safety\r\n\r\nnet via licensing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from auctioneers who are currently licensed\r\n\r\nindicate  that  the various trades see little  value  in  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  requirement.   The removal  of  licensing  is  not\r\n\r\nexpected  to  have  adverse impact on their  activities.   In\r\n\r\naddition, removing the need to apply for a licence would make\r\n\r\nit  easier for auctioneers to carry out their work, and could\r\n\r\nencourage more professional auctioning activities to be based\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the\r\n\r\nAuctioneers' Licences Act:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to change the title of the Act to Appraisers and\r\n\r\nHouse Agents Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to remove the definition of auctioneers and the\r\n\r\nrequirements   imposed  on  them  in  conducting   auctioning\r\n\r\nactivities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to remove any reference to auctioneers in the\r\n\r\nvarious sections of the Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to have the transitional provision to deem all\r\n\r\nauctioneers  to  have the appraiser and house agent  licences\r\n\r\nuntil 31st December 2000; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to amend the schedule to the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transition Measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a transition measure, auctioneers, who hold licences\r\n\r\nfor the auction of land and building and immovable properties\r\n\r\nand  are  engaged in the appraisal or sale or rental of  such\r\n\r\nproperties,  will  be deemed to hold an  appraiser  or  house\r\n\r\nagent  licence as the case may be until the expiry  of  their\r\n\r\nlicences  on 31st December 2000.  Thereafter, those who  wish\r\n\r\nto continue to perform appraisal or house agent services will\r\n\r\nhave  to  apply for the appropriate licence of  appraiser  or\r\n\r\nhouse agent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Council of Social Service or NCSS\r\n\r\nleads,   funds,   supports  and  guides   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations or VWOs and provides the crucial  link  between\r\n\r\nthem  and  the Government.  The Bill seeks to amend the  NCSS\r\n\r\nAct  to  enable the Council to remain relevant and responsive\r\n\r\nto  the fast-developing social service sector.  A decade ago,\r\n\r\nNCSS  had around 180 VWOs registered as member organisations.\r\n\r\nBy March this year, it had 259 members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments will strengthen the Council's ability to\r\n\r\nlead  and guide the voluntary sector effectively and  develop\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  in  social  service  provision.   This  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  all  Singaporeans who use the services  provided  by\r\n\r\nNCSS and its various member organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening the NCSS Leadership</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the provisions aimed at\r\n\r\nstrengthening the NCSS leadership.  The first relates to  the\r\n\r\nprovision for an additional Vice-President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCSS Act currently provides for one elected Vice-President who assists the President, and assumes the latter's\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   in   his   absence.     The    President's\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  have been increasing  steadily,  in  tandem\r\n\r\nwith  the  rapid development of, and demands in,  the  social\r\n\r\nservice  sector.   In  view of this, clause  3  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces  a  provision for a second  Vice-President  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed by the Minister, in consultation with the President\r\n\r\nof  NCSS.   Besides strengthening Board leadership,  it  will\r\n\r\noffer  the  President an additional avenue to groom potential\r\n\r\nsuccessors,  thereby  enhancing succession  planning  in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main change is the removal of the provision\r\n\r\nfor  three co-opted members on the NCSS Board.  These members\r\n\r\nwere originally included to bring in additional expertise  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board in specific areas (such as human resource,  public\r\n\r\nrelations and training).  They cannot vote and are not  fully\r\n\r\ninvolved in, and accountable for, the proper governance of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNCSS.   The Council would like to see all Board members being\r\n\r\naccountable  and  active participants.  The  proposed  change\r\n\r\nwill strengthen board governance.  With this change, the NCSS\r\n\r\nBoard will have a maximum of 23 members, from the current 25.\r\n\r\nIt will be trimmer but it will be stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Representation on the NCSS Board and the Council</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few provisions deal with the proper conduct of\r\n\r\nrepresentation on the NCSS Board and the Council.  Currently,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  prohibition against persons representing  more\r\n\r\nthan one member organisation.  This entitles some members  to\r\n\r\nmultiple  votes at the Annual General Meeting, if  they  hold\r\n\r\npositions  in  several organisations and  are  authorised  by\r\n\r\nthese organisations to represent them.  There is a risk  that\r\n\r\none   person   or   a   group  of  persons   could   have   a\r\n\r\ndisproportionate influence on the governance of NCSS.   While\r\n\r\nwe  have thus far been fortunate not to have encountered this\r\n\r\nproblem,  it  is  wise  to prevent it from  happening.   With\r\n\r\nincreased active citizenship, we can expect more people to be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  voluntary sector, and  in  more  than  one\r\n\r\norganisation at any one time.  Hence, clause 11 introduces  a\r\n\r\nprovision  to  prohibit persons from acting  as  an  official\r\n\r\nrepresentative of more than one member organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees of NCSS or member organisations are also\r\n\r\ncurrently   not  barred  from  serving  on   the   Board   or\r\n\r\nparticipating  in Board elections.  To prevent any  potential\r\n\r\nconflict   of  interest,  clause  3  of  the  Bill  therefore\r\n\r\nintroduces  a new provision to bar employees of the  NCSS  or\r\n\r\nmember  organisations  from serving on  the  Board  and  from\r\n\r\nparticipating in the election of Board members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Powers to Establish Institutions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS currently does not have the power to set up\r\n\r\nautonomous entities or institutions.  This limits  its  scope\r\n\r\nof  action.   Clause  7  of the Bill therefore  introduces  a\r\n\r\nprovision  to  empower the NCSS to form bodies  corporate  or\r\n\r\nincorporate or joint\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nventures to carry out its objectives.  I must emphasise  here\r\n\r\nthat  this  provision does not mean that NCSS  will  go  into\r\n\r\nbusiness.  NCSS will indeed remain a non profit-making entity\r\n\r\nfocused  on its primary mission, which is to promote, develop\r\n\r\nand provide effective social services in Singapore.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  change  would  enable it to  set  up  more  focused  or\r\n\r\nspecialised  institutions to achieve  its  stated  objectives\r\n\r\nmore effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such institution is the National Volunteer Centre\r\n\r\n(NVC),  the recently established national body for  promoting\r\n\r\nvolunteerism.  The NVC currently exists as a committee.  With\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  amendment to the Act, the NVC  can  become  an\r\n\r\nautonomous  entity  under the NCSS  Act.   As  an  autonomous\r\n\r\nagency, the NVC will be able to focus more effectively on its\r\n\r\nmandate  of  promoting volunteerism in  Singapore.   It  will\r\n\r\nenable NVC to establish its own administrative capability and\r\n\r\nso  operate  with greater speed and flexibility.  The  change\r\n\r\nwill  make for more effective decision-making and governance,\r\n\r\nas  NVC will be able to focus on all sectors instead of  just\r\n\r\nthe social sector, as is NCSS' mission.  It will also be able\r\n\r\nto  develop  a  distinct  identity and  garner  support  more\r\n\r\neffectively as an organisation dedicated to the promotion  of\r\n\r\nvolunteerism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maintaining Standards of Professionalism Among Member Organisations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS plays an important role in ensuring that the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations affiliated to  it  are  well\r\n\r\nmanaged  and  provide an acceptable standard of  professional\r\n\r\npractice.  As the voluntary sector grows, NCSS will  need  to\r\n\r\nplay  an  even more critical role in ensuring that  standards\r\n\r\nare  met.   Of  particular concern will be the  standards  of\r\n\r\nservice  provision,  fund raising, and financial  management.\r\n\r\nVWOs  provide services to some of the more vulnerable members\r\n\r\nof  the  community.   Clients therefore must  trust  VWOs  to\r\n\r\nprovide  sound  and professional advice.  The VWOs  are  also\r\n\r\nresponsible for making good use of funds generously  provided\r\n\r\nby  the community.  Although the vast majority of VWOs  fully\r\n\r\ndeserve the respect and trust of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity  for  their  high standards of professionalism  and\r\n\r\nservice, there may be a need for NCSS to nudge a VWO  or  two\r\n\r\nto improve its management or services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS provides grants and other assistance to its member\r\n\r\norganisations.   It guides the sector by issuing  guidelines,\r\n\r\nguide  books, manuals on operating concepts and  so  on.   It\r\n\r\nalso  guides  and directs agencies through its  selection  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  fund, through initiating new programmes  with\r\n\r\nselected  VWOs, and through consultancy advice.  However,  if\r\n\r\nan agency refuses to comply with guidelines on services or on\r\n\r\nother  management issues like finance and fund  raising,  and\r\n\r\nthis  leads  to a deterioration in services or mismanagement,\r\n\r\nNCSS can only remove funding.  It has no power to investigate\r\n\r\ncomplaints  or  inquire  into the management  of  its  member\r\n\r\norganisations  should the situation call for it.   Clauses  7\r\n\r\nand  13  of  the Bill therefore amend the Act to empower  the\r\n\r\nNCSS to investigate complaints, exercise control over and  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, discipline errant member organisations.  NCSS will\r\n\r\nthus  be  in  a  stronger  position  to  ensure  that  member\r\n\r\norganisations maintain acceptable standards of accountability\r\n\r\nand service provision.  In this way, NCSS will be better able\r\n\r\nto safeguard the interest of clients who require the services\r\n\r\nprovided  by  VWOs and the community which provides  generous\r\n\r\nsupport to these VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these proposed amendments will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the Board's position as the umbrella organisation\r\n\r\nof  the  social service sector.  Collectively,  the  measures\r\n\r\nenable NCSS to remain relevant and progressive in the face of\r\n\r\na dynamic and growing social service sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is really important that we have good leadership\r\n\r\nin  the voluntary organisations.  The very fact that they are\r\n\r\nvoluntary in nature, we tend to think that the people who are\r\n\r\nmanaging   them  become  less  accountable.   This   is   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily so.  If all voluntary organisations are to become\r\n\r\neffective  and responsive to the needs of not  only  the  low\r\n\r\nincome  families, but also other families that require  help,\r\n\r\nthen we should have an effective management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the amendments would\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  capacity of the Council to  respond  to  new\r\n\r\nneeds  and new challenges.  It is important at this  juncture\r\n\r\nthat  voluntary organisations, not only the National  Council\r\n\r\nof Social Service, but also other relevant community sectors,\r\n\r\nlook  at  how  they can meet the needs of those  who  require\r\n\r\nassistance.  And with the new issues and problems related  to\r\n\r\nfamilies,  children and young persons, it is  very  important\r\n\r\nthat  the  organisation undertakes a review to  see  how  its\r\n\r\nleadership has the capacity to mobilize the participation  of\r\n\r\nvolunteers  in the organisation and make it more  responsive.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  would like to find out from the Minister is  whether\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring  that is undertaken at  the  Council  will\r\n\r\nprovide  that  flexibility for it to  garner  more  community\r\n\r\nsupport  and  also to instruct and guide these  organisations\r\n\r\nthat are affiliated to the Council to meet new challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other crucial factor that needs to be addressed\r\n\r\nis  the  leadership in the organisation itself,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe leadership in the National Council of Social Service.  As\r\n\r\nwe  know, in most voluntary organisations, the leadership  is\r\n\r\ngraying.   Therefore,  it is very important  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  renewal  of  its leadership  in  the  organisation\r\n\r\nitself,  particularly the National Council of Social Service.\r\n\r\nSo  I  want  to find out whether these changes do  allow  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  itself  to undertake leadership renewal  within  its\r\n\r\nrank and thus encourage younger people to be involved in  the\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is the ownership of the National Council\r\n\r\nof  Social Service by the voluntary sector itself.  The  Bill\r\n\r\ncovers an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelement   of   nomination  by  the  Ministry   of   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment as well as by election process.  So I would  like\r\n\r\nto  find out whether these changes will, in any way, have  an\r\n\r\nimpact   on   the   issue  of  ownership  by  the   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations of the Council itself.  What I am trying to say\r\n\r\nis that it is very important that we ensure the participation\r\n\r\nof  volunteers  and  that  the  voluntary  organisations  are\r\n\r\nentrenched and further strengthened so that we will  be  able\r\n\r\nto encourage more people to take an active interest in trying\r\n\r\nto  promote  problem solving within the community.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister whether  the  ownership  by  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary sector is further enhanced by such changes that are\r\n\r\nbeing proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that note, I would like to support the\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the National Council of Social Service  (NCSS)\r\n\r\nhas  now  a  total  of   259 voluntary welfare  organisations\r\n\r\n(VWOs) under its charge.  The main purpose of NCSS is to help\r\n\r\nthe  needy,  the  handicapped  and  the  elderly  people   by\r\n\r\nproviding the necessary services to them.  It leads, supports\r\n\r\nand guides the various VWOs, and helps them to raise funds to\r\n\r\npay  for their operating expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCSS has also played a very important role as a\r\n\r\nbridge  between  the  Government and the  VWOs  so  that  the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments in the Government would  understand  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the people and to make prompt responses to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe needs of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment provides for an additional Vice-President\r\n\r\nto   assist   the   President   and   assume   the   latter's\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in his absence.  This will  provide  better\r\n\r\nleadership  in  the  Council  and  to  ensure  that  all  the\r\n\r\naffiliated  organisations will operate in a better  and  more\r\n\r\nefficient manner.  All the members of the Council must   make\r\n\r\ngood  use  of  the resources contributed by  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  to help those who really need assistance,  in  a\r\n\r\nfair and open manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the members of the National Council\r\n\r\nof Social Service are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nserving on a voluntary basis.  They do not get any salary and\r\n\r\nthey  sacrifice their precious time to help all the people in\r\n\r\nthe  society  who need their assistance and  services.   This\r\n\r\nspirit of love and concern for the people is certainly worthy\r\n\r\nof  our  praises and admiration.  With our population  ageing\r\n\r\nmore  and more rapidly, in  time to come, there will be  more\r\n\r\nand more people who would need such services and the National\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Social Service will certainly be assuming heavier\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in  the future.  There  should  be  a  more\r\n\r\neffective  channel  to provide such assistance to these needy\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, one of the local television programmes\r\n\r\nreflected  that  some  ordinary citizens  had  problems  that\r\n\r\nrequired  assistance but they did not know where to turn  to.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  with   the language barrier, they  found  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to seek help.  On many occasions, they went to some\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations for help,  but  were  turned\r\n\r\naway  as they could not make themselves understood.  Even  on\r\n\r\noccasions  when  they could communicate  with  the  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  officers,  their cases were not dealt  with  because\r\n\r\nthey apparently went to the wrong organisation, and they were\r\n\r\nnot   referred  to  the  appropriate  body.  It  was  a  very\r\n\r\nfrustrating experience for these poor folks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, we had a Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\npopularly  known  as Hock Lee Bor in Hokkien.   All  the  old\r\n\r\nfolks knew about it.  Whenever they need any help, they could\r\n\r\nalways   go to the Social Welfare Department.  But  now  this\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  no  more  in existence.   We  have  now  this\r\n\r\nMinistry  graciously  known  as  the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Sports.  To the ordinary citizens, this is  a\r\n\r\nmystery to them.  They do not know what this Ministry is  all\r\n\r\nabout.    I  think  we  should give more  publicity  to  this\r\n\r\nMinistry  to let the people realise that whenever  they  have\r\n\r\nany problem they can turn to this Ministry for help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we do not have a one-stop service centre for all\r\n\r\nwelfare  work.   Sometimes, if the members of the  public  go\r\n\r\ndirect to the individual welfare organisations, they may  not\r\n\r\nget the relevant one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  be  given the kind of help required.   More  often  than\r\n\r\nnot,  they would be turned away without any referral  to  the\r\n\r\nappropriate organisation  to follow up with the case.  I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  should  have  a  comprehensive  one-stop\r\n\r\nservice centre to provide better service to the needy people.\r\n\r\nWith  all  the  modern technology, computer and Internet,  we\r\n\r\ncould  easily  create a network that links  up  all  the  259\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  NCSS.  And with such a  better  network,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve the National Council of Social Service would be  able\r\n\r\nto  provide  better service to members of the public.   If  a\r\n\r\nperson  is to go to any individual organisation for help  and\r\n\r\nif  the said organisation could not be of help to the person,\r\n\r\nthe case should be referred to the headquarters in order that\r\n\r\nit  could  be  directed to the appropriate organisations  for\r\n\r\nhelp.  By so doing, we would be able to assist our people  in\r\n\r\na more systematic manner, just like what we have described as\r\n\r\n\"sending hot charcoal in a snowy weather\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have never experienced cold winter\r\n\r\nweather  and snow means nothing to us.  Maybe, we should  say\r\n\r\n\"sending  an  umbrella during a rainy day\".  During  a  rainy\r\n\r\nday,  when one needs an umbrella, let us provide him with  an\r\n\r\numbrella and he will certainly  appreciate it.  I believe  in\r\n\r\nsending  an  umbrella during a rainy day.  Our  young  people\r\n\r\nwill  understand that, because there is one song known as  In\r\n\r\nThe  Rain,  which  they sing frequently in karaoke  sessions.\r\n\r\nThey  will understand what it means to be offered an umbrella\r\n\r\nduring a heavy rain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Singapore is moving towards a\r\n\r\nhighly  urbanised and high-technology environment,  we should\r\n\r\nalso  not  forget  to  place more  emphasis  on   inter-human\r\n\r\nrelationship.  The Government has been leading  us  well  and\r\n\r\nour civil service is very effective, and we are ranked number\r\n\r\none   in   various  aspects  of   our  economic  development.\r\n\r\nHowever,  according to a survey by the HDB,  our  people  are\r\n\r\nfound to be lacking in care and concern for their neighbours,\r\n\r\nand social  cohesion among our people is not as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstrong as before.  We have not progressed in this aspect.  We\r\n\r\nshould  endeavour to enhance our social cohesion  to  develop\r\n\r\nthe  type  of  kampung spirit so that we would be successful,\r\n\r\nboth economically and socially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister would consider my suggestion,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  to set up a comprehensive one-stop service  centre\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit of our people who are in need  of   welfare\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is progressive and will augur well in enabling\r\n\r\nthe  NCSS  to  remain  relevant in the new  millennium.   The\r\n\r\nchanges  are intended to enable NCSS to lead and  guide  VWOs\r\n\r\nwith  speed and effectiveness.  That is important because  MP\r\n\r\nAng  Mong  Seng  has also stressed that.  Thus,  it  is  most\r\n\r\ndisappointing  to me to see that one major  element  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  addressed,  and that is, the size of  the  Board.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent  NCSS  Act provides for a Board of  22  members  plus\r\n\r\nthree  additional  co-opted  members,  making  it  25.    The\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment  is good.  It is adding  one  more  Vice-President  and  it has done away with three co-opted  members\r\n\r\nand that reduces the size to 23 members which, in my view, is\r\n\r\nstill far too large.\r\n\r\nI  am of the view that, with the amendments to be made to the\r\n\r\nAct,  it is opportune to consider streamlining the Board  for\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility  and nimbleness in  the  decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess.    Whilst  one  may  argue  that   there   must   be\r\n\r\nrepresentation  from  Council members, really  eight  members\r\n\r\nfrom  the full members and two associate members out  of  255\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Council really means very little.  The  Board\r\n\r\nis there to consider and make the decisions.  It is important\r\n\r\nto have representations and, in my view, it is more important\r\n\r\nto  ensure that there is a mechanism whereby the Board  needs\r\n\r\nmembers  on a regular basis, at least quarterly, if not  more\r\n\r\noften,  to  collect  feedback.  And  today,  with  electronic\r\n\r\nmeans, there should be constant feedback from members of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil to the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in my view, 8 from the full members and 2 from the\r\n\r\nassociate members have not much meaning except I would  still\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  at least 2 from each, so that when  the  Board\r\n\r\nconsiders matters, you can be assured that the views  of  the\r\n\r\nservice providers are being considered.  I notice that out of\r\n\r\nthe  23  members,  it  already  included  the  five  Head  of\r\n\r\nDivisions.   To  argue that there must be greater  or  fuller\r\n\r\nrepresentation from all the various sectors would just result\r\n\r\nin  a  very  enlarged Board which is going to slow  down  the\r\n\r\nprocess.  That  argument does not stand.  For  example,  just\r\n\r\ntake  the  Disability Division.  There are so many  forms  of\r\n\r\ndisabilities  and  where  does it end  in  terms  of  getting\r\n\r\neveryone represented?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister, while there is still time,\r\n\r\neven at the Committee stage, to amend the figures and I would\r\n\r\nbe  quite  happy  to see that the numbers provided  for  full\r\n\r\nmembers  and  associate  members  be  reduced  to  3  and   1\r\n\r\nrespectively.  So  instead of having the ten representations,\r\n\r\nwe  have four, and instead of having 23 on the Board, we will\r\n\r\nreduce   that  to  17,  which  will  certainly  improve   the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMembers for their views and support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the views and comments of Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo.  He asked whether we could provide further flexibility\r\n\r\nin  the  Council  with  the  changes  and  also  whether  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation is adequate.  Certainly, there is flexibility,\r\n\r\nas  has  been  alluded to also by Mr Ee, and the Board  could\r\n\r\nalways  seek the views of resource persons outside the Board.\r\n\r\nAnd  certainly in this IT age, the avenues open to the  Board\r\n\r\nto  seek views and comments from beyond the organisation  are\r\n\r\ncertainly there.  In terms of representation, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nadequate.  Mr Ee says that it is more than adequate and he is\r\n\r\nsuggesting that perhaps the Board could be further downsized.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are two conflicting views here.  In terms of\r\n\r\nownership and changes, there is definitely ownership, in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that you have representation by the various  VWOs  and\r\n\r\nthis has been there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  the  time  and  it  will certainly increase,  given  the\r\n\r\ngrowing civil society in Singapore and people wanting  to  do\r\n\r\nvoluntary  work  and would also definitely  want  to  involve\r\n\r\nthemselves  with  the Board.  I agree with  the  Member  that\r\n\r\nparticipation  and  organisation  are  important  and  proper\r\n\r\nrepresentation is also important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has got several views, both on the\r\n\r\nstate of the NCSS and also on the community although many  of\r\n\r\nthem  do  not really impinge directly on the changes  to  the\r\n\r\nAct.    But,  nevertheless,  they  are  sound  views  and   I\r\n\r\nappreciate the Member articulating these views. There is  one\r\n\r\nitem  though which the Member specifically wanted us  to  do,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  whether we could have a one-stop centre to  enable\r\n\r\npeople who want help to come to the centre and be referred to\r\n\r\nthe  proper  organisation  so  that  their  needs  could   be\r\n\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any member of the community could always come to\r\n\r\nNCSS to seek their help. But, more importantly, members could\r\n\r\ngo to the CDCs too. It is more convenient, it is within their\r\n\r\nlocation, and now that we are devolving more and more of  our\r\n\r\nfunctions to the CDCs, they have full knowledge of  who  does\r\n\r\nwhat and, therefore, could easily refer anyone in need to the\r\n\r\nproper organisation, and they have Mandarin-speaking officers\r\n\r\ntoo.   Quite apart from that, they can also go to the  Family\r\n\r\nService  Centres  (FSCs).  The Family Service  Centres  would\r\n\r\nalso  have with them the organizations that are available  to\r\n\r\noffer the kind of help that is needed by the persons who want\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked for a further downsizing of the\r\n\r\nBoard.   In  stating  this,  I can  appreciate  the  need  to\r\n\r\ndownsize the Board, the need for the Board to be trimmed,  to\r\n\r\nbe flexible and to move fast.  But at the same time, you have\r\n\r\nalso  views like that articulated by Dr Vasoo, ie, the  Board\r\n\r\nshould have proper representation from the VWOs.  In my view,\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  now proposed is not so much to  downsize  the\r\n\r\nBoard but to rationalise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe workings of NCSS.  But certainly, he will be watching how\r\n\r\nthe  changed Board will proceed and how it will work  and  if\r\n\r\nthere is need to further downsize the Board, I think that  is\r\n\r\nsomething which we can consider in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WIDENING INEQUALITIES IN SOCIETY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(MOTION)</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is absent.
