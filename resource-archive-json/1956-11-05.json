May I  add,  Sir,  that  the Government  has channels of information  which  are\r\n\r\nnot normally at the disposal of the general public?\r\n\r\nThey  are not aware that this is a dangerous quiet.\r\n\r\nThey are not aware that there has been a change  in\r\n\r\nCommunist   strategy.  There  has  been   intensive\r\n\r\npenetration into a wide field of otherwise laudable\r\n\r\nactivities  which is building up a  position  of  a\r\n\r\npowerful  force that threatens the whole future  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  government. The aim is to  control  the\r\n\r\nmasses  through  united front, of  workers  through\r\n\r\ntrade unions, of youth through students' unions, of\r\n\r\npeasants  through farmers' associations and  attap-\r\n\r\ndwellers'   associations, of  the   intelligentsia\r\n\r\nthrough    teachers,    literary    and    cultural\r\n\r\norganisations,   of  women  through   the   women's\r\n\r\nfederation, and of political Parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was confronted with this growing\r\n\r\nmenace when it took office last June, but no action\r\n\r\nwas  taken because we were biding our time and were\r\n\r\ngathering  more  and more news intelligence  before\r\n\r\nlaunching on our campaign.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my amendment had the overwhelming support of\r\n\r\nthis House which\r\n\r\nwas given in answer to my call which was contained\r\n\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And I move my amendment in the fullest confidence\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  receive the  full  support  of  all\r\n\r\nMembers  who  sincerely  believe  in  and  practise\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  This Government does not care  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  support of those who claim to love  Singapore,\r\n\r\nto  owe  loyalty to Singapore, and  yet  are  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  very best to destroy the security and  well-being  of  the people of Singapore. This Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not care to have the support of such  people.\r\n\r\nIt   is   better  that  such  Assemblymen   declare\r\n\r\nthemselves  here  and now so  that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore can know them for what they are  and  not\r\n\r\nwhat they pretend to be.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five Members, Sir, have so declared themselves and\r\n\r\nthe air in this House is the better for it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent events have since proved the justification\r\n\r\nand  wisdom  of the Government's action  which  has\r\n\r\nbrought  to  light the evil planning of  subversive\r\n\r\nelements  that  has been going on  to  build  up  a\r\n\r\npowerful force to overthrow democratic government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the commencement of the Government's action\r\n\r\non  the  18th September to the 24th October, before\r\n\r\nthe  riots  took  place, 15 persons  were  arrested\r\n\r\nunder the Banishment Ordinance and the Preservation\r\n\r\nof  Public Security Ordinance, and seven Communist-front   organisations  were  dissolved  under   the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance. This action was  striking  at\r\n\r\nthe  root  of  the evil forces. The Government  was\r\n\r\ngradually but inexorably winning the fight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th September the Singapore Chinese Middle\r\n\r\nSchools'  Students'  Union was  dissolved  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  exposed  the subversive  activities  of\r\n\r\nthis  Union in a White Paper which was laid  before\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly last month. On 1st October  Soon  Loh\r\n\r\nBoon,  ex-President  of the  dissolved  Union,  was\r\n\r\narrested  and this was followed on 10th October  by\r\n\r\nthe  arrests  of  four more Chinese  Middle  School\r\n\r\nstudent  leaders  and  the Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nrequired  the  Committees  of  Management  of   the\r\n\r\nChinese  High School and the Chung Cheng School  to\r\n\r\nexpel  142 students whose activities in the schools\r\n\r\nhave  been of a subversive character. On the nights\r\n\r\nof 10th and 11th October, large numbers of students\r\n\r\ncongregated in these two schools to commence a stay-in  demonstration of defiance. On 12th October,  at\r\n\r\nthe  request  of  the Minister for  Education,  the\r\n\r\nCommittees  of Management declared that  these  two\r\n\r\nschools  were  temporarily closed. On 13th  October\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education commenced re-registration\r\n\r\nof Chinese Middle School students for two temporary\r\n\r\nschools  to  be run by the Government.  These  were\r\n\r\nsubsequently opened on 16th October.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime several Middle Road organisations\r\n\r\nwere  becoming  increasingly  active  in  providing\r\n\r\nfinancial, material and moral support to the  stay-in  students. Of special mention, the Singapore Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers Union arranged comfort visits by parties of\r\n\r\nover   600  to  the  Chinese  High  School  stay-in\r\n\r\nstudents  on  20th October, and 300  to  the  Chung\r\n\r\nCheng  School  on 24th October, this  action  being\r\n\r\ncomplementary  in  nature to  the  similar  comfort\r\n\r\nvisits  paid  by  Student  Union  members  to   the\r\n\r\nstriking bus workers immediately prior to the Hock\r\n\r\nLee riots in May 1955.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mornings of 22nd and 23rd October large\r\n\r\ngroups  of  students, who were believed to have  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the two stay-in schools, picketed other Chinese\r\n\r\nMiddle  Schools in order to enforce a general  strike\r\n\r\nof   Middle  School  students  throughout  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBanners were exhibited which read:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A long term suspension of classes as a protest\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government's  insincere  reply  to  our\r\n\r\ndemand\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>At  the  same  time, there had been many  reports  of\r\n\r\nveiled   intimidation  to  prevent   the   successful\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the two temporary Government schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had been patient and tolerant so far\r\n\r\nand  this  had been taken by the student leaders  and\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  Middle  Road  bloc  as  a  sign  of\r\n\r\nweakness, which accounted for their increasing  tempo\r\n\r\nof  defiance of constituted authority. Something  had\r\n\r\nto be done, and\r\n\r\ndone  quickly,  to  prevent such illegal  activities\r\n\r\ngetting  out  of  hand and the Council  of  Ministers\r\n\r\ntherefore  decided  on 23rd  October  to  take  firm\r\n\r\naction  to  clear the two schools. On the evening  of\r\n\r\n24th October, in a broadcast over Radio Malaya, I said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The events of the past few days have brought to a\r\n\r\nhead  the  situation in our Singapore middle schools.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is not a problem of education; it is a matter\r\n\r\nof  discipline  in the schools, of authority  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  and  respect  for  the  legally  constituted\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore. No community can allow  this\r\n\r\npersistent  defiant and aggressive in  discipline  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   among   its   element   in   its   younger\r\n\r\ngeneration. Theirs is not a threat to any  particular\r\n\r\ngovernment; it is a threat to all governments of  any\r\n\r\nkind.  If,  in the name of democracy, any  group  can\r\n\r\nhold  the  Government to ransom until it  gets  everything  it  wants, Government becomes  a  mere  rubber\r\n\r\nstamp,  and  those who are the most  defiant  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw,   those  who  shout  loudest  and  bully   most\r\n\r\nthreateningly and persistently, will get  their  way.\r\n\r\nThis is the anteroom to mob rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student leaders have not only defied the school\r\n\r\nauthorities in the schools, they have organised a\r\n\r\ncampaign of misrepresentation outside the schools.\r\n\r\nThey have kept students in the schools to prevent\r\n\r\ntheir being reopened and to prevent the students\r\n\r\nthere from getting any proper education, even at the\r\n\r\nsacrifice of their opportunities of sitting their\r\n\r\nexaminations. They have mobilised the parents, some\r\n\r\nof whom have been glad to join in a political\r\n\r\ncampaign under the guise of supporting Chinese\r\n\r\neducation, and some genuinely misted by the\r\n\r\nstudents. They have taken to the homes the campaign\r\n\r\nagainst the new schools opened by Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThe two schools have therefore become a focus of\r\n\r\norganized resistance to Government policy. Parents\r\n\r\nare urging  Government to clear the situation in\r\n\r\norder that their boys and girls should be able to\r\n\r\ncarry on their studies peacefully, and not to be\r\n\r\nmade the pawns in a political campaign at their\r\n\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided that we do not want the schools to\r\n\r\nbe permanently infected with this fever, and carry\r\n\r\nthe fever into the whole community. We want to\r\n\r\nrestore the normal healthy temperature particularly\r\n\r\nin the schools where the fever can do most damage\r\n\r\nnow, and even greater damage in the future when these\r\n\r\nstudents are the bread-winners, the citizens and the\r\n\r\nparents of tomorrow. For this reason, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education has therefore today sent a leter to\r\n\r\nevery parent of the two schools to bring them home\r\n\r\nbefore 8 p.m. Thursday, 25th October. For the\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided that the schools must be\r\n\r\ncleared, that they must cease to be schools of\r\n\r\nindiscipline in the name of Chinese culture,and becoming real schools of peaceful Chinese Culture playing their part in building the democratic self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore of which we are on the threshold.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time (the morning of 23rd October) the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party had held three protest\r\n\r\nmeetings, the Farmers' Association had held eight\r\n\r\nprotest meetings,and the Civil Rights Convention Committee had held one protest meeting.Although some of the speeches made were virulent in tone, these organisations were saying in their speeches that the protests should be carried out by constitutional means; and the attendances and reception had not so far been such as to give rise to any fear of a\r\n\r\nbreach of the peace.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, 23rd October, further speeches were\r\n\r\nmade at the Civil Rights Convention Committee meeing\r\n\r\nat the 11\u00bd  milestone Yio Chu Kang Road, which were\r\n\r\nof a more inflammatory nature.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of 25th October, parents and\r\n\r\nguardians began to arrive at the two stay-in schools\r\n\r\nand the police removed barricades in order to enable\r\n\r\nthem to collect their sons, daughters or wards.\r\n\r\nAmong those who entered were officials of the\r\n\r\nChinese Schools' Students' Parents Friendly\r\n\r\nAssociation who were sympathetic towards the stay-in\r\n\r\nstudents and who aided with them in preventing other\r\n\r\nparents from taking their sons, daughters and wards\r\n\r\naway. The stay-in students had their own public\r\n\r\naddress\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsystem  through  which they constantly  whipped  up\r\n\r\ntheir own morale, and they denied a hearing to  any\r\n\r\nstatements  made over the Public Relations  address\r\n\r\nvans by singing or clapping in unison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 5 p.m. the P.A.P. held a protest meeting at the\r\n\r\nBeauty   World,  Bukit  Timah,  at  which   further\r\n\r\nspeeches  of  an inflammatory nature were  made  by\r\n\r\nLim  Ching  Siong and others, and it  is  believed\r\n\r\nthat on the conclusion of this meeting at 7 p.m., a\r\n\r\nnumber  of those who had attended went to join  the\r\n\r\ncrowds  assembled in Bukit Timah Road  outside  the\r\n\r\nChinese High School.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parallel between the build-up at this stage\r\n\r\nand  the  events  of  April/May 1955  was  becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly apparent. On 24th October, 13 days had\r\n\r\nelapsed    since    the    assemblies,    meetings,\r\n\r\ninflammatory  speeches  and  visits  of  supporting\r\n\r\ndelegations of students and workers (including  the\r\n\r\nbus workers) had been allowed to continue unchecked\r\n\r\nat  the  Chinese  High School and the  Chung  Cheng\r\n\r\nSchool  where  the stay-in students were  encamped,\r\n\r\nand it became clear that if a final appeal made  to\r\n\r\nthe  parents of school children assembled at  these\r\n\r\ntwo  schools  to remove them failed,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary that these assemblies be dispersed before\r\n\r\nthe  same pattern of events, as in 1955, culminated\r\n\r\nin serious riots and disorders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the situation, Sir, when the first riot\r\n\r\nincidents developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to take up the time of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  by giving a detailed account of  the  riot\r\n\r\nincidents,  as these have already been reported  in\r\n\r\nthe Press. I would like, however, to draw attention\r\n\r\nto some of the important features.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises of the Singapore Factory and Shop\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union  at Middle Road,  Hongkong  Street,\r\n\r\nBukit Timah Road and Bukit Panjang were raided  and\r\n\r\nseveral persons found therein arrested, among  whom\r\n\r\nwas  the  Member for Bukit Timah. The documents  we\r\n\r\nhave  found in the premises only confirm how  right\r\n\r\nwe  were in our decision to act in defence  of  the\r\n\r\npeace  and security of the men, women and  children\r\n\r\nof  all  races and classes in Singapore. They  were\r\n\r\nplanning further demonstrations in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndefiance of the law; and their documents are  full\r\n\r\nof  sentiments of the struggle. In one document  is\r\n\r\nthe   opinion  that  the  period  of  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nnegative struggle is over and if this time they  do\r\n\r\nnot   show  their  strength  for  struggle,   their\r\n\r\nfollowers  will be downhearted. This is what  calls\r\n\r\nitself  a  trade union, and not in support  of  any\r\n\r\nindustrial  dispute  or  any  improvement  of   the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  the working people  for  whom  they\r\n\r\nclaim\r\n\r\nto   exist.   It  is  a  pure  political   militant\r\n\r\norganisation dedicated to, and organised  for,  and\r\n\r\nemotionally attuned to struggle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Death in struggle is glorious\", says another\r\n\r\ndocument. Says yet another, \"We now understand that\r\n\r\ntoday  we  have to adopt a more violent  struggle.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  finally, another says, \"If we dare not  fight,\r\n\r\nthen  we  will be the losers.\" Is this the language\r\n\r\nof  genuine trade unionism; or is this the language\r\n\r\nof  a group of leaders of political subversion  who\r\n\r\nare  deceiving the workers and the public and using\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties  of  the working  people  not  as\r\n\r\nsomething  to  be  improved, but  something  to  be\r\n\r\nexploited and magnified and manipulated  as  an  instrument  to undermine Government so that they  can\r\n\r\nachieve  power?  Can  this exploitation  of   the\r\n\r\nworking man for selfish ends go further? In  taking\r\n\r\naction  against  these so-called  leaders,  we  are\r\n\r\nacting to save trade unions and trade unionism from\r\n\r\nexploitation. We seek, as we seek in the  schools,\r\n\r\nto  let them return to their basic purpose so  that\r\n\r\nit   can  be  more  quickly  and  more  effectively\r\n\r\nachieved  in  the interests of workers  and  pupils\r\n\r\nalike.  Communist exploitation of the  workers,  as\r\n\r\nshown  in  these tactics, is as bad  as  capitalist\r\n\r\nexploitation  and we, as a Labour  Front  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment, stand against both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported, Sir, in the Press, it is evident\r\n\r\nthat  the  students had been preparing  for  a  big\r\n\r\nvictory march.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of the Member for Bukit Timah has caused\r\n\r\ncomment  in some quarters. They were under  the  mis-\r\n\r\napprehension  that  an  Assemblyman  was  free  from\r\n\r\narrest.  There  is  no  such privilege  and  even  a\r\n\r\nMinister of the Government can be arrested for unlawful activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raids conducted by the police, Sir, on the\r\n\r\npremises  of  the Singapore Factory and Shop  Workers Union  and  the arrests of the leaders found  therein\r\n\r\nhad  brought about a significant change in  the  riot\r\n\r\nsituation.  There  was  an  immediate  subsidence  of\r\n\r\ntrouble.  I  leave it to hon. Members to  draw  their\r\n\r\nown conclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly before the riots, the Singapore Factory and\r\n\r\nShop  Workers Union withdrew $120,000 which  amounted\r\n\r\nto  80  per cent of their funds. Previous withdrawals\r\n\r\namounted  to only $28,000. Where this money went  and\r\n\r\nhow  it  was  spent  we have at present  no  concrete\r\n\r\nproof,  but  in the light of recent events,  one  can\r\n\r\nsafely  surmise the use to which this  large  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney has been put.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage to life and property was fortunately\r\n\r\nquite  small, in spite of the violence and extent  of\r\n\r\nthe  rioting, and this is mainly due to the fine  co-ordination  between the Police and the Military  and\r\n\r\nthe   imposition  of  the  curfew.   Of   the   known\r\n\r\ncasualties,  13  were  killed,  49  warded,  and   74\r\n\r\ntreated as out-patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take this opportunity to reiterate the\r\n\r\nthanks of this Government to the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the public for their fine co-operation and their\r\n\r\nforbearance of the hardship suffered by them  by  the\r\n\r\nimposition  of  a curfew which had been  forced  upon\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  our fight  against  lawless  and\r\n\r\nsubversive elements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Federation of Malaya for their\r\n\r\nfine  gesture  and  co-operation  by  coming  to  our\r\n\r\nimmediate   assistance  with  police  reinforcements.This   has   given  meaning  and  reality   to   the\r\n\r\nfriendship which exists between the two territories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Fire Brigade and the Ambulance service for\r\n\r\nrendering invaluable service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the City Council workers for the efficient and\r\n\r\nprompt  manner  in which they have cleared  the  mess\r\n\r\nleft behind by the rioters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Military for their immediate response to our\r\n\r\nrequest for help when our police were clearly  likely\r\n\r\nto be exhausted by the extent of the disorders.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMilitary  units were in position within a few  hours\r\n\r\nand  this  prompt and invaluable assistance  ensured\r\n\r\nthe early restoration of order with the minimum damage to life and\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our Police Force for their admirable restraint,\r\n\r\nhigh  standard  of discipline, courage  in  face  of\r\n\r\ngrave danger,\r\n\r\nand devotion to duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the events of the past few days have been\r\n\r\nforced on the Government and the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nalike,  by an irresponsible group who, after playing\r\n\r\na  long  time  with fire, have at last  started  the\r\n\r\nfire.  The  fact  that  they  talk  sweet  words  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and peace and constitutional  action  and\r\n\r\nhuman rights does not mask their real purpose or the\r\n\r\ndanger  of  their tactics. In taking action  against\r\n\r\nthis  group,  the  Government is not  attacking  the\r\n\r\nrights of trade unionists or farmers or teachers  or\r\n\r\nChinese  education. We are liberating  them  from  a\r\n\r\nform   of  political  exploitation  which,  like   a\r\n\r\nparasite,  grows  on the healthy  purpose  of  these\r\n\r\ngroups,  sucks  the health from the stock  on  which\r\n\r\nthey  cling and eventually kills it. We are  engaged\r\n\r\nin Operation Liberation from an actual threat and  a\r\n\r\nfurther possibility of tyranny on this island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all workers to co-operate with the\r\n\r\nGovernment in our Operation Liberation. They  should\r\n\r\nguard   themselves  against  so-called  trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders  who are out to exploit them for  their  own\r\n\r\nselfish ends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all employers to co-operate with the\r\n\r\nGovernment   in  our  Operation  Liberation.   Trade\r\n\r\nunionism is here to stay and any attempt to  smother\r\n\r\nit,  any  attempt  to exploit workers,  is  to  give\r\n\r\nfertile ground for subversive elements to thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all the people of Singapore to co-operate\r\n\r\nwith  the Government in our Operation Liberation  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can together build a happier  and  a  more\r\n\r\nprosperous  Singapore  for  our  children  and   our\r\n\r\nchildren's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Merdeka Talks</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I want to tell hon. Members that the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  re-opening  talks  with  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice has not been\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nset aside. Two months ago I had already been in touch\r\n\r\nwith  the Colonial Office informing them that I would\r\n\r\nbe  visiting London in the middle of December to  fix\r\n\r\nan  agenda  for the talks to take place  in  February\r\n\r\nnext year. I have only a few days ago been in further\r\n\r\ncommunication with the Colonial Office with  a  view\r\n\r\nto  expediting these talks. The present indication is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Secretary of State has  a  full  programme\r\n\r\nright up to late February. He has, however, indicated\r\n\r\nthat  he  would be pleased to see me in December,  as\r\n\r\npreviously  asked for. I am therefore not  yet  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to name a definite date for the  resumption\r\n\r\nof talks, but this Government has decided that if the\r\n\r\ntalks  are  successful  the new  constitution  should come  into  being  in August next year,  with  fresh\r\n\r\nelections.  The  new constitution  should  come  into\r\n\r\nbeing in August next year with fresh elections.  This\r\n\r\nis  in reply to the accusation of our opponents  that\r\n\r\nthis  Government is anxious to remain in office. This\r\n\r\nGovernment, is not anxious to remain in office.  This\r\n\r\nGovernment,  while in office, intends to bring  peace\r\n\r\nand  security to Singapore and nothing  is  going  to\r\n\r\ndeter  it. We will face the electorate when the  time\r\n\r\ncomes  and  it  is for them to pass judgment  on  our\r\n\r\npresent  action.  I  have  already  stated  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly that if fresh talks should fail, the purpose\r\n\r\nfor  which this Government accepted office would have\r\n\r\ncome  to an end, and there might be elections earlier\r\n\r\nthan August, 1957.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Let  me\r\n\r\ndeal  briefly  with the events which  followed  the\r\n\r\ndissolution of the Middle Schools' Students'  Union\r\n\r\nin which the schools were directly concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the Union had been dissolved, and\r\n\r\ndespite  my  warnings that the continued activities\r\n\r\nof  the Union were illegal, officials of the  Union\r\n\r\nunder  various pretexts continued to hold  meetings\r\n\r\nboth in and out of schools hours. They ignored  the\r\n\r\norders  of  principals and teachers, many  of  whom\r\n\r\nadmitted   that   discipline   had   broken    down\r\n\r\ncompletely.  On 10th October I therefore  called  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  supervisors and  principals  and  told\r\n\r\nthem  that it was my duty to see that the boys  and\r\n\r\ngirls  in their schools were able to work in  peace\r\n\r\nand quiet and that I did not see how they could  do\r\n\r\nso  as  long  as  there  remained  in  the  schools\r\n\r\nteachers   and   pupils  who  were   systematically\r\n\r\nencouraging others to flout authority. I  therefore\r\n\r\nasked  them  to dismiss two teachers and  some  140\r\n\r\nnamed  pupils. At the same time I issued  an  order\r\n\r\nforbidding  any assembly of pupils not specifically\r\n\r\nauthorised by the principals and requiring them  to\r\n\r\nexpel any pupils who disobeyed this order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to impress upon them that they could not\r\n\r\nhope  to maintain discipline unless they and  their\r\n\r\nteachers    dealt    firmly    with     acts     of\r\n\r\ninsubordination.  But,  I  said,  punitive   action\r\n\r\nalone  was  not enough. There were certain  factors\r\n\r\nwhich  contributed  to indiscipline.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nschools were far too large to be manageable;  there\r\n\r\nwere  children  in their early teens  in  the  same\r\n\r\nclasses  as  adults in their middle  twenties;  and\r\n\r\ntoo  many pupils whose standards of attainment were\r\n\r\nbelow  normal.  So  long as these  conditions  were\r\n\r\nallowed to continue, it\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould   be  difficult  for  any  staff  to  maintain\r\n\r\ndiscipline, and I therefore asked the principals  to\r\n\r\nsupply me with certain information which would  help\r\n\r\nthe Department to plan the necessary reforms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school authorities accepted as necessary my\r\n\r\ndemands  for disciplinary action and my request  for\r\n\r\ninformation. But not so the pupils. On the same evening,  large  numbers took possession of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh   School  and  the  Chung  Cheng  High  School.\r\n\r\nSupplies of food moved in and preparations were made\r\n\r\nfor  another  stay-in  strike.  Now,  this  kind  of\r\n\r\naction, as the students well knew, put Government in\r\n\r\nan  embarrassing position. Unless it was prepared to\r\n\r\nuse  force  to  expel  the students,  Singapore  was\r\n\r\ndenied  the  use  of school premises which  provided\r\n\r\nplaces   for  nearly  8,000  children.  The  numbers\r\n\r\ncamping  in the two schools were not known,  but  it\r\n\r\nwas  clear  that  several thousands  who  wished  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   their  studies  were  being  denied   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  do  so. This  time,  with  the  co-operation of two management committees, we were able\r\n\r\nto give them that opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th October I sent for the supervisors and\r\n\r\nprincipals  of the two schools and told  them  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  only  one alternative  to  their  being\r\n\r\ncalled  on  to show cause why their schools  should\r\n\r\nnot  be declared unlawful. The alternative was that\r\n\r\nthey  should  temporarily close their  schools  and\r\n\r\nsecond their teachers to the Government which would\r\n\r\nthen  be  able to accommodate in Government  school\r\n\r\npremises  those pupils who wanted to  get  on  with\r\n\r\ntheir lessons undisturbed. This they agreed to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13th October nearly all the teachers reported\r\n\r\nfor  duty and on the next day, the registration  of\r\n\r\npupils  for  admission to the temporary  Government\r\n\r\nschools began. It had been feared that there  would\r\n\r\nbe  widespread  intimidation and  a  reluctance  to\r\n\r\nregister  at the start, but the early response  was\r\n\r\nexcellent and almost 1,000 pupils had registered in\r\n\r\nthe  first  three days. Two schools were opened  on\r\n\r\n16th October, one for Chinese High School pupils at\r\n\r\nKallang\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nWest,  the other for Chung Cheng High School  pupils\r\n\r\nat  Fowlie  Road.  Both  these  are  new  Government\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  which  were  made  available  when\r\n\r\npupils in their morning sessions were transferred to\r\n\r\nthe  afternoon sessions in nearby schools.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthese children and their parents were put to a great\r\n\r\ndeal of inconvenience, but I had heard not a word of\r\n\r\ncomplaint. I am grateful to them for their excellent\r\n\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two schools were staffed by teachers from the\r\n\r\nChinese  High  School and Chung Cheng  High  School,\r\n\r\nunder  Headmasters  also from  these  schools.  They\r\n\r\nfollowed exactly the same syllabuses, used the  same\r\n\r\ntext-books as before, and were run in every  respect\r\n\r\nas  Chinese  middle schools. Yet we have  heard  the\r\n\r\nsame   old   lies,  endlessly  repeated,  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  destroying  Chinese  education,  and\r\n\r\noften  by people in responsible positions who  ought\r\n\r\nto have known better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the Government or its opponents who occupied\r\n\r\nthe  schools and by doing so effectively closed them\r\n\r\nto  other  pupils?  Is  it the Government  which  is\r\n\r\nintimidating pupils from attending either their  own\r\n\r\nschools or the temporary Government schools?  Is  it\r\n\r\nthe Government which has burnt down its own schools?\r\n\r\nWhat  sublime hypocrisy to accuse the Government  of\r\n\r\nattacking  Chinese education or any other  education\r\n\r\nfor  that matter, except a Communist education.  And\r\n\r\nthere,  of  course, is the answer. For these  people\r\n\r\nthe  words \"Chinese\" and \"Communist\" are synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe Government, on the contrary, believes that there\r\n\r\ncan be a Chinese education which is not Communist in\r\n\r\nany sense of the word, but Malayan in its loyalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me return to our temporary schools. After\r\n\r\nthe  first  few  days of registration,  the  numbers\r\n\r\nbegan  to fall, and it was clear that the main cause\r\n\r\nof  this  was  the campaign of lies and intimidation\r\n\r\nwhich  the  defunct Students' Union and  its  allies\r\n\r\nwere waging against registration. Yet what was asked\r\n\r\nof  those  registering? Nothing more than  that  the\r\n\r\npupil should report to the Registration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentre  with  his parent or guardian  who  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  sign a bond guaranteeing  future  good\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and the observance of school regulations.\r\n\r\nIt  involved no penalty other than the expulsion  of\r\n\r\nthe  pupil for a serious breach of school  rules.  A\r\n\r\nsimilar  bond is required of pupils at the  Catholic\r\n\r\nHigh  School  and it is difficult  to  see  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could be expected to ask for less in  the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the campaign of intimidation, the\r\n\r\nnumber  registering  continued  to  grow,  but   the\r\n\r\ninterference  with pupils from other middle  schools\r\n\r\nbecame  more  and more flagrant. Large parties  left\r\n\r\nthe  camp  schools to indulge in  a  form  of  moral\r\n\r\nthuggery  which is more dangerous in  its  way  than\r\n\r\nphysical violence, and it became clear that  further\r\n\r\naction by the Government was necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th October the Government issued a warning to\r\n\r\nparents to remove their sons and daughters from  the\r\n\r\nschools  before 8 p.m. on the following  day,  after\r\n\r\nwhich  the  schools would be cleared.  Some  parents\r\n\r\nheeded  the  warning, but when they arrived  at  the\r\n\r\nschools  they  found locked gates and barricades  of\r\n\r\ndesks.  These obstructions were broken down  by  the\r\n\r\npolice. Yet intimidation of the waverers amongst the\r\n\r\nstudents by their ringleaders and the 'sabotage'  efforts   of   members   of  the   so-called   Parents\r\n\r\nAssociation  made it difficult for parents  to  gain\r\n\r\naccess  to  their  children, and  few  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ntaking  them away. Some indeed, misled by the  lying\r\n\r\npropaganda   which  had  been  fed  to  them,   even\r\n\r\nencouraged their children in their defiance. Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Management  Committees, students  from  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  others anxious to see  the  schools\r\n\r\nopen  again  appealed to the students to leave,  but\r\n\r\nwithout  success, so that it became  more  and  more\r\n\r\nclear that the students would have to be evicted  by\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual eviction took place soon after dawn on\r\n\r\n26th  October after warnings had been ignored. Tear\r\n\r\ngas  was used and the buildings were cleared within\r\n\r\nhalf  an  hour without any serious casualty.  Since\r\n\r\nthen the premises have been occupied by the police,\r\n\r\nthough the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nGovernment  has  discussed with  the  Committees  of\r\n\r\nManagement the possibilities of reopening them at an\r\n\r\nearly date. To\r\n\r\nthis  end, the Chief Minister and I, accompanied  by\r\n\r\nsome  members of the Management Committees,  visited\r\n\r\nboth the schools on Thursday last. The intention  of\r\n\r\nour  visit was to find out how, soon we could reopen\r\n\r\nthe  schools - in fact, I wanted to open them  today -\r\n\r\nbut  seeing that the schools were in a shambles, the\r\n\r\nManagement  Committees agreed that it was impossible\r\n\r\nto  do so. However, at my suggestion, the Management\r\n\r\nCommittees   agreed  to  clean  up  their   premises\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not dwell upon the part which many students\r\n\r\nplayed  in  the  riots which followed the  eviction.\r\n\r\nThat is made clear by the large numbers of them  who\r\n\r\nwere amongst those arrested for rioting. I prefer to\r\n\r\ntell  you of the constructive steps I have taken  to\r\n\r\nget  the students into school again. As soon as  the\r\n\r\ncurfew  was  lifted,  I  opened  three  Registration\r\n\r\nCentres. This time a limit of four days was set  for\r\n\r\nthe time in which registration would take place. The\r\n\r\nmain  reason for this was that it would be  possible\r\n\r\nthe  more quickly to reorganise the schools and  get\r\n\r\nthem  running again if it was known how many  pupils\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  accommodated and in what  classes.  The\r\n\r\nresponse  was very slow at first, partly because  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  an  intensive publicity campaign would  have\r\n\r\nmeant  more delay, partly because many did not  know\r\n\r\nwhere  the  centres were. But the  daily  enrolments\r\n\r\nincreased   rapidly.  There  were  521  pupils   who\r\n\r\nregistered  on Saturday last. The total  number  now\r\n\r\nregistered is slightly over 2,500.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bare third of the numbers previously\r\n\r\nenrolled  in  the  two schools. Why  have  not  more\r\n\r\nregistered? All that was required was a guarantee of\r\n\r\ngood  behaviour. No one was refused admission unless\r\n\r\nhe  had  been  actively  engaged  in  subversion  or\r\n\r\nrioting,  and  even then a second  chance  might  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  any  young  pupil who  had  clearly  been\r\n\r\nmisled.   The   reorganisation  will   involve   the\r\n\r\nseparation  of older from younger children,  and  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  may be practicable, the breakdown of  over-large schools into\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsmaller  and more manageable units. All these measures\r\n\r\nare   designed  to  lessen  the  chances  of   similar\r\n\r\ndisorders in the future. What is not being done is  to\r\n\r\nanglicise  the  schools. They are  now,  and  will  be\r\n\r\nafter  the  reorganisation,  Chinese  middle  schools,\r\n\r\nbut,  I  hope,  Singapore Chinese middle schools.  Why\r\n\r\nthen  have  not more registered? There are three  main\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the widespread intimidation. There has, so\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  know, been no physical violence, but  many\r\n\r\ninstances  have  been reported to me  of  threats  and\r\n\r\n\"persuasion\".  And  even  when  they  have  not   been\r\n\r\ndirectly  threatened, many of the more  timid  parents\r\n\r\nand  pupils have decided that it would be more prudent\r\n\r\nto  stay  away  until  conditions  were  quite  normal\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there has been a widespread whispering\r\n\r\ncampaign which has maliciously distorted the facts  of\r\n\r\nthe  registration. Parents have been told  that  registration   meant  the  end  of  Chinese  education   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that  no over-aged pupils  or  pupils  not\r\n\r\nborn   in  Singapore  would  be  admitted,  and   that\r\n\r\nregistration  was  a cloak for Government's  plans  to\r\n\r\narrest  students.  It was even whispered  that  pupils\r\n\r\nwho  registered  would be put into prison.  All  these\r\n\r\ncharges  were  deliberate and malicious lies,  but  as\r\n\r\nother  countries  have found, it  is  much  harder  to\r\n\r\nrestore  confidence and trust than it is to sow  seeds\r\n\r\nof doubt and suspicion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, thousands of students, often under the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  mass emotion, have  taken  an  oath  to\r\n\r\nfight  to  the  end  against  registration.  Many  now\r\n\r\nregret  this  oath but feel bound by  it.  Others  are\r\n\r\nafraid  to  break it because they have been threatened\r\n\r\nwith  violence. I know of an instance  where  a  child\r\n\r\nwas   threatened  with  death  should  he  attend  the\r\n\r\nGovernment temporary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here let me pause for a little while and ask hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House and the public of Singapore  if\r\n\r\nit  is  their  wish that our schools should  turn  out\r\n\r\nwould-be  rioters,  intimidators and  murderers?  That\r\n\r\nthe  student  leaders,  backed by  an  outside  force,\r\n\r\nwould  not  hesitate to resort to  violence  is  clear\r\n\r\nfrom an editorial entitled \"We are waiting for it\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nissued  on 25th October and found on a blackboard  at\r\n\r\nthe Chung Cheng High School. It reads\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is now not the time for us to be afraid of our\r\n\r\nbeing  dispersed by force. Rather, it  is  now  high\r\n\r\ntime  for the colonialists to shiver with fright  at\r\n\r\nthe  bare  idea of the adventure they are  going  to\r\n\r\ntake. Ever since the 'May 13th' incident, the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore, particularly the students and workers,\r\n\r\nhave  been much accustomed to violence or bloodshed;\r\n\r\nmoreover, they have the foresight for the truth that\r\n\r\nall  violence or cruel act is sure to end in defeat.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whatever force or threat can never  shake\r\n\r\ntheir  determination to struggle. On  the  contrary,\r\n\r\nthey  will have more confidence and courage to  send\r\n\r\nthe militants into the grave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dare say affirmatively that should the\r\n\r\nauthorities  have  the  audacity  to  disperse   the\r\n\r\ncamping  students by force, Lim Yew  Hock  and  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee  would immediately be thrown out of  their\r\n\r\nposts. It is crystal clear to us that our subjective\r\n\r\nstrength for struggle has got extensively deep  into\r\n\r\nand  is  now lurking among people of every  walk  of\r\n\r\nlife,  particularly among the workers  and  farmers.\r\n\r\nThis  potential force is sure to explode once  there\r\n\r\nis  a  chance  for  it to do so.  If  the  students'\r\n\r\ncamping should develop into a universal demand for \r\n\r\ndemocracy,  freedom and human right  protection,  it\r\n\r\nwould be high time for people of every walk of  life\r\n\r\nto  launch  an  all-out mobilisation for  the  common\r\n\r\ndemand.  And the situation will then be more  favour\r\n\r\nable to us. For we will then get more closely united\r\n\r\nwith  them  and form a people's anticolonial  united\r\n\r\nfront  to bring about re-elections to smash  or  rout\r\n\r\nthe  entire Labour Front. By then, the blow will not\r\n\r\nonly be confined to Lim Yew Hock and Chew Swee Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubt that Chew Swee Kee has the audacity to\r\n\r\ncarry  out his threat. Anyway, if he dares  to  take\r\n\r\nthe  risk to disperse us with force, we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  face  the violence. The present conflict  is  no\r\n\r\nmore  that  of an egg against the rock but  that  of\r\n\r\nsteel versus the rock.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is the kind of language we have among the\r\n\r\npupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, let me put a very blunt question to the\r\n\r\nparents of the children.\r\n\r\nIs  it  their desire that their children  be  taught\r\n\r\nlawlessness and violence before they can distinguish\r\n\r\nright  from  wrong? Or is it their sincere  wish - and\r\n\r\nthe duty of any government - to see that their\r\n\r\nchildren get the education they want, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan take their rightful place in society after their\r\n\r\nschool days?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is probable, too, that many parents: have so\r\n\r\nlost control of their children that\r\n\r\nthey refuse to sign a bond. This disruption of\r\n\r\nfamily life is one of the things we\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave to fear from the spread of Communist teaching in\r\n\r\nour  schools. Let me read to you a letter taken  from\r\n\r\none of\r\n\r\nthose recently detained under the Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance : It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The general rule between father and son,\r\n\r\nmother  and  daughter  is not love  but  revolution,\r\n\r\nemancipation  and the new replacing the  old.  I  am\r\n\r\ntelling you this: the first duty of grown-up men and\r\n\r\nwomen is to declare the \"Independence Manifesto\".  A\r\n\r\nman  cannot  be  called a man if he adheres  to  the\r\n\r\nauthority of his father. A woman who obeys the order\r\n\r\nof  her  mother  is unfit to bear  and  nurture  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of a free nation.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the kind of education we had a month ago.\r\n\r\nThere  you see the nature of the evil with  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  contend.  When this  kind  of  doctrine  is\r\n\r\npreached, is it any wonder that parents and  teachers\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to maintain discipline, and  that\r\n\r\nyoung  men  and women - even boys and girls - are  to  be\r\n\r\nfound rioting when they should be studying? These are\r\n\r\ndangers  of which other countries than Singapore  are\r\n\r\nonly  too  well aware. The Federation Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  shown  his  support for our  action  in  a  most\r\n\r\nforthright speech recently. The Government  of  Burma\r\n\r\nhas  taken action against student unions there to try\r\n\r\nto  forestall  similar disturbances in that  country.\r\n\r\nThe  pattern  is  not new and the world  is  learning\r\n\r\nslowly  but surely to recognise the danger  in  time.\r\n\r\nEven in China today no student unions are allowed  to\r\n\r\nfunction without the guidance of the principals.  Let\r\n\r\nme  quote from the Jen Min Jit Pao (official organ  of\r\n\r\nthe   Chinese  People's  Republic)  and  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education directives on this matter:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Students' Association is not formed\r\n\r\nfreely  by  the students themselves. The idea  behind\r\n\r\nthe formation of the Association can perhaps best  be\r\n\r\nobtained   from   the  'Regulations   governing   the\r\n\r\nformation   of  Students'  Association  in  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchools'  promulgated  by the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nand  Ministry  of  Higher Education on  December  30,\r\n\r\n1955. The prominent points of the regulations are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the Principal, the Students'\r\n\r\nAssociation  assists  the  Youth  League  and   Young\r\n\r\nPioneers  to  respond to Chairman Mao's  call ... ,  and\r\n\r\nprepare  the students for service in the construction\r\n\r\nand protection of our Socialist mother country ...\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plenary session of the Association may be held\r\n\r\nonly  with  the approval of the Principal  and  the\r\n\r\nparticipation of the Principal\r\n\r\nand the Committee members of the Youth\r\n\r\nLeague ... \".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the factors I have mentioned - intimidation,\r\n\r\nlying  propaganda, the oath and the  disruption  of\r\n\r\nfamily   ties -  all   these   have   affected   the\r\n\r\nregistration. These difficulties were all foreseen.\r\n\r\nIt  was  known  that the fight would  be  long  and\r\n\r\ndifficult. The significant thing is not  that  only\r\n\r\n2,500 children have registered, but that as many as\r\n\r\nthat have done so. It means that 2,500 children are\r\n\r\nnot  only keen to get on with their studies and are\r\n\r\nprepared in future to obey school regulations,  but\r\n\r\nalso that they have had the courage to stand up  to\r\n\r\nintimidation. Over 1,500 are already in school; the\r\n\r\nrest will be found places, I hope, by tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committees of Management are already preparing\r\n\r\ntheir  schools for work to begin there  again,  but\r\n\r\nthe  conditions left behind by the camping students\r\n\r\nwere chaotic and some slight delay is, as I pointed\r\n\r\nout earlier, inevitable. As soon as they are ready,\r\n\r\nregistration  will  be  re-opened  at  the  schools\r\n\r\nthemselves  for a few days only, but under  exactly\r\n\r\nthe same conditions as before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then is the success of the registration\r\n\r\nscheme - that  it  has  provided  places  for   2,500\r\n\r\nchildren  in  Chinese middle schools - I  repeat,  in\r\n\r\nChinese middle schools - who otherwise would have had\r\n\r\nno  school to go to. It has shown beyond any  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not the Government which  is  killing\r\n\r\nChinese  education  but a mob of reckless  students\r\n\r\nand the evil forces behind them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not been an easy task with a very limited\r\n\r\nstaff  to  organise the registration, staffing  the\r\n\r\nclasses  and  the  timetables of the  new  schools.\r\n\r\nBehind  this operation, so much less striking  than\r\n\r\nthe  dispersal of rioters, there is a story of long\r\n\r\nand involved planning and endless hours of overtime\r\n\r\nwork on the part of officers in my Ministry and  of\r\n\r\nteachers from the two Chinese schools. We  are  apt\r\n\r\nto overlook their work in the greater excitement. I\r\n\r\nam glad to acknowledge the debt I owe to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have told you something of the Government's\r\n\r\nplans to restore order to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  Chinese middle schools and something too of the\r\n\r\nruthless  forces which still remain to be  overcome.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is fighting these and will  continue\r\n\r\nto  fight  them with all the means at its  disposal.\r\n\r\nYet  in  the last resort the solution lies with  the\r\n\r\nChinese  people  themselves.  Is  their  loyalty  to\r\n\r\nSingapore or to elsewhere? Have they the courage  to\r\n\r\nstand  up  to intimidation? There are many who  have\r\n\r\nclearly  shown  that their loyalty is  not  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  The Government has acted and will continue\r\n\r\nto  act against them. There are others who have  sat\r\n\r\non  the fence, and they include some in positions of\r\n\r\ngreat  influence who owe everything to this country.\r\n\r\nThey  are,  no  doubt, more subject to  intimidation\r\n\r\nthan  others;  by  virtue of  their  position,  they\r\n\r\nshould  equally show the more courage  in  resisting\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pay a tribute to those who have come out\r\n\r\ninto   the  open  in  support  of  the  Government's\r\n\r\naction.  I refer particularly to those students  who\r\n\r\nfirst  came forward to register and formed the first\r\n\r\nclasses  in the temporary schools; to those students\r\n\r\nin  other  schools  who  resisted  intimidation  and\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  attend school;  to  the  parents  who\r\n\r\nbraved  the mobs of students and took their children\r\n\r\nhome. These are the people we should be proud of.  I\r\n\r\nyield  to none in my admiration of the work done  by\r\n\r\nthe  Police and Services in quelling the riots.  But\r\n\r\nthe  final battle will be won by a display of  moral\r\n\r\ncourage.  We  must first tell the people  the  truth\r\n\r\nand  then they themselves must find in their  hearts\r\n\r\nthe  moral  courage to face it. The  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  led  the way. It is for the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto follow that lead.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                   \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SEAFARER'S WELFARE BOARD BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to create an authority for the co-ordination of\r\n\r\nwelfare  facilities for seafarers and to administer\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund\",\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr  J.

Unfortunately, that Select Committee was\r\n\r\nnot  able to complete its work and report the  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore the end of the session, and so that Bill has\r\n\r\nlapsed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one important exception, this present Bill\r\n\r\nreproduces  the  clauses of the  previous  Bill.  A\r\n\r\nnumber  of comparatively minor amendments of  draft\r\n\r\ning or on points of details have been made and they\r\n\r\nare  the result of the detailed consideration  that\r\n\r\nwas  given  to the previous Bill. The important  exception  is  the  omission from this  Bill  of  the\r\n\r\nprovision  which  was  made in  clause  47  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious Bill and that provision was that,  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of any Muslim dying testate after the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  force  of the Bill, the law of  Islam  should\r\n\r\napply.   That  clause,  Sir,  raised  an  important\r\n\r\nquestion of principle, namely, whether it is  right\r\n\r\nto enforce, by law, the observance of the teachings\r\n\r\nof  a particular religion by the individual members\r\n\r\nof  that religion. That clause would impose a major\r\n\r\nrestriction  on  the freedom of the individual,  in\r\n\r\nthis  case, any Muslim, to dispose of his  property\r\n\r\nby will in any way he pleases; and this would be  a\r\n\r\nradical  departure  from  the  previously  accepted\r\n\r\nprinciple  that in this community of many religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs  and  customs, while the  State  can  quite\r\n\r\nproperly  provide,  by  law,  facilities  for   the\r\n\r\nmembers of a particular religion to practise  their\r\n\r\nreligion,  the  State  should  not,  in  principle,\r\n\r\ncompel  anyone to do so but should leave it to  the\r\n\r\nfree  conscience of the individual to  observe  his\r\n\r\nreligious\r\n\r\ndoctrine  or not. Indeed, clause 47 of the previous\r\n\r\nBill was challenged in this House in the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading when, I think it was, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok  Ayer drew attention to the point  that,\r\n\r\nwhile  in his view it was perfectly proper  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a Muslim dying intestate without  a  will\r\n\r\nthat his property\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nshould  be distributed according to Muslim law,  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  right, in his view, that where  a  Muslim\r\n\r\nmade a will he should not be free to dispose of his\r\n\r\nproperty  as he pleased, whether or not it  was  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the law of Islam. This question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not to include this clause has  caused\r\n\r\ngreat controversy. I think it is well known that it\r\n\r\nwas  difficulty over the principle of  this  clause\r\n\r\nwhich  delayed  the  work of  the  previous  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee and prevented it from reporting the  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore the end of the session.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, that clause has been omitted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  present  Bill which is  now  before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  I  must accept  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nomitting  that clause, and the reason was  my  keen\r\n\r\ndesire  to enact, without further delay,  the  non-controversial  clauses  of  this  Bill  which  will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  be  of  great benefit  to  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  here. I was very anxious,  Sir,  to  get\r\n\r\nestablished without further delay the procedure for\r\n\r\nregistration  of  marriages and  divorces  and  the\r\n\r\nShariah  Court, matters on which we are all  agreed\r\n\r\nand  which are so badly needed, and I did not  wish\r\n\r\nto  delay getting these benefits to the Muslim  community through controversy over this one particular\r\n\r\nclause  and the two or three provisions related  to\r\n\r\nit.   I   hoped   that  perhaps  these   additional\r\n\r\nprovisions  could be made, if it was so wished,  by\r\n\r\none  of my colleagues introducing an amending  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  could be done after the Bill as now  drafted\r\n\r\nhas been enacted. But since the publication of this\r\n\r\nBill,  it has become evident that the vast majority\r\n\r\nof  Muslim  opinion is very strongly in  favour  of\r\n\r\nincluding  a clause on the lines of the old  clause\r\n\r\n47.  I  have  received very strong  representations\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Muslim Advisory Board and I  am  advised\r\n\r\nthat  the  whole  of  U.M.N.O. is  solidly  behind\r\n\r\nincluding a clause on those lines, and the views of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim Advisory Board have been supported,  to\r\n\r\nme,   by   the   Inter-religious  Organisation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Johore. We have therefore come to the\r\n\r\nconclusion that the vast majority of Muslims  would\r\n\r\nprefer  that  a  clause on those  lines  should  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBill  even at the cost of delaying somewhat its final\r\n\r\nenactment.  The Government has therefore  decided  to\r\n\r\nmeet the wishes of the Muslim community so widely and\r\n\r\nso  strongly expressed, and at the Committee stage  I\r\n\r\nshall introduce a new clause on\r\n\r\nthe lines of the old clause 47. In fairness, Sir, I should say that there has, of course,\r\n\r\nbeen opposition to including this\r\n\r\nclause, and this opposition is supported by a  number\r\n\r\nof   leading  Muslims.  So  that  hon.

The wording of the motion\r\n\r\nwill  not,  I  am advised, in any way  restrict  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee in considering other clauses of the\r\n\r\nBill,  but it will have the effect of inviting  them\r\n\r\nparticularly to consider including in  the  Bill  an\r\n\r\namendment to provide, as in the case of clause 47 of\r\n\r\nthe  old Bill, that the law of Islam shall apply  to Muslims  who die testate. As I have already  stated,\r\n\r\nit  is my intention, on behalf of the Government  in\r\n\r\nthat  Select  Committee, to introduce  an  amendment\r\n\r\ndesigned for that purpose.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that it will be useful, both for the Select Committee and in order that this matter shall be fully understood and the issues stated, that we\r\n\r\nshould  on this motion consider the principle behind\r\n\r\nthe new clause which I propose to move in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. I have already stated, in speaking on the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading, that there seems to us on this  side\r\n\r\nof  the  House  to be no question at  all  that  the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of  such  a clause  is  most  widely  and\r\n\r\nearnestly desired by the vast majority of Muslims in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It does, however, raise difficulties  and\r\n\r\nthere are two difficulties to which I should like to\r\n\r\nrefer briefly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the issue of basic principle. Is it\r\n\r\nright in Singapore to compel persons, who profess  a\r\n\r\nparticular religion, to comply with the precepts  of\r\n\r\nthat  religion? We must bear in mind, Sir, that this\r\n\r\nis  not  a  Muslim  State and hitherto  the  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  allowed  the individual  freedom  of\r\n\r\nconscience  to  follow his religion  or  not  as  he\r\n\r\npleases. For instance, it is not an offence in Singa\r\n\r\npore, as it is in several of the Muslim Malay States\r\n\r\nof the Federation, for a Muslim to drink alcohol, or\r\n\r\nfor  a  Muslim to enter licensed premises, or for  a\r\n\r\nperson  to sell a Muslim coffee during the hours  of\r\n\r\npuasa.  If  we  admit in this Bill the principle  of\r\n\r\ncompelling  a Muslim to follow the law of  Islam  in\r\n\r\nwills, are we then prepared to extend that principle\r\n\r\nand  to compel them to follow other precepts of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of  Islam?  And if we admit the  principle  for\r\n\r\nMuslims,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nare  we then to extend it for Hindus, Christians  and\r\n\r\nother  religious communities which we  have  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  That is the first important  question  on\r\n\r\nwhich  Members of this House, and I hope  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public, should make up their minds. The question\r\n\r\nof  principle - is  it right that we  should  compel  a\r\n\r\nperson to observe the tenets of his religion?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objection which has been put forward is a\r\n\r\nmore  practical one which has been put forward indeed\r\n\r\nby some Muslims who are against this clause; and that\r\n\r\nis,  they  argue  that a clause on  these  lines,  if\r\n\r\nenacted,  will  cause hardship to  Muslims,  because,\r\n\r\nquite apart from denying to the individual Muslim the\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  dispose of his property by  will  as  he\r\n\r\npleases,  the effect of this clause will be to  break\r\n\r\nup and fragment Muslim estates; so that, for example,\r\n\r\nif  a  Muslim who has built up a flourishing business\r\n\r\ndies, the business will have to be wound up and  sold\r\n\r\nin  order  that  the  proceeds may  be  realised  and\r\n\r\ndistributed amongst his heirs in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nMuslim law of inheritance. This, it is argued,  is  a\r\n\r\ngrave  handicap  to the building  up  of  Muslim  and\r\n\r\nparticularly Malay business and commercial interests,\r\n\r\nbecause  the energies and fruits of one man's efforts\r\n\r\ncannot  be carried on and sustained and increased  by\r\n\r\nhis heir or some person whom he thinks most competent\r\n\r\nto keep that family business going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further practical objection which has been raised\r\n\r\nis  that  the effect of applying the law of Islam  to\r\n\r\nwills  will be to throw into doubt a large number  of\r\n\r\nexisting  wills  and  may  therefore  lead  to   much\r\n\r\nlitigation  and  again hardship and  expense  to  the\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries of an estate. But, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  I have said, there seems to be no doubt  at\r\n\r\nall  that the vast majority of the Muslims - and  they,\r\n\r\nafter  all, are the persons most closely affected - do,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, want a clause on these lines  included,\r\n\r\nand  it  is in deference to that strongly and  widely\r\n\r\nexpressed  opinion that the Government will introduce\r\n\r\na new clause on these lines at the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that Members of this House will take\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  provided by this  motion  to  put\r\n\r\nforward their views for and against legislation  on\r\n\r\nthe  lines which I have referred to. That will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, be useful for the Select Committee, and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be valuable so that public opinion may be  advised of the intention of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, and it is this: if any Member\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly so wishes, he will have a further\r\n\r\nopportunity of debating this particular  clause  at\r\n\r\nthe  Report stage, assuming that we report the Bill\r\n\r\nback  including a clause on the lines  of  the  old\r\n\r\nclause  47.  He  can do so by moving  a  motion  to\r\n\r\nrecommit  that particular clause. But I hope,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat this morning we shall get expressions of views\r\n\r\nfrom Members on both sides of the House. Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I missed the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of speaking on the principles  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  Bill. Now I take the opportunity to  speak\r\n\r\non  this  motion which is item No. 4 on  the  Order\r\n\r\nPaper.  Although I am an Indian though born in  the\r\n\r\nMuslim   faith,  I  have  never  taken  any  public\r\n\r\ninterest  in  this  issue as I  never  argue  about\r\n\r\nreligion. I leave this to the religious experts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, representations were made to me regarding the\r\n\r\nclause  to  which the Hon. the Chief Secretary  has\r\n\r\nreferred  and other clauses in the old Bill  and  I\r\n\r\nhad to speak on a previous occasion and also in the\r\n\r\nprevious  Select  Committee on  the  Muslims  Bill.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not a secular State like  India.  The\r\n\r\nState religion is Christianity. Any Muslim can,  if\r\n\r\nhe  wants, make a will during his lifetime.  If  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  as per Muslim code, he is committing  an\r\n\r\noffence   against   his  God  and   his   religion.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  why should the estate of  a  Muslim  be\r\n\r\ndistributed  if  he  dies  after  making  a   will,\r\n\r\naccording to the Muslim law? This is one side of\r\n\r\nthe case. But in the Bill itself there is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmore  than one controversial point. Here is  a  Bill\r\n\r\nasking Muslims to follow the tenets of Islam. At the\r\n\r\nsame time,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  clause in the Bill which goes  against\r\n\r\nKoranic  rules. Since 1,400 years, no  man,  however\r\n\r\nbig,  has  been able to change the Koran. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  who  is  responsible for this,  Sir,  but  the\r\n\r\nproviso  in  clause  41 of the  Bill  is  definitely\r\n\r\nagainst the Muslim religion. For those who stand for\r\n\r\nthe   Muslim  religion  and  want  Muslims  to   act\r\n\r\naccording  to  Muslim religious laws, this  proviso,\r\n\r\nwhich is against the tenets of Islam, should not  be\r\n\r\nthere.  This was the main bone of contention in  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Select Committee. Sir, I had an  interview\r\n\r\nwith the Chairman of the Muslim Advisory Board and I\r\n\r\nhave  also received a copy of a letter addressed  by\r\n\r\nhim to the Chief Secretary dated 18th October, 1956,\r\n\r\nin  which the Chairman of the Muslim Advisory  Board\r\n\r\nsuggests  certain amendments, one of which  is  that\r\n\r\nthe proviso in clause 41 of the old Bill (1 think it\r\n\r\nis  the same proviso in the new Bill) be removed. If\r\n\r\nthat  is done, then the whole Bill is based  on  the\r\n\r\nlaws  of Islam and I wonder whether any Muslim  will\r\n\r\nhave any objection then. I want to be very brief  as\r\n\r\nthe Bill will be committed to a Select Committee and\r\n\r\nit  can  be  more fully discussed there. I  have  no\r\n\r\nparticular objection to clause 47. The fact is  that\r\n\r\nrepresentations on this clause have been made to me,\r\n\r\nand  as  an elected Member, it is my duty  to  bring\r\n\r\nthese   representations   before   the   House   and\r\n\r\neventually before the Select Committee. Some one has\r\n\r\nspread the rumour that I am against this clause\r\n\r\npersonally. That is incorrect. There are always\r\n\r\nmischief-makers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone will now be very happy that a\r\n\r\nShariah Court will be established immediately -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

One  of  the\r\n\r\nquestions  posed was, \"If we admit the principle  of\r\n\r\ncompelling  Muslims to follow the law  of  Islam  in\r\n\r\nwills, are we next to compel them to observe puasa?\"\r\n\r\nOn  the  face  of  it, Mr Speaker,  there  is  some\r\n\r\nsubstance  in what he says, but then there  is  this\r\n\r\ndifference. In the case\r\n\r\nof the former, non-compliance with\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nIslamic laws affects a number of people, whereas non-observance  of  the  puasa is a matter  between,  the\r\n\r\nperson  himself  and God. I do not  say,  Sir,  as  a\r\n\r\nMuslim, that it is a good thing not to observe puasa,\r\n\r\nbut it is definitely a lesser evil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been pointed out that Singapore is a\r\n\r\ncolony  and  not  a Muslim State and hence  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould not have Muslim laws on its statute book.  The\r\n\r\nsame  argument,  Sir,  can also  be  applied  to  the\r\n\r\nChristian religion and yet we have in our laws  today\r\n\r\nprovisions  which compel Christians to be monogamous.\r\n\r\nI  wonder,  Sir, whether this is a case of one  man's\r\n\r\nfood being another man's poison !\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.33 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, there are one or two observations which\r\n\r\nI  consider it my duty to make as Attorney-General  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion which is now before this Assembly.  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  Sir,  what  in  effect  the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee is being asked or indeed instructed  to  do\r\n\r\nis to consider an amendment to the existing law which\r\n\r\nwill  limit the freedom which every Muslim at present\r\n\r\nenjoys  under  the  law in common  with  every  other\r\n\r\nperson,  no  matter to what community he belongs,  to\r\n\r\ndispose  of his property by will in any way  that  he\r\n\r\npleases.   I   hope,   Sir,  in  making   these   few\r\n\r\nobservations, to avoid anything controversial, and  I\r\n\r\nalso  hope  that  what  I do  say  will  be  of  some\r\n\r\nassistance to Members of this Assembly and indeed  to\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee, if it should be appointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, I think it is important\r\n\r\nthat  Members of the Assembly should understand  what\r\n\r\nthe present law is. This has been referred to briefly\r\n\r\nby  one of the Members who has already spoken, and  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  House will be patient with me if  I  refer\r\n\r\nagain  to  it.  Generally, Sir, the  law  at  present\r\n\r\nemphasises and underlines the freedom of all  Muslims\r\n\r\nto  dispose of their property by will as they please.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is,  Sir,  that the existing law - the  Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance - provides that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing in this Ordinance shall be held to prevent\r\n\r\nany  Muslim  directing by his will  that  his  estate\r\n\r\nshall be administered according to the law of Islam.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, I think, Sir, has been the law here in Singapore since 1880 and that provision is\r\n\r\nreproduced  in clause 40 (3) of the Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nnow before the Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, another provision in the Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance which takes account of the law  of  Islam\r\n\r\nand this provision, I am referring to section 27 of\r\n\r\nthe Muslims Ordinance which again is reproduced  in\r\n\r\nclause 41 of the Bill which we are now considering,\r\n\r\nprovides, Sir, that in the case of any Muslim dying\r\n\r\nintestate,   the  estate  and  effects   shall   be\r\n\r\nadministered according to the law of Islam.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been some reference made to the proviso  which\r\n\r\nis part of that clause, but I am not concerned with\r\n\r\nthat  at this moment. So the present position, Sir,\r\n\r\nis that, first, all Muslims are free to make a will\r\n\r\nand  that, secondly, if a Muslim does make a  will,\r\n\r\nhe  is  free to -direct that his property shall  be\r\n\r\nadministered  according to the law of Islam.  That,\r\n\r\nas I have said, Sir, has been the law in Singapore -\r\n\r\nI  think  I am right in saying - since 1880. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nSir,  the law provides that if he does not leave  a\r\n\r\nwill,  that  is, if he dies intestate,  his  estate\r\n\r\nmust be administered according to the law of Islam.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have said, Sir, the law which I have briefly\r\n\r\nstated  has  been  in force in Singapore  for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  and  I  am  sure  that  Members  will  have\r\n\r\nappreciated that any change in the law on the lines\r\n\r\nwhich  the motion before the House now contemplates\r\n\r\nwill  alter  the existing rights of individuals  in\r\n\r\nrelation to their property, and will moreover place\r\n\r\nunder  a  legal  disability in  relation  to  their\r\n\r\nproperty  members of that particular  community,  a\r\n\r\nlegal disability which it is not intended to impose\r\n\r\non individual members of other communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Sir, if I may, to refer to one\r\n\r\nor two points of detail which might perhaps provoke\r\n\r\nsome comments from Members of the Assembly and I do\r\n\r\nso because I feel - I hope I am right - that the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee may be assisted by what may be said as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of some of the points which I am now  going\r\n\r\nto  mention. As I see it, Sir, any Select Committee\r\n\r\nwhich may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nappointed  in  accordance with the  terms  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion  will  have to consider very  carefully  the\r\n\r\nscope of the proposed new clauses. It seems to  me,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the  matters to be  considered  by  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee should include  the  question  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  to be done with wills which have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  made when the new legislation is to come into\r\n\r\nforce. I think, too, that the Committee, I suggest,\r\n\r\nwould  wish  to consider whether only Muslims  domiciled  in  the  colony should be affected  by  this\r\n\r\nlegislation.  I  assume,  Sir,  that  it  will   be\r\n\r\naccepted  that  this must be the case.  I  suggest,\r\n\r\ntoo,  Sir, that the Committee will perhaps wish  to\r\n\r\nrestrict the terms of the proposed legislation,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  to  be  any,  to  property  situated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  will  further  wish  to   consider\r\n\r\nwhether  wills  within the scope  of  the  intended\r\n\r\nlegislation  are to be invalidated  to  the  extent\r\n\r\nonly  that  they are inconsistent with the  law  of\r\n\r\nIslam. Sir, other questions will no doubt occur  to\r\n\r\nthe  Committee - I am sure they will - and indeed they\r\n\r\nmay be in the minds\r\n\r\nof Members this morning. These particular questions\r\n\r\nto  which  I have referred do appear to  me  to  be\r\n\r\nquestions  of importance and, as I say, if  what  I\r\n\r\nhave  said will be helpful to the Select Committee,\r\n\r\nI  shall be satisfied that what I have said has not\r\n\r\nbeen out of place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always\r\n\r\nthought that the time has come for provisions to  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  limit  the  powers of disposing  of  one's\r\n\r\nproperty  by will at one's complete discretion,  and\r\n\r\nit   has  been  my  view  for  some  time  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should amend the Wills Ordinance in order\r\n\r\nto  protect the dependants of a deceased person  who\r\n\r\nmay not be inclined to think of them and may wish to\r\n\r\ndispose  of  his property without consideration  for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of his widow and his children. The  Muslim  law, as I understand it, does, in fact,  insist\r\n\r\nthat  the  widow  and children  of  a  deceased  are\r\n\r\nprotected  in the disposal of his property.  It  may\r\n\r\nwell  be, Sir, that the Muslim law goes much further\r\n\r\nthan  I  would  be  prepared to go in  limiting  the\r\n\r\npowers  of  a  person to dispose of his property  by\r\n\r\nwill, but there is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncertainly  a  great  deal  of  good  sense  in   the\r\n\r\nprotection it seeks to give to the family against an\r\n\r\nunreasonable head of the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the question before us now, Sir, is not\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should  amend the law  of  disposal  of\r\n\r\nproperty in order to protect the dependants, but  we\r\n\r\nare  asked to consider a very radical departure from\r\n\r\nthe   principle  that  has  been  accepted  in  this Assembly,  that is, the principle that we must  give\r\n\r\nthe   fullest  facilities  to  all  races  for   the\r\n\r\nobservance   of   their   religious   customs    and\r\n\r\ntraditions.  In  this  case, the  Muslims  have  the\r\n\r\nfullest facilities for observing the law of Islam in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the disposal of property in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith the provisions of clause 40 (3) of the Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing in this Ordinance contained shall be held\r\n\r\nto prevent any Muslim person directing by his or her\r\n\r\nwill  that  his or her estate and effects  shall  be\r\n\r\nadministered according to the law of Islam.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the opportunity to do so, but what we are,\r\n\r\nin fact, asked to consider is whether they should be\r\n\r\ncompelled to do so : those Muslims who do  not  wish\r\n\r\nto  observe  the  law of Islam in respect  of  their\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are going from the principle of the\r\n\r\nfullest  opportunity for observance of  customs  and\r\n\r\ntraditions of religious beliefs to the principle  of\r\n\r\npolicing the enforcement of a religious belief. That\r\n\r\nis a very grave departure indeed, because, though  I\r\n\r\nwill  freely admit that, in so far as I am conscious\r\n\r\nof the laws of the various religious customs, at the\r\n\r\ntime  they were made they were appropriate  for  the\r\n\r\nsocial and economic circumstances then prevailing - it\r\n\r\ndoes not follow that they are appropriate today; and\r\n\r\nonce  we accept the principle of policing any aspect\r\n\r\nof  the  laws  of  a  particular  religion,  we  are\r\n\r\nthrowing    the   doors   open   for   very    grave\r\n\r\nrepercussions, particularly in view  of  the  plural\r\n\r\nsociety  and the many religions which are  domiciled\r\n\r\nin this territory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, Sir, before this House is\r\n\r\nasked to take a decision on so grave a matter, it is\r\n\r\nmy  hope that the Select Committee will also  advise\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nHouse  in  its  report of provisions  of  a  similar\r\n\r\ncharacter,  if any, and of the conditions prevailing\r\n\r\nin  connection  with  the disposal  of  property  by\r\n\r\nMuslims   in   the  following  territories   :   the\r\n\r\nFederation and each of the States of the Federation,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Pakistan  and Egypt.  It  is  true  that\r\n\r\nPakistan  is a theocratic State, Sir, but it  would\r\n\r\nbe interesting to know how they have dealt with this\r\n\r\naspect of Muslim law in these Muslim territories and\r\n\r\nto  what  extent this particular law is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nvalid and useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust, Sir, that we will not lose the lesson of\r\n\r\nthis  debate  and that Government will give  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  a law limiting  the  disposal  of\r\n\r\nproperty by deceased persons in order to protect  to\r\n\r\nsome extent their dependants at the time of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.47 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I most\r\n\r\nstrongly  welcome the motion moved by my friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague   the   Hon. the  Chief   Secretary   for\r\n\r\ndirecting, the  Select Committee  to  consider  the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of  the old clause 47. Certain  arguments\r\n\r\nhave  been raised against the introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nclause. One of them is that it is a matter of  basic\r\n\r\nprinciple - is  it  right  to  compel  a  person   who\r\n\r\nprofesses a particular religion to comply  with  its\r\n\r\nprecepts? Sir, organised society needs some sort  of\r\n\r\ncurbing,  and  it is recognised that  the  component\r\n\r\nmembers  of  an  organised  society  have   to   tie\r\n\r\nthemselves  down  with  certain  laws  in  order  to\r\n\r\nconduct relations with each other. These laws,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhave been derived from various sources, but some  of\r\n\r\nthese  sources are religion, customs and  usage.  In\r\n\r\ncertain cases the customs and usage have been  based\r\n\r\non  religious  laws,  and in  other  cases  probably\r\n\r\ncertain  laws have been based on older customs  that\r\n\r\nwere  prevailing  in  those tribes  and  people  who\r\n\r\nreceived that religion. But it is certain, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe  principle has already been accepted of  forcing\r\n\r\nmembers  of  an organised society to follow  certain\r\n\r\nrules  in  regard to their conduct with each  other,\r\n\r\nand  many  of these rules that are called  laws  are\r\n\r\nderived from religious laws.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what is wrong with compelling persons\r\n\r\nwho  profess  a particular religion to  comply  with\r\n\r\nits   precepts?  If  they  like  it,  if  they   are\r\n\r\nagreeable  to it, I do not think there  is  anything\r\n\r\nwrong.  Sir,  take the principle of any  legislation\r\n\r\nthat  comes up in any country, going before a  House\r\n\r\nof   the  representatives  of  the  people  of  that\r\n\r\ncountry.  If  the  representatives  agree  to   that\r\n\r\nlegislation  being put through, it  means  that,  according  to the functioning of democracy,  they  are\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  the  wishes of the people  concerned;\r\n\r\nthe   people  concerned  being  the  people  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  In  this  case the  people  concerned  are\r\n\r\nMuslims.  This  legislation will apply  to  Muslims,\r\n\r\nand  as far as I am aware, more than 99 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe   Muslims   in  Singapore  are  in   favour   of\r\n\r\nincorporating this clause in the Bill.  Sir,  if  we\r\n\r\nfollow  the  democratic  principle  of  this   House\r\n\r\npassing  legislation  for the  whole  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  applies to all the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen,  on  the  same parallel, Sir, if Muslims  want\r\n\r\ncertain  legislation which affects them only,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  any  reason why any Member of  this  House\r\n\r\nshould  not agree to it. The criterion by which  you\r\n\r\njudge  your  laws is whether they are acceptable  in\r\n\r\ncommon  sense. If a law is not acceptable in  common\r\n\r\nsense,  then  you say it is bad and  you  refuse  to\r\n\r\npass  it.  But if there are good grounds behind  the\r\n\r\ncustoms or the usage that call for the enactment  of\r\n\r\nthat  law,  then you say the principles  behind  the\r\n\r\nproposed  legislation  are good  and  therefore  you\r\n\r\npass  it.  But, Sir, what are the principles  behind\r\n\r\nthese provisions in the Muslim law which we want  to\r\n\r\nincorporate into clause 47? They are to provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  rightful heirs of a deceased person.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMuslim who makes a will has the right, according  to\r\n\r\nIslamic  law, to will away one-third of his property\r\n\r\nwithout  consulting anybody. So he has  the  freedom\r\n\r\nof  willing away one-third of his property  and  the\r\n\r\nrestriction applies only\r\n\r\nto  the  remaining two-thirds, and the law of  Islam\r\n\r\nsays that this two-thirds should be applied for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  his heirs who otherwise might  be  left\r\n\r\nunprovided  for.  It  often happens  that  a  person\r\n\r\ngetting on in age is sometimes\r\n\r\nsmitten with religion and leaves every\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthing to charity, or he may have a temporary quarrel\r\n\r\nwith one of his sons and cut him off his will, or he\r\n\r\nmay  get  into the clutches of a beautiful girl  and\r\n\r\nforget about his wife and children -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> That does not apply to Muslims only.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That is true. Sir, we have also\r\n\r\naccepted  the  principle of  compelling  Muslims  to\r\n\r\nfollow  certain Islamic laws, because clause  41  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is actually a derivation of an amendment\r\n\r\nto  the  Muslims Ordinance in 1924, and compels  the\r\n\r\ndistribution of the property of an intestate  Muslim\r\n\r\naccording  to  the law of Islam; but that  does  not\r\n\r\napply  to  other  communities  of  the  society   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If any person other than a  Muslim  dies\r\n\r\nintestate, his property is distributed according  to\r\n\r\nthe  old English law; but here you are compelling  a\r\n\r\nMuslim  who  dies  intestate to  have  his  property\r\n\r\ndistributed  according to the law of Islam.  So  you\r\n\r\nhave accepted the principle of compelling Muslims to\r\n\r\nfollow certain Muslim precepts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was raised as to how far we should go\r\n\r\nin compelling Muslims to observe their religion. For\r\n\r\ninstance, puasa was cited. I would say, Sir, that as\r\n\r\nfar  as  the people affected are concerned, if  they\r\n\r\nwant  it,  they  can have it. This is  according  to\r\n\r\npurely  democratic principles. The same answer  will\r\n\r\napply  to  the question - should we compel  people  of\r\n\r\nother religions to follow their religions? - and  that\r\n\r\nis,  if  they want it, they should have it. And  why\r\n\r\nnot?  In  fact, we have incorporated religious  laws\r\n\r\ninto  our  laws  in  many respects.  My  friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands\r\n\r\nand  Housing  mentioned just now that the  Christian\r\n\r\npractice of a man being  allowed to marry only  one\r\n\r\nwife  is  enforceable  in  the  Penal  Code.  If   a\r\n\r\nChristian  marries more than one wife, he is  hauled\r\n\r\nup  before  a  court  under the  Penal  Code  for  a\r\n\r\nbigamous marriage. That principle has been accepted.\r\n\r\nYou  are  forcing a Christian to confine himself  to\r\n\r\none  wife at one time! The section in the Penal Code\r\n\r\non bigamy does not read:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing in this Ordinance (or whatever it is)\r\n\r\ncontained  shall  be held to prevent  any  Christian\r\n\r\nfrom marrying more than one wife.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>It does not read that way, Sir, as pointed out by my\r\n\r\nfriend the Member for Cairnhill, and Muslims are not\r\n\r\nforced to distribute their property, if they do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to,  according to the law of Islam. (Referring\r\n\r\nto clause 40 (3) of the Muslims Bill.)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice in India, Sir, which is not a\r\n\r\ntheocratic  State,  is this. The  Muslims  have  been\r\n\r\nexcluded from that part of the Indian Succession  Act\r\n\r\nwhich deals with testamentary matters and disposal of\r\n\r\nproperty  and succession and so on, so that there  is\r\n\r\nno  express  legislation binding the Muslims  not  to\r\n\r\nfollow  their own religious laws. It is not the  same\r\n\r\nposition  here  in Singapore, because  you  have  the\r\n\r\noperation of the Wills Ordinance so that if a  Muslim\r\n\r\nmakes  a  will at present which is not in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  law  of Islam, that will is good.  But  in\r\n\r\nIndia  that  position  has been  neutralised  by  the\r\n\r\nexclusion of Muslims from that portion of the  Indian\r\n\r\nSuccession  Act which deals with disposition  and  so\r\n\r\non.  Case  law  in India has established  many,  many\r\n\r\ndecades back that, as far as disposal of property  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  where  wills are not in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nIslamic  laws,  the  law of Islam shall  prevail  and\r\n\r\nthere  have been hundreds and thousands of  cases,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  in  India in which judgment to this  effect\r\n\r\nhas  been given; and it is a recognised case law  now\r\n\r\nin India that that portion of the\r\n\r\nwill  which is in excess of what is allowed according\r\n\r\nto  the law of Islam is not recognised. Further,  the\r\n\r\nShariah Act of\r\n\r\n1937  in  India  states that where the  parties  are\r\n\r\nMuslims,  then  the  Muslim  personal  law  shall  be\r\n\r\napplicable  in matters of succession and other  major\r\n\r\nmatters  connected with Islamic law.  So  that  there\r\n\r\nagain is a positive direction to the courts that if a\r\n\r\ncase  comes  up  where a will is  contested  and  the\r\n\r\nparties  are  Muslims, then the Muslim  personal  law\r\n\r\nshall  apply. I shall quote, Sir, from Moolah's  10th\r\n\r\nEdition,  Principles of Mohammedan Law,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nrecognised authority in India:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Limits of testamentary power\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mohammedan cannot by will dispose of' more than a\r\n\r\nthird  of the surplus of his, estate after payment  of\r\n\r\nfuneral expenses and' debts. Bequests in excess of the\r\n\r\nlegal third cannot take effect unless there is consent\r\n\r\nthereto after the death of the testator.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>There, Sir, you have an answer to the point raised  by\r\n\r\nmy friend the Chief Secretary as to the breaking up of\r\n\r\nMuslim  businesses and estates. That can very well  be\r\n\r\navoided.  Even  though the will is not  in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  law  of  Islam and if those  aggrieved  are\r\n\r\ngetting less than what they should but if they consent\r\n\r\nto  the  extra portion given to others who should  not\r\n\r\nhave  got  it under Islamic law, then that bequest  is\r\n\r\nvalid.  So if a person leaves his business  to  a  son\r\n\r\nwhom he considers is best fitted to run it, and though\r\n\r\nthat  son's share of his property is in excess of what\r\n\r\nhe  should  have according to Islamic law,  the  other\r\n\r\nsons  can, by consent after the death of the testator,\r\n\r\nagree  to  the business being carried on by that  son.\r\n\r\nThere  are,  of course, other ways of overcoming  that\r\n\r\ndifficulty. Limited companies can be formed during the\r\n\r\nlifetime  of the testator, or the children  could  be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  partnership,  in  which  case  when   the\r\n\r\ntestator  dies, only that portion of the shares  which\r\n\r\nis  his  is subject to distribution, and the  rest  is\r\n\r\nnot.  Then,  of  course, there is  a  proviso  in  the\r\n\r\nIslamic law that one-third of the property can be left\r\n\r\nby  the testator to anybody he likes. He can make  use\r\n\r\nof  that  proviso to leave one-third to any particular\r\n\r\nheir  provided he obtains consent beforehand from  the\r\n\r\nother heirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now all the arguments answered point by\r\n\r\npoint. The final point I wish to make, Sir, is that if\r\n\r\na  Muslim  lady  marries  a Muslim  man,  she  has  an\r\n\r\nexpectation of a certain share of his property on  his\r\n\r\ndeath. She has that expectation because she married  a\r\n\r\nMuslim according to Muslim marriage rites, and both of\r\n\r\nthem  are  Muslims. Now if the law  of  Islam  is  not\r\n\r\napplied and the testator wills away his property as he\r\n\r\nlikes,  then what happens is that she may be  entirely\r\n\r\ncut  off from his will and then she will have lost the\r\n\r\nright of expectation to which she is entitled, because\r\n\r\nshe  has married a Muslim according to Muslim marriage\r\n\r\nrites. Sir, there is also an obligation on the part of\r\n\r\nthe husband\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  leave  the  wife her rightful  portion  of  his\r\n\r\nproperty  according to Islamic law, and if  he  can\r\n\r\nget  out  of  that at will because the law  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry does not force him to do this, then  he  is\r\n\r\nbreaking his obligation to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12 noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a\r\n\r\nmatter  on  which  I am very well  informed  but  I\r\n\r\nshould  like to make one or two remarks  because  I\r\n\r\npersonally intend to support the Muslim desire that\r\n\r\nthey  should  obstruct their economic  progress.  I\r\n\r\nshould like to explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally dislike very much the introduction\r\n\r\nof  any element of theocracy into a State. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  a  very  dangerous thing. My  objection  is\r\n\r\nbasically a Christian objection. I do not  want  to\r\n\r\nget into a lecture on theology, but there is a well-\r\n\r\nknown saying, \"Render to Caesar the things that are\r\n\r\nCaesar's and to God the things that are God's\"; and\r\n\r\nthat  is taken by Christians to mean that the State\r\n\r\nhas  its  proper  functions  and  you  leave  those\r\n\r\nordinary  day-to-day matters to the  State,  whilst\r\n\r\nthe  things that are God's are matters between  man\r\n\r\nand his God. If I acted on that principle as a good\r\n\r\nChristian,  I am afraid I should vote against  this\r\n\r\nclause  47  when it comes up before the  Committee,\r\n\r\nbut I do not think it would be appropriate to bring\r\n\r\na Christian principle to bear on a Muslim matter in\r\n\r\nthis way and I should use other methods of judgment\r\n\r\non it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help feeling a great respect for the\r\n\r\nMuslim community which is aware, and must be aware,\r\n\r\nthat this determination to follow strictly the  law\r\n\r\nlaid  down for the distribution of camels and goats\r\n\r\nin  the  deserts  of  Arabia is  not  really  quite\r\n\r\nappropriate in dealing with stocks and  shares  and\r\n\r\ninstallations of machinery and that kind  of  thing\r\n\r\nin a\r\n\r\nmodern technological State. They must also be aware\r\n\r\nthat  it is a difficult law to apply and one  which\r\n\r\nwill be economically difficult for their community.\r\n\r\nI honour\r\n\r\nvery highly their willingness to make sacrifices of\r\n\r\nwealth  and expectations of profit in the interests\r\n\r\nof their faith, and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nI think that is a factor which should be given full\r\n\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Socialist, I also see certain socialist\r\n\r\nadvantages  in  it. I have pointed  out  that  this\r\n\r\nMuslim  religious law is inappropriate in a  modern\r\n\r\ncapitalist State. I do not think it will  have  any\r\n\r\nparticular bad effect if we have a fully  Socialist\r\n\r\nState   because   there  will   be   nothing   very\r\n\r\nsignificant  to leave in your will, and  therefore,\r\n\r\nas  far  as it goes, this Muslim law would  fit  in\r\n\r\nquite  happily with a Socialist State which I  hope\r\n\r\nsome day we shall establish. For those reasons, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I personally intend to give my voice  for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it be an instruction to the Select Committee\r\n\r\non  the Muslims Bill to consider amendments to  the\r\n\r\nBill to provide that no Muslim shall dispose of his\r\n\r\nproperty  by will except in accordance with  Muslim\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Members will note that, in some cases,  over-\r\n\r\nexpenditure   has  occurred  because   bills   have\r\n\r\ninadvertently been debited to the wrong  votes.  It\r\n\r\nis not\r\n\r\nreally surprising. I do not know exactly how many\r\n\r\nbills, vouchers, etc. the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfinancial clerks of Government have to deal with  in\r\n\r\nthe  course of a year but it must run into  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  thousands. These minor inadvertencies are  bound\r\n\r\nto  occur. What is surprising is that they occur  so\r\n\r\ninfrequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule contains eight items and only one of\r\n\r\nthese  items is for a sizeable amount. That item  is No. 368  which refers to the Regional Fisheries  Research  Laboratory at Changi. There has  been  over-expenditure to the extent of $657,624, all of  which\r\n\r\nis   recoverable   from  Colonial  Development   and\r\n\r\nWelfare  funds.  Hon.  Members  may  ask  why  over-expenditure  of  this  amount  occurred  without  an\r\n\r\napplication for supplementary provision being  made.\r\n\r\nI  asked  the  same question when my  attention  was\r\n\r\ndrawn to the matter early this year. Enquiries  were\r\n\r\nmade  and it is clear that the omission was  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the eminent scientist in  charge  of\r\n\r\nthe  station  was not completely familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of financial General Orders and to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that he spent much of the latter part of  1955\r\n\r\nat  sea  with  the research vessel  the  arrival  of\r\n\r\nwhich  he  had  anxiously waited for  so  long.  The\r\n\r\nofficer  concerned  has had his attention  drawn  to\r\n\r\nthe  requirements  of financial  General  Orders  in\r\n\r\nthis connection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over-expenditure in connection with the Cambodian\r\n\r\nTrade  Fair was permitted as it was clear  that  the\r\n\r\noriginal  Singapore provision would not be  exceeded\r\n\r\nand  that  it  seemed  better to  wait  until  exact\r\n\r\nrequirements     were    known    before     seeking\r\n\r\nsupplementary provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee of Supply</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  new   rates\r\n\r\nproposed  are set out in detail in the  Schedule  to\r\n\r\nmy motion on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme was drawn\r\n\r\nup   in  1941  to  provide  for  granting  pensions,\r\n\r\nallowances  and gratuities to members of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  organisations  who suffered  injury  during\r\n\r\nthe  war  or to the dependants of those of them  who\r\n\r\nwere  killed  or  died  and  that  Scheme  was  also\r\n\r\napplied to the armed volunteer forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the basis of calculating pensions and\r\n\r\nallowances under that Scheme was the normal  monthly\r\n\r\nearnings  of  the person concerned at  the  time  of\r\n\r\ninjury  or  death. With the marked decrease  in  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  money  after the war, it was  immediately\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  supplement these very small  pensions\r\n\r\nand  allowances  by a Cost of Living  Allowance.  So\r\n\r\nCost  of  Living Allowances on these  pensions  were\r\n\r\nintroduced  and  approved by  a  resolution  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council in 1949, the rates coming  into\r\n\r\nforce with effect from the 1st of January, 1948.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time, those rates of Cost of Living Allowances\r\n\r\non  these  pensions were in line with  the  Cost  of\r\n\r\nLiving  Allowances  paid on the ordinary  Government\r\n\r\nservice  pensions. Since then, however,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen   revised   and  increased   Cost   of   Living\r\n\r\nAllowances  and  other allowances  on  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nGovernment pensions and this motion that I now  move\r\n\r\nseeks  to  get  approval for new rates  of  Cost  of\r\n\r\nLiving  Allowances for pensions under  the  Personal\r\n\r\nInjuries  Scheme which would bring those  allowances\r\n\r\nagain   into  line  with  the  allowances  paid   on\r\n\r\nordinary  Government service pensions in so  far  as\r\n\r\nthat  is  possible.  I say in  so  far  as  that  is\r\n\r\npossible   because  there  are  certain  fundamental\r\n\r\ndifferences between pensions under this\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nPersonal  Injuries  Scheme and ordinary  Government\r\n\r\npensions.  For instance, one, whereas  an  ordinary\r\n\r\nGovernment service pension depends upon the  length\r\n\r\nof  service  and the salary of the officer  on  his\r\n\r\nretirement and there is no change in the amount  of\r\n\r\npension  according  to  whether  the  officer   has\r\n\r\ndependants,  pensions under the  Personal  Injuries\r\n\r\nScheme   are  provided  for  wives  and   dependant\r\n\r\nchildren, so that, therefore, while Cost of  Living\r\n\r\nAllowances  on  service pensions  take  account  of\r\n\r\nfamily circumstances, Cost of Living Allowance on\r\n\r\nthese pensions do not, because the pension itself\r\n\r\ntakes that into account.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general effect of the increases now proposed\r\n\r\nis  to increase the total amounts payable under the\r\n\r\nScheme  by  about  30 per cent.  The  exact  amount\r\n\r\nvaries  in each case according to the circumstances\r\n\r\nof  the  pension. There has been, I  am  afraid,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of delay in working out these  revised\r\n\r\nrates  and  in  solving a number of  administrative\r\n\r\nproblems connected with them and, for this  reason,\r\n\r\nwe  have  felt it justified to bring the new  rates\r\n\r\ninto force with effect from the 1st of January.  As\r\n\r\nmy friend the Hon. the Financial Secretary had just\r\n\r\nstated,  the  money to pay what is required  during\r\n\r\nthe current year will be included in an application\r\n\r\nwhich  he  will  make  immediately  following  this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the rates of Cost of Living Allowance payable on current pensions and on such future\r\n\r\npensions  as  may  be  awarded under  the  Personal\r\n\r\nInjuries (Civilians) Scheme, 1941,\r\n\r\nshall,  by resolution of this Assembly, be  revised\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with  the  rates  set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  annexed hereto as from the  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1955,   or,  in  the  cases  of  pensions   awarded\r\n\r\nsubsequent to the 1st January, 1955, from the  date\r\n\r\nof the award of the pension.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465 & 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n<center>SCHEDULE</center>\r\n\r\nProposed revised rates of Cost of Living Allowance to be paid on pensions awarded under the Personal\r\n\r\nInjuries (Civilians) Scheme, 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Amount              Proposed         Amount            Proposed\r\n\r\n     of              Cost of Living       of            Cost of Living\r\n\r\n  Pension             Allowance        Pension           Allowance\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n   $   c.                $   c.         $   c.              $   c.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Not exceeding\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   5  00                16  00         52  00              55  80\r\n\r\n   6  00                17  00         53  00              56  20\r\n\r\n   7  00                18  00         54  00              56  60\r\n\r\n   8  00                19  00         55  00              57  00\r\n\r\n   9  00                20  00         56  00              57  40\r\n\r\n  10  00                21  00         57  00              57  80\r\n\r\n  11  00                22  00         58  00              58  20\r\n\r\n  12  00                23  00         59  00              58  60\r\n\r\n  13  00                24  00         60  00              59  00\r\n\r\n  14  00                25  00         61  00              59  40\r\n\r\n  25  00                35  00         72  00              63  80\r\n\r\n  26  00                35  80         73  00              64  20\r\n\r\n  27  00                36  60         74  00              64  60\r\n\r\n  28  00                37  40         75  00              65  00\r\n\r\n  29  00                38  20         76  00              65  40\r\n\r\n  30  00                39  00         77  00              65  80\r\n\r\n  31  00                39  80         78  00              66  20\r\n\r\n  32  00                40  60         79  00              66  60\r\n\r\n  33  00                41  40         80  00              67  00\r\n\r\n  34  00                42  20         81  00              67  40\r\n\r\n  35  00                43  00         82  00              67  80\r\n\r\n  36  00                43  80         83  00              68  20\r\n\r\n  37  00                44  60         84  00              68  60\r\n\r\n  38  00                45  40         85  00              69  00\r\n\r\n  39  00                46  20         86  00              69  40\r\n\r\n  40  00                47  00         87  00              69  80\r\n\r\n  41  00                47  80         88  00              70  20\r\n\r\n  42  00                48  60         89  00              70  60\r\n\r\n  43  00                49  40         90  00              71  00\r\n\r\n  44  00                50  20         91  00              71  40\r\n\r\n  45  00                51  00         92  00              71  80\r\n\r\n  46  00                51  80         93  00              72  20\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467 & 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Schedule -

Hart):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's\r\n\r\nauthority to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of\r\n\r\nS1,457,350  shall be supplied to  the  Government\r\n\r\nunder  the  heads  of  expenditure  and  for   the\r\n\r\nservices  specified in the Schedule  contained  in\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Cmd. 60 of 1956.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the most important items in this\r\n\r\npaper are Nos. 359 and 360. These seek provision to\r\n\r\nenable the revision of service pensions to be implemented. The question of the revision of service  of\r\n\r\npensions has been outstanding for some time and the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front Government undertook to  examine  the\r\n\r\nmatter shortly after taking office. At that time, a\r\n\r\ncommittee of the Federation Government was  already\r\n\r\nengaged  in examining the matter. Pension  revision\r\n\r\nhas always been taken on a pan-Malayan basis and it\r\n\r\nwas   decided   to  await  the  outcome   of   this\r\n\r\nexamination before taking action in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation committee reported towards the end\r\n\r\nof   1955.  It  recommended  a  revision   of   the\r\n\r\nAdjustment  Allowances paid on  pensions  in  issue\r\n\r\nbefore August, 1947, and the introduction of a  new\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Allowance to all pensions  in  issue\r\n\r\nbefore the 1st of January, 1955. A later committee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nalso   recommended   the  consolidation   of   all\r\n\r\nallowances and pensions and the revision  of  Cost\r\n\r\nof  Living  Allowance  paid on  post-consolidation\r\n\r\npensions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations with regard to Adjustment and\r\n\r\nSupplementary Allowances were subsequently accepted\r\n\r\nby  the  Federation Government and introduced  with\r\n\r\neffect  from  the  1st  of  January,  1955.   These\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been drawn up in the light  of\r\n\r\nFederation conditions and it was necessary to  find\r\n\r\nout  whether  they  could be applied  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwithout  modification or whether some  modification\r\n\r\nwas   required.  This  examination  has  now   been\r\n\r\nconcluded  and  it has been decided to  follow  the\r\n\r\nFederation  recommendations with regard  to  Adjustment Allowance and Supplementary Allowance in broad\r\n\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adjustment Allowance introduced in 1950 with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1947  rose to a maximum  of  $25  per\r\n\r\nmensem  on pensions of between $150 per mensem  and\r\n\r\n$180  per  mensem  and then gradually  tapered  off\r\n\r\nuntil it disappeared altogether on pensions of $320\r\n\r\nper  mensem and over. The reason why the  allowance\r\n\r\nwas  tapered  off  in  this way  was  that  it  was\r\n\r\nconsidered at that time that pensions of  $320  per\r\n\r\nmensem  and over were adequate and did not  require\r\n\r\nrevision.   Subsequently,   however,   doubt    was\r\n\r\nexpressed about the propriety of tapering  off  the\r\n\r\nallowance\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  this  way. It was considered that the principle\r\n\r\nof   adjustment  should  have  been  carried  right\r\n\r\nthrough  the  scale. When Complementary  Allowances\r\n\r\nwere  introduced in 1953, the principle of tapering\r\n\r\noff was abandoned and the allowance was applied  to\r\n\r\nthe  whole  scale subject to a ceiling of  $60  per\r\n\r\nmensem on pensions of $400 per mensem and over.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as a first step towards the revision of\r\n\r\npensions,  it is appropriate and it is proposed  to\r\n\r\nremove  the anomaly of tapering from Adjustment  Allowances and to fix a ceiling of $25 per mensem  on\r\n\r\nall   pensions  in  excess  of  $180  per   mensem.Secondly, it is proposed to introduce a new  Supplementary Allowance of the same nature as the revised Adjustment  Allowance  and Complementary  Allowance\r\n\r\nand to apply it in the manner described in the Cmd.Paper.  These two measures will have the effect  of\r\n\r\nadjusting  pre-consolidation  pensions  with  post-\r\n\r\nconsolidation  pensions in so far as adjustment  is\r\n\r\npracticable and justifiable.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable thought has been given to the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  a  date  of implementation.  As  hon. Members are aware, the Government is against  back-dating as a matter of principle.

It is the time for wars and revolutions  in\r\n\r\nthe  northern hemisphere. When the harvest  has  been\r\n\r\ncollected,  men's minds and energies turn  to  things\r\n\r\nother than the necessities of life and somehow I feel\r\n\r\nthat  it  must have been laid down in the stars  that\r\n\r\nthis  autumn  1956 was going to be a troubled  one  :\r\n\r\nriots   in  Poznan  in  Poland,  Budapest,  Hongkong,\r\n\r\nSingapore, and now a big war in the making in  Egypt.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average man reading the local newspaper must\r\n\r\nhave  become quite cynical by now.

I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nin   the   Hungarian  Press  and  in  Moscow   papers\r\n\r\nHungarian students must have been denounced  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore students hailed as patriots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein does the truth lie? Who was responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  riots?  Who  began them? Who is  in  the  right?\r\n\r\nThere  has  been  such a spate of  biased  propaganda\r\n\r\nthat  we might do well to retrace the events  of  the\r\n\r\nlast month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister in his statement this\r\n\r\nmorning  gave his Government's version of  what  took\r\n\r\nplace.  The  charge  is that these  300  \"subversive\"\r\n\r\ncharacters, who are now safely in jug, and these  now\r\n\r\ndissolved   Communist-front   organisations    were\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the rioting, and the  shooting  that\r\n\r\nbecame  necessary, the arson, the curfew and all  the\r\n\r\nhardships  that  followed. I  find  it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nagree with that interpretation of events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7th September, the Labour Front Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  received a unanimous vote  of  confidence\r\n\r\nfrom  the whole of the Legislative Assembly on  their\r\n\r\npromise  to  call  an  all-Party conference  to  plan\r\n\r\ntactics  for  the  next merdeka  talks  and  to  plan\r\n\r\nunited  action  in  case the talks failed.  I  repeat\r\n\r\nonce  more: Not one word then was let out  about  the\r\n\r\nbig purge which must have been decided on by then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18th September, six persons, all well-known\r\n\r\nleaders of trade unions or civic organisations,  were\r\n\r\narrested  for  banishment  to  China.  That  was  the\r\n\r\nopening gambit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a clever and a cunning way, the Government\r\n\r\nspotlighted  the  attack on \"Aliens,\"  on  those  not\r\n\r\nborn  in  this country. In this way, it isolated  the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking section of the population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move was against the Chinese Middle\r\n\r\nSchools'  Students' Union. Again the Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nsection  of the population. First, the Union was  banned.  Then  the  President  was  arrested  under  the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of Public Security Ordinance.  The  day\r\n\r\nbefore   the  Legislative  Assembly  debate  on   3rd\r\n\r\nOctober,   they   arrested  Chia  Ek  Tian,   Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee Member of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nP.A.P. and Assistant Secretary of the Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nBranch of the Factory and Shop Workers' Union.  This\r\n\r\nwas a direct warning to the Secretary General of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union  (the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah). There was no attempt to disguise this warning in the debate.

The implication\r\n\r\nwas:  the fact that he was Secretary General of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Factory   and  Shop   Workers'   Union,\r\n\r\nAssistant  Secretary General of the P.A.P. and  an\r\n\r\nAssemblyman was not going to protect him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move was on the 10th of October - once more\r\n\r\nagainst the Chinese school students. A list  of  142\r\n\r\nstudents   was   given  to  the  School   Management\r\n\r\nCommittees.  They  were to expel these  students  if\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  to  continue the schools.  Surely  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   did  not  expect  that  the  Management\r\n\r\nCommittees would quietly go back and tell  the  142\r\n\r\nstudents  that they were expelled and that  was  the\r\n\r\nend  of the matter? Immediately, there was a stay-in\r\n\r\nstrike  at  the  Chinese High School and  the  Chung\r\n\r\nCheng  High  School.  Meanwhile,  to  keep  up   the\r\n\r\npretence  of  democracy, public  rallies,   public\r\n\r\nsignature campaigns were allowed, and the propaganda\r\n\r\nbattle  went  on from 10th October to 24th  October - a\r\n\r\nbattle which very few people have any doubt that the\r\n\r\nGovernment lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 24th of October, the purge moved into top\r\n\r\ngear.  The  Hon. the Chief Minister broadcast  over\r\n\r\nRadio  Malaya and gave the students roughly 24 hours\r\n\r\nto  clear out from the schools. Sir, no one had  the\r\n\r\nslightest doubt that in that situation that was  the\r\n\r\nfuse.  The Government had decided to make the  final\r\n\r\nbig  push. Yes, it is true that the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty held a meeting at\r\n\r\nthe Beauty World on the 25th October from 5 p.m. to\r\n\r\n7 p.m. The dead-line for the big flush out was 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nA half-\r\n\r\nhearted attempt has been made to throw the blame of\r\n\r\nthe rioting which took place, on this meeting at\r\n\r\nwhich the Hon. the Chief Minister said that the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong)\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmade inflammatory speeches. I have said this to  the Government time and time again. If he said  anything\r\n\r\nwhich  was  seditious  or if anybody  said  anything\r\n\r\nwhich is against the law, he can be charged, he  can\r\n\r\nbe  prosecuted for it. To my knowledge, no  one  has\r\n\r\nbeen charged or prosecuted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that night as I came down from the meeting at\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah  at 7 o'clock I had not  the  slightest\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  something was going to  happen.  Nobody\r\n\r\nwho  passed that way had the slightest doubt. Crowds\r\n\r\nwere gathering outside the Chinese High School.  The\r\n\r\nwhole  road  was jammed. The Police made no  attempt\r\n\r\nto  disperse  the  crowd. They  cordoned  off  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  Road and diverted traffic into Dunearn  Road,\r\n\r\nbut  the people were not asked to break up and  move\r\n\r\nalong.  Knowing  the temper of the crowd,  one  must\r\n\r\nassume  that sooner or later such a crowd would  get\r\n\r\nout  of  hand.  Why the Police chose to  do  nothing\r\n\r\nuntil  it  got out of hand is a question which  only\r\n\r\nthose  who  planned  the Labour Front  strategy  can\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister in his statement\r\n\r\nthis morning skated over the riots. He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This was the situation, Sir, when the first riot\r\n\r\nincidents developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to take up the time of hon.Members by giving a detailed account of the riot\r\n\r\nincidents, as these have already been\r\n\r\nreported in the Press.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is true. But we knew that that was the signal\r\n\r\nfor  the  big  purge. At half-past eight,  riots;  at\r\n\r\nhalf-past two the next night, Police parties  raided\r\n\r\nthe   Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union,  the  Bus Workers'   Union  and  arrested  some  250   persons\r\n\r\nincluding  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong,  the  Member  for Bukit  Timah,  and Mr Devan Nair, both  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P.  From\r\n\r\nthen  on,  the purge was in full swing  and  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing days of rioting and day and night  curfew,\r\n\r\nmore  subversive elements were picked  up.  Then  on\r\n\r\nthe  2nd  of November, the Government announced  the\r\n\r\ndissolution\r\n\r\nof  the  Farmers  Association and the  Wooden  House\r\n\r\nDwellers   Association.   The   leaders   of   these\r\n\r\nAssociations  were already arrested.  They  were  at\r\n\r\nthe premises of the Factory and Shop Workers'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nUnion on the night of the 25th. Those are the facts.\r\n\r\nOn  those  facts,  we ask these questions.  Who  was\r\n\r\nresponsible? Who began it? Who was right?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not believe that the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  would have no less eminent a  person  than\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister of England set the  example  in\r\n\r\ngiving flimsy pretexts for police actions. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of England said, \"British troops are  going\r\n\r\nto land in Egypt because they are going to carry out\r\n\r\na  Police  action. For the sake of peace, democracy,\r\n\r\nfreedom,  happiness of mankind, it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nbomb  Egyptian citizens and occupy the Suez  Canal.\"\r\n\r\nThe  whole  world  says, \"This  is  naked  and  open\r\n\r\naggression.\"  The Prime Minister of England  is  not\r\n\r\ndisturbed. He said that he was carrying out the duty\r\n\r\nwhich  the  United Nations should have carried  out.\r\n\r\nThe  Israelis in anticipation of attack attacked the\r\n\r\nEgyptians. Because they were going towards the  Suez\r\n\r\nCanal, the British and French decided that they must\r\n\r\nprotect  the freedom of the waterway and intervened -\r\n\r\nintervened  not  by  attacking  the  aggressor   but\r\n\r\nintervened  by  joining the aggressor and  walloping\r\n\r\nthe defender. Mr Gaitskell for the Opposition said,\r\n\r\n\"The  British  joined  the  burglars  and  shot  the\r\n\r\nhouseholder.\"  If I had to choose between  being  in\r\n\r\nthe company of the Rt. Hon. Sir Anthony Eden and the\r\n\r\nRt.  Hon. Mr Hugh Gaitskell, I would rather  be  on\r\n\r\nthe side of the leader of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what it is all about. Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nhas   declared  that  its  intention  is  to   purge\r\n\r\nsubversive elements and break up the Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisations. We are a generous people  by  nature.\r\n\r\nTherefore we assume that the Member for Seletar (Mr\r\n\r\nNair)  became Assistant Minister to the Chief  Secretary  because of an intense desire to help to  purge\r\n\r\nthe  subversive  elements,  to  save  Singapore  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  to save this vital corner  of  the  free\r\n\r\nworld  in  the interest of democracy. That  was  the\r\n\r\ndeclared intention. We accept it at face value.  But\r\n\r\nin  the battle, I fear that Government was defeated.\r\n\r\nBy the time the battle was joined and the \"Middle\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Road  boys\"  were nabbed on the night of  the  26th,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese-speaking population  of  Singapore  was\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the Government was not  purging  subversive  elements but were crushing Chinese culture,\r\n\r\ncivilisation and education, and that the  Government\r\n\r\nwas  oppressive and fascist. Sir, I do  not  believe\r\n\r\nthat my friend the Member for Ulu Bedok (Inche Abdul\r\n\r\nHamid bin Haji Jumat) is a Fascist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My only regret was that he never\r\n\r\nbrought it home to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  foolish, the  silly,  the  completely  inept  interference in local  affairs  when\r\n\r\nthe  best thing they can do is to slink out  of  the\r\n\r\npicture  has  convinced me that  the  white  man  is\r\n\r\ndetermined to destroy himself in the Far  East.  Not\r\n\r\nonly they have decided to destroy themselves in  the\r\n\r\nFar   East   but  they  have  decided   to   destroy\r\n\r\nthemselves  in the whole of the Middle East  too.  I\r\n\r\nwas  very  amused  to  see  that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and  Works  (Mr  Thomas)  had  very\r\n\r\nlittle  to  say on Egypt. The man who has  something\r\n\r\nto  say on everything, including the Muslims Bill on\r\n\r\nwhich  he  admitted  he  knew  nothing,  could   not\r\n\r\ncondemn  his  own Government for a  fascist  act  of\r\n\r\naggression.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Not my Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Now, come, let us not quibble\r\n\r\nabout these niceties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Leave him alone and let him\r\n\r\nhave his fun.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this is not fun.

They lost\r\n\r\nthe  battle because the odds were against  them.  As\r\n\r\nlong as the British are here, to use British troops\r\n\r\nagainst their own people to carry out this purge  is\r\n\r\nthe seal of death of any political Party. We watched\r\n\r\nwith  extreme  interest the play of forces.  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid this before and I say this now: there are three\r\n\r\nforces   in   this  country;  British   Imperialism,\r\n\r\nCommunism and Malayanationalism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

But for  a nationalist\r\n\r\nto  go  and join forces with the British before  one\r\n\r\nhas got the upper hand on the British is a political\r\n\r\nact of folly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the propaganda campaign which was being waged,\r\n\r\nthe  Government had the whole apparatus of state  in\r\n\r\nits  hands  :  the radio, a friendly  Press  at  its\r\n\r\ndisposal. It could have called public meetings.  But\r\n\r\nit  was  the other side that organised. Six thousand\r\n\r\nstudents, everyone of them went home to a family  of\r\n\r\nten  and  convinced  the  family  of  ten  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was fascist. Six thousand times ten makes\r\n\r\n60,000. There were mass signature campaigns all over\r\n\r\nthe town, and the Government could not even move  in\r\n\r\nits  defence. Whatever the Government's  intentions,\r\n\r\nit  has  not  succeeded in bringing it home  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. If we want to run a democrary, we must  have\r\n\r\nthe people on our side. That was what the Government\r\n\r\ndid not do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been persistent demands for public\r\n\r\ntrials for these persons who have been arrested.  It\r\n\r\nis  the least that the Government can do to retrieve\r\n\r\ntheir  position.  If, in fact,  these  men  were  re\r\n\r\nsponsible  for the riots, were responsible  for  the\r\n\r\ndisorders  and were, in fact, going to  organise  an\r\n\r\narmed overthrow of the Government, then let there be\r\n\r\nopen trials, or let us have a public inquiry. Let\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  Government  produce its  evidence  publicly  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  the  allegations it has  made  against\r\n\r\nthe  subversive  elements and these  Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had hoped this morning that they might have\r\n\r\nproduced  the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim  Ching Siong)  to  participate in these proceedings  but  I\r\n\r\nwas  disappointed. In fact, I had a letter  for  him\r\n\r\nsent  from  Kota Bahru, no doubt someone hoped  that\r\n\r\nhe  would  be  coming out here  to  make  his  stand\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government in the proper Assembly  for\r\n\r\npublic debate. The Hon. the Chief Minister had  said\r\n\r\nthat  some people were under a misapprehension  that\r\n\r\nan  Assemblyman could not be arrested. Let  me  tell\r\n\r\nhim  that the Member for Bukit Timah was never under\r\n\r\nsuch  a misapprehension. The Member for Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nwas  quietly waiting for him and his Police  on  the\r\n\r\nmorning of the 25th of October - \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> 27th.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 27th. I beg his pardon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have so far been unable to trace a Report\r\n\r\nof  the  House of Commons No. 164 of 1940  in  which\r\n\r\nreference  was made to a book on constitutional  law\r\n\r\nthat  a  Member  of Parliament can  be  detained  by\r\n\r\npreventive   detention  by   order   of   executive\r\n\r\nauthority.  I  do  not know how far this  particular\r\n\r\nReport  applies to our situation. That was a  Report\r\n\r\nin  time  of  war  and we are in  a  very  different\r\n\r\nposition  here.  But I do hope,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   not   only   will  you  have   received   the\r\n\r\ninformation  of the arrest of the Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah, but you would at the same time look into  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional   position   which   the    Member's\r\n\r\ndetention  has  created. Amongst other  things,  one\r\n\r\nwonders  if the Orders in Council which say  that  a\r\n\r\nMember  who is absent from two consecutive  sittings automatically vacates his seat are going  to  apply\r\n\r\nin the case of the Member for Bukit Timah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not in his case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, I expect that if Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's colonial Government of Singapore  prevents\r\n\r\nthe Member\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfor Bukit Timah from appearing in this Assembly,\r\n\r\nthat is a reasonable excuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not really the constitutional position\r\n\r\nthat we are concerned about.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government  wants to retain  the  slightest\r\n\r\npretensions to democracy, it must bring  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Bukit Timah to open trial. If it cannot, then it\r\n\r\nmust  release him. And that goes for all  the  other\r\n\r\npersons who have been detained.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister knows well the case of\r\n\r\nMr Seah Yong, translator of the Nanyang Siang Pau. Mr Seah Yong was\r\n\r\narrested on banishment\r\n\r\nand the Singapore Union of Journalists have this  to\r\n\r\nsay  of  Mr Seah Yong in a release on the  26th  of\r\n\r\nOctober, 1956:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Three officials of the Singapore Union of\r\n\r\nJournalists visited Mr Seah Yong at the Outram Road\r\n\r\nRemand  Prison on October the 20th five  days  after\r\n\r\nhis  arrest on Banishment Orders and interviewed him\r\n\r\nfor  an hour. As a result of that interview, we  are\r\n\r\nmore  than ever convinced that Mr Seah was  not  involved  in activities aimed at illegally undermining\r\n\r\nthe  Government and our fears for the freedom of the\r\n\r\nPress have been immeasurably increased.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>And the Singapore Union of Journalists sets out what\r\n\r\nMr Seah told them took\r\n\r\nplace in the interrogation and it has this comment\r\n\r\nto make:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The fact that these four questions were\r\n\r\nput  to  Mr  Seah and that he was not  interrogated\r\n\r\nabout  anything else is difficult to reconcile  with\r\n\r\nyour (meaning the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's) assurance that Mr Seah's activities had\r\n\r\nno connection with his trade union\r\n\r\nactivities.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  Union of Journalists may or  may  not  be\r\n\r\nright.  The  point  is  that there  is  considerable\r\n\r\npublic disquiet as a result\r\n\r\nin  part of inept tactics and inept handling of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  If the Government gets the  journalistic\r\n\r\nprofession  against  it, then  the  Government  must\r\n\r\nexpect  that  the Press is likely to be  unfriendly,\r\n\r\nand  even to make worse the terrific public campaign\r\n\r\nagainst the activities of this Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one side of the question : convincing the\r\n\r\npeople  by  open  trial in Court or by  some  public\r\n\r\ninquiry  that  the  Government's  action  was  well-founded and that there was evidence to justify  such\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another side to the Government's\r\n\r\naction.  That is the toxic side effects of  this  big\r\n\r\ndose of purgative that the Government has decided  to\r\n\r\nadminister. The Government carried out its  purge  of\r\n\r\n\"subversive\"  characters. Now private employers  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to carry out their private purges, following\r\n\r\nthe  example of the Government. In some cases, there\r\n\r\nare signs that these private purges were pre-arranged\r\n\r\nbecause  the employers moved from prepared positions.\r\n\r\nThe  Tay Koh Yat Bus Company, for instance, had  some\r\n\r\n50  odd  spare drivers and conductors for  some  time\r\n\r\nbefore this big purge began. After the purge, the Tay\r\n\r\nKoh Yat Bus Company carried out its own purge. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  same story all over again. A new union had  been\r\n\r\nformed  called  the  Singapore  Transport  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  There  was an agreement with  the  old  union\r\n\r\nwhich  had 270 members in the Tay Koh Yat Bus Company\r\n\r\nregulating  the hours of work. Now the  Company  says\r\n\r\nthat  this agreement is invalid. They said it on  the\r\n\r\n3rd  of  November.  A  new  work  schedule  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  and  all  the old  270  members  are  now\r\n\r\nundergoing special treatment at the hands of the  Tay\r\n\r\nKoh Yat Bus Company. These were men who were formerly\r\n\r\ngiven eight hours of work a day by agreement between\r\n\r\nthe Company and the Bus Workers' Union. These men are\r\n\r\nnow  put on 2-hour shifts, and members from the spare\r\n\r\npool  and the special reserve spare pool are  getting\r\n\r\nthe  8-hour shifts. Slowly the Company, as  this  new\r\n\r\nTransport Employees' Union expands, will clean up the\r\n\r\nremnants  which  the Government had not  cleaned  up,\r\n\r\nprobably because the Government had decided that they\r\n\r\nwere  not \"subversive\". But from the Company's  point\r\n\r\nof view, they are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular instance, there are signs of pre-arranged positions, which means that the Company had\r\n\r\nan  inkling  that there was going to  be  this  opportunity  and seized it. But there are others  who  did\r\n\r\nnot  move from pre-arranged positions. There is,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the Yew Lee Cheong Tin Factory.  They  did\r\n\r\nnot  expect  this  but the moment it  happened,  they\r\n\r\nsacked all 23\r\n\r\nworkers and all members of the Factory\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  Shop Workers' Union. The whole lot was purged.\r\n\r\nHume  Industries  purged 6 shop  stewards.  Malayan\r\n\r\nTextile  Mills : 1 spinning worker, a shop  steward\r\n\r\nwas  purged. It seems that the Imperial  Government\r\n\r\ntoo  wants to carry out a private purge of its own.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Base authorities took the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nrevoke the pass that the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim)  has\r\n\r\nhad for years and years to enter the Naval Base.  I\r\n\r\nwarned  the Government when we passed the Protected\r\n\r\nPlaces  Ordinance that they must be on their  guard\r\n\r\nand  not allow this Ordinance to be abused  by  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base  authorities or by any other  employer.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Naval  Base says, \"As  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nemergency,  casual visitors cannot be allowed  into\r\n\r\nthe  protected  place.\" Sir, I might  have  been  a\r\n\r\ncasual  visitor  going  up to  advise  the  General\r\n\r\nCouncil of the Naval Base Labour Union when  I  was\r\n\r\nstopped by the Naval Base authorities, no doubt for\r\n\r\nreasons  of  state, for the security of  the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase,  the  Dockyard and the ships inside.  But  to\r\n\r\nexclude  the  Member  for  Sembawang  as  a  casual\r\n\r\nvisitor - 4,000 of his constituents are living inside\r\n\r\nthe  Base - and they had previously issued a pass  to\r\n\r\nhim, is an example of the chain reaction which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has set in motion. The Government  says\r\n\r\nthat  it  has channels of information not available\r\n\r\nto other members of the public. We must assume that\r\n\r\nthose  whom the Government had not purged had  been\r\n\r\ncleared  of  any  subversive tint. Obviously  these\r\n\r\nemployers   have  also  got  private  channels   of\r\n\r\ninformation  not available to the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  they  are  carrying  out  their  own\r\n\r\npurges.  On his own reasoning, the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  should  approve of their  actions:  \"Yes,\r\n\r\nthey  are  quite  right because as  they  are  well\r\n\r\ninformed  we should not doubt the wisdom  of  their\r\n\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is an even more poisonous side-effect\r\n\r\nof  Operation Liberation namely, the appearance  of\r\n\r\nBritish   troops,  rifles,  bayonets,  helicopters,\r\n\r\naeroplanes, Commanders-in-Chief. Sir, the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister said that the elected Government was\r\n\r\nin com-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmand  of Operation Liberation. But how can the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister counter the  effect  of  these\r\n\r\nBritish  troops at barricade points at all bridges?\r\n\r\nHow can he counter the pictures in all the Press of\r\n\r\nMaj.-Gen.   Tulloch,  General  Officer  Commanding,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Base District, and of Mr Nigel  Morris,\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Police, in charge  of  the  whole\r\n\r\noperation? The identification in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  this Government with armed  British  Imperialism is something which will take a long  time\r\n\r\nto live down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going to be the denouement? I am not\r\n\r\ninterested   in   the  immediate  result   of   this \"Operation Liberation\". The reality of power  is  in\r\n\r\nthe hands of the British. Let us face that fact. The\r\n\r\ndays  of  the curfew and the riots brought home  the\r\n\r\ntruth that he who has the rifle barrel has the  last\r\n\r\nword.  A  great  Chinese Marxist  dialectician  once\r\n\r\nwrote  that a new society is born out of  the  rifle\r\n\r\nbarrel.  That  is  true of this  situation:  with  a Britain  tough, reactionary, its Government prepared\r\n\r\nto  precipitate a world war to defend  its  economic\r\n\r\ninterest  in  the Middle East. If you  cannot  wrest\r\n\r\nthat  rifle  barrel from her, then  you  are  in  no\r\n\r\nposition to argue with her. To have gone behind  the\r\n\r\nwhite man holding a rifle barrel is, in my analysis,\r\n\r\na tactical error.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front may be right in believing\r\n\r\nthat  its actions will win sympathetic approval from Mr  LennoxBoyd and the Tory British Government. But the  Labour  Front also believes that  it  will  win concessions  for  merdeka in this  way.  The  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  is wrong. As long as this Tory Government  is\r\n\r\nin  power,  any attempt to exercise merdeka  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the people of Malaya, any  attempt  to\r\n\r\ntake  away  gold dollars from Britain to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the people of Malaya, will  be\r\n\r\nmet with the most terrific resistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct policy would be to use this power\r\n\r\nsituation,  of the British, the Communists  and  the\r\n\r\nNationalists, in such a way as, first,  to  put  the\r\n\r\nBritish into an untenable position. Having put  them\r\n\r\ninto  an untenable position, then we shall be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to take over the rifle barrel.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this whole tangled skein is unravelled in ten\r\n\r\nmonths'  time - I hear elections are to  be  in  August\r\n\r\n1957 - then  is  the time we shall have to sit  down  to\r\n\r\nweigh the position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Middle Road group (as they have been\r\n\r\ncalled)  are  now in jail. They knew that  they  were\r\n\r\ngoing to be nabbed. They knew it because the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister's actions were so apparent. But  they\r\n\r\nmade  the Government pay the heaviest price for  that\r\n\r\nretreat. And they are tough and resilient.  I  might\r\n\r\ntell the Hon. the Chief Minister that the Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit Timah has asked me to convey his compliments to\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister and to express his thanks to  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Secretary for the treatment he is  now\r\n\r\nreceiving in the Central Police Station as  a  V.I.P.\r\n\r\ndetainee. Let us assume for the sake of argument that\r\n\r\nthey are subversive characters. How long can you keep\r\n\r\nthem  there?  One  year, two years, four  years,  six\r\n\r\nyears? The Member for Bukit Timah is learning English\r\n\r\nand  Malay.  I brought his father to see him  and  he\r\n\r\ngave his father a list of books he was going to study\r\n\r\nwhile  he  is  enjoying the comforts of  one  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's police stations. Amongst the books  are  an\r\n\r\nEnglish/Malay   dictionary  and  a   Malay/Chinese\r\n\r\ndictionary. When he comes out, apart from speeches in\r\n\r\nHokkien  to  denounce the Chief  Minister  in  no  uncertain  terms,  it is not unlikely that,  given  the\r\n\r\nteacher  companions in jail, he might be  denouncing\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister in Malay and English too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the decisive turning point since the\r\n\r\nelections. I would say this for my hon. opponents  on\r\n\r\nthe  other side of this House : they have decided  to\r\n\r\ntake\r\n\r\nthe  bull by the horns, and I wish them well. I  hope\r\n\r\nthey  will not be gored by the bull's horns.  Let  us\r\n\r\nassume  that a thorough purge is carried  out  and  a\r\n\r\nvacuum  is  created  amongst  the  workers  and   the\r\n\r\nfarmers. No more Farmers\r\n\r\nAssociation. No more Factory and Shop Workers' Union.\r\n\r\nWhat  happens next? There was a vacuum for six  years\r\n\r\nfrom 1948 to 1954. The workers were unorganised,  the\r\n\r\nfarmers were unorganised\r\n\r\nand nobody filled that vacuum. There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwere  trade  unionists like one Mr Peter  Williams\r\n\r\nand some other people like him. But it was only the Malayan   Communist   Party   working   under   the\r\n\r\nlimitations  of  an  underground organisation  that\r\n\r\nworked away like demons and built up a force  which\r\n\r\nthe Tunku and this present Government have to meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fight for the loyalty of the people. We\r\n\r\nall  talk of fighting to win over the masses,  but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,   we   are  all   amateurs   against\r\n\r\nprofessional revolutionaries. We are not so  amateurish  now.  This is the challenge. If you  want  to\r\n\r\norganise  the masses, you must find the  people  to\r\n\r\norganise   them.   Masses  do   not   organise   by\r\n\r\nthemselves. Then you will come up against the  real crux  of  the problem. Can you find the organisers\r\n\r\nand  get them on your side? The Marxists call  them\r\n\r\ncadres.  Can you find the cadres? You lock up  one,\r\n\r\nthree  others spring up. You lock up three,  thirty\r\n\r\nspring up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to ask \"Why is the position like that?\" It\r\n\r\nis   because  of  two  factors:  first,  an  endemic\r\n\r\neconomic and social situation which brings  about  a\r\n\r\ngreat  sense  of  grievance  against  society,   and\r\n\r\nsecond,  the  appeal of an ideology  that,  theoretically,  provides the answers. I and  my  Party  have\r\n\r\nlived  with this problem for the last two years.  If\r\n\r\nwe do not solve this problem, then I say, we perish.\r\n\r\nIt  will  not be solved just by using the  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance  or  the  Banishment  Ordinance   or   the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance.   The\r\n\r\nbattle  is  a battle for organisers, for cadres.  To\r\n\r\nwin  these  people over to your side, you must  give\r\n\r\nthem  the  belief  of a just cause,  give  them  the\r\n\r\nconviction  and the drive to work for a  better  and\r\n\r\nhappier society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not always have agreed with some of my\r\n\r\nfriends who are now in prison in Changi but I agreed\r\n\r\nwith  them on one thing : the determination to wreck\r\n\r\nthe present colonial system as soon as possible. For\r\n\r\nI agreed with them that the colonial system is evil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the biggest tribute that this Government has\r\n\r\npaid  to  these \"subversive\" characters is  to  have\r\n\r\ntacitly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nadmitted   that   only  300  people   had   organised\r\n\r\nthousands of people in Singapore. The final battle in\r\n\r\nthis three-cornered fight - I am not speaking as a Party\r\n\r\npolitician - depends upon whether you can convince  the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaya, the people who are prepared to work\r\n\r\nand fight, that the democratic State is the answer to\r\n\r\nthe  problems of Malaya. It you can convince them  of\r\n\r\nit,  then you will get the intellectuals on your side -\r\n\r\nthe  persons  with the ability, the  conviction,  the\r\n\r\ndrive  and  integrity. And if you get  them  on  your\r\n\r\nside, you win the battle. But if they go over to  the\r\n\r\nother side, then you have lost the battle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in making this purge had\r\n\r\nmisunderstood the power situation in Malaya.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  their  expatriate colleagues in the Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  who  decide the fate of Singapore.  Their\r\n\r\nattitude   and  friendliness  do  not   decide   the\r\n\r\nconcessions  which  the British Government  will  or\r\n\r\nwill  not give. A Tory Britain with Sir Anthony Eden\r\n\r\nas  Prime  Minister is not going to be  swayed  into\r\n\r\nconcessions by a friendly local nationalist group if\r\n\r\nthat group is a genuinely nationalist group? Do hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the  other side  realise  that  a  Tory\r\n\r\nBritain is today bombing Col. Nasser who is an anti-Communist?  It has nothing to do with  Communism  or\r\n\r\nDemocracy. It is concerned with preserving,  as  Sir\r\n\r\nAnthony  Eden said, the way of life of  the  Western\r\n\r\npeople.  The  way of life of the Western  people  depends  on the oil wells in Arabia. If they lose  the\r\n\r\noil   wells,  there  will  be  five  million  people\r\n\r\nunemployed  in Britain within one year.  When  those\r\n\r\nare  the  stakes, Britain is not interested  in  pre\r\n\r\nserving  the Middle East for the sake of  democracy.\r\n\r\nBritain   is  interested  in  preserving   Britain's\r\n\r\neconomic interest and her way of life which  depends\r\n\r\non  those  economic interests. That was  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront's  tactical  miscalculation of  the  position.\r\n\r\nThere  should  never have been this  miscalculation.\r\n\r\nBut  the errors having been made, the least that the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front can do is to bring these men to trial,\r\n\r\nprove  the  charges  against them  and  satisfy  the\r\n\r\npublic conscience. It they cannot, then they have no\r\n\r\nalternative but to release them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise to second the motion before  the  House\r\n\r\nbecause as an elected Assemblyman, a Nationalist  and\r\n\r\na Democrat, that is the only honest and logical thing\r\n\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I stood for elections just over a year and a\r\n\r\nhalf  ago, it was on the understanding that  I  would\r\n\r\nfight for a self-governing, democratic Malaya.
