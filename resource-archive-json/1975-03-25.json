The  Minister, in a written  answer  to  a\r\n\r\nquestion  I  raised recently, stated that  the  Pc\r\n\r\nForce  as  a whole had a vacancy of 15%.  Has  the\r\n\r\nMinister  any  measure  in mind  to  resolve  this\r\n\r\nunhappy   manpower  position,  which  may  have  a\r\n\r\ncritical  relationship  to the  effectiveness  the\r\n\r\nForce?  I  have also a suspicion that  recruitment\r\n\r\nrequirements may not realistic, and also that  the\r\n\r\npromotion  structure in the  rank  and  file  does\r\n\r\nencourage  a sense of motivation. Moreover,  where\r\n\r\nofficers are concerned there is some feeling  that\r\n\r\nsufficient  credit not given to field achievement,\r\n\r\nwhile  too  much  attention is  paid  to  academic\r\n\r\nqualifications. I would urge the Minister to  give\r\n\r\nsome clarification regarding policy over manpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been some reference to the calling\r\n\r\nup  of  young  men  into  Police  Force.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  think atmosphere should  be  cleared,\r\n\r\nother's   there  will  continue  to   be   certain\r\n\r\napprehensions.  I am sure the Minister's  positive\r\n\r\nreply will do much to add to morale in the Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, und ably better relations have\r\n\r\nbeen  established  between  the  Police  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  past year. This  is  because  of\r\n\r\nefforts of the Ministry of Home All in many ways,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  the holding of the Annual  Police\r\n\r\nWeek  and  opening of police stations  to  enable\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public to see for themselves  how\r\n\r\nthe  Police  work.  This should  go  a  long  way\r\n\r\ntowards  promoting  operation  and  understanding\r\n\r\nbetween the people and the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are complaints of courtesy and\r\n\r\nhaughtiness  among Pc officers. Taxi drivers  have\r\n\r\ncomplained  that certain policemen in patrol  cars\r\n\r\nacross  their taxis. Sir, this practice not  good.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a speed limit many areas and  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer   should  know  how  to   abide   by   the\r\n\r\nregulations He drives faster than the speed limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin order to catch up with a taxi driver only to\r\n\r\nthreaten the taxi driver with the attitude \"Do you\r\n\r\nknow who I am?\" This is very undesirable. I hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will take note of this incorrect\r\n\r\nattitude of the Police officers and take necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures to rectify it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is another matter regarding the shortage of\r\n\r\npolicemen. In one of my Meet-the-People sessions,\r\n\r\na female resident in my constituency came to see\r\n\r\nme. She told me that her husband had gone amok and\r\n\r\nwanted to beat the children. Her husband had been\r\n\r\ntreated at the Woodbridge Hospital on a few\r\n\r\noccasions previously but was released only\r\n\r\nrecently. She, therefore, asked me to help her by\r\n\r\ngiving this matter urgent attention in order to\r\n\r\navoid any accidents. I telephoned the Chong Pang\r\n\r\nPolice Station and the officer who received the\r\n\r\ncall replied, \"Sorry, Sir. At the moment there is\r\n\r\nonly one policeman here. We cannot help you.\" I\r\n\r\nasked whether he could send a patrol car to the\r\n\r\ncomplainant's home to help her out. The reply was\r\n\r\nthat she had to wait for some time. This shows\r\n\r\nthat there is an acute shortage of police\r\n\r\npersonnel in that area. I remember that a few\r\n\r\nyears ago therewas the Lee Soo Ann Committee\r\n\r\nReport on the salaries of the Police rank and\r\n\r\nfile. I understand certain recommendations in this\r\n\r\nReport had been implemented. However, up till now\r\n\r\ncertain posts in the Police Force have still not\r\n\r\nbeen filled. Why is this so? I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister what\r\n\r\nremedial measures he intends to take. In the\r\n\r\nPresident's speech it was mentioned that full-time\r\n\r\nnational service would be introduced for the\r\n\r\nPolice Force in order to relieve the manpower\r\n\r\nshortage in the Police rank and file. I would like\r\n\r\nto ask when will this proposal be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question regarding the ranks in\r\n\r\nthe Police Force. I understand the authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned have set up a committee to look into the\r\n\r\nstructure of the ranks of Inspectors and to make\r\n\r\nrecommendations. However, after a considerable\r\n\r\nlapse of time, there has been no follow-up of that\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister when  will  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the committee be  implemented.\r\n\r\nWhy  have they not been put into effect?  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to know the reasons. Several posts have also\r\n\r\nnot  been filled up till now. I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nwhy  these  posts are still vacant. Is it  because\r\n\r\nthe pay is so low that people do not like to apply\r\n\r\nfor these posts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be given permission to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  this  head, although I have  indicated\r\n\r\nthat   I  would  not  be  moving  the  last   two\r\n\r\namendments* standing in my name?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The amendments read as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) That the total sum to be allocated be reduced\r\n\r\nby $100.for Head U in respect of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the total sum to be allocated for Head U\r\n\r\nin respect of the Development Estimates be reduced\r\n\r\nby $100.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I wholly agree with the sentiments expressed\r\n\r\nby  both the Member for Katong and the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang.  But I would also like to add  what  my\r\n\r\ntwo  Friends have said with regard to  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce. First of all, I welcome the introduction of\r\n\r\nfull-time national service in the Police Force.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  this  will inject more  numbers  to  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force,  as it is now trying  its  best  to\r\n\r\nrecruit more personnel to the various echelons  of\r\n\r\nthe Police service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Sembawang mentioned about\r\n\r\nthe   activities  during  Police  Week  in   which\r\n\r\nexhibitions and shows about Police work  are  held\r\n\r\nin  many parts of Singapore. I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health and Home Affairs  whether\r\n\r\nhe  has  taken  note  of  the  extent  of  success\r\n\r\nachieved as a result of the Police Week campaigns.\r\n\r\nIn  this  connection, I would also  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether an assessment of the results has been made\r\n\r\nand  whether steps can be taken to give the Police\r\n\r\nForce  a  better image. I am not saying  that  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force is not enjoying a good  image.  They\r\n\r\ndo; but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  is  always  the case with a large organisation\r\n\r\nthe  presence of a small number of black sheep  in\r\n\r\nour  Police  Force  can mar its  good  reputation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the House has been assured by  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister that the black sheep will be weeded out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the President's Address and its\r\n\r\nAddendum lay stress that Singapore will be made  a\r\n\r\nplace  in which people can live in peace.  It  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  pointed out that four police  stations\r\n\r\nwill  be  built  in various housing  estates,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, in Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the idea of setting up more police\r\n\r\nstations.  But  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  to  look  into this  matter  in  greater\r\n\r\ndepth.  To  the  best of my knowledge,  there  are\r\n\r\ninsufficient  police  stations  in   the   housing\r\n\r\nestates. Therefore, when Housing Board estates are\r\n\r\nbeing   built,  there  should  be  a  coordinating\r\n\r\ncommittee  to look into the question of  providing\r\n\r\nfacilities  such  as  police  stations,  so   that\r\n\r\nwhenever members of the public have any complaints\r\n\r\nto  make,  say,  a case of theft or robbery,  they\r\n\r\nwill not be too inconvenienced by having to travel\r\n\r\ngreat  distances. In other words, a police station\r\n\r\nshould  be  at the doorstep of the high-rise  flat\r\n\r\ndwellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress this point because\r\n\r\nthousands  of Housing Board flats are being  built\r\n\r\nevery year, and they will accommodate about 70% of\r\n\r\nthe  population  by  1980. When  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board was first set up in  1960,  its\r\n\r\nobject  was  to provide low-cost housing  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  question  of  policing  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates,   in  all  probability,  had   not   been\r\n\r\nconsidered and this has resulted in the  sad  fact\r\n\r\nthat  today the Home Affairs Ministry has  thought\r\n\r\nit  fit  and proper to build more police stations.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like to add that  building  police\r\n\r\nstations is one thing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngetting   the  right  material  in  relation   the\r\n\r\nmanpower  is another. As I have said, the recruitment\r\n\r\nof  police personal as well as enlisting full-time\r\n\r\nnational servicemen into the police force is  most\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to make the point with regard\r\n\r\nto  cases  of brutality on part of the  police.

As  I  know it, the  police  has  the\r\n\r\nauthority to detain any person suspected of having\r\n\r\ncommitted  a crime for a period of not  more  than\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks.  I would like to s the Hon.

This point  has  also been\r\n\r\nraised  by the Members for Sembawang and  Punggol.\r\n\r\nWe  in  the  Minister of Home  Affairs  view  this\r\n\r\nproblem   manpower  in  the  police   force   very\r\n\r\nseriously because there is a serious shortage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof manpower among junior officers, to the tune\r\n\r\nof  about  15%. As at 1st March, 1975, there  were\r\n\r\n4,406   police  constables  and  women  constables\r\n\r\nagainst an authorised establishment of 5,107.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of  course,  the  manpower  problem  is  not  a\r\n\r\nproblem  peculiar to the police force  alone.  The\r\n\r\nmanpower  problem has been created as a result  of\r\n\r\nour sustained\r\n\r\neconomic growth in the last decade resulting in  a\r\n\r\ntight  labour  market in Singapore. Therefore,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as the Ministry of Home Affairs is concerned,\r\n\r\nWe  looking  at  this problem, we  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nlogical means of overcoming this manpower shortage\r\n\r\nis  to develop new work methods which will utilise\r\n\r\nthe  limited manpower available to the police more\r\n\r\nefficiently. Therefore, a committee to review  the\r\n\r\nmanpower problem in the police force was appointed\r\n\r\nin  January this year. The committee is headed  by\r\n\r\nan  Assistant Commissioner of Police and  consists\r\n\r\nof  members which include one school principal,  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative from the Public Service Commission,\r\n\r\na representative from the Ministry of Finance and,\r\n\r\nof  course, a representative from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of reference for this committee are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to consider the requirements of the police\r\n\r\nforce for junior officers in relation to the crime\r\n\r\nrate, population growth and changing political,\r\n\r\neconomic and social conditions of Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to recommend ways in which the manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements of the police force can be met having\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  general  labour  shortage  in Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to recommend measures which will alleviate\r\n\r\nthe manpower problem and contribute to greater\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the  police  force,  such   as\r\n\r\nrationalisation and civilianisation of certain\r\n\r\npolice duties, mechanisation and computerisation,\r\n\r\nand greater use of women police officers; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) having regard to (1), (2), and (3)\r\n\r\naforementioned, to examine whether  present  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions of service for junior officers are\r\n\r\nadequate  to  attract and retain officers  of  the\r\n\r\nright quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  fourth term of reference will mean reviewing\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness of the Lee Soo Ann  Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the question of enlisting full-time national servicemen to meet the problem of\r\n\r\nmanpower  shortage  in the  police  force.  I  say\r\n\r\nstraightaway that this will only meet the shortage\r\n\r\nto  some  extent, and we hope the  committee  will\r\n\r\nfind the full answer to the manpower shortage as a\r\n\r\nwhole.   As   regards   the   full-time   national\r\n\r\nservicemen in the police force, our view  is  that\r\n\r\nthis  will only solve part of the problem  because\r\n\r\nfull-time national servicemen will be doing  full-time police duties for only two years. After that,\r\n\r\nthey go into the reserve service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into details as to how they\r\n\r\nwill  be  used because the details are  now  being\r\n\r\nworked out. With regard to the operational date of\r\n\r\nthe  full-time national servicemen scheme, it will\r\n\r\noperate as soon as possible because facilities are\r\n\r\nnow  being prepared in our training school to take\r\n\r\nin   the   first   batch  of  full-time   national\r\n\r\nservicemen in the police force. They will be given\r\n\r\n12  weeks, or three months' training, before  they\r\n\r\nare given police duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nwho complained about discourtesy and arrogance  on\r\n\r\nthe   part  of  the  police  force  and  also  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  of the Member for Punggol on the  abuse\r\n\r\nof  power  and brutality? In 1974, a total  of  65\r\n\r\ncomplaints  were received from the public  against\r\n\r\npolice  officers  for  rudeness,  discourtesy  and\r\n\r\nabuse  of power. Four of the complaints are  still\r\n\r\nunder   investigation.   Of   the   remaining   61\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  only  10  cases  were  substantiated.\r\n\r\nThese 10 were cases of minor infringements and the\r\n\r\nofficers    concerned   were   reprimanded.    Our\r\n\r\nexperience  has  been that most of the  complaints\r\n\r\nwere  unfounded  and a number  were  malicious  or\r\n\r\nexaggerated.  But  I would like to  reassure  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that  every complaint  received,  whether\r\n\r\nfrom a Member of Parliament or from any member  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  against  any members  of  the  police\r\n\r\nforce, is fully investigated and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  the complaint is substantiated action is taken\r\n\r\nagainst  the  offender, whether the  complaint  is\r\n\r\nagainst discourtesy, arrogance, abuse of power  or\r\n\r\nbrutality. I have often repeated this and I  shall\r\n\r\nrepeat again that abuse of power and brutality  in\r\n\r\nthe  police force will not be tolerated.  However,\r\n\r\nin a large organisation as the Police Force - this\r\n\r\nwas  also stated by the Member for Punggol  -there\r\n\r\nwill always be a few black sheep to mar its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to action against the black sheep,\r\n\r\nmay  I  just give a few figures. First of  all,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to assure the Member for Punggol  that\r\n\r\nthe  Police Force has no hesitation in weeding out\r\n\r\nthe  black sheep if the offences committed warrant\r\n\r\ndismissal.  In  1974, 35 officers comprising  four\r\n\r\nInspectors, one Station Inspector, four  Sergeants\r\n\r\nand  26 Police Constables were dismissed from  the\r\n\r\nForce  for  corruption  and  serious  breaches  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  that  these cases should  be  dealt  with\r\n\r\nimpartially  and fairly, may I draw the  attention\r\n\r\nof  hon. Members that sometime last year I had the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force  Act  amended in this  Chamber.  The\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Police Force  Act  enables  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police to refer disciplinary cases\r\n\r\nagainst  junior  officers  or  inspectors  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission. This ensures impartial\r\n\r\ninvestigation  against police officers.  Prior  to\r\n\r\nthat,   offences  committed  by  those  ranks   of\r\n\r\nofficers  were  dealt  with by  the  Police  Force\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to police/public relationship, the\r\n\r\nPolice  Weeks  and the campaigns  that  have  been\r\n\r\nheld, the Member for Punggol asked me what was the\r\n\r\neffect  of  these campaigns. May 1  say  that  the\r\n\r\nresults   were  quite  encouraging   because   the\r\n\r\nattendances in all the campaigns, Open Houses  and\r\n\r\nother  programmes  organised by the  Police  Force\r\n\r\nwere good. But the fostering of good police/public\r\n\r\nrelations  will  take some time  to  nurture,  and\r\n\r\ncannot   be   achieved  by  only   one   campaign.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  will  continue  this  campaign  of\r\n\r\nfostering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  relations between the public and the  Police\r\n\r\nForce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the campaign which was held recently, special\r\n\r\ninstructions  were  given to the officer-in-charge\r\n\r\nof  the  various Land Divisions to  foster  closer\r\n\r\nworking relationship between him and the MP of his\r\n\r\nDivision, as well as the Chairman of the Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees. It will take  some  time\r\n\r\nfor    them   to   establish   a   close   working\r\n\r\nrelationship, but I am informed that in  a  number\r\n\r\nof  constituencies  some  happy  relationship  has\r\n\r\nalready  been forged for the common  good  in  the\r\n\r\nfight against crime. Again I must say that it will\r\n\r\ntake some time for it to develop, but a start  has\r\n\r\nalready been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wanted to know about the\r\n\r\nvacancies of inspectors. He is worried that  there\r\n\r\nare  not  enough  inspectors. As I  say,  our  big\r\n\r\nconcern  is the junior ranks. Anyway, may  I  just\r\n\r\ngive  him some figures of inspectors. In 1974,  37\r\n\r\nPolice  Inspectors were recruited against a  total\r\n\r\nvacancy of 69. That is by direct recruitment,  but\r\n\r\nit  does  not mean that these posts of  Inspectors\r\n\r\nshould  be  filled by direct recruitment.  Usually\r\n\r\nhalf  of  them  are  filled by direct  recruitment\r\n\r\nbecause  some posts must be reserved for promotion\r\n\r\nof sergeants as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg your indulgence. The Minister has not\r\n\r\nreplied to my question of police stations  in  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board estates. This is an important  point\r\n\r\nand  it  has  been  mentioned before  in  previous\r\n\r\ndebates - the Member for Toa Payoh can bear me out\r\n\r\nthat  Toa  Payoh  at one time  was  known  as  the\r\n\r\nChicago of Singapore. So I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nreply on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I do not think that the crime rate in\r\n\r\nHousing Board estates can be brought down just  by\r\n\r\nhaving  a police station in every housing  estate.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  to  have a police  station  in  every\r\n\r\nhousing estate that would mean mobilising a lot of\r\n\r\npolice  manpower. This is a problem that  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven thought to very deeply. We cannot afford  to\r\n\r\npin  down heavy manpower resources by building too\r\n\r\nmany police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstations.  What  we  are doing  now  is  to  build\r\n\r\nDivisional Police Headquarters at strategic  sites\r\n\r\nand  from  these Divisions we will be  introducing\r\n\r\nteam policing. Patrol cars will be doing a 24-hour\r\n\r\npatrol  duty within that division and  the  patrol\r\n\r\ncars  should  also cover Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  estates.  It is better  to  have  a  mobile\r\n\r\npatrol  moving around rather than be static  in  a\r\n\r\nplace,  because that would be tying down manpower.\r\n\r\nAt  the moment we are having team policing in  two\r\n\r\nPolice Divisions, that is Orchard Division and the\r\n\r\nCentral  Division. Since the introduction of  team\r\n\r\npolicing,  figures have shown that the crime  rate\r\n\r\nin  these two Divisions has gone down by  30%.  We\r\n\r\nnow  have plans to introduce team policing in  the\r\n\r\nother six Police Divisions by October this year. I\r\n\r\nhope that the crime rate would go down accordingly\r\n\r\nin these other six Police Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members on this side of the House have\r\n\r\nalready raised several questions in respect of the\r\n\r\nPolice Force, and I would like to air my views  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard. The Minister said just now that  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force will be enlisting full-time national\r\n\r\nservicemen for police duty. I endorse this move to\r\n\r\nbe taken by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment there are part-time national\r\n\r\nservicemen  in  the  Police Force,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary. I think care should be taken\r\n\r\nof these people. According to my understanding the\r\n\r\nmorale  of  the Special Constabulary men  is  very\r\n\r\nlow.   Many  highly  educated  part-time  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  have  been posted to do  watch-dog  or\r\n\r\njaga  duties, or even office-boy duties. Naturally\r\n\r\nthese  people are frustrated. As a result of  this\r\n\r\nfrustration their morale is very low. I have  also\r\n\r\nheard of more interesting episodes. One is that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice officer told the Special Constables in  his\r\n\r\ncharge to issue three summonses a day after  which\r\n\r\nthey  could  go home to sleep. If there  are  such\r\n\r\ncases,  I  think we have to stop them.  We  should\r\n\r\nthink  of  ways and means to remedy the  situation\r\n\r\nand raise the morale of the Special Constables who\r\n\r\nare  part-time national servicemen.  They  form  a\r\n\r\nvital link, if I may say so, in the Police Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said that he will continue to\r\n\r\nhold   Police   Weeks  to  further  promote   good\r\n\r\npolice/public relationship. I say  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  idea  to  continue  with  the  Police  Week.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should not forget that when we ask the\r\n\r\npeople  to  cooperate with the police,  we  should\r\n\r\nalso  ask the police to cooperate with the people.\r\n\r\nWe  have received many complaints from members  of\r\n\r\nthe public, as what other MPs have also said here,\r\n\r\nthat  there are many complaints about the rudeness\r\n\r\nand  discourtesy  on the part of the  police,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, inconveniencing the witnesses by  asking\r\n\r\nthem  to  turn  up at the police station  to  give\r\n\r\nstatements. Why cannot the police inspector go  to\r\n\r\na place convenient to the witness to take down his\r\n\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Gambling Suppression Branch sometimes\r\n\r\nreceives information from the public that such and\r\n\r\nsuch  a  person  is running a gambling  den.  When\r\n\r\ninformation  of  this  nature  is  received,   the\r\n\r\nGambling  Suppression Branch should  take  a  very\r\n\r\ncautious  attitude  in  its investigations  before\r\n\r\ntaking  any action. In my constituency  there  had\r\n\r\nbeen  some  unpleasant incidents  arising  out  of\r\n\r\naction  taken  by  the Police on such  information\r\n\r\nreceived.   Police  officers  from  the   Gambling\r\n\r\nSuppression    Branch,   without   checking    the\r\n\r\nreliability  or unreliability of the  information,\r\n\r\ncame  all  the way to my constituency  to  conduct\r\n\r\nraids and searches in the homes of people who  had\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  community work. These  residents\r\n\r\nhave  a very high public standing and are unlikely\r\n\r\nto   be   bookies   or  gambling  den   operators.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would ask the Minister to direct  the\r\n\r\nGambling  Suppression Branch to be  more  cautious\r\n\r\nbefore acting on informa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntion   received,  because  the  information   they\r\n\r\nreceive   can   turn  out  to  be  unreliable   or\r\n\r\nmalicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has also told this House that\r\n\r\non  receipt  of complaints against the Police  for\r\n\r\nbrutality,  discourtesy,  etc, investigation   is\r\n\r\nalways  made  and very often such complaints  were\r\n\r\nfound to be unsubstantiated. I wonder who are  the\r\n\r\npeople  responsible for the investigation of  such\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  If  we ask a police officer  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  a  complaint against another police officer,\r\n\r\nwe  would  not get any favourable results  as  the\r\n\r\nofficer  would tend to cover up the other officer.\r\n\r\nTo  ensure  that  such complaints are  impartially\r\n\r\ninvestigated  into, they should  be  conducted  by\r\n\r\nindependent  people  who are not  police  officers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I think if this course of  action  is\r\n\r\ntaken, we will find that many such complaints  are\r\n\r\nwell-founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to remind the Minister\r\n\r\nof the shortage of police personnel in Jurong Town\r\n\r\nwhich is the largest industrial town in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn this industrial town there is only a very small\r\n\r\npolice  post. I was informed at any one time  that\r\n\r\nthe  number  of police officers on duty  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed three. I do not know whether it is true  or\r\n\r\nnot. Also there are only two police patrol cars in\r\n\r\nthis  police  post, one of which is out  of  order\r\n\r\nevery  other day. For a big industrial  town  like\r\n\r\nJurong, it is inadequate to have only such a small\r\n\r\npolice post. As a result, there are so many  cases\r\n\r\nof  robbery and housebreaking and other crimes  in\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\nI  would like to ask the Minister whether  he  has\r\n\r\nany plan in mind to improve the security in Jurong\r\n\r\nTown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, may I say that this particular subhead\r\n\r\nrelates  to  the Permanent Secretary.

We  heard\r\n\r\nthis  answer last year and we hear it  again  this\r\n\r\nyear.   Judging  by  the  increasing   number   of\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from this side of the  Chamber,  I  am\r\n\r\nbeginning  to feel that the number of black  sheep\r\n\r\nhas  increased.  If  that is the  case,  something\r\n\r\npositive  should  be  done about  it  rather  than\r\n\r\nsaying that it is a question of black sheep in any\r\n\r\norganisation.  I  do  not think  that  is  a  very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly support the suggestion of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong  that  a  more independent  system  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation should be set up. The mere fact that\r\n\r\ninvestigation is left to the colleagues within the\r\n\r\nPolice Force, one could expect, as pointed out,  a\r\n\r\nsituation  of kuan kuan sian hu, which means  they\r\n\r\nwill  take care of their own interest for  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons.  Another answer which has been  given  so\r\n\r\nvery   often   is   that  the  Police   Force   is\r\n\r\nshorthanded.  If the Police Force is  shorthanded,\r\n\r\nsomething  should be done very quickly.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nby  publicly  making such statement and  admitting\r\n\r\nthe  shortcomings of the Police Force, we are only\r\n\r\nextending an invitation to the criminals  to  step\r\n\r\nup their activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of the Lee Soo Ann Report and\r\n\r\nwhat  should be done to remedy the position should\r\n\r\nbe  looked into very quickly. This has dragged  on\r\n\r\nlong  enough,  and  I  would  like  to  refer  the\r\n\r\nHonourable Minister to his reply to me  last  year\r\n\r\nwhen we were debating on the same department. Most\r\n\r\nof the complaints are again heard here today. I am\r\n\r\nsure  most of my colleagues agree with me that  we\r\n\r\nare  beginning to feel a little tired coming  here\r\n\r\nand playing the same old record. It is not that we\r\n\r\nlike  to  hear our own voice or that we are  over-imaginative.  It cannot be due to over-imagination\r\n\r\nthat  we are taking up all these complaints. There\r\n\r\nmust be some foundation in the complaints to cause\r\n\r\nits num\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nber  to increase. Why? Certainly there must  be  a\r\n\r\ngood reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu said\r\n\r\nthat a stock answer has been given. Whatever the\r\n\r\nMember calls it, that is the answer because black\r\n\r\nsheep are always present in any organisation. If\r\n\r\nno action has been taken, then of course there is\r\n\r\njustification to complain. I have stated\r\n\r\ncategorically that action against black sheep has\r\n\r\nbeen taken. It is not that action has not been\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I repeat for the information of the Member\r\n\r\nhow  many black sheep have been dismissed from the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force. It is not that I want to  play  the\r\n\r\nrecord  again, but the point is that it seems  the\r\n\r\nmessage  has  not been put across effectively.  At\r\n\r\nthe  risk  of being repetitious, may I  again  say\r\n\r\nwhat action has been taken against black sheep? In\r\n\r\n1974, 35 officers comprising four Inspectors,  one\r\n\r\nStation  Inspector, four Sergeants and  26  Police\r\n\r\nConstables  have  been  dismissed.  Is  that   not\r\n\r\naction?  Do we want to sack more? They should  not\r\n\r\nbe  sacked  until  they have  been  given  a  fair\r\n\r\nhearing under a disciplinary board. It is not that\r\n\r\naction has not been taken. Action has been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allegation that police officers will\r\n\r\nprotect  their own kind, we should at  least  have\r\n\r\nsome  confidence  in the majority  of  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce    personnel   for   their    honesty    and\r\n\r\nimpartiality. I do not think it is fair to make  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  allegation that police  officers  protect\r\n\r\ntheir  own  kind.  May  I  say  that  justice  and\r\n\r\nimpartiality  not  only, in fact,  exist  in  such\r\n\r\ncases  but  they have been seen to  exist.  May  I\r\n\r\nrepeat  again that action has been taken to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Police Force Act in this House last  year  so\r\n\r\nthat   the   Commissioner  of  Police  can   refer\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  cases  against  junior  officers  or\r\n\r\ninspectors to the Public Service Commission. Where\r\n\r\ncases   are   referred  to  the   Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission,  there will be non-Police officers  on\r\n\r\nthe Board of Inquiry, and if there is a cover-up I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure that those who sit  on  the  Board\r\n\r\nshould be able to find out. Why should there be in\r\n\r\nthe Police Force an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexternal  body  to  investigate these  complaints?\r\n\r\nWhat  about  the other departments? There  is  the\r\n\r\nComplaints   Bureau  and  they  also   investigate\r\n\r\ncomplaints against police officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to manpower shortage, we are not\r\n\r\nthrowing  our arms up in despair. It is a problem,\r\n\r\nand  it  is not that nothing has been done.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave  stated just now in answer to the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong,  a  Manpower Committee has been formed  to\r\n\r\nlook  into these problems and I am just as anxious\r\n\r\nthat  they  come  up  with the answers.  If  these\r\n\r\nanswers  or  recommendations  are  accepted  -  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  other Ministries are also involved  -  we\r\n\r\ncan  then implement these recommendations to solve\r\n\r\nthe problem. I have said that one of the terms  of\r\n\r\nreference would be to review the effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  Lee  Soo Ann recommendations. Maybe it  could\r\n\r\nhave been done last year but as you know, it takes\r\n\r\nsome time to consider the effectiveness of the Lee\r\n\r\nSoo  Ann  recommendations. We  have  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nreview, and it is fair to say that the Lee Soo Ann\r\n\r\nrecommendations were implemented only two or three\r\n\r\nyears   ago.  I  think  we  have  not  lost  time.\r\n\r\nSomething has been done, and I assure the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan  Kayu  and Jurong that before  we  meet\r\n\r\nagain  in  the next Budget debate something  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  done  as far as manpower  shortage  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the proposal to introduce full-time\r\n\r\nnational  service in the Police Force  also  means\r\n\r\nthat  something is being done. This in  itself  is\r\n\r\nthe  answer that it will partly solve the  problem\r\n\r\nof manpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that the Gambling\r\n\r\nSuppression  Branch  takes  action  without  first\r\n\r\nchecking   up,   usually  they  do   check   their\r\n\r\ninformation.  In  the case mentioned  it  just  so\r\n\r\nhappened  that the raid conducted did  not  reveal\r\n\r\nanything. I agree with the Member for Jurong  that\r\n\r\nbefore  raids  are conducted they should  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  in  processing their information.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is a professional matter.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe   officer-in-charge  should  know   best   how\r\n\r\nreliable  the information is. These officers  have\r\n\r\nalways been cautioned to be very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncareful  about  information  received,  just   as\r\n\r\ninformation received about complaints against  the\r\n\r\nPolice   Force   have  also   to   be   cautiously\r\n\r\ninvestigated.  Some complaints are  substantiated,\r\n\r\nand  some are not. Some human beings, as you know,\r\n\r\nare motivated by good motives while some are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About police stations, something is also being\r\n\r\ndone  here. Most of our police stations were built\r\n\r\nbefore  World War II. Some were built even  before\r\n\r\nWorld   War  I.  Besides  the  Queenstown   Police\r\n\r\nStation,  we have not had any new police  station.\r\n\r\nIt  has been stated that four police stations will\r\n\r\nbe  built. I see the Member for Toa Payoh  sitting\r\n\r\nthere  pretty satisfied, and I hope the Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nPolice Station will come up soon. Tenders will  be\r\n\r\ncalled before the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Jurong, I agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong that the Police Force in Jurong Town is\r\n\r\nhighly  inadequate. At the time  of  planning  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Posts it was never envisaged  that  Jurong\r\n\r\nwould  grow  into  a  town of  80,000  or  100,000\r\n\r\npeople.  Immediate action is now  being  taken  to\r\n\r\nremedy that situation. Jurong Town is in the Rural\r\n\r\nWest  Police  Division. The  existing  Rural  West\r\n\r\nDivisional Headquarters stationed at Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nis  not  strategically situated to cater  for  the\r\n\r\nneeds of Jurong Town. It is, therefore, planned to\r\n\r\nbuild a headquarters station in Jurong Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Architect of the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  is now making a feasibility  study  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  the station on a two-acre site  opposite\r\n\r\nthe   T-junction  of  Corporation  Road  and   the\r\n\r\nproposed extended arm of Boon Lay Drive.  But,  as\r\n\r\nan  interim  measure, the Police are  planning  to\r\n\r\nshift  the  operational  headquarters  from  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  to  Jurong Town as soon as possible.  For\r\n\r\nthis purpose, an application has been made to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Building Committee for permission  to\r\n\r\nrent  part  of  the premises which belong  to  the\r\n\r\nJurong Town Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nanswering my questions. However, he seems to  have\r\n\r\nomitted two points. First, what measures are being\r\n\r\ntaken by his department to increase the efficiency\r\n\r\nof  the  Police Force and raise the morale of  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constables because some highly  qualified\r\n\r\npeople in the Constabulary have been asked  to  do\r\n\r\nvery  common  duties. The other point  relates  to\r\n\r\nPolice  Week. The Minister must not emphasise  the\r\n\r\nneed  for the people to cooperate with the Police.\r\n\r\nIt  should  be  the other way round -  the  Police\r\n\r\nshould cooperate with the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I have forgotten to\r\n\r\nanswer these questions. With regard to the Special\r\n\r\nConstables, that situation might have occurred  in\r\n\r\nthe  past. But attempts have now been made to make\r\n\r\npart-time   duties   in  the   Police   Force   as\r\n\r\ninteresting  as  possible  and  to  utilise  their\r\n\r\nhigher  education, which some  of  them  have,  to\r\n\r\nadvantage. For example, instead of detailing  some\r\n\r\ndental   surgeons,  who  are  part-time   national\r\n\r\nservicemen,  to  do  pure Police  work  which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong referred to as watchdog duties,\r\n\r\nthey have been organised to render dental service.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  they  are  giving  dental  service  to\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  the  Police Force  and  the  Special\r\n\r\nConstables.  We  are now trying to  utilise  their\r\n\r\ntalents  as  much as possible. The  difficulty  is\r\n\r\nthat  since they are part-time national servicemen\r\n\r\nthey  are  on duty for only three hours every  ten\r\n\r\ndays.  Anyway,  every attempt  is  being  made  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  national  service  in  the  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  is  as interesting as  possible.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  am  told  that their  morale  has  risen\r\n\r\ncompared to what it was before because of the  new\r\n\r\nattempts to make their service more interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to cooperation between the Police and\r\n\r\nthe public, of course, it is a two-way affair.  It\r\n\r\ncannot  be  one-sided. As I said, the officers  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the various Police Divisions have  been\r\n\r\ntold to work closely with Members of   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament  and  members  of  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees. Maybe there has been such\r\n\r\ncooperation in some Police Divisions  but  not  in\r\n\r\nothers.  But as we carry on with our campaigns  to\r\n\r\npromote Police/public relationship, a good working\r\n\r\nrelationship  will be fostered in all  the  Police\r\n\r\nDivisions.  It cannot be just a one-sided  affair.\r\n\r\nIt has to depend on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the Minister for his answers.

The men  who  combat\r\n\r\ncrime with increasing complexity and at great risk\r\n\r\nto themselves deserve our full support and praise.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to join my fellow colleagues\r\n\r\nhere  to  examine the real reasons for  the  acute\r\n\r\nshortage of manpower in the rank and file  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice   Force  and  to  establish  what  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures can be taken so that we will attract  the\r\n\r\nright  type of men for the very important task  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining law and order in our Republic. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe need to establish a Manpower Committee so soon\r\n\r\nafter the Lee Soo Ann Report may reflect the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister is not satisfied with the terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions given in the Lee Soo  Ann  Report.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I hope that this new Manpower  Committee\r\n\r\nwill do much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this sub-head I would like to comment on\r\n\r\nthe Ministry's traffic policy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  accepted that traffic control by both  the\r\n\r\nArea's  Divisional Police and the  Traffic  Police\r\n\r\nDivision is essential to reduce accident rate  and\r\n\r\nto  prevent traffic congestion. I am sure everyone\r\n\r\nagrees that severe penalties must be meted out  to\r\n\r\npeople who persistently commit tra-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nffic  offences  and violations. According  to  the\r\n\r\nlatest Police Department Annual Report, 1973,  the\r\n\r\nrevenue collected by the Force for the years  1972\r\n\r\nand  1973  for  compounding traffic offences  were\r\n\r\n$2,481,215 and $2,972,891 respectively. It  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, appear that the Traffic Police Division\r\n\r\nwas  set  up more as a revenue-earning section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Force where the silent  majority  are\r\n\r\nthose who are penalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month a member of this silent majority\r\n\r\ndutifully pleaded guilty to a charge of beating  a\r\n\r\nred light. It was his first offence. Excepting the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Court, no opportunity for any explanation\r\n\r\nwas  given or any offer of composition made by the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police. Like the majority who were unlucky\r\n\r\nto  be  summoned  to court, he had the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  there was little use in arguing against  the\r\n\r\nwords  of the single policeman who booked  him  as\r\n\r\none  would  only  end up paying  a  heavier  fine.\r\n\r\nHence,  he  pleaded  guilty.  Imagine  his   great\r\n\r\nsurprise  when the Magistrate fined him  $600.  He\r\n\r\nhad only $200 in his pocket. The Police refused to\r\n\r\nlet  him  go  home to get the rest of  the  money.\r\n\r\nFinally, he pleaded to be allowed to use the  only\r\n\r\navailable  telephone, that is, a public telephone.\r\n\r\nHe  called  up  his  office  colleagues  and  they\r\n\r\nmanaged  to raise the rest of the money  required.\r\n\r\nThis  was personally delivered to him. What  would\r\n\r\nhave  happened if the public telephone was out  of\r\n\r\norder?  Perhaps  he would have to wait  until  one\r\n\r\nkind   police   officer  dared  to  exercise   his\r\n\r\ndiscretion and allow him to go home to collect the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the money, having retained his  identity\r\n\r\ncard.  In  this particular instance, his  identity\r\n\r\ncard  was  retained and yet nobody was sympathetic\r\n\r\ntowards  his  predicament. He was  simply  treated\r\n\r\nlike a criminal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, on 23rd February I was told that in\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang Siang Pau, it was reported that a man\r\n\r\nwas  fined  only  $250  or one  month's  jail  for\r\n\r\nmolesting a girl in a public bus. Yet, for a first\r\n\r\noffender  for beating a red light the  penalty  is\r\n\r\n$600 or two months' jail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it Government's policy to raise revenue from\r\n\r\nthe   Traffic  Police  or  other  traffic  control\r\n\r\nauthority, such as the ROV irrespective of whether\r\n\r\nthe  public is going to suffer from any minor, and\r\n\r\nsometimes   through  ignorance,  or  unintentional\r\n\r\ninfringement of the law? The interpretation of the\r\n\r\nlaw  according  to  the letter  and  the  complete\r\n\r\nunwillingness  to exercise any discretion  is  the\r\n\r\nsurest  way  of  generating discontent  among  the\r\n\r\npublic against the Police and the Government. Many\r\n\r\npeople  feel  that the mobile and  traffic  police\r\n\r\nappear  to  have a quota of arrests to fulfil.  In\r\n\r\nthe same 1973 Police Department Annual Report,  it\r\n\r\nwas  also  reported that for the  years  1972  and\r\n\r\n1973,  the  number of reports of traffic  offences\r\n\r\nwere 121,648 and 163,634 cases respectively. It is\r\n\r\nlittle  wonder  that as the Traffic  Police  fines\r\n\r\nincrease in size the number of arrests or  traffic\r\n\r\noffences  committed  by  the  public  appears   to\r\n\r\nincrease   proportionately.  I  would   like   the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned to make a statement whether the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police has, in fact, a quota of arrests to\r\n\r\nfulfil  either for each day or each month for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The answer is no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> In fact, I was told that the Mobile Squads were\r\n\r\neach given a quota of six arrests a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a well-known fact that Traffic Police\r\n\r\n(both from the Traffic and various Divisions) hide\r\n\r\nbehind trees, pillars and at corners to pounce  on\r\n\r\nmotorists  who may have missed, for  example,  the\r\n\r\n\"no  turning\"  road signs during certain  selected\r\n\r\nhours. Many Members in this House will agree  that\r\n\r\nsome of these signs cannot be read until one comes\r\n\r\nnear and stop in front of them. For a motorist who\r\n\r\nis unfamiliar with a road or area, it is sometimes\r\n\r\ninevitable  that  turning the  corner  during  the\r\n\r\nrestricted   hours  will  happen.  Some   of   the\r\n\r\npolicemen  forget that their primary  duty  is  to\r\n\r\nassist the public and not to simply arrest or book\r\n\r\nthem.  They should, therefore, stand in  front  of\r\n\r\nthe  signs  to guide the traffic rather than  hide\r\n\r\nsomewhere so as to be able to catch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotorists for committing any simple offences.  All\r\n\r\nthe strenuous efforts to project the good image of\r\n\r\nthe Police Force as a friend of the public such as\r\n\r\nthe  Police Week and so on, are nullified by these\r\n\r\nactions of the Traffic Police. The Police who want\r\n\r\npublic  cooperation on the one  hand  seem  to  be\r\n\r\npractising   public  persecution  of  the   silent\r\n\r\nmajority, on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully support the Police in their job to\r\n\r\nmaintain  law and order, but I would like  to  see\r\n\r\npositive action taken by the Ministry to minimise,\r\n\r\nif  not  to  eliminate, punishment by the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice of the silent majority simply because  they\r\n\r\nare  more manageable victims to handle than  those\r\n\r\nwho commit serious crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I will try to bring up those points which\r\n\r\nthey have not covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many police stations in Singapore which\r\n\r\nare  very old as they were built a long time  ago,\r\n\r\nand  they  have not been renovated. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Police  Station building  is  an  ancient\r\n\r\nbuilding. Since there is a trend to modernise  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force, why not start building a new Central\r\n\r\nPolice Station? A new, central, modern, and up-to-date  police station will not only create a better\r\n\r\nimage  but  it  will also provide  better  working\r\n\r\nconditions for the officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of full-time national service\r\n\r\nfor  the Police Force is an excellent idea  as  it\r\n\r\nwill  meet  the manpower shortage to some  extent.\r\n\r\nMay I ask how this is going to be implemented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask whether the Police\r\n\r\nForce  is  manned properly? In the last one  week,\r\n\r\nmore than a million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndollars  worth  of  goods were  stolen  in  a  few\r\n\r\nrobberies.    Something   is   wrong    somewhere.\r\n\r\nObviously, the criminals know that the  Police  is\r\n\r\nunderstaffed  and, therefore, they  can  get  away\r\n\r\nwith  crime. Their attitude seems to  be  that  if\r\n\r\nthey  get  caught it is just bad luck.  But  their\r\n\r\nchances  of  getting away are good.  Probably  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force is very badly understaffed. It is  no\r\n\r\nuse  increasing the punishment for  the  criminals\r\n\r\nbecause I believe the robberies will increase.  We\r\n\r\nmust try to reform the robbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is happening to the mobile squad of our\r\n\r\nTraffic Police? My colleague has already spoken on\r\n\r\nthis  subject. A few national servicemen have been\r\n\r\nrecruited to this section. They were given  a  few\r\n\r\nancient  vehicles  to go around on  patrol,  which\r\n\r\nbroke  down so often. They could not do their  job\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any plan by the Police Department to buy\r\n\r\nmore  motor cycles so that more traffic  policemen\r\n\r\nwill be available when needed at all times of  the\r\n\r\nday?  Sometimes in congested areas we  cannot  see\r\n\r\nany traffic constables. They have all disappeared.\r\n\r\nNowadays,  the only time policemen and  women  are\r\n\r\nseen  is  often during peak-hour periods  or  when\r\n\r\nthere is a road safety campaign. That is the  time\r\n\r\nthey  come out in full force. Outside those  hours\r\n\r\nthey are very elusive. They are never seen on  the\r\n\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic lights along the stretch of road from\r\n\r\nOrchard Road right up to Collyer Quay are supposed\r\n\r\nto  be synchronised. May I ask how many roads have\r\n\r\ntraffic  lights synchronised in such  a  way  that\r\n\r\nthey  ensure a smooth flow of traffic? Quite often\r\n\r\nmotorists  have  to stop at every  traffic  light,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  not synchronised  and  thereby\r\n\r\ntraffic  jams occur, or the traffic is  unable  to\r\n\r\nflow  easily  and smoothly. Furthermore,  to  make\r\n\r\nmatters  worse the duration of the amber light  of\r\n\r\nmany   traffic  lights  is  so  short  that   many\r\n\r\nmotorists  are  caught unawares. In certain  cases\r\n\r\naccidents  have resulted simply because the  amber\r\n\r\nlight went off so fast that the red light seems to\r\n\r\nbe instantly on. And the green light for the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirection is lighted at the same time. I feel that\r\n\r\na  few  seconds' duration should be given for  all\r\n\r\nthe  red  lights to stay on before  changing  into\r\n\r\ngreen  light  for the other direction of  traffic;\r\n\r\nand not an immediate change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I still want to stress the point\r\n\r\nthat  we should pay attention to the rising  crime\r\n\r\nrate  in  Housing  Board  estates.  Just  now  the\r\n\r\nMinister in his answer mentioned several points to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that the crime rate in the HDB estates\r\n\r\nhas  decreased. But I have found out  that  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  certain crimes committed in  these  areas\r\n\r\nwere not reported to the Police. That accounts for\r\n\r\nthe  decrease. Perhaps it is due to  the  people's\r\n\r\ndisappointment with the service they get from  the\r\n\r\nPolice that they do not want to report any crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimes in HDB estates are usually robbery, house-breaking, and molest. There are people who regard\r\n\r\nsuch  crimes as minor and so the police  need  not\r\n\r\nbother  paying attention to them. I do  not  agree\r\n\r\nwith such people. We should realise that more than\r\n\r\nhalf of our population live in HDB flats. They are\r\n\r\nconstantly  troubled with crimes such  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, and this puts them in a dilemma. Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Police  should give  top  priority  to\r\n\r\ncombating  such  crimes. There are  so  many  such\r\n\r\nincidents  that  the HDB flat dwellers  themselves\r\n\r\nare unable to prevent them that they need the help\r\n\r\nof the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually these crimes are committed in a certain\r\n\r\npattern.  If  a flat is empty, the criminal  would\r\n\r\nbreak  open  the  door  and  steal  the  property.\r\n\r\nRobbery or molest is usually committed in the lift\r\n\r\nor  in  some secluded corner at a convenient time.\r\n\r\nThese criminals usually find that HDB estates  are\r\n\r\nconvenient places for them to commit their crimes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is because of many people milling about\r\n\r\nthat it is difficult to detect them. Once they are\r\n\r\nmissed in the crowd, they could easily make  their\r\n\r\nescape. The Police should be aware of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis and should be able to think out a good method\r\n\r\nto deal with such crimes. I cannot understand why,\r\n\r\nin  spite  of the increase and frequency  of  such\r\n\r\ncrimes, the Police are still not able up to now to\r\n\r\ntake any effective measures to check such crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the main reason why the Police\r\n\r\nDepartment  is not able to deal with these  crimes\r\n\r\neffectively  is  that  they  have  neglected   the\r\n\r\nseriousness of such crimes because they think that\r\n\r\nrobbery,  house-breaking, and theft are all  minor\r\n\r\ncrimes  which  do not deserve their attention.  So\r\n\r\nthey do not plan out an effective way to deal with\r\n\r\nsuch crimes. Another reason is that the police  do\r\n\r\nnot  well  understand the conditions  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates and therefore they cannot fully play their\r\n\r\nrole.  They are not able to carry out their duties\r\n\r\neffectively,  thus leading to higher incidents  of\r\n\r\ncrime everyday, even in the day time. I think  the\r\n\r\ncriminals  know the conditions in  the  HDB  areas\r\n\r\nbetter  than the Police. They also know very  well\r\n\r\nthe beat duties of the policemen, and so they pick\r\n\r\na  suitable  time and place in order  to  get  off\r\n\r\neasily.  In  the circumstances, the  police  could\r\n\r\nonly  resort  to  such measures as increasing  the\r\n\r\nnumber of patrol cars and more frequent beats,  or\r\n\r\nput  more policemen on beat patrol in the  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  This is also what the Minister suggested\r\n\r\nin  his  replies. Using only this method, I think,\r\n\r\nis  a bit too mundane. It is a sort of routine. It\r\n\r\nwill  not enable the Police to know what  goes  on\r\n\r\ninside  the buildings. Moreover, it will give  the\r\n\r\ncriminals a good opportunity to pick out  suitable\r\n\r\ntimes  and  places to commit crime. For  instance,\r\n\r\nduring  the recent exercise of community  security\r\n\r\nservice, the hours were from 7 pm, to 11 p.m, when\r\n\r\nthe  participants  had  to report  to  the  police\r\n\r\nstation  at these times. So if one were to  report\r\n\r\nat  a  police  station, it would take  some  time.\r\n\r\nAfter  taking away the time for the trips  to  and\r\n\r\nfro, only about two hours would be left. What kind\r\n\r\nof help can the people get out of such patrolling?\r\n\r\nThe  criminals can also calculate their time. They\r\n\r\ncan commit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrimes, before the patrolmen turn up or after they\r\n\r\nhave  left. So if the Police cannot quickly  think\r\n\r\nout a better method to deal with the crimes in HDB\r\n\r\nestates  but  only talk about crime  and  security\r\n\r\nproblems  in  the  housing  estates,  it  is  more\r\n\r\npropaganda and is not going to help the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me this is a very important question because I\r\n\r\nam  not  willing  to see more  than  half  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  who  are  staying  in  Housing   Board\r\n\r\nestates  facing this security hazard. So  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest to the Minister, firstly, to  set\r\n\r\nup  in  the  Police  Force a  section  of  special\r\n\r\npersonnel to deal with the prevention of crimes in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board estates by taking charge of matters\r\n\r\nsuch  as  planning effective action  to  ensure  a\r\n\r\npresence  of security. Secondly, to set up  Police\r\n\r\nsub-depots in HDB estates. I do not mean  ordinary\r\n\r\npolice  stations but sub-depots. I mean  that  the\r\n\r\nPolice could rent a one-room unit from the HDB and\r\n\r\nstation  some policemen there to provide a 24-hour\r\n\r\nservice. I believe this can be very effective  and\r\n\r\neconomical. It would be cheaper than to get patrol\r\n\r\ncars  to go around. In this way the residents will\r\n\r\nbe  able to see the policemen every day and,  when\r\n\r\nnecessary,  they  can report to the  policeman  on\r\n\r\nduty  of  any  crime. Moreover, it will  give  the\r\n\r\nPolice  an  opportunity  to  cooperate  with   and\r\n\r\nactually serve the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, your 10 minutes are up. Mr Phey is not\r\n\r\nhere.

He seems to\r\n\r\ngive the impression that he is quite an expert  on\r\n\r\nthe  crime situation in the Housing Board estates.\r\n\r\nHe  is  quite  vehement  about  setting  up  crime\r\n\r\ndetection  and  prevention posts in Housing  Board\r\n\r\nestates. May I remind him that I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  much concerned with crime in the Housing Board\r\n\r\nestates as he is. I may remind him that I  am  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  MacPherson,  a  constituency   which\r\n\r\nconsists wholly of Housing Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member for Bukit Panjang is\r\n\r\nsuggesting  this to prepare for the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats  that are going up in Woodlands. As  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  proposal to establish a police post in  every\r\n\r\nHousing   Board   estate  to  prevent   crime   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I have stated earlier that it is not  a\r\n\r\nfeasible proposition. Without the support  of  the\r\n\r\nHeadquarters  Division, such police  posts  cannot\r\n\r\nrespond  effectively. They  can  only  respond  to\r\n\r\nreports  of  petty crimes within  their  immediate\r\n\r\nvicinity.  This is an uneconomic use of  manpower.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   the  answer  is  mobile   patrol   by\r\n\r\npolicemen,  who  will provide a quicker  and  more\r\n\r\neffective  response to crime reports.  The  Police\r\n\r\nwill  also be able to deploy its limited  manpower\r\n\r\nover  a wider area by increased mobility, that  is\r\n\r\nto say, to adopt team policing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain to the Member what is meant by team\r\n\r\npolicing? Team policing is not just going  into  a\r\n\r\npatrol car and take a drive round. That is not the\r\n\r\ncase. Team policing entails a deployment of a four-man  patrol  team utilising a saloon car  equipped\r\n\r\nwith  a  portable two-way radio for  communication\r\n\r\nwith  each  team  member  and  their  headquarters\r\n\r\nstation.  The team provides a 24-hour coverage  of\r\n\r\ncrime-prone  and specially selected  areas,  which\r\n\r\nare    divided   into   sectors   determined    by\r\n\r\ngeographical  location,  crime  rate,   population\r\n\r\ndensity and security sensitivity. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nteam  also perform foot patrols. They do not  only\r\n\r\nsit  in  cars. They are also equipped with walkie-talkies  in order to achieve maximum coverage  and\r\n\r\nto  develop  close rapport with the  public.  When\r\n\r\nthey  need  to  act  as a team,  they  can  easily\r\n\r\nassemble  together  because of  the  walkie-talkie\r\n\r\ncommunication with each other. To prove that it is\r\n\r\nan  effective method of crime prevention,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  tested in \"A\" and \"E\" Divisions. The results\r\n\r\nconfirmed that it is a better system. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  shown  that  the rate of preventable  crimes,\r\n\r\nsuch as robberies and burglaries, has decreased by\r\n\r\napproximately 30% in both Divisions. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nshall implement team policing in the remaining six\r\n\r\nDivisions by October 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member said that we do not regard house-breaking and robberies in Housing Board estates\r\n\r\nwith any seriousness. That is not true. We do.  In\r\n\r\nfact, in addition to the proposed team policing we\r\n\r\nhave  already instituted vertical policing of  the\r\n\r\nHousing   Board  estates.  In  other  words,   the\r\n\r\npolicemen  do not only police round the block  but\r\n\r\nthey  also  go up and down the staircase  and  the\r\n\r\nlift as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a Police presence, priority for Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats is given to Police officers, but  not\r\n\r\nevery  Police officer will be staying in the  same\r\n\r\nblock of flats. That is no good. The scheme i5  to\r\n\r\nslot,  say,  two Police officers in one  block  of\r\n\r\nfiats,  so  that there is some form  of  a  Police\r\n\r\npresence  in every block of flats. That  is  being\r\n\r\ndone now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that routine patrolling is\r\n\r\nnot  good enough for crime prevention because  the\r\n\r\ncriminals are intelligent enough to know when  the\r\n\r\nPolice  is coming and therefore could avoid  them.\r\n\r\nSurely the Member can credit the Police with  some\r\n\r\nintelligence  and  commonsense  not  to  have  too\r\n\r\nroutine a policing. In other words, everyday  they\r\n\r\ndeploy  their  patrolling at different  intervals,\r\n\r\ni.e, not necessarily at the same time every  day.\r\n\r\nThe  point about CSF on policing duty between  the\r\n\r\nhours  of  7  p.m, and 11 p.m, every  night-  that\r\n\r\ncannot be helped because they are also working  in\r\n\r\nthe  day and are only free during these hours.  We\r\n\r\nhave  also organised some Vigilante Corps  members\r\n\r\nwho  work on night shifts to patrol during the day\r\n\r\ntime as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member for Anson. I agree with\r\n\r\nhim  that almost all the police stations  are  old\r\n\r\nand  due for renovation. I have said that all  the\r\n\r\npolice stations, except Queenstown Police Station,\r\n\r\nwere built before the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond  World  War. As far as the  Central  Police\r\n\r\nStation  is  concerned, it is due  for  demolition\r\n\r\nunder  urban renewal. II is planned to  house  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Police  Station  at  the  present  Police\r\n\r\nHeadquarters  building at Pearl's Hill,  when  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  Police\r\n\r\nComplex at Mount Pleasant is developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also mentioned that four divisional police\r\n\r\nstations will be built in the course of the fiscal\r\n\r\nyear.  One is at Toa Payoh. The second station  is\r\n\r\nthe  Orchard  Road Police Station at  Napier  Road\r\n\r\nnear  the  Gleneagles Hospital. The third  is  the\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar Police Station at Upper Paya Lebar Road\r\n\r\njunction, and the fourth is the Jurong Town Police\r\n\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the shortage of Police manpower, may I say\r\n\r\nthis.   The   shortage  of  Police   manpower   is\r\n\r\nexperienced  not  only in Singapore  but  also  in\r\n\r\nother Police Forces the world over. However,  this\r\n\r\nis  not something which criminals can find comfort\r\n\r\nin,  as  suggested  by some Members,  because  the\r\n\r\nPolice   make   up  this  shortfall   by   greater\r\n\r\nutilisation of national servicemen, like  the  CSF\r\n\r\nand  so  on, more civilianisation and the  use  of\r\n\r\npolicewomen  to relieve male junior  officers  for\r\n\r\ncrime   detection   and  prevention   work.   More\r\n\r\nmechanisation  has  also been  adopted  with  team\r\n\r\npolicing. As far as investigation and detection is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we have also reorganised the  Criminal\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Department.  We  have  built  up  a\r\n\r\nCriminal  Intelligence Unit and we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  a  Scene  of Crime Unit,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  increase  the effectiveness  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force further. So far, in spite of what  we\r\n\r\nread   in  the  newspapers,  the  rate  of   crime\r\n\r\ndetection is quite high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as full-time national servicemen are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the details are being worked  out  and\r\n\r\nthey will be announced in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the mobile squad, as far as its\r\n\r\nstrength  is concerned, it is not as  bad  as  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force as a whole. But its shortage will  be\r\n\r\nlooked into by he Manpower Committee, as I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  before. One of the primary functions of  the\r\n\r\nmobile  squad is to control and regulate  traffic.\r\n\r\nThe  volume  of  traffic is heaviest  during  peak\r\n\r\nhours. Therefore, more mobile squad personnel  are\r\n\r\nutilised during these periods than off-peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned about using\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  to do  mobile  patrol  squad\r\n\r\nduty.  We  have  a  small mobile  patrolmen  squad\r\n\r\ncomprising  37 national servicemen.  They  perform\r\n\r\neight  hours  of duty every 19 days on motorcycles\r\n\r\nprovided by the Special Constabulary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to traffic lights, they are\r\n\r\nsynchronised to facilitate the flow of traffic. To\r\n\r\ndate, 26 roads have such a synchronised system. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  the amber light is concerned, the  amber-phase of a traffic light system is timed according\r\n\r\nto  the  intensity of the vehicular traffic  going\r\n\r\nthrough  the  road  intersections.  Normally   the\r\n\r\nduration  is three seconds. The Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\ngave  an example. He wants all lights to be  green\r\n\r\nat the same time so that there is a smooth flow of\r\n\r\ntraffic.  I agree with him on this point,  but  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time if all lights are green there  must\r\n\r\nbe a time when all lights are red. You cannot have\r\n\r\none without having the other also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point made by the Member for River Valley is\r\n\r\nthat  the Traffic Police Division is, he fears,  a\r\n\r\nrevenue-collecting organisation. I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  it is not a revenue-collecting organisation.\r\n\r\nIts  function is to enforce traffic laws  so  that\r\n\r\naccidents will be reduced to the minimum.  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice   personnel  are  constantly  reminded   to\r\n\r\nenforce traffic laws in accordance with the spirit\r\n\r\nrather  than the letter of the law. In fact,  they\r\n\r\nhave been told that their work is assessed on  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  cases reported  and  not  on  the\r\n\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state this quite categorically. It is a\r\n\r\nmisconception to say that the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police have been told to come back with so\r\n\r\nmany summonses a day.\r\n\r\nThis is not true. It is the quality of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases they detect rather than the quantity. Let me\r\n\r\nbe  very  categorical about this. That is why  the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police have adopted what they term as  the\r\n\r\nSelective Enforcement Policy. The rationale behind\r\n\r\nthis  policy is that it is not possible to enforce\r\n\r\nthe  law  in  every single traffic violation,  and\r\n\r\nsince  there  is a relationship between  hazardous\r\n\r\ntraffic  violations  and  traffic  accidents,  the\r\n\r\nTraffic   Police  concentrate  their   enforcement\r\n\r\nefforts   on   serious  traffic   offences   which\r\n\r\ncontribute to traffic accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Selective Enforcement Policy is now paying\r\n\r\ndividends.   The   number  of   traffic   accident\r\n\r\nfatalities  dropped from 390 in  1972  to  380  in\r\n\r\n1973.  In 1974, 288 persons were killed in traffic\r\n\r\naccidents, representing a reduction of 24.2%.  May\r\n\r\nI  repeat  that  it is not true that  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice have a quota of summonses to issue per  day\r\n\r\nin  order  to boost the revenue of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe  assessment of the performance of  the  police\r\n\r\nofficer  is  based  on  the nature  of  the  cases\r\n\r\nreported and not on the quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also realise that to many black sheep\r\n\r\nmotorists,  particularly those who can  afford  to\r\n\r\npay  fines, the ultimate answer is not  to  impose\r\n\r\nfines on them again and again. That is why we have\r\n\r\nintroduced the Points Demerit System in  which  an\r\n\r\naccumulation  of  12  points for  serious  traffic\r\n\r\nviolations will cause the offender's licence to be\r\n\r\nsuspended.  It  is quite clear that  we  introduce\r\n\r\nthis system not with the object of collecting more\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  because  we  could  then  justify   a\r\n\r\nsuspension of licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the case which the Member brought\r\n\r\nup   about  the  Police  not  allowing  a  traffic\r\n\r\noffender to go home to collect money for a fine, I\r\n\r\nam  surprised  he  has  not  brought  this  to  my\r\n\r\nattention  earlier because this  case  needs  some\r\n\r\ninvestigation. I do not know why this has not been\r\n\r\ndone. As far as the sentence is concerned - a fine\r\n\r\nof  $600 as compared to a lighter sentence  for  a\r\n\r\ncase  of molesting, that is a matter which is  not\r\n\r\nwithin  the  province  of  the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.  That  is left to the assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou   know,   it  is  his  judgment  alone   which\r\n\r\ndetermines  the  degree of the  sentence.  If  the\r\n\r\nperson  who  is  sentenced is not  happy,  he  can\r\n\r\nappeal.  This  is what is known as an  independent\r\n\r\njudiciary.  That has got nothing to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police. But as far as the Traffic  Police\r\n\r\nis  concerned, in cases where there is  a  blatant\r\n\r\nviolation  of traffic laws which would  invariably\r\n\r\nlead  to an accident if not prevented, they  would\r\n\r\nwant heavier and heavier sentences to be imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I do concede the point that the amount of\r\n\r\nfine  imposed  for  a traffic offence  is  at  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the magistrate. But what I am trying\r\n\r\nto  bring  out is the public opinion  towards  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  traffic  in  Singapore.  Just  now  I\r\n\r\nindicated  the  increased  revenue  from   traffic\r\n\r\noffences  in  1972-73. 1 said  that  in  1972  the\r\n\r\nrevenue was almost $2.5 million and in 1973 it was\r\n\r\nalmost  $3 million. One of my colleagues here  has\r\n\r\ngiven  me  figures which show that  the  estimated\r\n\r\nrevenue  from  traffic fines  for  1974  was  $3.3\r\n\r\nmillion and for 1975 the estimated revenue  is  $4\r\n\r\nmillion. So there is this fear among the public of\r\n\r\nthis  intention. I am just reflecting this  public\r\n\r\nopinion which I think is valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to traffic fines, I purposely lay\r\n\r\nstress that this was the first offence, and  I  do\r\n\r\nconcede that if there is a blatant act to beat the\r\n\r\ntraffic light then nobody would quibble about  it.\r\n\r\nBut here is a case of one policeman's word against\r\n\r\nthat  of  a member of the public. I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister, being a lawyer himself,  is  it\r\n\r\nnot common Jaw that a person is innocent until  he\r\n\r\nis  proved  guilty? But in this case the policeman\r\n\r\nseems to exercise the reverse, which means that he\r\n\r\npresumes that the offender is guilty until  he  is\r\n\r\nproved innocent. What I am saying is that no oppor\r\n\r\ntunity  was  given  to this person  to  prove  his\r\n\r\ninnocence,  it  is like saying,  \"When  the  light\r\n\r\nturned amber, I was very near the stop-line.  What\r\n\r\ndo  you want me to do? Step on the emergency brake\r\n\r\nor drive across?\" The circumstances are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch that proper investigation should be done. The\r\n\r\nreason  why I did not bring this matter up earlier\r\n\r\nwas  because] was informed of it only a few  weeks\r\n\r\nago although the incident occurred on 2nd January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I am quite surprised that the person\r\n\r\nconcerned pleaded guilty. If he is not guilty,  he\r\n\r\nshould not have pleaded guilty. The Traffic Police\r\n\r\ncannot force him to plead guilty, and if he  feels\r\n\r\nthat the fine of S600 is too heavy because this is\r\n\r\nhis  first  offence  he  can  always  appeal.  The\r\n\r\nsentence is at the discretion of the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about revenue. The Annual\r\n\r\nReport  for  1973 just happened to include  it.  I\r\n\r\nhave  made  it quite clear that it is no criterion\r\n\r\nto  effectiveness.  The  criterion  is:  how  many\r\n\r\naccidents have been averted? How many deaths  have\r\n\r\nbeen  avoided? How many cases of injury  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom road accidents have been reduced? That is the\r\n\r\ncriterion and I state this quite categorically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I concede all the points the Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid.  Can the Minister assure the House  that  he\r\n\r\nwill  give  specific instructions to  all  Traffic\r\n\r\nControl Divisions and the Traffic Police that they\r\n\r\nwill henceforth stand in front of the traffic sign\r\n\r\nor  at the road junction and not hide behind trees\r\n\r\nin order to catch the offenders, as we have seen a\r\n\r\nfew days ago?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is another point, it is\r\n\r\nactually  debatable whether the Traffic  policemen\r\n\r\nshould  stand  in  front of the  traffic  sign  or\r\n\r\nbehind it. As I said, the Points Demerit System is\r\n\r\nsuch  that we must operate it in such a way as  to\r\n\r\nremove  those hazardous drivers who are  a  danger\r\n\r\nand  a  menace  to other road users.  Whether  the\r\n\r\npolicemen carry out their duty in front or  behind\r\n\r\ntrees is a matter for the professionals to decide.\r\n\r\nI will not direct them on this. The policy is that\r\n\r\nthey  should  not  summon just  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nsummoning.

Having come here illegally,  and\r\n\r\nfinally, finding themselves financially destitute,\r\n\r\nthey  end up by committing crimes. May I ask  what\r\n\r\nactive  measures are being taken to prevent  entry\r\n\r\nof illegal immigrants into Singapore? A few may be\r\n\r\ncaught,  but  I am sure that many got  away  scot-free.  I  will not be surprised if I am told  that\r\n\r\nmany of the robberies, thefts, etc, were committed\r\n\r\nby  these  illegal immigrants out of  desperation.\r\n\r\nWhat  steps  are  being taken to  tighten  up  our\r\n\r\nsecurity  measures  to  prevent  entry  of   these\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Immigration Office at Empress Place\r\n\r\nseems to be perpetually congested. There seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  no order. People do not queue up and there  is\r\n\r\nconfusion.   It   is  time  this  department   was\r\n\r\nreorganised so that there will be a proper  system\r\n\r\nin dealing with members of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints that some of the\r\n\r\nofficials  who deal with members of the public  do\r\n\r\nnot  seem  to understand the policy governing  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  passports. To quote an instance,  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  boy who was born in Singapore. His parents\r\n\r\nare  non-citizens. He is studying in a  school  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Recently, the boy's parents  wanted  to\r\n\r\ntake him abroad to see his aged grandparents. When\r\n\r\nhis  parents applied for an international passport\r\n\r\nfor  this boy, the Immigration Official told  them\r\n\r\nthat   the   application  for  the   international\r\n\r\npassport  was  rejected. The reason  is  that  his\r\n\r\nparents are non-citizens and, therefore, he cannot\r\n\r\nautomatically become a citizen. They were  advised\r\n\r\nby   the  official  that  they  should  obtain   a\r\n\r\ncertificate of status for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  boy, which would take some time for it to  be\r\n\r\ngranted.  In the meantime, the parents  went  back\r\n\r\nhome disappointed and explained the matter to  the\r\n\r\nboy's   uncle.  On  the  strength  of  the   boy's\r\n\r\nrestricted  passport which was given  earlier  the\r\n\r\nuncle  went  to  see the Assistant  Controller  of\r\n\r\nImmigration  to  explain the case.  The  Assistant\r\n\r\nController, on seeing the restricted passport that\r\n\r\nthe  boy  is  a  citizen by  birth,  directed  his\r\n\r\nofficer  to  approve the issue of an international\r\n\r\npassport.  However, the official  told  the  boy's\r\n\r\nuncle  that  the  original  application  form  was\r\n\r\nmissing  and  requested him to  fill  up  a  fresh\r\n\r\napplication  and  to collect  the  passport  on  a\r\n\r\ncertain day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day in question when he went to collect\r\n\r\nthe  passport,  the official was  not  there.  But\r\n\r\nthere  was  another person dealing with the  case.\r\n\r\nAgain  the  same problem arose, and this disgusted\r\n\r\ngentleman had to refer the matter to the Assistant\r\n\r\nController. Finally the passport was approved  and\r\n\r\ngiven to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know why should all these\r\n\r\nunnecessary  problems exist at this counter.  Such\r\n\r\ninconsiderate and ignorant behaviour on  the  part\r\n\r\nof  the  officer  at  the counter  should  not  be\r\n\r\ntolerated because many tourists and visitors go to\r\n\r\nthis  department. It would give a very poor  image\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and their opinion would be that  the\r\n\r\ndepartment is not functioning properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to take the question of the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah first. The position is  that\r\n\r\nthe old Singapore paper identity cards have ceased\r\n\r\nto  be  valid documents after 31st January,  1967,\r\n\r\nvide Government Gazette Notification No. 145 dated\r\n\r\n20th  January, 1967. In view of this, persons  who\r\n\r\nare  away  and  still hold old Singapore  identity\r\n\r\ncards are not automatically eligible for Singapore\r\n\r\nlaminated  identity cards. If they wish to  return\r\n\r\nto   Singapore,  they  must  first  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department for the necessary  permits\r\n\r\nto  return.  If  their applications are  approved,\r\n\r\nthey may then apply for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew laminated identity cards after their return to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is necessary because many  people\r\n\r\nwho have been residing in a foreign country for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time may have lost their permanent  resident\r\n\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to illegal immigrants, brought up by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson, the majority of the illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants   are   brought   into   Singapore   by\r\n\r\ntraffickers,  some  of  whom  are  organised  into\r\n\r\nsyndicates. Concerted action continues to be taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Police and the Immigration Department  on\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants. The Marine Police who  patrol\r\n\r\nthe  territorial waters of Singapore  are  on  the\r\n\r\nlookout  for  small vessels which  sneak  in  with\r\n\r\nillegal   immigrants   on   board.   Police    and\r\n\r\nImmigration Officers carry out surprise checks  at\r\n\r\nwork  sites.  They  also conduct  raids  based  on\r\n\r\ninformation    gathered   by    the    Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment. This has resulted in numerous  arrests\r\n\r\nof illegal immigrants. In 1972, 1973 and 1974, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of illegal immigrants arrested was  1,547;\r\n\r\n2,223  and  1,365  respectively. On  arrest  these\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants were prosecuted and imprisoned,\r\n\r\nand  then repatriated. The traffickers were  dealt\r\n\r\nwith severely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the amendment to the law introduced last\r\n\r\nyear,   penalties   for  traffickers   have   been\r\n\r\nenhanced.  Illegal immigrants and their harbourers\r\n\r\nor employers are liable to imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nnot exceeding two years or to a fine of $6,000  or\r\n\r\nto  both  such imprisonment and fine.  Traffickers\r\n\r\nare  punished  with imprisonment of  two  to  five\r\n\r\nyears and are also liable to fine of up to $10,000\r\n\r\nand  to  caning.  In  addition,  their  boats  and\r\n\r\nequipment  are  also  confiscated.  Recently   one\r\n\r\ntrafficker was sentenced to 64 years' imprisonment\r\n\r\nand   12   strokes  of  the  rotan,  and   another\r\n\r\ntrafficker  four  years'  imprisonment  and  eight\r\n\r\nstrokes   of   the  rotan.  Keeping  the   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants out of Singapore is not easy because of\r\n\r\nthe  close proximity of neighbouring countries and\r\n\r\nthe    accessibility   of   our   coastline.   The\r\n\r\nImmigration Department has since last year set  up\r\n\r\nan Intelligence Unit to seek out traffickers. As a\r\n\r\nresult  it  has achieved considerable  success  in\r\n\r\ntracking down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  number  of  traffickers who are  now  in  gaol\r\n\r\nserving heavy sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to congestion at Empress Place office\r\n\r\nof  the Immigration Department, in early 1974  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department secured an extra  area  of\r\n\r\n11,330 sq, ft, at the headquarters, Empress Place.\r\n\r\nThis  extension  of office and waiting  space  has\r\n\r\nhelped to ease the congestion. Railings have  been\r\n\r\nconstructed at crowded sections of the counters to\r\n\r\ninduce the public to queue up. This has been done,\r\n\r\nfor   instance,  at  the  Passport  counter  where\r\n\r\nnumerous  applications  are  received  daily.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to the railings, more cushioned  benches\r\n\r\nhave  been  placed for members of the  public  who\r\n\r\nhave to wait. The issue of the various immigration\r\n\r\ndocuments is also done in an orderly fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson related the story of a boy\r\n\r\nwho went through considerable difficulty before he\r\n\r\nwas  issued with an international passport. I have\r\n\r\nbeen  informed  by  my officers  of  a  case,  the\r\n\r\nthreads  of  which are very similar and  it  could\r\n\r\nwell  be  the  same  case. The  boy  was  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on 7th February, 1963. His  application\r\n\r\nfor a passport was submitted by his father on 11th\r\n\r\nNovember,   1974   at  the  Immigration   counter.\r\n\r\nAlthough   his   father  had   declared   on   the\r\n\r\napplication  form  that  the  boy  had  no   other\r\n\r\npassport, it was discovered later that the child's\r\n\r\nname was included in his father's foreign passport\r\n\r\nand that both father and son had entered Singapore\r\n\r\non  a  visit  pass. Since the boy was a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  he  had really no reason to travel  on  a\r\n\r\nforeign passport, but having entered Singapore  on\r\n\r\na   foreign  passport,  his  application   for   a\r\n\r\nSingapore  international  passport  was  therefore\r\n\r\nreferred  to a senior officer. The senior  officer\r\n\r\ntold the father that it was necessary for the  boy\r\n\r\nto  regularise his stay in Singapore  by  applying\r\n\r\nfor a certificate of status before the issue of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore   international   passport   could    be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18th November, 1974, father and son called at\r\n\r\nthe Immigration Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  produced the boy's Singapore restricted\r\n\r\npassport.  This  case  was then  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Controller of Immigration  who  was  in\r\n\r\ncharge of the Passport Section. He found that  the\r\n\r\nboy's  case  had already been regularised  by  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  boy  had a  Singapore  restricted\r\n\r\npassport and that his name had, since the previous\r\n\r\ninterview, been deleted from his father's  foreign\r\n\r\npassport.  He then decided that the boy  could  be\r\n\r\nissued with a Singapore international passport. As\r\n\r\nthe  father  wanted  the  passport  urgently,  the\r\n\r\nAssistant Controller advised him to submit a fresh\r\n\r\napplication    immediately   as    the    previous\r\n\r\napplication had to be withdrawn. The passport  was\r\n\r\nissued to the boy on an urgent basis the next day.\r\n\r\nThe  moral of this story, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nyou  may get into unnecessary difficulties if  you\r\n\r\nwant the best of both worlds, as was the case with\r\n\r\nthe boy's father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson's narration of the story is\r\n\r\nthe father's version.

Since the organisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Community Security Force, the VC has made  an\r\n\r\neven  better  contribution to the  community.  The\r\n\r\nmost  important function of the VC is  to  perform\r\n\r\nbeat  patrols in HDB estates, kampung  areas,  and\r\n\r\nother  areas that need such patrols. This  greatly\r\n\r\ncontributes to the maintenance of security and the\r\n\r\nsuppression  of crime. Therefore, this performance\r\n\r\nreceives the praise of all the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Vigilante Corps has a glorious history\r\n\r\nbehind  it.  Members of the Corps have  sacrificed\r\n\r\nmuch  time  and effort in the task of  maintaining\r\n\r\nsecurity  in the community and the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order. On the introduction  of  national\r\n\r\nservice  the  VC  membership  increased  with  the\r\n\r\naddition  of  volunteers so  that  the  number  of\r\n\r\nregular  VC  personnel could be reduced.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  are still thousands of volunteer VC members\r\n\r\non  patrol beats maintaining security and law  and\r\n\r\norder  in  the  community. They  have  contributed\r\n\r\ntheir  time  and  effort in  the  service  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry. All this effort is worth our praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to raise the matter of\r\n\r\nallowances  paid to VC members. According  to  the\r\n\r\npresent scheme, the allowance is too little. A  VC\r\n\r\nmember gets 60 cents for an hour's service  and  a\r\n\r\nleader   85   cents  per  hour.   This   is   very\r\n\r\ninsignificant. Everything has in-creased in price.\r\n\r\nIn  the past, the bus fare was 5 cents to 20 cents\r\n\r\nper trip, but now it is at least 20 cents. Laundry\r\n\r\nwas 20 cents to 50 cents per piece, but now it  is\r\n\r\nat  least  50  cents. When a member turns  up  for\r\n\r\nduty,  he  spends on petrol or bus  fares.  If  he\r\n\r\ntakes snacks or drinks it comes up to $3 or $4 per\r\n\r\nnight. This is why his allowance is not enough. If\r\n\r\na VC member could work more hours or take up other\r\n\r\njobs, he would be given more allowance. So I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry concerned can increase the allowance\r\n\r\nto VC members in order to raise their morale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister\r\n\r\nto  reply.

In   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  during  my Meet-the-People  sessions\r\n\r\nevery  week,  I  receive a lot of complaints  from\r\n\r\nvarious  people  about the delay in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nsuch applications over the past few years. Many of\r\n\r\nthem  have waited for many a year and some of them\r\n\r\nhave repeatedly made applications without success.\r\n\r\nThey are very worried and concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have analysed their circumstances, their\r\n\r\nfamily backgrounds, their income, their\r\n\r\noccupations and the number of people in their\r\n\r\nfamilies. From what I have gathered, these\r\n\r\napplicants generally have an income of at least\r\n\r\n$400 per month. Their occupations range from\r\n\r\nworkers and technicians in the shipbuilding\r\n\r\nindustry to hawkers, taxi drivers and other\r\n\r\noccupations. Most of the other members in their\r\n\r\nfamilies are local citizens, or they have children\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore and who are citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore. There may be exceptional cases where\r\n\r\none or two members of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamily  are non-citizens. Many of them pay  income\r\n\r\ntax  and they contribute a great deal towards  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Therefore,  we should  give  sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  citizenship  applications  from\r\n\r\nsuch  people  so that they will be  able  to  make\r\n\r\ngreater contributions to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has said repeatedly in this\r\n\r\nHouse that those who contribute to our country  in\r\n\r\none  way or other will be given consideration  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   I  endorse  this   view,   it   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, my hope that the Minister will consider\r\n\r\ngranting  citizenship to those who  contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  arts  in Singapore. I would like to give  one\r\n\r\nexample of this case for the careful consideration\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister.  In this particular  case,  the\r\n\r\napplicant is an expert in ballet dancing. He is  a\r\n\r\npermanent resident of Singapore. He went  overseas\r\n\r\nafter  completing  his  secondary  education.   He\r\n\r\nobtained a diploma from a school in London and  is\r\n\r\na  member of the London Institute of Choreography.\r\n\r\nHe  has also participated in various international\r\n\r\nperformances and returned to Singapore in 1972  in\r\n\r\nthe hope of contributing what he has learnt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his stay in Singapore for three years, he\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  charitable performances  in  the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre and conducted ballet classes  in\r\n\r\nthe  various community centres to develop talents.\r\n\r\nIn  considering  the granting  of  citizenship  to\r\n\r\npeople  who  make  an  economic  contribution   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we must also consider those  who  make\r\n\r\nartistic  or cultural contributions to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  in  this  way that  talents  in  the\r\n\r\ncultural   field  will  be  able  to  develop   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This particular artiste I mentioned has\r\n\r\napplied  for  citizenship two years  ago  but  his\r\n\r\napplication is still under consideration. I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  ask  the  Minister to  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also cases of old people who have\r\n\r\napplied   for  citizenship.  They  have   grown-up\r\n\r\nchildren   who  are  quite  successful  in   their\r\n\r\nbusiness. One such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplicant  has  a son who is a medical  specialist\r\n\r\nworking  in  the General Hospital. This  applicant\r\n\r\nhas  waited  for two years but the only  reply  he\r\n\r\nreceived was that his application has been  turned\r\n\r\ndown.   Surely  there  is  no  harm  in   granting\r\n\r\ncitizenship  to  this applicant  because  all  his\r\n\r\nchildren are now independent and in a position  to\r\n\r\nsupport  and maintain him. So granting citizenship\r\n\r\nto  him will not add to the economic burden of our\r\n\r\nState.

They  are  not\r\n\r\nconsidered citizens, and therefore they  lose  all\r\n\r\nthe privileges accorded to citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the national registration in 1967, some of\r\n\r\nthese people could not produce proper documents to\r\n\r\nsupport  their  case  and consequently  they  were\r\n\r\ngiven  blue  identity  cards, which  automatically\r\n\r\nmeans  that  they are non-citizens.  What  is  the\r\n\r\nplight of these people? To date many of them still\r\n\r\nfind   difficulty   as  they   are   not   granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a case where every member of the\r\n\r\nfamily  is a citizen of Singapore, except for  one\r\n\r\npoor member whose documentary proof was mislaid by\r\n\r\nhis  parents during the war. Thus he became a non-citizen.  He  had  applied for  citizenship  quite\r\n\r\nsometime ago but he has not received any reply  to\r\n\r\nhis application. Can the Minister explain what  is\r\n\r\nthe  present  stand in the granting of citizenship\r\n\r\nfor cases of this nature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also people who have the necessary\r\n\r\nrequirements and are paying income tax but are not\r\n\r\nconsidered for citizenship. May I ask why they are\r\n\r\nnot considered for citizenship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I first reply to the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang?  The  Government  must  be  strict  and\r\n\r\ncareful  in  granting citizenship. Citizenship  is\r\n\r\nsomething which must be regarded with great value.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  policy on citizenship  is  reviewed\r\n\r\nregularly.   All  applications  are  attended   to\r\n\r\nwithout  delay, but they must take their  turn  in\r\n\r\nthe  queue. It is true that some applications  may\r\n\r\ntake  a  long  while before a decision  is  given.\r\n\r\nThese  applications come from applicants who  have\r\n\r\nnot  met  the minimum requirements for citizenship\r\n\r\nbut  who may later qualify. Such applications  are\r\n\r\nreviewed  regularly. If an applicant has  to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  a long time it is because he has taken a long\r\n\r\ntime to meet all the requirements. Once a decision\r\n\r\non  the  application  is made,  the  applicant  is\r\n\r\nnotified  immediately. Therefore, as  long  as  an\r\n\r\napplicant  has  not received a decision  there  is\r\n\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years good news exceeded bad news, as\r\n\r\nevidenced by the following statistics:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n         Citizenship Applications from all\r\n\r\n                    Categories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Approved   %    Refused   %  Decisions                       \r\n\r\n                                     taken\r\n\r\n1972    3168   65.7    1654   34.3    4822\r\n\r\n1973    5055   82.1    1104   17.9    6159\r\n\r\n1974    3989   93.9     259    6.1    4248\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, through the years the number  of\r\n\r\napprovals has been going up.\r\n\r\nThis  should gladden the heart of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member's second point, it has\r\n\r\nbeen  and  still  is  the Government's  policy  to\r\n\r\nconsider favourably applications from persons  who\r\n\r\nare able to contribute to the economic, social and\r\n\r\ncultural  progress of the country. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nthe  two cases that he has mentioned. If he  could\r\n\r\nwrite to me, then I will investigate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Anson, he raised\r\n\r\nthe   problem  of  persons  who  claim  birth   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  have  no documentary  proof.  This\r\n\r\nproblem was discussed in Parliament on 17th March,\r\n\r\n1972.  The present position remains basically  the\r\n\r\nsame  as  in 1972. We cannot waive the citizenship\r\n\r\nregula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntions  for  these persons because a  waiver  will\r\n\r\nimmediately encourage applications from all  sorts\r\n\r\nof   people,  all  of  them  professing  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The crux of the matter is  documentary\r\n\r\nproof.  During the national registration  exercise\r\n\r\nit  was  revealed that there were many people  who\r\n\r\nclaimed  birth  in Singapore but on  investigation\r\n\r\nwere found not to be born here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the granting of citizenship to a\r\n\r\nperson who is the sole remaining non-citizen in  a\r\n\r\nfamily,    the    Government   is   prepared    to\r\n\r\nsympathetically consider the application of such a\r\n\r\nperson provided he will not become a burden to the\r\n\r\nState.  In fact, quite a number of such applicants\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  granted citizenship, if  the\r\n\r\nMember has any particular applicant in mind, he is\r\n\r\ninvited  to  supply the details to my Ministry  so\r\n\r\nthat the case will be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Govindasamy(Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I am sorry that this matter, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  pointed  out,  is a regular  occurrence  year\r\n\r\nafter year. Unfortunately the reply also seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  stereotyped, year after year - the policy\r\n\r\nof  citizenship is being reviewed year after year.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the stereotype replies; but how  it\r\n\r\nhas changed from last year to this year we are not\r\n\r\naware of. I thought I heard the Minister say  that\r\n\r\nif  citizenship  is not granted to  an  applicant,\r\n\r\nperhaps  he has not satisfied the requirements.  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought that once an  application  is\r\n\r\naccepted,  he  has already satisfied  the  minimum\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is that the applicant is told\r\n\r\nthat no enquiries are to be made. If enquiries are\r\n\r\nat  all  made,  the  applicant is  told  that  his\r\n\r\napplication is still under investigation. If there\r\n\r\nis  no communication between the applicant and the\r\n\r\nRegistry,  I do not know how the Department  keeps\r\n\r\ntrack  of an applicant fulfilling the requirements\r\n\r\nby   a   certain  time,  that  is,  he   is   able\r\n\r\neconomically to be of some benefit to  the  State,\r\n\r\nbefore granting him citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, when I say that the\r\n\r\npolicy is being reviewed from year to year, it  is\r\n\r\nnot just an empty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement.

So the policy  is\r\n\r\nnot  static. We have reviewed our policy and  have\r\n\r\nadded  on  to  the  criteria of  requirements  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The  minimum  requirement   is,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  residential qualification, i.e, permanent\r\n\r\nresidence for 10 out of 12 years. There are  other\r\n\r\nrequirements, like not being a burden to the State\r\n\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to those who qualify under the\r\n\r\nvarious   criteria,   how   do   we   know    that\r\n\r\ncircumstances have changed?

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ang Nam Piau, L. P.Rodrigo and P.

However, in implementing these\r\n\r\nmeasures  we  have to keep them in line  with  our\r\n\r\nlong  term  policies. We have to make use  of  our\r\n\r\ncurrent  slack  period to prepare for  a  complete\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery.  Sir,  this  shows  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  made  judicious   and   adequate\r\n\r\npreparation   to   meet   the   present   economic\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, we have seen that in order to\r\n\r\ncounter  and  mitigate the impact of  recessionary\r\n\r\ntrends  on  our business community, the Government\r\n\r\nhas started to readjust and formulate new economic\r\n\r\npolicies  in  the  last  quarter  of  1974.  These\r\n\r\ninclude  the setting up of the Economic Activation\r\n\r\nCommittee to formulate new policies and strategies\r\n\r\nfor  economic  development, the reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development Board  to  enhance  its\r\n\r\nefficiency, the setting  of an Export  Council  to\r\n\r\nhelp  businessmen to find new markets  abroad  for\r\n\r\nour  manufactured goods, and the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\nForeign  Exchange Markets Committee to  raise  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  our financial  institutions  as\r\n\r\nwell  as measures to relax credit squeeze and  the\r\n\r\npartial lifting of restrictions on the purchase of\r\n\r\nproperties   by  foreign  investors.   All   these\r\n\r\nmeasures   are   aimed  at  stimulating   economic\r\n\r\nactivity  in  our  country.  They  are  all   very\r\n\r\nexcellent measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for the current year for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance is $707 million, representing\r\n\r\n40%  increase  over last year.  Out  of  this  sum\r\n\r\n$281.7  million  is in respect  of  loans  to  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community for their development, which is\r\n\r\nvery  good.  I  would like to know  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nbusiness enterprises will benefit from these loans\r\n\r\nand  what contribution will they make towards  our\r\n\r\neconomic  development, and how many jobs  will  be\r\n\r\ncreated for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Finance Ministry has spared no\r\n\r\neffort  to  stimulate our economy and  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  investment,  according  to  the  business\r\n\r\ncircle, there was a big drop in foreign investment\r\n\r\nlast year. What are the reasons for this drop? One\r\n\r\nof  the  main  reasons may be  due  to  the  world\r\n\r\nrecessionary trends. However, apart from this,  we\r\n\r\nalso  have to take a closer look at our investment\r\n\r\npolicy  to see whether there are any shortcomings.\r\n\r\nIf there are, we must take steps to remedy them in\r\n\r\norder to consolidate our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus of the business community is that\r\n\r\nthere  have been some shortcomings in the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board's policies.  These  act  as  an\r\n\r\nimpediment to foreign investment. For example,  no\r\n\r\nproper  guidance  has been given to  the  would-be\r\n\r\ninvestors. They have not been told of the kind  of\r\n\r\nindustries  suitable to promote in  Singapore.  In\r\n\r\naddition, there has been undue delay in processing\r\n\r\nthe  applications. It takes at  least  a  year  to\r\n\r\nprocess an application. Sometimes there is a delay\r\n\r\nof  two to three years before it is approved,  and\r\n\r\nduring this period the investors do not know  what\r\n\r\nto  do.  This  has become a wet blanket  over  the\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  of would-be investors. If  we  are  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to attract foreign investment, something\r\n\r\nmust be done to remedy such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another complaint relates to the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced by foreign  investors  in  the\r\n\r\npurchase of residential properties. This has  been\r\n\r\na  vexing problem to them because the Land  Office\r\n\r\nhas  adopted delaying tactics in considering their\r\n\r\napplications. It invariably happens  that  when  a\r\n\r\nbuyer and seller have entered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  an agreement and after payment is made,  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office  then  informs  the  buyer  that  his\r\n\r\napplication has been rejected. Thus, he will  have\r\n\r\nto  engage a lawyer to get a refund of his  money.\r\n\r\nThis   is   another  depressing  effect   on   the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  foreign investors  to  invest  and\r\n\r\nreside  here.  I  hope  the  Minister  will   take\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  remedy  this situation,  Finally,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to put forward three questions to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Firstly,  how is the  Finance  Ministry\r\n\r\ngoing to encourage and subsidise our export trade?\r\n\r\nWhat  kind of industrial or commercial enterprises\r\n\r\nwill  benefit from such subsidies? Secondly,  will\r\n\r\nthere  be  a further relaxation on the  supply  of\r\n\r\nmoney  in  order  to encourage and  stimulate  our\r\n\r\neconomy, in particular, the construction industry?\r\n\r\nThirdly, on 17th March, 1975, when I took part  in\r\n\r\nthe   Budget   debate  I  mentioned   about   some\r\n\r\ndifficulties faced by the timber industry. One  of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  given  was that  the  Timber  Export\r\n\r\nIndustry  Board  was not efficient.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nthen  answered that he would take note of this.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know whether an investigation  has  since\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out  or not. I also  mentioned  the\r\n\r\ngreat  need to promote our timber export and wood-processing industry. Since the Minister  has  once\r\n\r\nagain  emphasised the need for diversification  of\r\n\r\nour  economy, he should pay more attention to this\r\n\r\nindustry and ensure that plans are being  made  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  this particular industry which has  great\r\n\r\nprofit potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister another\r\n\r\nquestion. I wonder whether he knows anything about\r\n\r\nthe Customs Branch Office in Jurong. Oddly enough,\r\n\r\nthis  office  only deals with non-dutiable  goods.\r\n\r\nFor  dutiable  goods one has to  go  to  the  main\r\n\r\nCustoms  Office  to pay the duty. Therefore,  many\r\n\r\nindustrialists    find    it    troublesome    and\r\n\r\ninconvenient to do so, particularly so in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  problem. Since there  is  a  Customs\r\n\r\nBranch  Office in Jurong, it should be  given  the\r\n\r\npower  to  levy taxes on dutiable goods  as  well.\r\n\r\nThere are about 500 to 600 factories in Jurong and\r\n\r\nthis  Customs Office in Jurong should provide such\r\n\r\nservices for their convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I suppose it is our\r\n\r\nGovernment's   policy   to   recruit    preferably\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, wherever possible,  into  our\r\n\r\ncivil service. In this connection, I would like to\r\n\r\nask   the   Minister  for  Finance  the  following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

How many of these officers are non-Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What steps, if any, are taken or will be taken\r\n\r\nby the Government to grant Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nto non-Singapore citizens officers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Will the Minister for Finance set a target\r\n\r\ndate  for  the  civil service  to  be  completely\r\n\r\nstaffed by Singapore citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P.

All this is appreciated  and  not\r\n\r\ndifficult  to grasp. Today, the people are  paying\r\n\r\nfor  most,  if not almost, all the services  which\r\n\r\nthe    Government   is   affording   the   people.\r\n\r\nConspicuously  excluded,  however,  is   education\r\n\r\nwhich, of course is heavily subsidised and so also\r\n\r\nthe medical services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem will be to persuade the people to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the fact that mounting costs determined\r\n\r\nby  external  factors requires increased  national\r\n\r\nrevenue, to be acquired through taxation and other\r\n\r\nmeasures,  to  pay  for more costly  services.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  additional  burden  must  be  spread\r\n\r\njustly. To do so, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  think it necessary at all tunes to present\r\n\r\na    coherent   explanation   of   revenue-raising\r\n\r\nmeasures.   It   is  important  to   ensure   that\r\n\r\nexplanations   of  revenue-raising  measures   are\r\n\r\nalways   adequate  and  credible  as  representing\r\n\r\naspects  of a just and well-considered  policy  of\r\n\r\nnational revenue development, so as not to  invite\r\n\r\npublic  belief that they are being  taxed  ad  hoc\r\n\r\nsimply because the Government thinks they can take\r\n\r\nit  and therefore should pay, and because that tax\r\n\r\nmeasures will yield the most money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to Members on the debate on the\r\n\r\nBudget  statement, the Minister thought  that  the\r\n\r\nincrease of $60 per annum on the 1000 cc and under\r\n\r\ncars  was very modest as it amounted to only $5  a\r\n\r\nmonth  and which the Minister thought that anybody\r\n\r\nwho  went to the Orchard Road Car Park for a  meal\r\n\r\ncould afford. If this response of the Minister  is\r\n\r\nconstrued  by  the  public as an  explanation  and\r\n\r\njustification  of  the $60 increase,  then  surely\r\n\r\nthere  will he the public fear of another increase\r\n\r\nshortly  by another $60 per annum, and  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would  probably explain  away  again  as\r\n\r\n\"just another $5 increase a month\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that having imposed this tax he\r\n\r\ndid  not want Members to think that it was the end\r\n\r\nof  all  taxes  as far as road transportation  was\r\n\r\nconcerned. He also said that this tax was meant to\r\n\r\nbe  principally  revenue-raising  and  not  as   a\r\n\r\nsolution  to  the  congestion problem  or  towards\r\n\r\nmaking  a  success of the CBD scheme.  The  public\r\n\r\nmust then be puzzled because, in his statement  in\r\n\r\nParliament  on 16th October, 1972, on raising  the\r\n\r\nroad  tax,  the  Minister offered the  explanation\r\n\r\nthat  \"the  revised  rates should  encourage  more\r\n\r\npeople to use public transport to their places  of\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  central city area.\" Again,  in  his\r\n\r\nreply on the 17th March, the Minister utilised the\r\n\r\ncontention  of  Members  that  the  car  being   a\r\n\r\nnecessity is owned by every family to regard it as\r\n\r\na  standard  possession  and  suggested  therefore\r\n\r\n\"there was a chicken in every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npot  in  Singapore\". That is why the Minister  was\r\n\r\nunrepentant  about  the road  tax  increases.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  founded his unrepentance upon a  premise\r\n\r\nwhich  he  himself constructed out of  an  earnest\r\n\r\nopinion of Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I appreciate the nature of the problem\r\n\r\nrelating to the need to increase our revenue  with\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister is confronted, in  particular\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of preparing to meet the  increasing\r\n\r\nexpectation  of  a  youthful population.  As  this\r\n\r\nyouthful   population  of  ours  marry  and   have\r\n\r\nchildren, they begin to have expectations both for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  future  and for the  future  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren. But I believe, Sir, that our people  can\r\n\r\nbe  carried  along  to  bear  a  greater  national\r\n\r\nexpenditure if they see fairness and coherence  in\r\n\r\nthe   explanation  or  justifications   supporting\r\n\r\nrevenue-raising measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the civil service, I wish to make the\r\n\r\nobservation that much can be improved in the lower\r\n\r\nranks  of the service. As the Minister has pointed\r\n\r\nout, the officers at this level are concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  administration of rules and  regulations  and\r\n\r\nare   in   contact  with  the  public.   While   I\r\n\r\nacknowledge the general efficiency of the service,\r\n\r\nI  must  agree with the Minister that we must  not\r\n\r\nreach  the  point of \"smugness and complacency  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service\".  I feel  that  there  is  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  need to orientate, with  emphasis,  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  civil service officers  at  the\r\n\r\nlower  ranks towards assisting the public in areas\r\n\r\nother than those with which they are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public are often told by officers\r\n\r\nthat the matters they have brought directly to the\r\n\r\nattention of the officers cannot be dealt with  at\r\n\r\nthat   counter   or  in  that  section   or   that\r\n\r\ndepartment.  When direction of further  assistance\r\n\r\nis  sought by members of the public, the  officers\r\n\r\neither  refuse  or are unable (probably  they  are\r\n\r\nmore unable than being inclined to refuse) to deal\r\n\r\nwith  matters which specifically relate  to  their\r\n\r\ncounter,  section or department.  I  should  think\r\n\r\nthat if a matter is brought to an officer for  his\r\n\r\nattention but that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould   be  dealt  with  in  another  office   or\r\n\r\ndepartment  in  a  particular  way,  the   officer\r\n\r\napproached should not only say, \"No, this  is  not\r\n\r\ndone  here\" but also say where the matter  can  be\r\n\r\ndealt with. He should also be able to say how that\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  public should go about  it.  Such\r\n\r\norientation  may  be  useful  at  present  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister has made a provision of $2,188.2  million\r\n\r\nfor  the  fiscal  year  1975 for  Development,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 40.1% over the fiscal year 1974; while\r\n\r\nallowing  an  increase  of only  1,689  posts  for\r\n\r\nfiscal  year 1975, i.e, an increase of  only  2.7%\r\n\r\nfor fiscal year 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has asked his Ministry to improve\r\n\r\nthe   civil  service  through  developing  greater\r\n\r\nadministrative skills, adopting innovating  ideas,\r\n\r\nimproving  work procedures and methods and  making\r\n\r\ngreater  use of machines. The Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  also issued a circular to the service calling\r\n\r\nfor  higher productivity. I feel that the  service\r\n\r\nat  the  lower  ranks  can  become  productive  if\r\n\r\nofficers  develop the initiative and  capacity  to\r\n\r\nassist  the public, as I have suggested.  I  would\r\n\r\nconclude by recalling the Minister's assurance  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for River Valley that should cases like\r\n\r\nthe  example of the 50 bicycles be brought to  his\r\n\r\nnotice,  he would send the officer responsible  to\r\n\r\nthe   Staff  Training  Institute.  But   for   the\r\n\r\nimprovement of the civil service, can we  have  it\r\n\r\nthe other way round? Can the Minister keep sending\r\n\r\nofficers to the Staff Training Institute first  in\r\n\r\norder to avoid the 50-bicycle blunder?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the chit fund companies\r\n\r\nhave closed down for quite some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA  small  sum of money was supposed to  have  been\r\n\r\npaid out to the subscribers in various stages.  It\r\n\r\nappears  that only one or two payments  have  been\r\n\r\nmade so far.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many people involved in the two  major\r\n\r\nchit fund companies and they are still waiting for\r\n\r\nthe  second  payment of their dividends.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no news about this. The rate of  making\r\n\r\npayment  is rather slow. It is believed  that  the\r\n\r\ncost of administration will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neventually  exceed the actual amount  to  be  paid\r\n\r\nout. Can something be done about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last one year, bank rates on fixed\r\n\r\ndeposits   and  saving  accounts  had   fluctuated\r\n\r\nseveral times. At one stage the rates increased by\r\n\r\n2%.  Then subsequently they began to drop.  Though\r\n\r\nthis may be good for investment, there is a danger\r\n\r\nthat  money  would be withdrawn, as is being  done\r\n\r\nnow,  and  invested in illegal  ventures  such  as\r\n\r\nillegal  tontines,  lotteries,  unauthorised  chit\r\n\r\nfunds,   etc.  Although  for  general   investment\r\n\r\npurposes  the reduction in rates is a good  trend,\r\n\r\ncan the Minister do something to prevent the rates\r\n\r\nfrom fluctuating?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leave allowance given to civil servants\r\n\r\nappears  to  have been fixed according to  grades,\r\n\r\nand  an increase is given only on promotion  to  a\r\n\r\nhigher  grade. Can the Minister revise the  scheme\r\n\r\nand  introduce  some  form of  sliding  scale  for\r\n\r\npayment  of  leave allowances? This  is  requested\r\n\r\nonly  in  the  interest of a more  faithful  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Post Office Savings Bank has advertised\r\n\r\nin  no  small  way  that its branches  are  spread\r\n\r\nthroughout the Republic for the convenience of the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public  and that a number  of  them  have\r\n\r\nsince  been computerised, and the final  objective\r\n\r\nis  to  introduce this system to all its branches.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  almost ail the Post  Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank   branches,  the  sharing  of   premises   is\r\n\r\nnoticeable  - the officer in charge  of  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  acting  as  Branch Manager  of  the  Bank.\r\n\r\nDepositors  of the Post Office Savings  Bank  have\r\n\r\nbeen  told quite a number of times that funds kept\r\n\r\nin  such  branches are not sufficient to meet  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  demands, even though  the  computerised\r\n\r\nsystem  was  introduced. Can the Minister  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  the POSB cannot keep sufficient funds of  its\r\n\r\nown  to help the depositors so that they need  not\r\n\r\nbe  driven  away from time to time?

What is the\r\n\r\nGovernment  doing to promote Singapore-made  goods\r\n\r\nin  other countries?

It is  to  the\r\n\r\ncredit  of  the Government to introduce  them.  In\r\n\r\nspite  of  my complaint last year that  prices  in\r\n\r\nsome supermarkets were not as competitive as those\r\n\r\nin  the private sector, they still sell many items\r\n\r\nat  S  to  15  cents  more than what  the  private\r\n\r\ndealers sell. Can something be done to improve the\r\n\r\nsituation?  Though prices may be going clown,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must maintain and squeeze the  private\r\n\r\ndealers out, especially those who are not fair  in\r\n\r\ntheir  prices,  by  lowering  the  prices  at  the\r\n\r\nsupermarkets.  Sir,  I  would  also  request  that\r\n\r\nbefore  any price increase of essential  foodstuff\r\n\r\nis  allowed, the Minister should first  check  the\r\n\r\nstock in order that the consumers or the merchants\r\n\r\ndo not lose in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Minister's stand on the subject of\r\n\r\nthe  13th  month payment? When this allowance  was\r\n\r\nintroduced,  it was made clear that  a  periodical\r\n\r\nreview  would  be  made in order  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  Will  it  be  maintained  or  will  an\r\n\r\nincrease  be given? I would also like to know  how\r\n\r\nmany   civil   servants  have  been  given   merit\r\n\r\nincrements  last  year. I hope the  Minister  will\r\n\r\ngrant more merit increments to deserving and loyal\r\n\r\ncivil  servants. This merit increment will help  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal to retain civil servants who are needed\r\n\r\nand it will also he an incentive for others to get\r\n\r\nincrements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since my complaint last year on the filling\r\n\r\nup of income tax forms there is a slight change in\r\n\r\nthe tax form for this year. There is now a section\r\n\r\nfor  inclusion of a claim for tax relief for  aged\r\n\r\nparents.  However, I still say that the  tax  form\r\n\r\ncan  be further modified for easy completion.  One\r\n\r\nway would be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ticking\"  method. I hope the Minister  will  look\r\n\r\ninto it and improve it in the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Save Water\" and \"Save Energy\" campaigns have\r\n\r\nbeen  going  on for some time. This was especially\r\n\r\nevident  during the energy crisis.  All  kinds  of\r\n\r\nsteps  were  introduced to curb power consumption.\r\n\r\nOf late it would appear that there is a slackening\r\n\r\nof  vigilance and a certain amount of complacency.\r\n\r\nA  hue and cry is made only when someone steps  on\r\n\r\nour toes. Why can we not maintain strict vigilance\r\n\r\nover  the  need to cultivate the saving habit?  It\r\n\r\nwill be good for the country and the economy as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is wrong with the way PUB bills are\r\n\r\ndrawn  up. There are far too many cases of persons\r\n\r\nbeing   overcharged  and  suffering  losses   when\r\n\r\nadjustments  are  made  in  the  charges.  Is  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  working properly or does  it  require  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  of oiling? It would appear  that  the\r\n\r\namounts in these bills fluctuate on the high side,\r\n\r\nthus  creating some diffidence in the public  view\r\n\r\nand also anxiety in that they are always paying an\r\n\r\nincreasing  amount. When the matter is brought  to\r\n\r\nthe  authorities concerned, the officials  scratch\r\n\r\ntheir  heads and make adjustments in the following\r\n\r\nmonth's   bill.   Why   should   there   be   such\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies?  Can  the PUB  recruit  more  meter\r\n\r\nreaders  to  read the meters monthly  so  that  an\r\n\r\naccurate  assessment can be made rather than  make\r\n\r\nan  estimate which is usually faulty?

I do not know whether I  have\r\n\r\ngot  all of them down. I think he complained about\r\n\r\nguidance to investors not being adequate and  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  not  told what industries  were  being\r\n\r\npromoted.   He  also  complained  of   delays   in\r\n\r\nprocessing applications, some of which took two to\r\n\r\nthree  years. On this particular comment, I  am  a\r\n\r\nbit  surprised  because the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  of  our most efficient institutions. I  think\r\n\r\nits  record over the last 10 to 15 years has  been\r\n\r\nquite good. It has had a reputation of being  able\r\n\r\nto  reply  very promptly to applications  and,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  it has given guidance  to  investors\r\n\r\nwithin  two  or  three  weeks.  If  there  is  any\r\n\r\nparticular instance which has been brought to  the\r\n\r\nMember's  notice, I would like to know  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure   the  EDB  also  would  like  to  know  what\r\n\r\nparticular  inefficiency has resulted  from  their\r\n\r\nefforts to promote investment in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained about investors having\r\n\r\ndifficulty   in  purchasing  property   and   when\r\n\r\nnotified   by   the   Land   Office   that   their\r\n\r\napp1ications  for purchase of property  have  been\r\n\r\nrejected,  they have been to a lot of  trouble  in\r\n\r\nrecovering their deposits. On this matter, while I\r\n\r\ntake  general interest in it, the Land  Office  is\r\n\r\nnot under my jurisdiction. But I would say that in\r\n\r\nmany  cases,  where  the investors  are  going  to\r\n\r\nreside  in Singapore, a high proportion  of  their\r\n\r\napplications  has been approved. For  those  cases\r\n\r\nwhich  have not been favoured by either  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  or by the Ministry of Finance, it  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  the  property applied for has very  generous\r\n\r\nland areas. I think the idea is that the investors\r\n\r\nshould  be  enabled to settle in some place  which\r\n\r\nwould  give  them  peace of mind  and  ability  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate upon their industries. Beyond that,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think that it is our intention that  real\r\n\r\nestate should be bought up even by investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked three questions. First, how\r\n\r\nis  the  Minister going to encourage and subsidise\r\n\r\nindustries,   and   what   industries   would   be\r\n\r\nsubsidised in the present situation? The answer to\r\n\r\nthis  is  that all industries are welcome although\r\n\r\nthose   which   are  more  viable  under   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances,      such     as      shipbuilding,\r\n\r\nshiprepairing, oil rig building, and machine  tool\r\n\r\nindustries  which service these industries,  would\r\n\r\nbe  given some priority. The assistance which  has\r\n\r\nbeen given has been clearly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  available  in  the form of  tax  incentives,\r\n\r\nexport incentives, assistance with loan financing,\r\n\r\nassistance    in    industrial    buildings    and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure. In the matter of export financing,\r\n\r\nthe  Monetary Authority of Singapore is finalising\r\n\r\narrangements to enable banks to rediscount  export\r\n\r\nbills  with  the  Authority.  This  facility  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a cheaper source of finance for  exports.\r\n\r\nDetails of this arrangement will be announced very\r\n\r\nshortly by the Monetary Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question, I think, is whether there is\r\n\r\nany  further  relaxation on money supply.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of money supply, we have relaxed all  credit\r\n\r\ncontrols  and  the banks are quite  free  to  lend\r\n\r\nmoney without any limit to any particular industry\r\n\r\nor industrial sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third question is on the difficulties of the\r\n\r\ntimber industry and he mentioned that I had stated\r\n\r\nthat  I  would  take note of the difficulties  and\r\n\r\nrefer  them  to the Timber Export Industry  Board.\r\n\r\nThis  matter  has been noted as promised  and  the\r\n\r\nparticular  section  of  his  comments  has   been\r\n\r\nreferred  for action by the Timber Export Industry\r\n\r\nBoard. I have not had any reaction as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final suggestion which the Member made was in\r\n\r\nrelation to the Customs office in Jurong which, he\r\n\r\nsays, deals only with non-dutiable goods. I am not\r\n\r\nfamiliar with this particular division of work  in\r\n\r\nJurong. But it seems a reasonable suggestion  that\r\n\r\nthere should he officers there who could also deal\r\n\r\nwith  dutiable  goods, and I will refer  his  very\r\n\r\nuseful  suggestion to the Customs  Department  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson asked questions on\r\n\r\nrecruitment of Singapore citizens into  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and  would  like to know  the  number  of\r\n\r\nDivisions  I and II officers in the civil  service\r\n\r\nas  at  the end of February 1975. The figures  for\r\n\r\nFebruary  1975 are not yet available, hut  figures\r\n\r\nas at December 1974 show that there was a total of\r\n\r\n21,160 officers in Divisions I and II in the civil\r\n\r\nservice, of whom 19,932 are Singapore citizens and\r\n\r\n1,228 or 5.8% are non-citizens. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  1,228  non-citizens, 606  officers  are  in\r\n\r\nDivision I and 622 are in Division II. These civil\r\n\r\nservants  may be considered for citizenship  after\r\n\r\nfive  years' permanent residence, instead  of  the\r\n\r\nnormal requirement of 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, I suppose, sonic advantages in having\r\n\r\na  civil  service  staffed entirely  by  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. But it is not possible at this stage  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  development for the  Singapore  civil\r\n\r\nservice  to  be  so  staffed.  A  manpower  survey\r\n\r\nconducted jointly by my Ministry and the  Economic\r\n\r\nResearch  Centre  of the University  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nsuggests that the manpower shortages of engineers,\r\n\r\narchitects, surveyors, doctors, dentists,  lawyers\r\n\r\nand  technicians will continue in  the  l970s.  We\r\n\r\nshall  not be able to train sufficient numbers  of\r\n\r\nsuch  professional and skilled personnel from  our\r\n\r\nown  citizens,  and  we shall  therefore  have  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   recruit   non-citizens   if    our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes are not  to  be  adversely\r\n\r\naffected. It is not possible for me, therefore, to\r\n\r\nset  any  target date by which the  civil  service\r\n\r\nwill  be  entirely staffed by Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nnor  do  I  consider it desirable that any  target\r\n\r\nshould be set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has benefited from recruitment of non-citizens into our public service in the past\r\n\r\nthrough  the system of open competition.  I  would\r\n\r\nfavour continuing to leave the door open. However,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson may rest assured that, all\r\n\r\nthings being equal, a Singapore citizen takes  and\r\n\r\nwill continue to take preference over non-citizens\r\n\r\nin appointments to the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens touched on a\r\n\r\nnumber of points. He gave me a lecture on the  way\r\n\r\nI should present my Budget and explain the revenue\r\n\r\nraising  measures to the public. Well, I  am  much\r\n\r\nobliged for this little lesson on explanations  on\r\n\r\ntax  problems.  I  realise, of  course,  that  the\r\n\r\nexplanations  on  why taxes  have  to  be  imposed\r\n\r\nshould  be  fair and coherent. If I am lacking  in\r\n\r\nthis particular quality on this particular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget  on  the 3rd March and 17th March,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat   these  shortcomings  will  be  excused   by\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the circumstances in which I made the\r\n\r\nstatements on taxes on cars in October 1972 and in\r\n\r\nMarch  1975  are  quite different.  In  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  were in the rather  happy  position\r\n\r\nthat  we were not really short of money, even  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes.  In  the  1975  Budget,   I\r\n\r\nthought  I explained that there was a gap  between\r\n\r\nthe  revenue  we  had  and the total  expenditure,\r\n\r\nincluding development expenditure, and therefore I\r\n\r\nhad  to  place greater emphasis upon the  revenue-raising aspect of the tax. I did explain that  the\r\n\r\neffect  on  the car-using public was  a  secondary\r\n\r\nobjective,  and  hoped that there  would  be  some\r\n\r\npsychological effect on people against using their\r\n\r\ncars  - some encouragement would be given to  them\r\n\r\nto adopt the Park and Ride scheme, and also adjust\r\n\r\nto  the  limitation on people going to the Central\r\n\r\nBusiness District during peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not there would be further\r\n\r\ntaxes,   this   would  depend  upon  the   traffic\r\n\r\nsituation  and perhaps upon the need  for  raising\r\n\r\nfurther  revenue. I thought the tax  imposed  this\r\n\r\nyear  was  modest  but would have a  psychological\r\n\r\neffect.  Anyway  I  hope that there  would  be  an\r\n\r\nupturn  in the economy and it may not be necessary\r\n\r\nfor  me to come again for taxation for the purpose\r\n\r\nof raising additional revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also mentioned\r\n\r\nthe civil servants and the desirability that there\r\n\r\nshould  be  no smugness or complacency  among  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  I  quite  agree  that  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants  should be as polite and  as  helpful  as\r\n\r\npossible,  and  if  they  cannot  deal  with   any\r\n\r\nparticular  request of the public at a  particular\r\n\r\ncounter  or  in their own office then they  should\r\n\r\ntry  and  indicate where additional  help  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained  and perhaps even help them in  referring\r\n\r\nthe  matter  to the particular office  that  deals\r\n\r\nwith the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned my comments on the\r\n\r\ncivil service and the way in which they dealt with\r\n\r\nproblems.  He also quoted the two instances  which\r\n\r\nhad been raised by the Member for River Valley.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  trying to trace these  two  particular\r\n\r\ninstances in my Ministry. I am afraid we  have  no\r\n\r\nrecord  of them. I must assume that perhaps  these\r\n\r\nexamples  are,  if  not classical,  apocryphal  in\r\n\r\nnature, and they probably sprang from the mind  of\r\n\r\nthe Member for River Valley. (I am sorry he is not\r\n\r\nhere.)  In  fact, it is like the fishermen's  tale\r\n\r\nwhere  the  fish  grows bigger and  bigger.  These\r\n\r\nblunders appear to have been magnified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, say that in particular matters\r\n\r\nof this nature, technical officers have a tendency\r\n\r\nto  try and blind the Ministry of Finance officers\r\n\r\nwith  scientific verbiage. They use a  description\r\n\r\nto  try to frighten my officers in regard to their\r\n\r\nignorance. My Ministry has a part to play. We  are\r\n\r\nguardians of public finance and we must  see  that\r\n\r\nmoney  is  spent  in the way it  should  be  spent\r\n\r\nwithout any extravagance. So even where we fear we\r\n\r\nmay  be ignorant, we still ask questions which  we\r\n\r\nthink  are  necessary. We should not be frightened\r\n\r\nof  being  thought  ignorant by  asking  questions\r\n\r\nwhich  we feel must be answered before we  can  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  expenditure should  be  approved.\r\n\r\nThis is probably analogous to the patient and  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  (since doctors are mentioned) - the doctor\r\n\r\nprobably   knows   better  about   his   patient's\r\n\r\ncondition. The doctor can probably suggest that an\r\n\r\noperation is very necessary to protect the  health\r\n\r\nof  the patient, but finally it is the patient who\r\n\r\nmust   decide  whether  or  not  to   undergo   an\r\n\r\noperation.  In the same way it is the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance which must decide whether or not money may\r\n\r\nbe   allocated  for  any  particular  purpose.  If\r\n\r\nextravagance  is  allowed, and if departments  are\r\n\r\npermitted  to  spend as they like, it  would  mean\r\n\r\nthat   the  burden  of  extravagance  would   have\r\n\r\neventually to be placed upon the shoulders of  the\r\n\r\npublic in the form of heavier taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I hope that my Ministry of Finance officers\r\n\r\nare  sufficiently  capable of  distinguishing  50-cycle generators from 50 cycles and one generator,\r\n\r\nI   agree   that  they  should  always  be   given\r\n\r\nadditional training. In fact, they have been  sent\r\n\r\nto  the  Staff Training Institute even before  any\r\n\r\nnotice  is  taken  of any particular  officer  who\r\n\r\nrequires   special  training.  But  if  particular\r\n\r\nofficers do make blunders of the nature which  had\r\n\r\nbeen  described by the Member for River Valley,  I\r\n\r\ncertainly  would consider that perhaps they  could\r\n\r\nimprove  by  undergoing  a  course  at  the  Staff\r\n\r\nTraining Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the comments of the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson.  He  touched on such a variety of  subjects\r\n\r\nthat I will only answer those which come under  my\r\n\r\nown  jurisdiction. He mentioned about chit  funds.\r\n\r\nThe  position is that since August 1972,  26  chit\r\n\r\nfund  companies  have  been  wound  up.  Time   is\r\n\r\nrequired  to adjudicate on claims and  recover  as\r\n\r\nmuch assets as possible, and the interim dividends\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  declared  as  and  when  there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient funds. The public is always informed of\r\n\r\nsuch payments through press releases. The delay in\r\n\r\ndeclaring   funds   was  caused  by   difficulties\r\n\r\nencountered  in the collection of  debts  owed  by\r\n\r\ndebtor subscribers. In some cases court action has\r\n\r\nto  he  taken  to recover such debts. To-date  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Receiver has declared interim  dividends\r\n\r\ntotalling  $9,264,638.15 to 43,026 subscribers  of\r\n\r\n14  chit  funds. Between April and September  this\r\n\r\nyear  another 5,575 subscribers of 10  other  chit\r\n\r\nfunds  will be receiving their dividends totalling\r\n\r\nSl,950,527.  It is anticipated that a  second  and\r\n\r\nfinal dividend for the two big chit funds will  be\r\n\r\npaid  sometime  towards the end  of  the  year.  I\r\n\r\nassure  the Member that the Government is as  keen\r\n\r\nas  he  is  to see an early conclusion to  matters\r\n\r\nconnected with the closure of chit funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also expressed concern over recent\r\n\r\nfluctuations in interest rates. Movements  in  our\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  have  been  to  a  large   extent\r\n\r\ninfluenced by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternational events, and it is difficult  for  us\r\n\r\nin  Singapore to insulate ourselves from movements\r\n\r\nin  the  international monetary markets.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  indication  that  fluctuations   in\r\n\r\ninterest  rates in Singapore over  the  past  year\r\n\r\nhave  produced  adverse effects on  the  level  of\r\n\r\ndeposits  placed with banks and finance companies.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary,  these  deposits  continued  to\r\n\r\nincrease  and  at the end of February  1975  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposits with banks and finance companies stood at\r\n\r\n$5,179.7  million compared to $4,601.2 million  in\r\n\r\nJuly  1974.  For the same period savings  deposits\r\n\r\nincreased from $746.7 million to $792.5 million. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to emphasise, however, there  is  not\r\n\r\nmuch that the Government can do if individuals, in\r\n\r\ntheir  hope  for  quick  gains,  take  unnecessary\r\n\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked why the Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings  Bank  cannot maintain  sufficient\r\n\r\nfunds  to  meet  withdrawals.  This  Savings  Bank\r\n\r\nalways  ensures that there is sufficient  cash  at\r\n\r\nits   various  counters  and  branches   to   meet\r\n\r\nwithdrawals.   But   like  any   prudent   banking\r\n\r\ninstitution it tries not to overstock liquid funds\r\n\r\nat counters, since such funds do not earn interest\r\n\r\nbut only add on to costs. With the installation of\r\n\r\ncomputerised  on-line  banking,  the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank has in fact increased the amount that\r\n\r\nmay be withdrawn. At the Savings Bank counter in a\r\n\r\nPost  Office  a depositor can now withdraw  up  to\r\n\r\n$2,000  once a day, whereas previously  the  limit\r\n\r\nwas $500 once every three days. At any Post Office\r\n\r\nSavings  Bank  branch  the  amount  that  can   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  is higher, namely $5,000 in  cash  once\r\n\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired as to the activities of\r\n\r\nthe  Neptune  Orient  Lines and  Intraco.  Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient  Lines' success should not be judged solely\r\n\r\nby  the  record of its profits. The Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  disappointed  at  the progress  made  by  the\r\n\r\nnational shipping line. It is not the Government's\r\n\r\nintention to curb the freedom of shippers for  the\r\n\r\nshort term benefit of Neptune Orient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLines  by making it compulsory for our exports  to\r\n\r\nbe carried on the national line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Intraco, its principal activity remains in\r\n\r\ninternational  trading. Export sales  account  for\r\n\r\n60% of the company's turnover. I am pleased to say\r\n\r\nthat,  since  its  inception  in  1968,  Intraco's\r\n\r\nturnover  has  increased from $11 million  to  $63\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about export promotion efforts\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. I have made quite a  detailed\r\n\r\nstatement  on export promotion during  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned the re-discounting of export\r\n\r\nbills just now in reply to the Member for Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also touched on the higher\r\n\r\nprices  being  charged  by consumer  supermarkets.\r\n\r\nConsumer  supermarkets provide a valuable  service\r\n\r\nin  stabilising prices of goods, particularly when\r\n\r\nthere  are unfounded rumours of shortages of goods\r\n\r\ndue   to   hoarding  in  anticipation   of   price\r\n\r\nincreases.  These supermarkets help to  force  the\r\n\r\nprivate dealers to sell at reasonable and even  at\r\n\r\nlower levels. However, because of higher overheads\r\n\r\nand  a  faster  turnover of stocks, there  may  be\r\n\r\nisolated  cases  where goods are  sold  at  higher\r\n\r\nprices  in supermarkets as they have to pay higher\r\n\r\nprices  for  new  stocks. In the  end  it  is  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  who  must  make every  effort  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves and make more use of the information of\r\n\r\nprices  supplied daily by the Department of Trade.\r\n\r\nThey   should  refrain  from  buying  from   shops\r\n\r\ncharging higher prices and instead patronise those\r\n\r\nselling at fair prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked questions regarding the civil\r\n\r\nservice. On leave allowance, I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  allowance  is fixed  according  to  the\r\n\r\ndivisional  status  of the  officer  and  not  his\r\n\r\ngrade.  An  increase in leave  allowance  is  only\r\n\r\ngiven  if  the  officer is promoted  to  a  higher\r\n\r\ndivision,  for example, a promotion from  Division\r\n\r\nIV to Division IH. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  under the old leave scheme  an  officer's\r\n\r\neligibility was based on his divisional status and\r\n\r\nhis leave would be revised to a higher rate on his\r\n\r\npromotion   to  a  higher  division.   The   leave\r\n\r\nallowance' compensates officers for the number  of\r\n\r\ndays'  leave  which  they  gave  up,  and  it   is\r\n\r\ntherefore not logical to allow a revision in leave\r\n\r\nallowances  except when there is a change  in  the\r\n\r\ndivisional status of the officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's question regarding the 13th month\r\n\r\nallowance,  it was quite clearly stated  when  the\r\n\r\nallowance  was introduced that it was  not  to  be\r\n\r\nconfused  with  bonus.  A bonus  is  uncertain  in\r\n\r\namount and it may or may not be paid. But the 13th\r\n\r\nmonth  allowance, like the National Wages  Council\r\n\r\npayment,  is a wage supplement. These are  orderly\r\n\r\nadjustments   of  wages  pending  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nrevision of salaries. I see no reason why the 13th\r\n\r\nmonth allowance should not be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the merit increment scheme, I\r\n\r\nrecollect  explaining in the  last  Budget  debate\r\n\r\nthat  merit  increments are awarded  to  deserving\r\n\r\nofficers in the basic grades in the administrative\r\n\r\nand  professional services. It is  meant  to  give\r\n\r\nrecognition  to outstanding officers who  are  not\r\n\r\nyet  ready for promotion but who deserve a  faster\r\n\r\nincrease   in   their  salary  than   the   normal\r\n\r\nincrements  would  allow.  For  1974,   62   civil\r\n\r\nservants were granted merit increments as follows:\r\n\r\ntwo  were  given one increment; 59 were given  two\r\n\r\nincrements; and one was given three increments. In\r\n\r\naddition   to   the   merit   increment    scheme,\r\n\r\noutstanding  officers  in the  administrative  and\r\n\r\nprofessional   services  may  be  considered   for\r\n\r\naccelerated promotion. This will help  to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe quality of the civil service by attracting and\r\n\r\nretaining every bright and capable officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to thank the Member for his\r\n\r\nsuggestion  regarding income tax forms.  I  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member that in designing the income tax forms\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  the taxpayer is always  borne  in\r\n\r\nmind. The Inland Revenue Department is continually\r\n\r\nstriving to improve and simplify the form as this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot   only   benefits   the  taxpayer   but   also\r\n\r\nfacilitates processing by the department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment\r\n\r\non  the  Minister's reply in respect of  the  13th\r\n\r\nmonth  payment. If I heard him correctly, he  said\r\n\r\nthat  the 13th month payment is a wage supplement.\r\n\r\nBy  that,  it would mean that it is a  form  of  a\r\n\r\ndeferred  wage which is paid to a public  employee\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  the year for his  12  months  of\r\n\r\nservice. I would presume that interpretation to be\r\n\r\ncorrect.  If  the  13th month payment  is  a  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement, and if my interpretation is correct, I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the Minister would reconsider  his\r\n\r\nearlier  decision not to pay public employees  who\r\n\r\nretire prior to 31st December of any year. I  feel\r\n\r\nit  is  only fair that they ought to be paid  this\r\n\r\nwage supplement. If a public employee works for 10\r\n\r\nmonths  or  11  months in the year, surely  he  is\r\n\r\nentitled to that portion of the 13th month payment\r\n\r\non a pro rata basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider this point\r\n\r\nbecause   this  has  given  rise  to  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nunhappiness  among civil servants. Having  put  in\r\n\r\nyears  of  dedicated service,  just  because  they\r\n\r\nhappen to retire one day short of the full year in\r\n\r\nthe  year of retirement, they are deprived of such\r\n\r\na wage supplement, as the Minister calls it, which\r\n\r\nis   due  to  them.  On  the  other  hand,  public\r\n\r\nemployees who resign after a very short period  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service enjoy the 13th month allowance\r\n\r\nbecause  they choose to resign after  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary of the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of situation that gives rise to\r\n\r\na  lot  of  discontent. Civil  servants  who  have\r\n\r\nserved  the Government loyally during their  whole\r\n\r\nlife  are in the last year of retirement not given\r\n\r\nwhat is due to them. On the other hand, those  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  shown any loyalty know how  to  put  in\r\n\r\ntheir  resignation at the proper time and so enjoy\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the 13th month payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter\r\n\r\nsympathetically. Even though it may  be  too  late\r\n\r\nfor some civil ser\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvants  who have already retired, there is no  harm\r\n\r\nbecause  the  decision  could  have  retrospective\r\n\r\neffect, and this will make everybody happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not think this is the particular place\r\n\r\nfor  me  to make a decision of this nature.

Such criticisms are well-intentioned and\r\n\r\nconstructive in nature. The purpose is to help the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  to  carry  out  their  duty  more\r\n\r\nefficiently. In moving this amendment,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nseek to criticise their attitude. I would like  to\r\n\r\nfight for the benefits of the civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the civil servants are serving the country\r\n\r\nand  the  people  loyally  and  faithfully,  their\r\n\r\nwelfare  should be looked after by the Government.\r\n\r\nI  would like to lodge a complaint to the Minister\r\n\r\nregarding    their   Municipal   Provident    Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions. I understand that on 26th November,\r\n\r\n1974, the Ministry of Finance issued a circular to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that up to 31-12-74 members of the MPF\r\n\r\ncould  opt for conversion to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund scheme. Most of the civil servants opted  for\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  scheme. Under this scheme, the  members'\r\n\r\ncontributions will be credited into their accounts\r\n\r\nin  the POSB. These contributions in the POSB will\r\n\r\nthen earn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest  as from 1st January, 1975. However,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance has not yet paid  their  MPF\r\n\r\ncontributions into their POSB accounts.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhen   will  their  monies  be  paid  into   their\r\n\r\nrespective POSB accounts. I hope that this  matter\r\n\r\nof conversion and the payment of monies into their\r\n\r\nPOSB  accounts could be expedited. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  delay in crediting their POSB accounts,  many\r\n\r\ncivil  servants have lost a large sum of interest.\r\n\r\nI  would  also  like to ask the  Minister  whether\r\n\r\ntheir contributions will earn interest as from 1-1-75.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, under the special scheme offered to\r\n\r\nMunicipal Provident Fund members to withdraw from.\r\n\r\nthe Municipal Provident Fund, 1,005 out of a total\r\n\r\nof 1,297 officers opted to join the CPF scheme and\r\n\r\nto  have their MPF contributions transferred  into\r\n\r\ntheir accounts with the Post Office Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the large number of officers involved\r\n\r\nin  the exercise, some delay in processing the MPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  for credit of the accounts  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers  is unavoidable. Each payment has  to  be\r\n\r\ncomputed  by  the Accountant-General's  Department\r\n\r\nand verified by the Audit Department. The position\r\n\r\nis aggravated by the fact that the conversion date\r\n\r\ncoincided  with the closing date of the  financial\r\n\r\nyear of the Municipal Provident Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPF rules do not provide for interest to be\r\n\r\ncredited  to a member who has withdrawn  from  the\r\n\r\nMPF.

Govindasamy.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, as an employer, employs the\r\n\r\nlargest  number of workers. So the spate of  daily\r\n\r\nstaff  problems  and grievances in  such  a  large\r\n\r\nservice  must surely be innumerable.  It  requires\r\n\r\nvery  little  commonsense  to  understand  that  a\r\n\r\nproperly  constituted machinery  where  grievances\r\n\r\ncould be aired and problems attended to is a vital\r\n\r\nprerequisite   to  good  industrial   relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government as an  employer  and  its\r\n\r\nemployees.  But  one gets the impression  that  in\r\n\r\ncertain   departments  this  machinery   is   non-existent,  and where it exists one sometimes  gets\r\n\r\nthe  impression that the officers in  charge,  who\r\n\r\nare   called  staff  officers  or  by  some  other\r\n\r\ndesignation, do not seem to be competent enough to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  stall problems. A competent industrial\r\n\r\nrelations   officer  must  be  one  who  possesses\r\n\r\nunderstanding and be able to temper decisions with\r\n\r\na  human  touch. One gets the impression that  the\r\n\r\nonly  qualification  all these  officers  have  is\r\n\r\ntheir  ability  to quote relevant,  and  sometimes\r\n\r\nalso   irrelevant,  sections  of  the  Instruction\r\n\r\nManual in dealing with staff problems. A visit  to\r\n\r\na  staff  officer  reminds one of  a  visit  to  a\r\n\r\nfortune  teller.  It  is not that  I  myself  have\r\n\r\nvisited  a  fortune teller. But from what  I  have\r\n\r\nobserved,  the authority of the fortune teller  on\r\n\r\nthe roadside is the book of oracle. If you consult\r\n\r\nhim,  he will use the book of oracle to tell  your\r\n\r\nfortune.  While he understands what is written  in\r\n\r\nthe book of oracle, very often he cannot grasp the\r\n\r\nsignificance of the text in that book. So we  have\r\n\r\nthe  staff officer who understands what is written\r\n\r\nin the Instruction Manual, but very often fails to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  significance and  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\ncertain  sections in the Instruction Manual.  Like\r\n\r\nthe  incompetent  fortune teller, the  incompetent\r\n\r\nstaff  officer  gives  his  answer  each  time  by\r\n\r\nreferring  to the Instruction Manual as his  guide\r\n\r\nand  authority. This must surely lead to a lot  of\r\n\r\nunhappiness because the problems which are brought\r\n\r\nup are very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noften human problems, and they must be attended to\r\n\r\nwith  regard to human feelings in order to  remove\r\n\r\nthe  grievances. Using the Instruction  Manual  as\r\n\r\nthe  only means of dealing with the problems  does\r\n\r\nnot  produce  that  kind of  effect.  So  we  find\r\n\r\nproblems  after problems coming up  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  which are badly attended to and this  has\r\n\r\nresulted in greater frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we hear in this House not only this\r\n\r\nyear but also for many years previously that there\r\n\r\nare  frustrations  and  grievances  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  We also hear that it is not so much  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of  pay that matters. Money  is  not  the\r\n\r\nimportant  factor. There must be job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI think one of the causes of job discontent is the\r\n\r\nlack of attention and the lack of care on the part\r\n\r\nof  Government not only in constituting  a  proper\r\n\r\ngrievance  machinery to solve staff  problems  but\r\n\r\nalso in employing and training people to deal with\r\n\r\nsuch  problems. It is necessary to train  officers\r\n\r\nadequately to deal with such problems  in  a  more\r\n\r\nqualified manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is this does the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider  that  attention   to   staff\r\n\r\nproblems  is  of vital importance in  ensuring  an\r\n\r\nefficient  civil service? If so, is  it  not  true\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is not doing enough to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the officers who man the grievance machinery\r\n\r\nare competent enough? Should not the Government do\r\n\r\nsomething  so  that problems can  be  solved  more\r\n\r\neffectively  and discontent in the  civil  service\r\n\r\nminimised? I would like to know from the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are such plans afoot  and  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is going to be a change in its approach  in\r\n\r\ndealing   with   staff   problems.   The   present\r\n\r\nrelationship  seems  to  be  that  of  master  and\r\n\r\nservant.  If they do not like them, they  have  to\r\n\r\nleave.  There  is  no  question  of  treating  the\r\n\r\nofficers with due respect. I do not think this  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of the political  leadership.  But\r\n\r\nsometimes  because of an inadequate machinery  and\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of competent officers it can result  in\r\n\r\nthis sort of situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance for the improvement it has\r\n\r\nmade  to  the  format of the Main and  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  year after year. However, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  make  two comments in respect of the Estimates\r\n\r\nas presented this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment is that information on the staff\r\n\r\nestablishment  does not reflect the true  position\r\n\r\nor the state of affairs in respect of personnel in\r\n\r\nthe Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second column in the Estimates gives the\r\n\r\nnumber  of posts for the previous year. The  third\r\n\r\ncolumn  gives the provision of personnel  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming  year.  What is perhaps needed  is  another\r\n\r\ncolumn  next  to  tile establishment  requirement,\r\n\r\nstating the actual staffing position. For example,\r\n\r\nfor  this  year it is stated that for  FY  74  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Division was supposed to have 159 Division\r\n\r\nI  officers,  but it is not known  how  many  were\r\n\r\nactually  employed. But as I understand it,  every\r\n\r\none of the Ministers who spoke before the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  seemed  to be  talking  about  staff\r\n\r\nshortages  in  their Ministries.  Perhaps  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Estimates for next year we  could  see  an\r\n\r\nadditional  column showing the  actual  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  working in each Department, and not  just\r\n\r\nthe establishment requirement alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second comment is this. If the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance could just turn to page 93 of the Main and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates, he would  notice  that  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the salary of the Minister for Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology  the wage mentioned  against  this\r\n\r\nitem  is  $7,000 per mensem but the  appropriation\r\n\r\nfor  FY  75 is only $42,000. Sir, it neither  adds\r\n\r\nnor  multiplies. If the wage is $7,000 per mensem,\r\n\r\nthen  the  annual appropriation should be  $84,000\r\n\r\nand  not $42.000. Sir, I know, and you know,  that\r\n\r\nonly  part of the Minister's wages is paid by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But the point is that  the  Main  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates as a public  document  does\r\n\r\nnot  let everybody know that the Minister receives\r\n\r\nonly part of his wages from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would have thought that a footnote at  the\r\n\r\nbottom of the page or somewhere appropriate  could\r\n\r\nbe inserted to explain the difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am sorry to hear the Member for Moulmein's\r\n\r\ncomments  on  the  poor state  of  our  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations. I had the impression that our relations\r\n\r\nwith  the union representatives representing civil\r\n\r\nservants  were  of the best, and most  harmonious.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly so over the last few years when,\r\n\r\nI  think,  the question of wages was not  of  very\r\n\r\ngreat relevance in our discussions because we give\r\n\r\nregular  increases in salary. I would have thought\r\n\r\nthat under these circumstances there would be very\r\n\r\nfew complaints. Of course, our officials in charge\r\n\r\nof industrial relations ought to be quite flexible\r\n\r\nin  outlook  and not at all rigid.  They  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  bound by certain terms of reference  when\r\n\r\nthey go to the negotiation table, in the same  way\r\n\r\nthat  union representatives must be given  certain\r\n\r\nterms  when they negotiate. But if, in fact, there\r\n\r\nwere  cases  where  we have  been  too  rigid  and\r\n\r\ninflexible,  I  would like to know the  particular\r\n\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein must forgive me if I do\r\n\r\nnot  always accept general criticisms made  on  my\r\n\r\nofficers  by  persons who may sit on the  opposite\r\n\r\nside of the negotiating table. In the same way,  I\r\n\r\ndo   not   always  accept  complaints   from   the\r\n\r\nemployers'  side  that union negotiators  are  too\r\n\r\nrigid  and  inflexible.  I agree  that  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  is  a very specialised field  and  that\r\n\r\nthere should be a special aptitude or training  so\r\n\r\nthat  negotiations will proceed more  smoothly.  I\r\n\r\nthink   some   of  my  officers  have   had   such\r\n\r\nexperience.  The Member for Moulmein may  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow  that one of the senior officers dealing with\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations  in  my  Ministry  had  been\r\n\r\nseconded  to  the  NTUC Research Unit  and  served\r\n\r\nthere  for  seven  years.  So  he  should  not  be\r\n\r\ninsensitive   to  union  thinking  in   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations. Another senior officer has attended  an\r\n\r\noverseas  course,  and  yet another  is  presently\r\n\r\noverseas attending a six-month course with special\r\n\r\nemphasis on industrial relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised two matters.\r\n\r\nHe  also paid my Ministry some compliments on  the\r\n\r\nimproved  format of the Budget. But  he  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  there should be one further improvement  and\r\n\r\nthat  is the actual number of posts filled  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  shown in the Estimates. This is somewhat\r\n\r\ndifficult to adopt because the number varies  from\r\n\r\nday to day depending on recruitment, transfers and\r\n\r\nresignations. Since time is required to print  and\r\n\r\ncheck  the  Estimates, the position shown  on  any\r\n\r\nparticular day when we prepare the Budget will  be\r\n\r\nout  of  date  by  the  time these  Estimates  are\r\n\r\npresented  to  Parliament.  Nevertheless,   I   am\r\n\r\ngrateful for having given thought to this  subject\r\n\r\nand made the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the provision shown in the Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the  Senior Minister, Science and Technology,\r\n\r\nthe   explanation   is  that   the   appropriation\r\n\r\nrepresents  the difference between his  salary  of\r\n\r\n$7,000  per  mensem  as Senior  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nsalary of $3,500 per mensem as Vice-Chancellor  of\r\n\r\nthe  University  of Singapore.  I  will  certainly\r\n\r\nconsider  for next year, if, in fact, it is  still\r\n\r\nrelevant,  the  suggestion of the Member  that  in\r\n\r\nspecial  cases  like  this  an  appropriate   note\r\n\r\nexplaining  the position should be  given  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, the reason for the Finance Minister to\r\n\r\nthink  that  there existed in the last  few  years\r\n\r\ngood industrial relations probably stems from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there  has been an  absence  of  angry\r\n\r\nspeeches, strike notices and industrial action  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the civil service unions. But this has\r\n\r\ngot nothing to do with the speed and effectiveness\r\n\r\nthat  the grievances of the public employees  have\r\n\r\nbeen   settled.  This  is  due  largely  to   very\r\n\r\nresponsible and reasonable attitude of trade union\r\n\r\nleaders  whose  patience seems to be inexhaustible\r\n\r\nin so far as staff relations affecting the kind of\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  attention from the  Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that there are a few such\r\n\r\nqualified officers. I am not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarrelling  with the fact that there  are  a  few\r\n\r\ncompetent  civil servants. But he must not  forget\r\n\r\nthat   there  are  so  many  thousands  of  public\r\n\r\nemployees. I believe the number of the monthly and\r\n\r\ndaily-rated employees exceeds 50,000.  With  three\r\n\r\nor  four competent officers that the Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  how  can they hope to  solve  so  many\r\n\r\nproblems  that  occur in the different  places  of\r\n\r\nwork? The three or four officers that the Minister\r\n\r\nhas   in  Fullerton  Building  is  not  all   that\r\n\r\nsufficient. Competent officers must be present  in\r\n\r\nthe various Ministries, and not only that but they\r\n\r\nmust also be present in the different sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministries because they have got a  very  big\r\n\r\nstaff. So I say that it is generally accepted that\r\n\r\na  sufficiency  of good personnel officers  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant   prerequisite   for   good   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  in the civil service. My  plea  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  that what he has at present  is  not\r\n\r\nenough. He must increase the number. Probably  his\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Education, would  need\r\n\r\nsome   extra  qualified  and  competent  personnel\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not complaining. The question is we must\r\n\r\nalways improve. If things work satisfactorily,  we\r\n\r\nmust  always aim for the better. That must be  the\r\n\r\nobjective.   While  generally  the  situation   is\r\n\r\nsatisfactory, there is much room for  improvement.\r\n\r\nFor a start, probably this could he one area where\r\n\r\nhe could look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I do not know whether my\r\n\r\ncolleague wants to raise any other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The  prices  of  some\r\n\r\ngoods  have  accordingly  gone  up,  for  example,\r\n\r\nbread,  kway  teow and mee. The  prices  of  these\r\n\r\ncommodities have been adjusted several  times.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  \"adjustment\" means \"price increase\".  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  why the merchants do not use the  words\r\n\r\n\"price   increase\"  but  prefer  to   use   \"price\r\n\r\nadjustment\". Perhaps they want to use  euphemistic\r\n\r\nwords so as to confuse the minds of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these price increases are in multiples of 5\r\n\r\ncents  or 10 cents. But during the second half  of\r\n\r\nlast year, food producing countries had reasonably\r\n\r\ngood  harvests.  Prices of basic commodities  have\r\n\r\ncome  down, but the prices of bread, mee and  kway\r\n\r\nteow came down by only one cent or two cents.  The\r\n\r\nincrease  or decrease of prices of some  essential\r\n\r\ngoods  have  to  be approved by the Department  of\r\n\r\nTrade.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to  ask   what\r\n\r\nexplanation can the Department of Trade  give  for\r\n\r\nthis  unreasonable situation. Bread, mee and  kway\r\n\r\nteow are the daily staple foods of the people  and\r\n\r\nchanges  in prices affect their living to a  great\r\n\r\nextent. Therefore, they are entitled to receive an\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that retailers have a very unsociable\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  consumers.  At  the  time  when\r\n\r\nprices increase, they will immediately mark up the\r\n\r\nprices  of  their existing stock.  But  conversely\r\n\r\nwhen  the  prices of commodities come  down,  they\r\n\r\nstill  sell their existing stock at the same  high\r\n\r\nprices.  This  is very unfair to the consumers.  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  whether the Department  of  Trade  has\r\n\r\ntaken  any  action against such retailers.  If  no\r\n\r\naction  has ever been taken, I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  could  instruct the  wholesalers  when\r\n\r\nselling  their  commodities to the  retailers,  to\r\n\r\nmark  the  retail prices of those  commodities  in\r\n\r\norder  to  prevent the retailers  from  exploiting\r\n\r\ntile consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen :</b> Sir, I wish to congratulate the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  for  noticing  a  greater  tendency  for\r\n\r\nprices to increase than to reduce. I cannot  claim\r\n\r\nany   direct   responsibility  for  this   curious\r\n\r\neconomic    phenomenon.   The    Government,    as\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  my Ministry, does  not  have  any\r\n\r\nformal  control over the prices of  foodstuffs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, although we would like to be  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat price increases of essential commodities  are\r\n\r\njustifiable on economic grounds. I think  in  most\r\n\r\ncases, maybe in all cases, we are consulted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only suppose that the reason for this\r\n\r\ntendency is that it is bad marketing strategy  for\r\n\r\na company to have a series\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof small  price  increases, however justifiable,  for\r\n\r\nits   products.  This  could  give  consumers  the\r\n\r\nimpression   that   the   company's   prices   are\r\n\r\ncontinually rising and generate more ill-will than\r\n\r\nnecessary against the company. As a result, e is a\r\n\r\ntendency   to   hold   back  small   eases   until\r\n\r\njustification can be prod for an increase  to  the\r\n\r\nnearest  round figure, say, 5 cents, 10  cents  or\r\n\r\neven 50 cents, depending on the value the products\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when prices of commodities\r\n\r\nfall,   the   Government  has  often  urged   upon\r\n\r\ncompanies that the benefits be immediately  passed\r\n\r\non  to  consumers. Consequently,  in  some  cases,\r\n\r\nprice  reduction  which they  reluctantly  concede\r\n\r\ncould be less than five cents ending on the prices\r\n\r\nof  the  items concerned. It may also be  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  not as yet expect price reduces  to  be  as\r\n\r\nlarge  as price increases, world commodity  prices\r\n\r\nhave  not  always fallen as rapidly as  they  have\r\n\r\nrisen.  Members may, however, like to  that  there\r\n\r\nhave been some cases of reductions in quanta of 10\r\n\r\ncents, instance, prices of cooking oil in consumer\r\n\r\npacks of various sizes have falls ranging from  20\r\n\r\ncents to $1.50. But may I suggest that in the end,\r\n\r\nit is duty of consumers themselves to be sure that\r\n\r\nthe  prices  will fall, and by larger  amounts  if\r\n\r\nthey so desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister not answered my\r\n\r\nsecond    question   about   price   tagging    of\r\n\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, these price tags have not been imposed by\r\n\r\nregulations, many cases they are  the  result  of\r\n\r\nefforts  of  CASE  and perhaps persuasion  by  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Department officials. They  have  not  been\r\n\r\nimposed  by regulations. I do not think that  they\r\n\r\nare of much value because prices change so rapidly\r\n\r\nthat the traders can always suggest that they have\r\n\r\nnot  had  the  time yet to indicate  a  change  of\r\n\r\nprices from previous rate to the prevailing rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, whilst I agree with the Minister that it is\r\n\r\nthe duty of the consumers to ensure that prices of\r\n\r\ncommodities go down as fast as they go up, he must\r\n\r\nconsider  this very important point. The  consumer\r\n\r\nneeds commodities like bread, rice, kway teow, bee\r\n\r\nhoon  and  so on. These are commodities that  they\r\n\r\ncannot do without. So if consumers were to boycott\r\n\r\nretailers   who  jack  up  their  prices   to   an\r\n\r\nunreasonable extent, it is, I feel,  the  duty  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  ensure that such exorbitant  price\r\n\r\nincreases do not occur in the market place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more times than one the retailers have sought\r\n\r\nthe  permission of the Trade Department  to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of  commodities,  and  the  Consumers\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Singapore has also been  involved.\r\n\r\nBut at each time they came up with arguments which\r\n\r\nsomehow  won over the Trade Department people  and\r\n\r\nleft the Consumers Association in a position where\r\n\r\nit  was impossible to bargain for lesser increases\r\n\r\nin prices. Therefore, I do not see any reason why,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Trade Department notices that prices  of\r\n\r\ncommodities in world markets have dropped, they do\r\n\r\nnot  call up these retailers and CASE and come  up\r\n\r\nwith very strong arguments as to why the prices of\r\n\r\nthese  commodities  -  I am talking  about  staple\r\n\r\ncommodities  especially -should not  fall  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  proportion  as  the  fall  in  world  market\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I made it clear that some of the price\r\n\r\nreductions  have  been the  result  of  the  Trade\r\n\r\nDepartment  calling in the traders and  suggesting\r\n\r\nto them that in view of the fall in food commodity\r\n\r\nprices there should be reductions in the prices of\r\n\r\nessential foods, like bread, rice and so  on.  The\r\n\r\nresult has always been a reluctance on the part of\r\n\r\nthese  traders. The reason why the falls have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  in multiples of five cents is that they  try\r\n\r\nto  get  away  with as little as possible  --  one\r\n\r\ncent,  two  cents and so on. In some  cases,  like\r\n\r\ncooking  oil and so on, there has been  a  greater\r\n\r\nsuccess  on  the part of our persuasion.

Members in this House must e read in the\r\n\r\npress or in other reports t prices of real estate,\r\n\r\nespecially  in respect of residential  properties,\r\n\r\nhave e down tremendously during the last months or\r\n\r\nso. In some instances the value has dropped by  as\r\n\r\nmuch as 30% even 40%, so much so that there is w a\r\n\r\nglut in housing stocks in the market. However, the\r\n\r\nproperty  assessments  which  have  been  revalued\r\n\r\nupwards  the  past, corresponding to the  increase\r\n\r\nproperty  prices before 1974, have  named  at  its\r\n\r\npeak.

In  some  cases,  indeed,  they  have\r\n\r\nrisen.  So there is no justification for a general\r\n\r\nreduction  in the annual values of properties.  In\r\n\r\nspecific  instances, it may  be  that  rents  have\r\n\r\nfallen, it is therefore open to the owner  in  any\r\n\r\nindividual casa to object when the Valuation  List\r\n\r\nfor the ensuing year is open for public inspection\r\n\r\nannually  in August.

In Jurong Town some sports  facilities\r\n\r\nare  available  and  these include  a  stadium,  a\r\n\r\nfootball  field  and a basketball  court,  etc.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know  whether  certain  community\r\n\r\norganisations  in  Jurong  Town  which  have  been\r\n\r\nregistered  with  the Registrar of  Societies  can\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  these facilities and whether  their\r\n\r\napplications   for  the  use   of   these   sports\r\n\r\nfacilities will be favourably considered or  given\r\n\r\ncertain  concessions. We all know that the rentals\r\n\r\nor  fees  charged for such facilities  are  rather\r\n\r\nhigh,  and since these organisations cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  pay such high fees the sports facilities  will\r\n\r\nbe  hardly  used  and will be just  like  a  white\r\n\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally I have no intention to raise my third\r\n\r\nquestion  here, but now I feel I am duty-bound  to\r\n\r\nraise it. At this time last year I had also raised\r\n\r\nthe  same question hoping that tile Minister could\r\n\r\nsupervise the JTC in its work. This concerns  tile\r\n\r\ncollection and disposal of rubbish in Jurong Town.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know  whether it  is  because  of  the\r\n\r\ninability of the JTC to employ the required number\r\n\r\nof labour to clear up the rubbish or whether it is\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  increase  in  the   number   of\r\n\r\nstructures or residents there that the rubbish  is\r\n\r\nnot  being  collected  daily.  On  many  occasions\r\n\r\nrubbish is piled up for several days at a stretch.\r\n\r\nIt  has not been collected and sent to the rubbish\r\n\r\ndisposal  dump. This is detrimental to the  health\r\n\r\nof  the residents and I have received a number  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  them. I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he has been supervising  the  JTC\r\n\r\nin  regard to this matter. I hope I need not  have\r\n\r\nto raise the same matter again next year. I also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  that the Minister can take suitable measures\r\n\r\nto deal with this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question relates to Neighbourhood II\r\n\r\nof  Jurong Town. It is called the Boon Lay  Garden\r\n\r\nEstate.  The design of this estate is rather  odd.\r\n\r\nIt  was  only  designed for residential  purposes.\r\n\r\nThere was no provision for shopping facilities and\r\n\r\nso  the authorities have to modify the residential\r\n\r\npremises  for  use  as shops. Even  if  groceries,\r\n\r\nclinics   and  other  types  of  shops   are   now\r\n\r\navailable,  there  is  still  a  shortage   of   a\r\n\r\nparticular type of shop, namely, the eating house.\r\n\r\nWithout  an eating house it is rather inconvenient\r\n\r\nto  the  residents, especially single workers.  It\r\n\r\nwould be most difficult for them to go anywhere to\r\n\r\nget  food. So they will have to travel to  the  13\r\n\r\n1/2m.s. Jurong to get their food. I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether  he  can  remedy  this\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the purchaser of an executive flat in Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  is not at present allowed to use his CPF  to\r\n\r\npurchase  the  fiat. I realise that purchasers  of\r\n\r\nHUDC fiats have only recently been allowed to  use\r\n\r\ntheir CPF contributions. I have not yet considered\r\n\r\nwhether  purchasers  of  the  executive  flats  in\r\n\r\nJurong Town should be given the same privilege.  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  are certain conditions in  the  HUDC\r\n\r\nscheme which would be quite different from the JTC\r\n\r\none.  At  present, CPF money can only be used  for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of low-cost fiats in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding tile second question on the hiring of\r\n\r\nsports facilities, these are already subsidised by\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation  as  the football  field,  sports\r\n\r\nstadium, swimming pool and other courts are  built\r\n\r\nat  high cost with public money. I understand that\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation follows the similar  practice  on\r\n\r\nthe  comparative rates set by other  bodies  which\r\n\r\nprovide  for  concession  rates  for  schools  and\r\n\r\nregistered  sports bodies but they  charge  higher\r\n\r\nrates for commercial users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third question regarding refuse collection\r\n\r\nfrom  blocks  of  fiats  to  the  bin  centre,   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  this is now  being  carried  out\r\n\r\nevery  day by a contractor appointed by the Jurong\r\n\r\nTown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorporation. A competent contractor was  appointed\r\n\r\nrecently to provide the service and with effective\r\n\r\nsupervision   the  work  is  being   carried   out\r\n\r\nefficiently.  The  refuse  removal  from  the  bin\r\n\r\ncentre to the dumping ground is carried out by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment, and this is also done\r\n\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth question regarding coffee shops and\r\n\r\neating   houses,   I  understand   that   in   the\r\n\r\nresidential   area  Neighbourhood  I,   which   is\r\n\r\nvirtually completed, there is provision for  eight\r\n\r\neating  shops  together  with  four  other  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.  In  Neighbourhood Ii, where about  3,500\r\n\r\nfiats  have been completed out of a total of about\r\n\r\n10,000  fiats,  provision is being  made  for  136\r\n\r\nshops  of  which about ten will be set aside  for\r\n\r\neating houses. In addition, a hawker centre with a\r\n\r\ntotal  accommodation of 162 stalls will  be  ready\r\n\r\nwithin the next three to four months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, concerning the use of CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions for the put-chase of executive flats\r\n\r\nin   Jurong   Town,  I  hope  the  Minister   will\r\n\r\nreconsider this matter seriously. If the HUDC  has\r\n\r\na scheme governing such privileges, I hope the JTC\r\n\r\nwill  also apply the same regulations in the  case\r\n\r\nof  their  executive fiats. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthe Minister' will agree to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the JTC executive flats are not purely for\r\n\r\nour  citizens.
