Furthermore, a new power station to meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  industrial expansion is  also  being\r\n\r\nbuilt  and  a  World Bank loan is being  sought  for\r\n\r\nthis.  The consultants for this project are  already\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the new station is for plant\r\n\r\ncapable of generating 60 M.W. which is scheduled for\r\n\r\ncommission in 1965. With these developments,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  expected that there will be any sudden shortage\r\n\r\nof  supply in the future. On the contrary, our total\r\n\r\ngenerating plant, once installed, should  enable  us\r\n\r\nto  meet  our expanding needs, including the  Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Development project. However, I  may  add\r\n\r\nthat the failure of the free-piston plant has been a\r\n\r\ngreat disappointment. The new plant was intended for\r\n\r\npeak  loads  and  there  have been  anxious  moments\r\n\r\nlately  on this account during peak periods.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible that these may recur again between now  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the extension scheme in Pasir Panjang is ready\r\n\r\nin  June  this  year.  It is doubtful  if  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  should have agreed to install a free-piston\r\n\r\nplant.  They were advised in 1957 that such a  plant\r\n\r\nhad  not been proved and tested on such a scale  and\r\n\r\nthat St. James was to be the biggest of its kind  in\r\n\r\nthe world, and the present City Electricity Engineer\r\n\r\nwas opposed to this project.

In fact, the City Electricity Engineer had been\r\n\r\nsent  to  the  New Hebrides in order to restore  his\r\n\r\nconfidence in the free-piston engine - I was  told - not\r\n\r\nbecause of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimproper supervision but because this was the  first\r\n\r\ntime that a free-piston engine was installed on such\r\n\r\na  scale  and not by the original patentees  of  the\r\n\r\nfree-piston   engine.  I  do  not   understand   the\r\n\r\ntechnical intricacies of the term \"free-piston\", but\r\n\r\nI  am  told that it is something quite new. It is  a\r\n\r\ngas  turbine and it was developed by the French.  In\r\n\r\n1957,  Mr Chan Kum Chee - I think he was the Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Public Utilities Sub-Committee - was persuaded,\r\n\r\nin  spite  of  The  views of  the  City  Electricity\r\n\r\nEngineer,  to  undertake this project. Tenders  were\r\n\r\ncalled  for to install a free-piston engine although\r\n\r\nit  had  never been attempted on such a large  scale\r\n\r\nand  the tender was given not to the original French\r\n\r\npatentees but to an English firm which was going  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  under  licence. It had  sent  the  best\r\n\r\nqualified men to supervise and install this  machine\r\n\r\nand  there  had  been an endless amount  of  trouble\r\n\r\nsince  the trial test. The City Electricity Engineer\r\n\r\nlost  confidence in the machine. To restore it,  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  team, which was out here at  that  time\r\n\r\nstudying our request for a World Bank loan  for  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  project  we had in  mind,  recommended - I\r\n\r\nthink    the    gentleman's   name   was    Monsieur\r\n\r\nShereschewsky; the Minister for Finance is not  here\r\n\r\nbut  I think it was Monsieur Shereschewsky -  that the\r\n\r\nCity  Electricity Engineer, Mr Fuiczek, be sent  to\r\n\r\nthe  New  Hebrides where they had installed a  free-piston  engine which works. Well, he has  seen  that\r\n\r\none work.

But it has nothing to  do  with\r\n\r\nsupervision.  It  was the best  that  the  firm  had\r\n\r\navailable  and  the pity was that it  was  not  good\r\n\r\nenough  because they did not invent the  free-piston\r\n\r\nengine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is it not correct that the work was\r\n\r\nundertaken sometime in 1958 for the first time  when\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. was in power in the City Council  under\r\n\r\nthe  guidance  of Mayor Ong Eng Guan  and  the  work\r\n\r\nreally started then?

The necessity to ration water is\r\n\r\ndetermined by the rainfall and the water  stocks  in\r\n\r\nall our reservoirs. In spite of 11.23 inches of rain\r\n\r\nin  December,  rainfall for the year 1961  has  been\r\n\r\nbelow  average and our stocks, in spite  of  partial\r\n\r\nrationing, are 40 per cent short of total capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainfall for 1961 amounted to 71.32 inches as\r\n\r\nagainst  a yearly average over the last 86 years  of\r\n\r\n95.7  inches, the shortfall being 24.48 inches.  The\r\n\r\nshortfall  for 1960 was 34.15 inches,  and  we  are,\r\n\r\ntherefore, starting the year 1962 in only a slightly\r\n\r\nbetter position than we did in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levels and capacity of all our reservoirs are\r\n\r\nbelow normal, particularly those in Johore. In order\r\n\r\nto  improve the Johore stocks and to take  advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  rainfall distribution, more  water  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  drawn  off  from  the  Singapore  reservoirs.\r\n\r\nHowever,  present total stocks in all the reservoirs\r\n\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n MacRitchie, shortage        219.6 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Peirce, shortage            101.3 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Seletar, shortage           75.2 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Gunong Pulai, shortage       615 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Pontian, shortage          1,351 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  total capacity of all these five reservoirs  is\r\n\r\n5,856  million, and we have at the present moment  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  2,362  million.

It remains to be seen if  the\r\n\r\nremaining  period of the current monsoon will  bring\r\n\r\nsufficient  rainfall to make up this deficiency.  Up\r\n\r\nto  the present, the monsoon has not brought as much\r\n\r\nrain as we had hoped and expected. I am advised that\r\n\r\nit  would  be imprudent to lift rationing altogether\r\n\r\nas  then  there  would be the danger  of  having  to\r\n\r\nreintroduce it more severely later in the  year.  We\r\n\r\ncan better decide on when to stop the rationing when\r\n\r\nwe  know  our  exact position after  the  North-East\r\n\r\nMonsoon is over in a few weeks' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since Friday the 5th of January, a less\r\n\r\nstringent  water rationing programme  was  put  into\r\n\r\neffect by which there is rationing only twice a week\r\n\r\nin  the  mornings, instead of three times a week  in\r\n\r\nthe  mornings and afternoons. The only exception  is\r\n\r\nin  Zone  7  because, being an industrial  area  and\r\n\r\nincluding the Harbour Board, it is rationed  once  a\r\n\r\nweek on Sundays only. If the rain continues for  the\r\n\r\nremainder  of the monsoon to fall as heavily  as  it\r\n\r\nhas  fallen  in the last few days and our capacities\r\n\r\nare  brought  up  to normal, we can probably  resume\r\n\r\nfull supplies by the end of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of discontinuing rationing on public\r\n\r\nholidays,  such  as  Christmas,  will  continue  for\r\n\r\nThaipusam, Chinese New Year, Han Raya Puasa and  all\r\n\r\nthe  other  holidays if rationing is still necessary\r\n\r\nby then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Prime  Minister  is  aware  that   the\r\n\r\nstandpipes  are  made differently.  Some  standpipes\r\n\r\ncannot be conveniently let running. They are made in\r\n\r\nsuch  a way that unless you press the nob water does\r\n\r\nnot flow. That is good because it ensures no wastage\r\n\r\nof  water.  But there are some standpipes where  you\r\n\r\njust  turn  on the tap and water flows, and  if  the\r\n\r\nlast  man takes the water and does not turn it  off,\r\n\r\nthe  water runs until some good Samaritan  goes  and\r\n\r\nturns  it off. This happens in quite a lot of  areas\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Is the Prime Minister aware that this\r\n\r\nis  happening? Would he consider taking steps to see\r\n\r\nthat  water  is  not wasted and that  the  taps  are\r\n\r\ninstalled in such a way that water is not wasted  by\r\n\r\nthe standpipes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is\r\n\r\na   city  full  of  capable  and  apt,  particularly\r\n\r\ningenious, people. I have been assured by the people\r\n\r\nwho contrive these mechanical devices that there  is\r\n\r\nalmost  no conceivable method of manipulation  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  fashioned or modelled which someone cannot,\r\n\r\nwith   equal  ingenuity,  contrive  to  keep   under\r\n\r\npressure and water flowing for a small charge. If we\r\n\r\nspend  our time in creating more business for  those\r\n\r\nwho  make these counter appliances, then I am afraid\r\n\r\nthe problem would still remain unsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Mountbatten might like to\r\n\r\nput  this  picture in perspective.  The  consumption\r\n\r\nfrom the standpipe is seven million gallons per day,\r\n\r\nabout  ten per cent of the total consumption of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the island. Our water shortage last  year\r\n\r\nwas  something quite out of proportion to the saving\r\n\r\nthat  could conceivably have been brought  about  by\r\n\r\npreventing  wastage. I am not suggesting that  there\r\n\r\nis not one or two million gallons of waste everyday.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would be grateful if, apart from just  vague\r\n\r\nand   broad  suggestions,  something  concrete   and\r\n\r\npositive  could be brought to the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nWater  Engineer.  It  has been  suggested  that  one\r\n\r\ndecisive  method  to  enforce economy  is  the  coin\r\n\r\nsystem.  If  somebody has got to put a coin  into  a\r\n\r\nmeter before the water begins to run,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  we  can be almost certain that there  will  be\r\n\r\nsomebody  to receive every ounce of the  water  that\r\n\r\ndrips  out before the coin runs out. However,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold - my  colleagues and I - that it is an  unsocialist\r\n\r\npractice to sell water. Therefore, the plan  is  not\r\n\r\nbeing  proceeded  with, if someone can  contrive  to\r\n\r\ngive  consumers of water an incentive to be  at  the\r\n\r\nreceiving  end of the tap to ensure that nothing  is\r\n\r\nwasted,   the  Water  Engineer  would   be   greatly\r\n\r\nindebted,   and,  I  am  quite  sure,   a   suitable\r\n\r\ncommendation would be given and awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer\r\n\r\nto  that  is  the  usual question of education.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has tried to educate the public by having\r\n\r\nposters all over the place to tell them not to waste\r\n\r\nwater. Would the Prime Minister consider looking  at\r\n\r\nthose  posters  and consulting the audio-visual  aid\r\n\r\nexperts? Sir, any audio-visual aid expert will  tell\r\n\r\nhim  that  the  posters are asking people  to  waste\r\n\r\nwater.

If  that  is   a   correct\r\n\r\nassumption, how then does the Prime Minister hope to\r\n\r\nbuild up his 100 per cent capacity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I was saying, every year we\r\n\r\nfill  up  the  stocks  over the  monsoon  period  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  December, January and sometimes  part  of\r\n\r\nFebruary.  With the 5,800 million gallons  in  hand,\r\n\r\nand  the annual rainfall, we are then safely through\r\n\r\nthe  whole  year without any question of  rationing,\r\n\r\nprovided  of course nothing catastrophic happens  to\r\n\r\nthe rainfall. Last year, 1961, we started off with a\r\n\r\nshortfall of 34 inches of rain. May I just refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  exact  figure? The shortfall in 1960 was  34.15\r\n\r\ninches.  We started off the year with about  50  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  our water stock. It was in the expectation\r\n\r\nthat  the rainfall for the year 1961 would be normal\r\n\r\nthat  neither  the Water Engineer nor  anybody  else\r\n\r\nconsidered taking any steps at all. But by June,  it\r\n\r\nbecame  obvious that the rainfall was already  short\r\n\r\nfor  the  first half and was likely to continue.  We\r\n\r\nran  into  a  drought. There was water rationing  by\r\n\r\nAugust.  I  could lift it straightaway  without  any\r\n\r\nserious difficulty. But we would all be running  the\r\n\r\nrisk  that if the rain does not come as normal, that\r\n\r\nmeans  95.7 inches, the yearly average for 86 years,\r\n\r\nbut  is  as low as either in 1960 or 1961,  then  by\r\n\r\nAugust we may be in trouble. Whereas if we hold  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  on probably by the end of January,  if  the\r\n\r\nrains continue in the last few days as they have - the\r\n\r\nrainfall being sometimes on one day three inches  in\r\n\r\none  continuous fall of 24 hours -  then we can safely\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  have done all that human  beings  can\r\n\r\npossibly  do in such a situation before we open  all\r\n\r\nthe  taps. I think we shall be reproaching ourselves\r\n\r\nif  we  lift  it  imprudently and at a  later  stage\r\n\r\nenforce inconvenience on everybody, and everybody is\r\n\r\nbuying containers, pots, kettles and pails all  over\r\n\r\nagain.  People  have got used to  the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nrationing - the cycle is twice a week now for mornings\r\n\r\nonly   - and it is more than likely that if the  rains\r\n\r\ncontinue as they have, we shall safely do away\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  rationing for the whole year by the  beginning\r\n\r\nof February.

Now  the  United  Nations   Industrial\r\n\r\nSurvey  Mission  in its Report has again  made  that\r\n\r\nrecommendation. The Mission is convinced that  there\r\n\r\nhave   been  some  instances  of  exports  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  being  dumped into  Singapore  at  prices\r\n\r\nbelow cost, and that there have been other instances\r\n\r\nin which the exports of industries in Singapore have\r\n\r\nbeen discriminated against. Therefore, without anti-dumping legislation, any country can set up  a  high\r\n\r\ntariff  wall against Singapore's products  and  dump\r\n\r\nits exports into Singapore at unfair and destructive\r\n\r\nprices.  This  very vulnerability is psychologically\r\n\r\nunhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, anti-dumping legislation for Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  the  advantage  of  strengthening  the  State's\r\n\r\nbargaining position against that of other  countries\r\n\r\nin  trade  matters. It may also be  advantageous  in\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for  trade  arrangements  with   other\r\n\r\ncountries  for  mutual protection  of  each  other's\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaya already has an anti-dumping Ordinance, and similar legislation for\r\n\r\nSingapore is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New legislation is considered necessary in this\r\n\r\ninstance, because the Control of Imports and Exports\r\n\r\nOrdinance is not suitable for the purposes  outlined\r\n\r\nabove,  and the existing Customs Ordinance does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  for  levying of import duties on  items  on\r\n\r\ngrounds   of  dumping.  With  the  new  legislation,\r\n\r\nadequate countervailing duties can be levied without\r\n\r\nthe  time-consuming processes provided for  in  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The purpose of this Bill  is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat industries in Singapore are not choked off by a\r\n\r\nflood  of  goods dumped into the State at uneconomic\r\n\r\nprices.   Manufacturers  had   complained   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  there  were  instances   of   new\r\n\r\nindustries  that have been established in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  suffered  almost instant  death  because  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  imported products were reduced  just  as\r\n\r\nthese factories commenced production. I am not in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  say  whether these complaints  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers are well founded or not. There was, at\r\n\r\nthe  time  when these alleged offences occurred,  no\r\n\r\nproper  machinery  for  the  investigation  of  such\r\n\r\ncomplaints. The Bill sets out in clause 7 two  tests\r\n\r\nfor  the imposition of countervailing duties.  These\r\n\r\nare that the effect of dumping is such as either  to\r\n\r\ncause  or threaten material injury to an established\r\n\r\nindustry   in   Singapore  or  to  retard   periodic\r\n\r\nestablishment of industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that the powers given under\r\n\r\nthis Bill will be used with care and discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn  an  entrepot economy such as ours, import duties\r\n\r\nshould  be  introduced only when it  is  established\r\n\r\nbeyond doubt that the gain to the State in terms  of\r\n\r\nemployment,  national  income  and  economic  growth\r\n\r\noutweighs  any possible loss to the entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nThe  mere existence of this Bill may itself make any\r\n\r\naction   unnecessary   for   importers,   and    the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers abroad whom they represent would  know\r\n\r\nthat  any  attempt  to destroy Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth by unfair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic practice can be frustrated with ease.

Again and again,\r\n\r\nwe  have  often  heard legitimate requests  for  the\r\n\r\nimposition of duties to protect the establishment or\r\n\r\neven  the  survival of existing industries,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  repeatedly resisted these requests until  very\r\n\r\nrecently,  because we are conscious  that  once  you\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  thin  end of  the  wedge  and  start\r\n\r\nimposing duties on imports, that tradition which  is\r\n\r\nof  such  value  to  us  will slowly  evaporate  and\r\n\r\nSingapore will lose much of its trade and goodwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, Sir, every attempt to\r\n\r\nimpose   duties  on  imports  should  be   carefully\r\n\r\nscrutinised  and  no responsible  government  should\r\n\r\nattempt to introduce measures to that end unless the\r\n\r\ncase  for such measures is overwhelming. Is the case\r\n\r\nfor the provisions of this Bill overwhelming?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Reading of this Bill is moved by the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary and he  tells  us  that  he\r\n\r\nknows of no single instance in which the Ordinance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas utilised in the Federation.

In  those circumstances, it must be obvious  to\r\n\r\nthis House that the conditions do not exist for this\r\n\r\nBill or for the need of this power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary goes on further to say that he hopes - no doubt he has every reason to hope - that the powers here would never be used. In those circumstances, Sir, the powers should never be sought. They are great powers which are given to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara without the\r\n\r\nadvice    of    any    Committee.   We    appreciate\r\n\r\nconstitutionally that it means the Cabinet, but  the\r\n\r\nCabinet can take these decisions without the  advice\r\n\r\nof  any Committee in whom we can place reliance that\r\n\r\nthey  should  view  these matters  from  the  purely\r\n\r\neconomic aspect. We who survive by virtue of serving\r\n\r\nour  neighbours  should never place ourselves  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  whereby our Government could in  a  moment\r\n\r\nwangle or otherwise utilise these provisions against\r\n\r\na neighbouring State. In fairness to the Government,\r\n\r\nSir, they have put in provisions whereby orders made\r\n\r\nunder  this  Bill  when  it is  made  law  would  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  this House so that this  House  would\r\n\r\nhave  scrutiny  of government conduct  in  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  instance.  I must say, Sir,  that  that  very\r\n\r\nfact,  to  my  mind, takes away the sting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions which lead to the exclusive discretion of\r\n\r\nthe Cabinet the decision whether to impose duties or\r\n\r\nnot on the whole range of goods which come into this\r\n\r\narea.  But  I  do  deplore  - and I  speak  not  as  a\r\n\r\nbusinessman but as a citizen who is conscious of the\r\n\r\nlife-blood  of  this  country  in  its  service   in\r\n\r\ncommerce - the action of the Government in seeking  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  Bill  which gives powers  of  imposing\r\n\r\nduties  where the need for such a Bill has not  been\r\n\r\nmade  out, and it is frankly admitted that there  is\r\n\r\nno such need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I listened with\r\n\r\nastonishment  to  the outburst  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson. He said that the Government had admitted that\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  introducing the Bill  has  not  been\r\n\r\nestablished. I think it may be that he misunderstood\r\n\r\nwhat   the   Parliamentary   Secretary   said.   The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary made the point that  in  the\r\n\r\npast  the  Government had received  complaints  from\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  that goods were being  dumped,  as  a\r\n\r\nconsequence  of  which factories had  to  be  closed\r\n\r\ndown.  All that the Parliamentary Secretary said  is\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  absence  of  suitable  machinery  for\r\n\r\ninvestigation,   it  was  not   possible   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment - and he was not referring to  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment but to previous Governments - to  establish\r\n\r\nwhether  or not these complaints are true. They  may\r\n\r\nbe  true,  they may not be true. Until  a  full  and\r\n\r\nthorough  investigation  has  been  made  with   the\r\n\r\nbacking  of  the  law, it is not  possible  to  draw\r\n\r\ndefinite conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Anson's contention that no\r\n\r\ncase  has  been made out for the necessity  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  surely,  Sir, the opinion of experts  of  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank is not to be set aside very lightly,  and\r\n\r\nthey  made this recommendation as early as 1954.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt  when the Member for Anson was Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  State  of  Singapore  - before  that  he  was\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce  - he must have seen and studied\r\n\r\nthe recommendations of the mission despatched by the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank.  Weighty reasons were adduced  in, the\r\n\r\nReport. I do not think such opinion could be lightly\r\n\r\ndismissed  as  unworthy  of  consideration  by   any\r\n\r\ngovernment.  But  more  recently  we  have  had  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  another mission of industrial  experts,\r\n\r\ndespatched by the United Nations this time, and they\r\n\r\nurged  with some emphasis that it was high time  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  implemented the  recommendation  of  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank made as far back as 1954. This is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  principal reasons why the Government  today  is\r\n\r\nseeing this Bill through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone, of course, is aware of the importance of\r\n\r\nthe  free port status of Singapore and no one in his\r\n\r\nsenses would want that free port status\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndestroyed. The Member for Anson did suggest  in  his\r\n\r\nremarks  that  in a moment of anger  the  Government\r\n\r\nmight   impose   retaliatory  measures   against   a\r\n\r\nneighbouring State wherby in that way we destroy the\r\n\r\nfree port status of Singapore. Sir, I can assure the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  that the Government  never  makes  any\r\n\r\nimportant   decision,  in  fact,  never  makes   any\r\n\r\ndecision in a moment of anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also under some misapprehension as to the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  the Bill. He seemed to  be  under  the\r\n\r\nimpression that this Bill empowers the Government to\r\n\r\nlevy import duties on - to quote his own actual words - \"the  whole range of goods\". This Bill does not give\r\n\r\nthe  Government  any  such powers.  The  powers  are\r\n\r\nlimited  to  the  levying  of  import  duties  on  a\r\n\r\nrestricted class of commodities. They are defined, I\r\n\r\nthink, in clause 7 of the Bill. They refer to  goods\r\n\r\nwhich are manufactured in Singapore or are about  to\r\n\r\nbe  so  produced in the State. Therefore, when those\r\n\r\ngoods  are  not manufactured or where  there  is  no\r\n\r\nimmediate  prospect  of  their  manufacture  in  the\r\n\r\nState, the powers given in this Bill do not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, while we have been able in the past century\r\n\r\nor  more  to grow or prosper because of the services\r\n\r\nbeing performed as a free port and the emporium  for\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia,  it  is  now  getting  obvious  to\r\n\r\neveryone  that  this trade is an entrepot  trade  by\r\n\r\nitself. If we are not able to expand fast enough  to\r\n\r\nprovide increasing employment and a growing national\r\n\r\nincome for our rapidly increasing population, we are\r\n\r\ntherefore compelled - and by \"we\" I do not mean merely\r\n\r\nthis  Government, I say the country as  a  whole  is\r\n\r\ncompelled - to ensure its future livelihood  by  other\r\n\r\nmeans. One of the principal measures open to  us  is\r\n\r\nto  rely  on ourselves and our resources to  produce\r\n\r\nthose  goods  which  we are now  importing,  and  to\r\n\r\nproduce, if possible, new goods which we can  export\r\n\r\nto  other countries, thereby yielding income to  the\r\n\r\nState  and  providing employment for our population.\r\n\r\nThis  is a task of considerable magnitude. The whole\r\n\r\nof our future\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprosperity and well-being will depend on whether the\r\n\r\ncountry as a whole can achieve success in this\r\n\r\nendeavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House is one of those very\r\n\r\nnecessary  measures which we must take if we  decide\r\n\r\nto accept accelerated industrialisation as a serious\r\n\r\nobjective of our endeavours. Many other things  will\r\n\r\nhave  to be done. Perhaps some of these will require\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts,  amounting to  sacrifices  on  our\r\n\r\npart, if we are to succeed in the great effort  that\r\n\r\nlies ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all we can say at this moment is this: that the\r\n\r\nGovernment must have these powers to ensure that the\r\n\r\nnew  industries which are established  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  have  reasonable security against dumping  from\r\n\r\nforeign sources. At the same time, we must take into\r\n\r\naccount the demands of the free port, and where  any\r\n\r\nparticular instance of a request for the levying  of\r\n\r\ncountervailing duties arises, the Government will be\r\n\r\nin  a position to make the necessary calculations of\r\n\r\nprofit  and  loss to strike a proper balance  sheet,\r\n\r\nand, after all relevant factors have been taken into\r\n\r\naccount,  to  make  the  proper  decision   in   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Ramaswamy].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The figure \"1961\" will be altered to \"1962\" as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, lines 8 to 10, to leave out the whole\r\n\r\nof sub-clause (1) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sub-clause (1) refers to the\r\n\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concluded  at\r\n\r\nGeneva  in 1947.

Members of this House may wish  to  know  the\r\n\r\nbrief history of the principal Ordinance which  this\r\n\r\nBill  proposes  to  wind up. The War  Risks  (Goods)\r\n\r\nInsurance  Ordinance was introduced in 1941  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to insuring goods in Singapore (then a British\r\n\r\nColony),  against certain risks in time  of  war.  A\r\n\r\nsimilar  Ordinance with the same intention was  also\r\n\r\nintroduced in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War Risks (Goods) Insurance Ordinance required\r\n\r\npersons  and companies holding stocks of  goods  for\r\n\r\nsale  worth  $10,000 or more to take  up  War  Risks\r\n\r\n(Goods)   Insurance  policies.  The  policies   were\r\n\r\nobtainable   from  those  insurance   companies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation of Malaya  which  were\r\n\r\naccredited  agents of the Board of  Management.  The\r\n\r\nlatter  body was set up under the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nWar Risks (Goods) Insurance Ordinance. It controlled\r\n\r\nand  managed  the funds collected from  premiums  on\r\n\r\ninsurance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicies  for  goods insurable under the  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  policies covered the goods against damage, loss\r\n\r\nand  seizure through enemy action. Goods  that  were\r\n\r\ninsurable included rubber, tin, clothing, provisions\r\n\r\nand other merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1946, the Board of Management under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was reconstituted to register claims  and\r\n\r\nto pay compensation to those cases that were proved.\r\n\r\nSince 1947, no claims of payment under the War Risks\r\n\r\n(Goods) Insurance Fund Ordinance have been reported,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  apparent  that no  further  claims  are\r\n\r\nexpected.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  that  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance be wound up. However,  in  doing\r\n\r\nso,  no  further  expenditure  of  public  money  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be incurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is a straightforward one\r\n\r\nand  the  provisions  in it are  mainly  procedural.\r\n\r\nClause  4  provides that within a further period  of\r\n\r\nthree  months from the coming into operation of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the Board of Management can continue  to\r\n\r\napply  the  Fund  in  the  payments  of  outstanding\r\n\r\nclaims. Should there be a dispute in respect of  any\r\n\r\nclaims,  the amount of the claim shall be paid  into\r\n\r\ncourt  or other arrangements made, as deemed fit  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board  of Management, after obtaining  approval\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister. At the end of  the  three-month\r\n\r\nperiod from the coming into operation of this  Bill,\r\n\r\nthe  unexpended balance and assets of the  Fund  (if\r\n\r\nany) shall be deposited with the Accountant-General,\r\n\r\nand shall be disposed of as directed by the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong  and the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,  as\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in  clause 5 of the  Bill.  Clause  6\r\n\r\nrequires   that  the  accounts  of  the   Board   of\r\n\r\nManagement be audited by the Director of  Audit  and\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  Government  Gazette.  After  the\r\n\r\npublication  of the Board's accounts, the  Board  of\r\n\r\nManagement shall be wound up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite appreciate\r\n\r\nthe desire of the Government to wind up this fund.

You\r\n\r\nwill see that in clause 3, all actions are barred as\r\n\r\nfrom  the  date  of  coming into operation  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  both against the Government and  against\r\n\r\nany member of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, however, suggests that if there is any\r\n\r\ndisagreement  in respect of claims, monies  will  be\r\n\r\npaid  into  court, which does suggest that  one  can\r\n\r\nthen   make  a  claim  in  court  contrary  to   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 3. It may well be that  I  have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood the purpose of these clauses. I  would\r\n\r\nlike a clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would furthermore inquire as to what is the\r\n\r\nextent  of  the  fund at the present moment.  Surely\r\n\r\nthis House is entitled to basic information when  it\r\n\r\nis  sought to wind up a fund. What is the  total  of\r\n\r\nthe  claims outstanding? Furthermore, Sir, they seek\r\n\r\nindemnity  provisions  under  clause  10.  You  will\r\n\r\nnotice that fortunately clause 10 does not come into\r\n\r\noperation forthwith. But by virtue of the provisions\r\n\r\nof  clause  1,  sub-clause (2), it  will  come  into\r\n\r\noperation  at  a later date. It is my  earnest  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will not seek its introduction\r\n\r\nwithout giving an opportunity to all those who  seek\r\n\r\nto  make  claims, to make them before that indemnity\r\n\r\napplies. But in any event, Sir, this House again  is\r\n\r\nentitled to know. You are seeking to give indemnity.\r\n\r\nAre   there   any  claims  at  the  present   moment\r\n\r\noutstanding? Are there any claims anticipated?

The proviso of payment into court  is\r\n\r\nnot  applicable,  and furthermore  an  indemnity  is\r\n\r\nsought without giving this House information  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are  any  outstanding  or  potential\r\n\r\nclaims.  The Parliamentary Secretary has  been  good\r\n\r\nenough  to say he will give me this information.  He\r\n\r\nmisunderstands the whole procedure,  if  I  may  say\r\n\r\nwith  respect, Mr Speaker.

Members can observe from the Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement,  this Repeal Bill seeks to wind  up  the 1946  Rehabilitation Loan Ordinance, 1947,  and  to\r\n\r\nclose  the  accounts arising from it. The principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance   was   introduced   to   sanction    the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  $50 million raised during  1946-47\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of the Loan Ordinance, 1946.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $50 million was raised to meet financial\r\n\r\nexpenditure arising out of the Japanese  occupation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya,  as well as to meet the expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthe    economic   rehabilitation   of    Singapore.\r\n\r\nExpenditure for the said purposes has been incurred\r\n\r\nand   there  is,  at  the  moment,  a  balance   of\r\n\r\n$9,439,381.  Out  of  the  balance,   it   is   the\r\n\r\nconsidered  estimation  of the  Accountant-General,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that  only about  $1  million  will  be\r\n\r\nsufficient to meet future outstanding claims. To be\r\n\r\nexact,  the  estimated amount is  $1,117,563.  This\r\n\r\nestimated expenditure will meet outstanding  claims\r\n\r\nwhich  include  arrears  of  pay,  gratuities   and\r\n\r\npensions   to   volunteers  and  their  dependants;\r\n\r\narrears  of  pay  to Government servants  who  were\r\n\r\ninterned;  claims for services rendered  and  goods\r\n\r\nsupplied  prior  to  occupation; pensions,  retired\r\n\r\nallowances, gratuities, and other similar payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As only very small yearly expenditure for these\r\n\r\nclaims is envisaged in future years, little purpose\r\n\r\nis  served in keeping alive the Rehabilitation Loan\r\n\r\nAppropriation  Account. I therefore move  that  the 1946  Rehabilitation Loan Appropriation  Ordinance, 1947,  be  wound up by this Repeal  Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House.  In winding  up  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance, however, provision has been made in  the\r\n\r\nRepeal  Ordinance  to transfer all  the  unexpended\r\n\r\nbalance of monies to the Development Fund and  also\r\n\r\nto  meet  all  future outstanding claims  from  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund of the Annual Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will note that this Repeal\r\n\r\nBill  is  a relatively simple one and has  received\r\n\r\nthe recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Again, Mr Speaker, I rise on a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  principle  and  draw  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`notwithstanding the provisions of .[the principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance] ... all expenditure of moneys  ... shall\r\n\r\nhe deemed to have been lawfully incurred.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why should the Government seek to shut out\r\n\r\ninquiries   that  may  be  necessitated  into   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure?

The intention of  the  Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nremove  uncertainty prevailing in the rubber  market\r\n\r\nas   to  the  validity  of  rubber  contracts.  This\r\n\r\nuncertainty  arose from a decision of the  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal in the case of Mizrahie versus Stanton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNelson.  In  this case, one of the  two  grounds  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the appellant based his appeal was  that  the\r\n\r\ncontracts  which  the plaintiffs as  rubber  brokers\r\n\r\nentered  into on his behalf with third parties  were\r\n\r\nin  no  sense  genuine contracts for  the  sale  and\r\n\r\npurchase   of  rubber  but  were  merely  colourable\r\n\r\ntransactions  entered  into  for  the   purpose   of\r\n\r\nenabling  him to gamble in differences and  as  such\r\n\r\nunenforceable  under section  6  of  the  Civil  Law\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations were made to both the Singapore\r\n\r\nand Federation Governments that amending legislation\r\n\r\nwas  necessary to restore confidence in  the  rubber\r\n\r\nmarket and to remove any doubt as to the legality of\r\n\r\nrubber contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy is founded largely on the\r\n\r\nrubber  trade  and today she is the world's  largest\r\n\r\nrubber  market.  In 1960, trade in rubber  accounted\r\n\r\nfor  about  37  per cent of her total trade.  It  is\r\n\r\nessential,  therefore, that nothing  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\njeopardise the effectiveness of the Singapore rubber\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment would render forward\r\n\r\ncontracts  for the sale or purchase of unascertained\r\n\r\nrubber    by   description   legal   and   therefore\r\n\r\nenforceable.  Legitimate hedging operations  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried on without fear that such contracts would be\r\n\r\ndeclared void. At the same time, reckless and  undue\r\n\r\nspeculation   would  be  curbed  as   the   relevant\r\n\r\ncontracts become enforceable and no defence  can  be\r\n\r\nbrought on the grounds that such contacts are gaming\r\n\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar legal provision is contained in the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya Rubber Exchange (Incorporation)\r\n\r\nAct,  1961, which will soon come into force  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention here that the present Bill is\r\n\r\nlinked to the Rubber Dealers (Amendment) Bill  which\r\n\r\nwill be considered by the House at a later stage.

In this\r\n\r\ncase,  one of the two grounds on which the appellant\r\n\r\nbased  his  appeal was that as he  did  not  hold  a\r\n\r\nlicence  under  the  Rubber  Dealers  Ordinance   to\r\n\r\npurchase rubber, the forward rubber contracts  which\r\n\r\nthe plaintiffs as rubber brokers entered into on his\r\n\r\nbehalf with third parties were illegal and void.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Court expressed no opinion as to\r\n\r\nwhether the contracts were null and void because the\r\n\r\nappellant  did not hold a licence under  the  Rubber\r\n\r\nDealers  Ordinance, sufficient doubt and uncertainty\r\n\r\nhave  been  created which affect confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore rubber market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, it is not clear whether the word\r\n\r\n\"purchase\"  appearing in section 2 of the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nrefers  to  all purchases or only to such  purchases\r\n\r\ncompleted by delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed definition makes it clear that only\r\n\r\npurchases  of specific rubber completed by  delivery\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  be  covered by a  licence  and  that\r\n\r\nforward  contracts for the purchase of unascertained\r\n\r\nrubber  by  description do not require a licence  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurchaser.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  there are in Singapore business firms  who\r\n\r\nindulge  in  the  purchase  of  forward  rubber  for\r\n\r\nlegitimate means for satisfying the requirements  of\r\n\r\npurchasers  in  the  United  Kingdom,  U.S.A.,   and\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  It is a perfectly healthy  business  and\r\n\r\nvital for our economy. There are others who use this\r\n\r\nas  the grand gambling game. Mr Speaker, by putting\r\n\r\na  small  deposit  you can purchase  forward  rubber\r\n\r\nthree  months forward, and during those three months\r\n\r\nhope  to  make a fortune if it rises by  one  cent - I\r\n\r\nthink you are supposed to make more than $1,000 on a\r\n\r\n25-ton  contract,  and  so on  it  goes.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nspeaking  in  vacuo, Mr Speaker. I know  of  actual\r\n\r\ncases  where even housewives who do not know a  bale\r\n\r\nof  RSS.1  from  a tin of rubbish, purchase  forward\r\n\r\ncontracts  at  the  instigation  of  rubber  brokers\r\n\r\nseeking  to get their commission, being promised  an\r\n\r\nEl Dorado of wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill seeks to legalise large-scale gambling. I would like to put it a little differently, Mr Speaker. If there is a legitimate business in dealings in rubber, every firm can easily take out a licence and pay for it. There is no difficulty at all there. It is a question of a formal application for the purchase of a licence, and its annual fee is a very moderate sum. Even big\r\n\r\nfirms may wish to indulge in gambling - if they  want\r\n\r\nto, it is their own affair. But I do urge this House\r\n\r\nand  I do plead with this House not to open the door\r\n\r\nto  large-scale  gambling for small people  as  this\r\n\r\nBill would. It has been proved in the past. Sir, the\r\n\r\nrubber  brokers cannot really be blamed  very  much.\r\n\r\nThey  are  there to make profits, and  if  they  can\r\n\r\npersuade you to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuy  rubber  even  if they know  you  are  going  to\r\n\r\nlose - they  hope  you  will  make   - they  get   their\r\n\r\ncommission.  It is a question of the effect  on  the\r\n\r\nordinary  citizen. There are many of  them  who  had\r\n\r\nbeen involved in this grand gamble and who have  had\r\n\r\ntheir  fingers burnt and who have not had the  money\r\n\r\nto  go  to court like Mizrahie had and fought it  to\r\n\r\nthe  end. Those people were cornered and pauperised.\r\n\r\nLet  us recognize that the rubber brokers have  very\r\n\r\nlittle  mercy  when it is a question  of  owing  the\r\n\r\nmoney  on  these contracts. They seek not to  extort\r\n\r\nbut  to compel payment of what is their lawful  due.\r\n\r\nBut  I  say  with  respect, Mr Speaker,  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment, which calls itself socialist,  that  all\r\n\r\nof  us, who have any respect for the principle  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  seek to protect the common man  from  an\r\n\r\nunhappy propensity, to gambling in so far as  it  is\r\n\r\nlegitimate,  instead of bringing up  this  Bill,  we\r\n\r\nshould   instead   make   it   definite   that   all\r\n\r\nunascertained rubber by description is  included  in\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"purchase\" and is not excluded.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat we should do in order to protect the small  man\r\n\r\nfrom  an  organised business which seeks to  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit  out of its commission. Also at times let  us\r\n\r\nremember that brokers, jobbers themselves, in  their\r\n\r\nown  names  or through the facade of their  friends,\r\n\r\npurchase rubber in the hope of its going up or  sell\r\n\r\nrubber in the hope of its going down; and then  when\r\n\r\nthey   are  caught  they  seek  to  unload  on   the\r\n\r\nunsuspecting victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if the Government is really\r\n\r\nconscious  of what it was doing in this  matter,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it was merely seeking to please its friends\r\n\r\nand  did  not  understand the extent of the  dangers\r\n\r\nwhich it seeks to unleash upon the people. But I  do\r\n\r\nplead with the Government to reconsider this Bill, a\r\n\r\nBill which authorises gaming on a tragic and ruinous\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson may have a good case if only he will  put\r\n\r\nit  in  proper perspective and refrain from  grossly\r\n\r\nexaggerating  or  distorting the  picture.  Now,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, there is gambling in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   rubber  market.  There  is  gambling  in   any\r\n\r\nextensive  producing market. There may  be  isolated\r\n\r\ncases  of  private  individuals who  gamble  in  the\r\n\r\nrubber  market. They may gamble in the stock market.\r\n\r\nThey  may gamble in any other markets or indulge  in\r\n\r\nvarious forms of gambling. Is it seriously suggested\r\n\r\nthat  just  to  protect a small  number  of  foolish\r\n\r\npeople - I do not agree with the Member for Anson that\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  extensive social  menace - in  order  to\r\n\r\nprevent  a  few  foolish people from  getting  their\r\n\r\nfingers burnt in transactions of which they have  no\r\n\r\nunderstanding, we are to put the rubber market in  a\r\n\r\nstraitjacket?  That is what it amounts  to,  because\r\n\r\nthe  real  difficulty is how you are to  distinguish\r\n\r\nthe  small  operator  from  the  big  operator,  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  operator  from the non-business  operator.\r\n\r\nOne  certain criterion is set out. Once you  have  a\r\n\r\nGovernment board that controls transactions, then  I\r\n\r\nsay  the  functioning of the rubber market,  if  not\r\n\r\nreduced to a standstill, will certainly cease and be\r\n\r\ncrippled.  The  volume of operations in  the  rubber\r\n\r\nmarket  is  tremendous. This is the  largest  rubber\r\n\r\nmarket  in  the  world. By and  large,  transactions\r\n\r\nconform  to certain standards of commercial  ethics,\r\n\r\nand  the volume of downright gambling undertaken  by\r\n\r\nignorant people is simply marginal. But to say  that\r\n\r\nthis Bill unleashes on the people a new danger,  and\r\n\r\nat  the  same time say that this has been  happening\r\n\r\nall the time is surely inconsistent. If we unleash a\r\n\r\nnew  danger, it means that housewives may enter  the\r\n\r\nrubber  market, and by introducing this Bill we  are\r\n\r\ninviting  housewives to do so. I do not  agree  that\r\n\r\nthe  remedies proposed by the Member for Anson  meet\r\n\r\nthe  case.  The purpose is quite simple.  It  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that contracts in forward purchases, dealings\r\n\r\nin  what  is  called paper rubber  can  be  enforced\r\n\r\nlegally,  and, indeed, if such were to be the  case,\r\n\r\nthen  perhaps there would be less temptation on  the\r\n\r\npart of people not familiar with the workings of the\r\n\r\nrubber market to try their luck there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the problem posed to the Government as a\r\n\r\nresult  of the decision of the court case,  although\r\n\r\nsimple in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciple,  involves  quite a  number  of  intricate\r\n\r\nissues;  and  one of the reasons why the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  taken such a long time before it presents  this\r\n\r\nBill  to  the  House  is that we  have  carried  out\r\n\r\nconsultations  not  only with the  rubber  trade  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but also with our opposite numbers in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation. The solution that they\r\n\r\nhave  arrived  at after long months of  deliberation\r\n\r\nare the two Bills which are now before the House. As\r\n\r\nI  have  said,  their  purpose  is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntransactions  in the largest rubber  market  in  the\r\n\r\nworld have a proper legal standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  says  that common people and  housewives  all\r\n\r\ndeal  in rubber contracts. I beg to differ from  his\r\n\r\nview. Only people who know the rubber trade deal  in\r\n\r\nthese  contracts.  Maybe there  are  a  few  foolish\r\n\r\npeople  who  venture into this kind of  business.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to tell the House that the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has  also  passed similar legislation  which\r\n\r\nwill come into force very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that these two Bills - this one as\r\n\r\nwell  as the Civil Law (Amendment) Bill which I have\r\n\r\njust moved - only enable legitimate hedging operations\r\n\r\nto  be  carried out without fear that such contracts\r\n\r\nwould   be   declared  void.  Reckless   and   undue\r\n\r\nspeculation   would  be  curbed  as   the   relevant\r\n\r\ncontracts become enforceable and no defence  can  be\r\n\r\nbrought  on  the  grounds that  such  contracts  are\r\n\r\ngaming   contracts.

I am glad to hear\r\n\r\nit.  The question is, what difficulty will there  be\r\n\r\non  the part of a legitimate rubber dealer in taking\r\n\r\nout  a  licence? None at all. That the Minister  has\r\n\r\nnot  answered. If you make it necessary for a person\r\n\r\nto  take out a licence before there can be any  sale\r\n\r\nof  rubber to him or any sale of rubber by  him,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  deemed to be enforceable; then you  would\r\n\r\nprotect the common man from being made the victim of\r\n\r\nthe  rubber broker. I am not seeking to limit in any\r\n\r\nway  the rubber trade. All I am seeking to do is  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the  rubber trade to legitimate traders.  Let\r\n\r\nthem gamble if they will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary completely misunderstands the Bill, if I may say so with respect. It does not protect anyone from gambling losses. It does not only protect legitimate hedging of purchase and sale, but it also protects all gambling transactions as well as legitimate transactions. And it is Unnecessary. All I ask this Government to consider is that it should leave it at\r\n\r\nthe  position where a licence is required before you\r\n\r\nindulge  in  the  purchase and sale of  rubber.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has said, \"How can you exaggerate  so  much\r\n\r\nas  to say that we are opening the floodgates  of  a\r\n\r\ngrave  danger when you say it has existed  already?\"\r\n\r\nAgain  he  mis-understands  me,  Mr  Speaker.

Now we are going to  wipe  out  the\r\n\r\nMizrahie  judgment. The floodgates  are  there.  The\r\n\r\npoor  man, the simple man who is going to  be  told,\r\n\r\n\"You  are  earning $200 or $300 as a teacher.  Come,\r\n\r\ngive  me  your life savings of $5,000, and  in  five\r\n\r\ndays  I  will give you $50,000.\" Maybe you can  make\r\n\r\n$50,000. But, on the other hand, the probability  is\r\n\r\nthat  you  will lose it. And there is no protection.\r\n\r\nBut if the same teacher were to be told, \"Take out a\r\n\r\nlicence  first.  Become a rubber dealer,\"  he  would\r\n\r\nthink twice. All I am asking the Government to do is\r\n\r\nto leave the protection of the Mizrahie judgment for\r\n\r\nthe commoner, by making it necessary for dealers  in\r\n\r\nrubber to have licences.

The  first\r\n\r\nmatter  is  the question of the meaning of  political\r\n\r\nnepotism. I want no misunderstanding on this  aspect.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  seek, Mr Speaker, is not a re-hash of  what\r\n\r\nhas   transpired  before.  Nepotism  is   favouritism\r\n\r\ntowards   one's  relations.  Political  nepotism   is\r\n\r\nfavouritism arising from political relations.  It  is\r\n\r\nin  this  sense, Mr Speaker, and in this sense  only\r\n\r\nthat the words are used in this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly calls upon the Government to\r\n\r\nappoint  a  Commission of Inquiry consisting  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  High Court Judge and two  retired  Civil\r\n\r\nServants  to  investigate  political  nepotism   and\r\n\r\nimproper  political  interference  with  the   Civil\r\n\r\nService  and  employees of Statutory bodies  and  to\r\n\r\nmake recommendations.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter - in his speech on the Privileges Bill\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister indicated that he was under  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  I  brought up this  motion  at  the\r\n\r\nrequest of the Barisan Sosialis. This is not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have for a long time been troubled by a growing\r\n\r\nimpression,  perhaps from minor things in  themselves\r\n\r\ninadequate,  but  cumulative,  leaving   an   unhappy\r\n\r\nimpression  that the P.A.P. Government  is  utilising\r\n\r\nits position and its ministerial responsibilities  to\r\n\r\nplant P.A.P. men in key positions. When the strike of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association employees took place, which\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  like  good  capitalist  employers,\r\n\r\nrefuse to term a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrike  because the workers have no union, it became\r\n\r\napparent   that  a  vast  number  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation employees were P.A.P. members  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  indulging  in  political  activities  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  with a view to  shepherding  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  our  youth  towards  the  P.A.P. as  a\r\n\r\npolitical    Party,   interlanded   with   perfectly\r\n\r\nlegitimate activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because of this that I tabled my motion.

Therefore, it\r\n\r\nhas been one of my trials at various times since  my\r\n\r\nelection   to  seek  the  assistance  of  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties in this Assembly and the assistance  of  the\r\n\r\nindependent  Member for Joo Chiat to second  motions\r\n\r\nof mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In fact, Mr Speaker, in the  case\r\n\r\nof  one  Opposition Party, it was made clear  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  they would refuse to support or second - not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of supporting in the House but  supporting\r\n\r\nin  writing any motion which is not brought up by  a\r\n\r\nMember of their own Party -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It was  tabled\r\n\r\nfor  the  16th  November, and if you  remember,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  it was very pertinent to this  motion.  It\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To ask the Prime Minister to state the number of\r\n\r\npersons  appointed since 1st June 1959 by  Ministers\r\n\r\nto  public  bodies, the names of such  persons,  the\r\n\r\noffices  to  which  they were appointed,  and  their\r\n\r\npolitical affiliations, if known.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was good enough to send me a list of 527 persons appointed by the Ministers to various public bodies since 1st June, 1959. I ask\r\n\r\nthe  House to appreciate that the list which is  now \r\n\r\nprinted  and which they have is the list of  persons \r\n\r\nappointed by Ministers in pursuance of their  powers\r\n\r\nand does not include a list of employees employed by\r\n\r\nvarious  statutory  bodies, and therefore  does  not\r\n\r\ninclude the vast numbers of P.A.P. members who  were\r\n\r\ntaken   into   the   employment  of   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, or a list of the employees of the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Prime Minister, however - though he gave me  the  list - did  not  give  the party affiliations  of  the  persons  appointed by the Ministers. If you remember \r\n\r\nthe reply to the question - in order not to misquote  - \r\n\r\nI quote in full:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The number of persons appointed since June, 1959,\r\n\r\nby  Ministers to public bodies is 527.  Their  names\r\n\r\nand  the  offices to which they were  appointed  are\r\n\r\ngiven  in  the  list tabled in this Assembly.  Their\r\n\r\npolitical  affiliations, if any, are of no relevance\r\n\r\nto  the  duties they perform. Some are known  to  be\r\n\r\nmembers, and some are publicly reputed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   members,  of  both  the  Government  party  and\r\n\r\nOpposition political parties in this Assembly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have sought assistance to\r\n\r\nascertain  who amongst these 527 shown in  the  list\r\n\r\nwere  P.A.P. members and I shall give you a detailed\r\n\r\nanalysis.  But  before I do so, I want  to  make  it\r\n\r\nquite  clear that it is not my suggestion  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not appoint a member of its  Party\r\n\r\nto  public office just because he is a member of the\r\n\r\nParty. Quite naturally, it can and does happen  that\r\n\r\na  member  of the political Party in office  is,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of his own merits, worthy of appointment to a\r\n\r\npublic  office.  I  recognise  that  those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  go through the travail  of  dedicating\r\n\r\nthemselves to the ideals of a political Party  often\r\n\r\nare  sincere  in their dedication to public  service\r\n\r\neven  though  I  may not agree with their  political\r\n\r\nviews or their political conduct. But what I do say,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, is that the number involved is  of\r\n\r\nsuch a character that it legitimately raises a query\r\n\r\nas  to whether, in fact, such appointments were made\r\n\r\nnot  merely on merit but took into account the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the persons in question were P.A.P. members  in\r\n\r\npursuance of a policy to seek control of all aspects\r\n\r\nof public life for party ends. That is the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as to the list given by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, I shall be giving the numbers of those who\r\n\r\nwere   P.A.P. members  at  the   time   of   their\r\n\r\nappointment,  which is a material time  to  consider\r\n\r\nwhat  the Government had in mind. The fact that some\r\n\r\nof  them  have  since defected  is  not  a  relevant\r\n\r\nconsideration.  The question is,  were  they  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers at the time of their appointment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the list in the order in which it\r\n\r\nwas  sent  to  me - and I trust I  will  not  try  the\r\n\r\npatience of the Assembly - this is somewhat important.\r\n\r\nThe  first  is the Ministry of National Development.\r\n\r\nThe  Board  of  Management  of  Nature  Reserves - one\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Assemblyman out of five trustees  appointed.\r\n\r\nThe   Board   of  Trustees,  Singapore   Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust - one person appointed, not a P.A.P. member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Housing and Development Board - Chairman and  one\r\n\r\nother  member were P.A.P. members out of a total  of\r\n\r\nfive   appointed.  The  Board  of  Architects -   nine\r\n\r\npersons appointed, no P.A.P. members. It seems  that\r\n\r\nthere are no architects amongst the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the Ministry of Finance. The Malayan\r\n\r\nBoard of Income Tax and Income Tax Board of Review - I\r\n\r\ncan  trace  no  P.A.P. members.  The  Property  Tax\r\n\r\nValuation   Review  Board - I  can  trace  no   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers.  The  Industrial Promotions Board - only  one\r\n\r\nmember  appointed, not a P.A.P. member. The Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board - one member is a P.A.P. Assemblyman\r\n\r\nout  of  six appointments to the Board. The Property\r\n\r\nTax  Advisory  Committee - all six members,  including\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman, appointed to this Committee were  and\r\n\r\nare P.A.P. Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the Ministry of Culture. The National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Fund Committee - this Committee consisted  of\r\n\r\none  Chairman and nominees from various bodies.  The\r\n\r\nChairman  was a P.A.P. member of this Assembly.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  was dissolved in February.  The  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Trust - the Chairman is a P.A.P. Assemblyman,\r\n\r\nand  there is one other P.A.P. member out of a total\r\n\r\nof  11 members. The National Library Board - no P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmember that I can trace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the Prime Minister's Office. The Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation Board -  11 are P.A.P. members out of  30\r\n\r\nappointments  to  the  Board.  Of  these  11  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers,  8 were P.A.P. Assemblymen, none  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties. The Urban  and  Rural  Services\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee - everyone of the  15  members,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Chairman of this  Committee,  was  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Assemblyman. Four of these appointments  were\r\n\r\nrevoked on 21st July. 1961, the day after the debate\r\n\r\nin this Assembly, and these four are all now Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Assemblymen. The Board of Management of the\r\n\r\nMalay  Settlements of Jalan Eunos, West Coast  Road,\r\n\r\nAyer  Gemuroh  and Sembawang - I can trace  no  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmember, and it seems obvious that the Malays can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotect  themselves  from P.A.P. infiltration.  The\r\n\r\nLight Dues Board and the Pilot Board - I can trace  no\r\n\r\nP.A.P. member.  The Singapore Telephone  Board - only\r\n\r\none  P.A.P. member  out of five  appointments.  The\r\n\r\nOmnibus Services Licensing Authority - I can trace  no\r\n\r\nP.A.P. member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour. The Panel of Advisers to\r\n\r\nthe   Juvenile  Magistrate's  Court   - three   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  out  of 15 appointments. The Parole  Board,\r\n\r\nGimson   School   - one  P.A.P. member  out  of   ten\r\n\r\nappointments. The Probation Committee -  I  can  trace\r\n\r\nno  P.A.P. member. The Advisory  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Amateur Sports Council  - all  members  are\r\n\r\nnominees  of sports organisations, and I could  find\r\n\r\nno   P.A.P. member  except,  I   understand,   the\r\n\r\nSecretary, but I wish to make it quite clear that  I\r\n\r\nmake  no  issue  of  this as he himself  was  not  a\r\n\r\nnominee of the Government but a nominee of a  public\r\n\r\nsports  body. The Board of Visitors, Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nHomes and Institutions  - five P.A.P. members of  whom\r\n\r\nthree are members of the Assembly out of a total  of\r\n\r\n35  appointments. One of these, Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nan Assembly woman on the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health. The Leprosy Board - one\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Assemblyman out of four members. The Midwives\r\n\r\nBoard   - no  P.A.P. members that I  can  trace.  The\r\n\r\nNursing  Board - the Chairman is a P.A.P. Assemblyman.\r\n\r\nThe  Pharmacy Board - no P.A.P. affiliation that I can\r\n\r\ntrace.  The  Trafalgar Home - I can  trace  no  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmember. The Woodbridge Hospital Visitors - two  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers out of 15 appointments. The Medical Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil - one  P.A.P. member out of  13  appointments;\r\n\r\nthat one had been previously appointed, and I am not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  his political  affiliation  was  a\r\n\r\nfactor  in  his  appointment. The  Poisons  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  - only one out of five appointments. Again,\r\n\r\nhe  is a person who seems eminently fitted to be  on\r\n\r\nthe  Committee, and I am not suggesting that in this\r\n\r\nparticular  case his political affiliation  affected\r\n\r\nhis appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law.

The Education Finance\r\n\r\nBoard  -  no  P.A.P. member  that  I  can  trace.   The\r\n\r\nEducation Advisory Committee - 3 out of 16 are  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers,  one  of them an Assemblyman.  The  Lembaga\r\n\r\nGerakan Pelajaran Dewasa - the Chairman and five other\r\n\r\nmembers are P.A.P. members including one Assemblyman\r\n\r\n(six out of a total of 14 appointments).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs.

The\r\n\r\nHotels Licensing Board - the Chairman and three others\r\n\r\nout  of  a  total of nine appointments  were  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers. The Chairman resigned; the present Chairman\r\n\r\nis  not,  in so far as I can trace, associated  with\r\n\r\nany   political  Party.

How many  of\r\n\r\nthe members of the Board are P.A.P. members?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My information is that this Board was constituted\r\n\r\nin  1960 and the People's Association took over  the\r\n\r\nmanagement and the running of all existing community\r\n\r\ncentres and is now in charge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  about  60  community centres, and of  these  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming  membership of  the  Board  are  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know from information from the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees are P.A.P. members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Work Brigade, I am informed\r\n\r\nthat  the  Camp Supervisors who supervise  all  nine\r\n\r\ncamps are, all three of them, active P.A.P. members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject of the employees, I regret\r\n\r\nto inform the House that I am reliably informed that\r\n\r\nit  has  been the practice of the P.A.P. to  levy  a\r\n\r\nmonthly payment from employees in Government service\r\n\r\nand  in the service of statutory bodies who obtained\r\n\r\ntheir  employment  as a result  of  intervention  by\r\n\r\nMinisters,  P.A.P.

At the time I brought it up,  although \r\n\r\nwe  knew  that  the  P.A.P. sent its  supporters  by\r\n\r\nbuses, we did not know that the P.A.P. was utilising\r\n\r\npublic  funds  for the purpose. But  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nAnson  or  Hong  Lim or any other  election,  it  is\r\n\r\ngrossly  improper for a political Party  to  utilise\r\n\r\npublic  funds entrusted to the Government or to  its\r\n\r\nmembers in this fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subject of the motion by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  and the Member for Upper Serangoon is for  an\r\n\r\ninquiry consisting of at least one High Court  Judge\r\n\r\nand   two  retired  civil  servants  to  investigate\r\n\r\npolitical    nepotism    and   improper    political\r\n\r\ninterference with the civil service and employees of\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies. Sir, there has been no mention  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service whatsoever. May I  ask  in  what\r\n\r\nrespect  the  subject which has  been  touched  upon\r\n\r\ncomes  within  the ambit of this motion?  I  am  not\r\n\r\ntrying  in  any way to conscribe the scope  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate.  In fact, on reading serious the  motion,  I\r\n\r\nwas under the impression that there were going to be\r\n\r\nserious   allegations  made  as  to   misdemeanours,\r\n\r\ncorruption,  and  so on. Therefore,  beforehand,  we\r\n\r\nmoved  an amendment taking into account the  serious\r\n\r\nnature  of  these allegations, that we would  accept\r\n\r\nthis  motion provided evidence would be let.

Therefore, that allegation must be  out  of\r\n\r\norder if we are to debate the motion of which notice\r\n\r\nwas  given, unless the Member can assure me that the\r\n\r\nallegation comes within the ambit of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Mr Speaker, I did not\r\n\r\nthink  it  was necessary to spell it out.

And the purpose of this motion, Sir, is  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the public service from the abuse of  power\r\n\r\nentrusted  to  Ministers. It  is  a  very  important\r\n\r\nprinciple, and that is why it is important  that  we\r\n\r\nappoint a Commission of Inquiry to investigate  into\r\n\r\nthese  fears and suspicions, to ascertain and report\r\n\r\non  the  truth, and to make recommendations for  the\r\n\r\nfuture protection of our civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask for two retired civil servants to be on\r\n\r\nthe  Commission because it is my view that our civil\r\n\r\nservice  has been trained along the right  lines  of\r\n\r\nintegrity    and    independence   from    political\r\n\r\ninterference.

To\r\n\r\nmy  mind, the conduct of officers in Radio Singapore\r\n\r\ngives cause for genuine concern as to the extent  of\r\n\r\nministerial   interference   in   the   departmental\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  responsibility.

We\r\n\r\nare  here  on matters of principle. Mr  Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nseek   to   speak  on  the  general   disquiet   and\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction on the part of the public. It is not\r\n\r\nmerely  allegations that I make or allegations  that\r\n\r\nanother  person  makes  that  I  seek  to   have   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to investigate. I seek to give\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to the people at large, to the civil\r\n\r\nservice, to make their complaints in proper form  to\r\n\r\na  tribunal  which  will hear them  impartially  and\r\n\r\nwhich  will  adjudicate. That is the  simple  issue,\r\n\r\nSir,If  we accept the fact that there is disquiet,\r\n\r\nit  may  be that it is without reason. I am  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  seeking to condemn the Government-if you  will\r\n\r\nnotice  the issue-as seeking to have the appointment\r\n\r\nof  a Commission of Inquiry to investigate a general\r\n\r\ndisquiet  throughout the country with  reference  to\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  this Government in the  particular\r\n\r\nfield  of  interference with the civil  service  and\r\n\r\nwith   employees  of  statutory  bodies.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   says  that  I  have  not  made   specific\r\n\r\nallegations.  I have already made some.  It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat with reference to some other matters, I will be\r\n\r\nable, in due\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  to implement what I have said here, because\r\n\r\nI can assure the Prime Minister and other Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House that there is nothing which I have  said\r\n\r\nhere  which I am not prepared to repeat and,  within\r\n\r\nmy  ability in so far as I can, to amplify before  a\r\n\r\ntribunal if and when it is appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment, it is a curious\r\n\r\namendment.  The first is a simple and  factual  one.\r\n\r\nThey delete the two civil servants. To my mind,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   a  retired  civil  servant  is  eminently\r\n\r\ndesirable to assist, not so much in the question  of\r\n\r\ncondemnation,   but  in  the  question   of   future\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the civil service from  attempts  to\r\n\r\ninterfere  by the overbearing Ministers. I  do  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to recognise the value of having two\r\n\r\nretired civil servants attached to the tribunal  for\r\n\r\npurposes    of   assisting   in   the   making    of\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  I  am very happy  to  notice  that\r\n\r\nthough  there  is an amendment, it  does,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nincorporate  the spirit of my motion  and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does accept. But, Sir, you will notice  a\r\n\r\nlimitation which may well not have been intended. It\r\n\r\nseeks  to limit the investigation of this Commission\r\n\r\nonly  to  the  allegation made  in  this  House,  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  all  allegations  and  those  who  have\r\n\r\nvoiced  those allegations. It may well be that  that\r\n\r\nwas not the intention, and I hope that it is not the\r\n\r\nintention  to  limit  the  Commission's  powers   to\r\n\r\ninvestigation  of allegations of nepotism  that  are\r\n\r\nmade in this House and to shut out the cvil service,\r\n\r\nthe  employees  of statutory bodies and  the  public\r\n\r\nfrom   making   their  appropriate  representations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  Sir,  it says the Commission  will  be\r\n\r\nheld  provided all Members will undertake to  repeat\r\n\r\nthese allegations before the Commission and to  give\r\n\r\nevidence of such allegations on oath or affirmation,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding any provisions in any Standing Order\r\n\r\nor written law. Sir, in so far as I am concerned,  I\r\n\r\nam very happy to give that undertaking. But it seems\r\n\r\nto  me a little absurd, if you will permit me to say\r\n\r\nso,  Mr Speaker, to incorporate it in an amendment.\r\n\r\nIf   one  person  is  not  prepared  to  give   that\r\n\r\nundertaking,  it does not mean that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be deprived of a Commission, the principle of\r\n\r\nwhich is conceded by the Government. It is perfectly\r\n\r\ntrue that Members are protected from being compelled\r\n\r\nto  repeat outside what they have said here.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink, Sir, if we at times recognise that if we give\r\n\r\nMembers   the   credit  for  having   a   sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  accepting  the  fact   that   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry would be called and they would\r\n\r\nbe  subpoenaed  to it, and if they  refuse  to  give\r\n\r\nevidence,  then they will be placed  in  an  acutely\r\n\r\nembarrassing  position vis-a-vis the  Government.  I\r\n\r\ncan  find  no  merit really, Mr  Speaker,  in  this\r\n\r\namendment  except that the Government, seemingly  to\r\n\r\nsave  face rather than accept my motion, has  sought\r\n\r\nto  amend  it so that it seems that we are accepting\r\n\r\nits  own amendment. I do urge the Assembly to accept\r\n\r\nthe motion as it stands, a simple motion which seeks\r\n\r\nmerely    to    investigate,   report    and    make\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It might be convenient if the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister moves now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Seconder?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no seconder required to the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, I am not moving yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr    Speaker,    Sir,   speaking    of    personal\r\n\r\nrelationships, the leaders of the P.A.P. have always\r\n\r\ncredited  me  highly. It is a sorry  matter  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  have  inevitably parted ways  with  them  on\r\n\r\npolitical lines. I know the Prime Minister  is  very\r\n\r\nangry  over  the  motion on political  nepotism.  He\r\n\r\ntakes  it  to  mean that we of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwant  to have a bout of Siamese boxing with him.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have no intention of hitting out  at  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. on  questions  which  do  not  concern   any\r\n\r\npolitical principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain here why I signed as the seconder\r\n\r\nof  this motion. There are two reasons which led  me\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is because, after the 13 Assemblymen of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis have left the P.A.P., those who\r\n\r\nwere  serving in Government departments or statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and  who were not satisfied with the  Right-wing  \r\n\r\ninclination or political line  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  were oppressed by the P.A.P. in  respect\r\n\r\nof  their livelihood, and so lost their jobs.  Among\r\n\r\nthose  who were forced to leave their jobs were  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre district leaders of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  centre leaders and assistant  leaders,\r\n\r\nmembers of the Work Brigade, car park attendants  in\r\n\r\nthe   Vehicles  Registration  Department,  temporary\r\n\r\nclerks   in  the  Citizenship  Registration   Board,\r\n\r\nphotographers  and  typists  in  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCulture,   and  even  receptionists  in  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's office. They were sacked as from 21st  of\r\n\r\nJuly  last  year. The Government did  not  give  any\r\n\r\nreason  to  explain the mistakes they  had  made  in\r\n\r\nrespect of their duties. The Government also did not\r\n\r\npoint  out  where  their ability did  not  meet  the\r\n\r\nduties  they  shouldered. They  were  sacked  merely\r\n\r\nbecause  they  would not attend  the  P.A.P.  Branch\r\n\r\nCommittee  meetings to support the Central Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  the P.A.P. which had already  changed\r\n\r\nits  political  nature. They were a  group  of  very\r\n\r\nefficient people, as, for instance, the team leaders\r\n\r\nof  the  People's  Association and community  centre\r\n\r\nleaders.  The  Prime Minister had praised  them.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if the work of rehabilitating  the  over\r\n\r\n10,000  fire  victims  at Bukit  Ho  Swee  had  been\r\n\r\ncarried out without the help of these people, and if\r\n\r\nit  had depended only on the help of the police  and\r\n\r\ntroops,  then  there  might  very  well  have   been\r\n\r\nviolence and disturbances. These people had  loyally\r\n\r\nsupported the P.A.P. for many years. In carrying out\r\n\r\ntheir duties they did not haggle over the length  of\r\n\r\ntime. They wholeheartedly served the people. But  on\r\n\r\nthe 21st of July, they were sacked. On the contrary,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is paying about $1,000 salary  every\r\n\r\nmonth   to   the  former  Labour  Front   Organising\r\n\r\nSecretary, Mr De Cruz, George Thomson and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. is carrying out a kind of\r\n\r\nunprincipled political oppression and divesting  the\r\n\r\nright   of  these  people  to  serve  in  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and statutory boards, why then should  I\r\n\r\ncover   up   the  P.A.P.'s  practice  of   employing\r\n\r\npersonnel for Government departments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the Barisan Sosialis has\r\n\r\nacquired new evidence which shows that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ncontinuing to exploit its position in power to carry\r\n\r\nout  improper  actions  in  respect  of  the  public\r\n\r\nservices.  Mr Speaker, Sir, here is a  letter  from\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.  It  was written on the 27th of  September,\r\n\r\n1961, to Mr Chang Yuen Siang, who was a team leader\r\n\r\nat  the  Paya  Lebar Work Brigade camp. This  letter reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n`Comrade Yuen Siang,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chai  Chee  and  Ang  Chee are Executive  Committee\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Toa Payoh Branch. They  had  their\r\n\r\nsupper earlier in order to go to the Branch to carry\r\n\r\nout  their  work. When they leave, please take  over\r\n\r\ntheir work. It is my hope.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                                 Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n                                     Chee Seng.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to table this\r\n\r\nletter in order to comply with the procedure. It was\r\n\r\non  the 4th of October, 1961, that the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Home Affairs  wrote  a\r\n\r\nsimilar letter to the camp leader of the Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade  camp requesting him  to  release  two\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members who were working in the Work Brigade\r\n\r\nso  that  they could leave the camp and  have  their\r\n\r\nsupper earlier in order to enable them to go back to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Branch to work. From what I know, in July\r\n\r\nlast  year, the Paya Lebar camp of the Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nhad  withdrawn all leave papers of its members, that\r\n\r\nis to say, it disallowed members of the Work Brigade\r\n\r\nto  leave the camp at night at any time they  liked.\r\n\r\nBut  these two letters explained that if the members\r\n\r\nof  the Work Brigade were members of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nthey were also executives of the Branches, then they\r\n\r\nwould have a special privilege to leave the camp and\r\n\r\ngo to the Branch to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have another piece of\r\n\r\nevidence. Let me give a copy of this evidence to the\r\n\r\nClerk  of the Assembly. This evidence is in a letter\r\n\r\nwritten  by  the  Chairman of the P.A.P.  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nBranch  to  the camp leader of the Paya  Lebar  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade. This letter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n`Comrade Yuen Siang,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Your  members,  Choo Chua Tee and Cheng  Mao  Shih,\r\n\r\nwere absent from the camp on Monday because they had\r\n\r\ngone to the Toa Payoh Branch of the P.A.P. that  day\r\n\r\nto  help paint the table tennis table. So I hope you\r\n\r\nwill  excuse  them  and give them their  pay  during\r\n\r\ntheir absence.\r\n\r\n                                Kim Yuen Chee,\r\n\r\n                         Toa Payoh Branch Chairman.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is  also  the seal of the  Toa  Payoh  Branch\r\n\r\nPublicity Section. It was dated the 8th of November,\r\n\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether this can\r\n\r\nbe  considered as a sort of political  nepotism.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as a person is a member of the P.A.P., and  at\r\n\r\nthe same time he is a member of the Work Brigade, he\r\n\r\nneed  not go to the Work Brigade camp. He can absent\r\n\r\nhimself  and  still get his pay on  the  day  he  is\r\n\r\nabsent from work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, here again, I do not wish to\r\n\r\ntalk  too much. My Party has indicated to me clearly\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  the  neutrality  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  The  Central Executive  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis has, by a majority, agreed that  we\r\n\r\nmust stop and correct the practices of the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nengaging employees for the public service.  We  must\r\n\r\ndo this in order to maintain neutrality in the civil\r\n\r\nservice.  Otherwise, all talk of neutrality  is  but\r\n\r\nhumbug.  Because of these two reasons I have  signed\r\n\r\nas a seconder of the motion tabled by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the amendment moved by the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, it is my opinion that I should endorse the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  Member  for  Anson.  I  feel  it  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely unnecessary to move such an amendment. In\r\n\r\nthe  meantime, I feel that to add this amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  original  motion is an act to  restrict  people\r\n\r\nfrom  ventilating their views, doubts and suspicions\r\n\r\nof Government policies. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntable  copies of the two letters I have  quoted.  I\r\n\r\nshall  produce the originals, if necessary,  to  the\r\n\r\nrelevant Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the letters handed in to the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I expected\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson  or  the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  to divulge startling details of political\r\n\r\nnepotism, but actually what we have heard is nothing\r\n\r\nbut a general ramble on certain appointments we have\r\n\r\nmade,  particularly to statutory boards and  certain\r\n\r\ntemporary posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this quite clearly: that the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in order to carry out its policy,  must\r\n\r\ncertainly  have  the means to be  assured  that  its\r\n\r\npolicy  is  going  to be carried out.  Part  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  administration  and  the  execution   of\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the  Government is left  to  statutory\r\n\r\nboards. It is natural and stands to reason that when\r\n\r\nsome appointments are made to these statutory boards\r\n\r\nwe  should  include people who we  believe  will  do\r\n\r\ntheir best to see that our policies are carried out.\r\n\r\nCertainly  the Member for Anson does not expect  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  appoint him to any of the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards like the Housing and Development Board or the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Board.  Let me put  a  simple  instance\r\n\r\nbefore him. The House is fully aware of the previous\r\n\r\nBoard  constituted  under the Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust.   Under  that  Board,  little  was  done   in\r\n\r\naccelerating or building cheap houses. Since we took\r\n\r\nover, we have placed people in the Housing Board who\r\n\r\nwe  know  are  sympathetic - although not  necessarily\r\n\r\nmembers of the P.A.P. - to the policies of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  who are sincere and honest in carrying out  our\r\n\r\npolicies. It is because we have done this that today\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board can claim to have\r\n\r\nput  up  the biggest number of houses for  1961 - more\r\n\r\nthan  at any time in the life of the previous S.I.T.\r\n\r\nNow assuming that we had no control over the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board, where would these houses  be\r\n\r\ntoday? Assuming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  had no control over any other  Board,  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the Government could be sabotaged  and\r\n\r\njeopardised. It is not enough for us  to  put  up  a\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Development Plan or an election programme\r\n\r\nand  say  that  we  will do this and  that  for  the\r\n\r\npeople,  if we do not have the means to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese   policies  are  going  to  be  carried.   The\r\n\r\nexecution  and administration of these  policies  is\r\n\r\nleft  in the hands, to some extent, of the statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and  it is necessary - desirable,  in  fact - to\r\n\r\nplace  in  them  people upon whom we  can  rely  and\r\n\r\npeople  who we know for sure are sympathetic to  our\r\n\r\npolicies  and  our plans and who will  honestly  and\r\n\r\nsincerely  spend a considerable part of' their  time\r\n\r\nto see that they are carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add this. By the term \"political nepotism\",\r\n\r\nI  have  the impression that favours are granted  to\r\n\r\npeople because of their political affiliations.  But\r\n\r\nlet  me  tell  the  House that the majority  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of the statutory boards do not receive  any\r\n\r\nemolument whatsoever. They do not receive  a  single\r\n\r\ncent. And let me tell the House too that many of the\r\n\r\nmembers  who are on these boards and whom  we  trust\r\n\r\nhave  spent a considerable amount of their time  and\r\n\r\nenergy   to   attend  meetings  because   of   their\r\n\r\ndedication  to public service. They have volunteered\r\n\r\nbut  they have not been compelled to become  members\r\n\r\nof  these  boards. The House and the  public  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  us  to appoint Members of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nthese  boards. Instead of executing the policies  of\r\n\r\nthe Government, we will find that they will be using\r\n\r\nthese boards to sabotage our development plans. That\r\n\r\ni3 the natural conclusion: What is the grumble? What\r\n\r\nis the fuss that the Member for Anson has kicked up?\r\n\r\nHe  read out a list of statutory board memberships - a\r\n\r\nlist  which  had  been given to  him  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - and  tried to examine how many  members  of\r\n\r\nthese  boards  are P.A.P. members. From  his  speech\r\n\r\ntoday,  he  has acknowledged that in many  of  these\r\n\r\nboards there are very few P.A.P. members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the difficulties that we\r\n\r\nface  in  this country is the paucity of people  who\r\n\r\nare  prepared to dedicate their time in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice without receiving any reimbursement for  the\r\n\r\ntime and energy they spend in the public service. Is\r\n\r\nit  not  natural, therefore, that we  should,  as  a\r\n\r\nfirst recourse, look towards people whom we know and\r\n\r\nwho  are prepared to come forward and serve on these\r\n\r\npublic  boards; and if these persons should also  be\r\n\r\nmembers of the Party, are they not more reliable? In\r\n\r\nfact,  many of those whom we have appointed to these\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards have been appointed not solely  on\r\n\r\naccount  of  their  party affiliation  but,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has acknowledged,  there  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  sitting on these statutory boards  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen recognised for their merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has suggested that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  improper political interference with the civil\r\n\r\nservice.  Does  he suggest then that  any  political\r\n\r\nParty which comes into power should draw a clear-cut\r\n\r\nline  between the Government and the civil  service?\r\n\r\nAre  not  the  policies  of  the  Government  to  be\r\n\r\nexecuted  through  the  civil service?  If  stopping\r\n\r\ncorruption  in the civil service means  raising  its\r\n\r\nefficiency, if insisting upon the civil  service  to\r\n\r\nbe  more  polite  and more prompt  in  their  public\r\n\r\nrelationship   with  the  people  is   regarded   as\r\n\r\ninterference,  then I say that such interference  is\r\n\r\nwarranted.  Members of the House  will  accept  that\r\n\r\neven civil servants are not infallible and they  are\r\n\r\nnot robots. They are not machines on which you press\r\n\r\na  button and orders are carried out. They are human\r\n\r\nbeings  with  human failings. With several  thousand\r\n\r\ncivil servants, is it not possible that there  is  a\r\n\r\nminority   whose   efficiency  is   suspect,   whose\r\n\r\nintegrity  may  also  be suspect?  In  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\ncustomary   for   me  to  receive  letters    - albeit\r\n\r\nanonymous  and  which  I  therefore  do  not   treat\r\n\r\nseriously - alleging inefficiency and  corruption.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you yourself could be aware\r\n\r\nof  letters appearing in the daily Press complaining\r\n\r\nof  inefficiency in some departments  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey appear periodically in the Press. Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis   up   to  the  Government  to  see  that   these\r\n\r\ninefficiencies  are removed. How  would  you  expect\r\n\r\nthem  to be removed? Should the Minister himself  go\r\n\r\nand  do the job of the civil servants? It is humanly\r\n\r\nimpossible.  Therefore,  we have  appointed  certain\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  to some Ministries to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service is always kept on its toes, that  all\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  inefficiency and any  allegation  of\r\n\r\ncorruption can be immediately investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have in my amendment deleted\r\n\r\nthe  appointment of civil servants on the Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry. Sir, the reason for that is very simple.\r\n\r\nIf  you  put  civil  servants  on  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry - whether  they  be  retired  or   not - it   is\r\n\r\ntantamout to asking civil servants to sit  upon  the\r\n\r\nheads of the Government or to sit upon the heads  of\r\n\r\nelected   leaders  of  the  country.   That   is   a\r\n\r\ncontradiction  which  must not  be  allowed  to  get\r\n\r\nthrough. Another reason is this. Any recommendations\r\n\r\nor  any  conclusions arrived at by such a Commission\r\n\r\nwhich   includes  civil  servants  will  always   be\r\n\r\nsuspect,  because however the Commission  makes  its\r\n\r\nfindings, there will be people who are bound to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  civil servants are prejudiced against  or\r\n\r\nbiased  for the Government, and it is solely in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of a fair judgment being arrived a by  such\r\n\r\na  Commission that we are prepared to appoint a High\r\n\r\nCourt  Judge  to  constitute  this  Commission.   As\r\n\r\neverybody knows, the Judiciary is independent of the\r\n\r\nExecutive.  Allegations  which  are  made  must   be\r\n\r\nspecific. No Commission can spend its time listening\r\n\r\nto  fairy  tales  or stories.

Firstly, the\r\n\r\namendment  seeks  only  to  have  investigated   any\r\n\r\nallegations  of  political  nepotism  made  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly;  secondly, the proviso,  to  my  mind,  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  objectionable,  in  that  it  seeks   to\r\n\r\nhamstring  Members of this House  into  agreeing  to\r\n\r\nsomething which the law says nobody can  hamstring\r\n\r\nthem into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is no law yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think that is most improper, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir,I am surprised that the Leader of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  instead  of  protecting  the  privileges  of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen, seeks, by virtue of this amendment,  to\r\n\r\ndestroy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should have thought that the\r\n\r\nGovernment having conceded that there should be such\r\n\r\na  Commission - and they must have thought  about  the\r\n\r\nmatters carefully -  then they would have decided that\r\n\r\nthe  wider  the scope of the Commission, the  better\r\n\r\nfor the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have very often heard from a\r\n\r\nnumber  of people whose opinions should be respected\r\n\r\nabout the P.A.P. Government, about what it is doing,\r\n\r\nabout  what  it  is  not doing, and  about  all  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  and hard things the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\ndoing.  We hear all these things. They have  been  a\r\n\r\nmatter of market talk and coffee-shop gossip for the\r\n\r\nlast  two years. But as responsible Assemblymen,  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  bring such talk and such gossip  into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  voice them because we are  not  quite\r\n\r\nsure  whether they are correct or not. But from  the\r\n\r\npoint of view of the Government, the important thing\r\n\r\nis  not, I venture to suggest, whether what  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  told is correct or not, but that it  is  being\r\n\r\nsaid. If more than one person is saying it, if quite\r\n\r\na  lot  of persons are saying it, then it becomes  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  importance for the Government  to  clear\r\n\r\nitself.  I  hope  this  Commission  will  clear  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, Mr Speaker, Sir. But if the  Government\r\n\r\nputs  restrictions  on the Commission,  then  people\r\n\r\nwill  doubt whether the Government is honest in  its\r\n\r\nstatement that it wants a Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson has been quite fair\r\n\r\nin  his  motion. What the Government want  is  this:\r\n\r\nthey want allegations to be made here, and only  for\r\n\r\nthose allegations to go to the Commission. They also\r\n\r\nwant the persons who make allegations to go and give\r\n\r\nevidence. But what we want in this Assembly  is  not\r\n\r\nfor Assemblymen to go and give evidence, because  we\r\n\r\nAssemblymen are not the ones who can give  evidence.\r\n\r\nThe  people who know and who suffer the difficulties\r\n\r\nare  the people outside. This Commission is intended\r\n\r\nto   protect   those  persons  who  go  before   the\r\n\r\nCommission and give their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence,  not  to  protect  Assemblymen.

And  I\r\n\r\nsay   this  to  him - this  is  my  frank  and  honest\r\n\r\nopinion - that  if  we  work on  the  basis  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   is   honourable  (we   call   ourselves\r\n\r\nhonourable in this Chamber), then we shall waste the\r\n\r\ntime  of  the Judges, their secretaries,  the  court\r\n\r\nushers, and other people who give valuable time  for\r\n\r\na  public cause. You do not appoint a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry just because somebody bellyaches and wants a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry. You appoint a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry because there is a prima facie case for  it.\r\n\r\nThe   Member  for  Hong  Lim  made  some   fantastic\r\n\r\nallegations.

This is Commission number 4 on the list, as  I\r\n\r\nanswered  earlier in the afternoon. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park knows there are five Puisne  Judges  in\r\n\r\nthe  High Court. One Puisne Judge will have  to  sit\r\n\r\ndown  and  spend no less than about 30 sitting  days\r\n\r\ndiscussing  and  listening to  evidence  and  cross-examination.  \r\n\r\nHe  will probably spend  another  week\r\n\r\nsifting  the evidence and writing a report.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  doing  this for fun. It costs public money  and\r\n\r\neffect.  As  the  Member for Hong Lim's  allegations\r\n\r\ncost  effort.

When he went to court, he dared  not  go\r\n\r\ninto the witness box to claim it. And he surrendered\r\n\r\nthe  property.  Why? Because he  discovered  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the proceedings that if he had gone  into\r\n\r\nthe  witness box on oath and sworn that the property\r\n\r\nwas  his, then he would have been charged for having\r\n\r\nreceived gifts without consideration as a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.

What is wrong with it? But when the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson says - and I was watching the Member for Nee\r\n\r\nSoon  very  closely - that  I,  as  Chairman  of   the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association, wrongly used or  misused  the\r\n\r\nfunds  of  the People's Association to bring  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers to Anson and Hong Lim rallies, then  I  say,\r\n\r\nhe puts it down in writing, he produces his witness,\r\n\r\nand we shall question the witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has not been one single word on the real nub\r\n\r\nof  this motion, which is what the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark   has   talked  about - political  nepotism   and\r\n\r\ninterference  with  the civil service.  With  people\r\n\r\ntrained in the English democratic traditions, it  is\r\n\r\na   very  serious  matter  when  you  intimidate  or\r\n\r\notherwise undermine the morale and integrity of  the\r\n\r\ncivil    service   by   unlawfully   or   improperly\r\n\r\ninterfering with it. Not a single word of that  from\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson, let alone from the Member for\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon. Strangely enough, I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  this is a failing of the Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  or  whether he reflects  the  13  Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers. As I understood his ten-minute speech which\r\n\r\nI  heard before I left the Chamber in order that  he\r\n\r\nwould  not  be inhibited, what he was bemoaning  was\r\n\r\nnot  the  fact  that he got all these various  chaps\r\n\r\njobs  in the People's Association but that after  we\r\n\r\ndiscovered he was up to no good, we got him out  and\r\n\r\nwe  got rid of his chaps. That was the complaint.  I\r\n\r\nshould  have  thought  the proper  wording  for  the\r\n\r\nmotion by the Member for Upper Serangoon would  have\r\n\r\nbeen that \"This House condemns the P.A.P.

The\r\n\r\nMember for Anson is worlds apart from the Member for\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon.

And  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  say,  in brief, that we are  prepared,  as\r\n\r\nindeed any government which desires to maintain  its\r\n\r\nintegrity as a matter of honour is prepared, to have\r\n\r\nany  Commission  of  Inquiry or  any  scrutiny  into\r\n\r\nanybody's  conduct.  For only in  that  way  can  we\r\n\r\njustify acceptance of the fact that whatever we  do,\r\n\r\nbe  it  right  or be it wrong, is not  for  personal\r\n\r\nadvantage and personal interest. But I say, when  it\r\n\r\ncomes to a thing like this - and we have gone through\r\n\r\nall  this rigmarole with the Member for Hong Lim and\r\n\r\nwhatever that Commission of Inquiry achieved or  did\r\n\r\nnot  achieve - that  is a debatable point - a  year  has\r\n\r\nsince  elapsed and we have heard no more' about  all\r\n\r\nthese wild allegations.

This  is\r\n\r\nstill  on  our  statute  books  and,  therefore,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  pertinent  to inquire how  this  particular\r\n\r\nsection  3 is to be worked. Under section 3  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara who, by order signed by the Minister,\r\n\r\nprohibits   or   permits.  We  know,  Mr   Speaker,\r\n\r\nconstitutionally, the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  never\r\n\r\nacts on his own. He either acts on the advice of the\r\n\r\nCabinet or on that of a particular Minister  and  it\r\n\r\nwould   seem   on   some   occasions,   under    the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  on the advice of the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 72 (1) of the Singapore (Constitution)\r\n\r\nOrder in Council, 1958, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Part of this\r\n\r\nOrder,  defence and external, affairs shall  be  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  Government  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 74 (1) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom may,\r\n\r\nwhenever it is of the opinion that the discharge  of\r\n\r\nits   responsibilities  for  defence  sir   external\r\n\r\naffairs  so  requires,  request  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  by  a  communication  made  through  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  Commissioner, to  take  any  action\r\n\r\nspecified in that communication or to discontinue or\r\n\r\nrefrain from any action which is so specified;  and.\r\n\r\nsubject to the provisions of subsection (8) of  this\r\n\r\nsection, the Government of Singapore shall, as  soon\r\n\r\nas  may  be, comply with any such request except  to\r\n\r\nthe   extent  that  the  Internal  Security  Council\r\n\r\ndecides,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions   of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (7) of this section, that  the  subject-matter  of  the  `request is a  matter  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity and not of defence or external affairs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then section 74 (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the United Kingdom Commissioner is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat the provisions of the preceding subsection have\r\n\r\nnot been complied with, he may, by writing under his\r\n\r\nofficial seal, so inform the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nand advise him to make an Order giving effect to the\r\n\r\nrequest of the Government of the United Kingdom; and\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara shall  make  an  Order\r\n\r\naccordingly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 74 (4) of that Ordinance reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every Order made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nunder this section shall have the force of law,  and\r\n\r\nshall be published in the Gazette.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Recruiting Ordinance, from 1875 up\r\n\r\ntill  the  date this Constitution Order  in  Council\r\n\r\ncame  into force, regulated recruiting in so far  as\r\n\r\nsuch  recruitment  took  place  in  the  Colony  for\r\n\r\nservice in a foreign State.

Do we talk about anti-colonialism, or do\r\n\r\nwe  talk  about  law? Having heard  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park talk law, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave decided that the matter should be answered in a\r\n\r\npurely  legal and proper manner and the  appropriate\r\n\r\nMinister  who  should answer the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark is the Minister for Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law feels that behind the jargon of the law, really what it means is: do you really\r\n\r\nseriously object to people enlisting members of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis who want to volunteer to go to West\r\n\r\nIrian?  Do  we really and seriously feel that  their\r\n\r\nloyalty to Singapore will be undermined if they  are\r\n\r\nengaged in the anti-colonial struggle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nhas  acutely and subtly posed the problem. It is not\r\n\r\na  question of portfolio because the Cabinet as such\r\n\r\nact  together,  and the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  can\r\n\r\nonly act on the advice of the Cabinet as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Farrer Park to section  74  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,  which\r\n\r\nspecifically spells out the powers over defence  and\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs  in  the  hands  of  the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If there is any doubt as to  where  the\r\n\r\nmatter   rests,  whether  it  is  internal  security\r\n\r\nencroaching   upon  defence -   this   is   purely   a\r\n\r\nhypothetical  case  and  I am  not  suggesting  that\r\n\r\nsomebody  who  wants to go to West  Irian  to  fight\r\n\r\nDutch  colonialism is necessarily a  danger  to  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of the State of Singapore. In fact, I would\r\n\r\nthink  that  there  is no better  guarantee  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of the State of Singapore than  to  engage\r\n\r\nall   the   anti-colonial  fervour  and   zest   and\r\n\r\nenthusiasm in something really worthwhile, something\r\n\r\nwhich  I  had  the honour to sign in  a  declaration\r\n\r\njointly  with the First Minister of the Republic  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   to   which   my  former   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary was a witness. He stood solemnly by as  we\r\n\r\ndeclared  and he solemnly supported that West  Irian\r\n\r\nshould  go  back to Indonesia.

But,  nevertheless, let me make  this  point,\r\n\r\nwhich  I was on the point of clarifying. We  are  on\r\n\r\nthe  threshold of either a nationalist non-Communist\r\n\r\nsocialist Malaya or a Communist one, and we  support\r\n\r\nanti-colonialism anywhere provided that is where  it\r\n\r\nis  going to lead to.

But that does not mean  we\r\n\r\ndo  not support West Irian because, as far as we can\r\n\r\nsee,  that  leads  to,  for  a  long  while  yet,  a\r\n\r\nnationalist Indonesia. What history has in store for\r\n\r\nus and our neighbours we do not know, but West Irian\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  Indonesia and we  support  it   - foreign\r\n\r\nenlistment notwithstanding. The Singapore Government\r\n\r\ngives  a firm and categorical assurance to all those\r\n\r\nwho  wish to volunteer that we will stand up for the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  rights  of  all  those  who  wish  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice life and limb for a sacred cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has just\r\n\r\nbeen  a suggestion that there is recruitment  going\r\n\r\non  in this country for the military purposes of  a\r\n\r\nforeign  nation. I think we want to put the  matter\r\n\r\nin   proper   perspective.  That   is,   in   fact,\r\n\r\ninaccurate.  I  have  read  in  the  papers  of   a\r\n\r\nstatement  issued by the Indonesian  Consul-General\r\n\r\nwho  has  stated  merely that he  has  noted  these\r\n\r\napplications  for service overseas, that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  being  utilised at the moment, but  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  considered in due course.  That  is  not\r\n\r\nrecruitment,  Sir. That is no more  than  a  polite\r\n\r\nK.I.V., as if the Member for Farrer Park writes and\r\n\r\ntells  me  that  he is referring my letter  to  his\r\n\r\nclient  for consideration. It means nothing at  all\r\n\r\nand I do not think it is fair to imply -  though I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  if the implication is intended - that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the Consul-General for Indonesia is  in  any\r\n\r\nway  transgressing any of our laws.

He  has\r\n\r\nset the pattern for behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said, \"This is just a\r\n\r\nceremonial  gesture appealing to  the  emotions  of\r\n\r\nman\".  That  may  be his view. He  may  be  a  very\r\n\r\nemotional  man who believes in ceremonial gestures.\r\n\r\nBut  the Barisan Sosialis are neither emotional nor\r\n\r\nceremonial.

Quite naturally, Sir, it follows, as\r\n\r\nday  follows  night, that Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, particularly the leaders in the Assembly,\r\n\r\nfeel very strongly about the issue.
