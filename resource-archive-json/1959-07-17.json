I was  referring,\r\n\r\nSir,  to the Han Raya Haji message of the Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So long as we remember that all religions preach\r\n\r\ngoodwill  and love for one's fellow-men, then  with\r\n\r\ntolerance we can live happily together in peace and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for this country in particular, we need to\r\n\r\nremember  and not only to remember, but to practise\r\n\r\nit. The Hon. the Prime Minister once stated that he\r\n\r\nfeared that the greatest danger for this country is\r\n\r\nfrom  communal hatred. We cannot expect  to  dispel\r\n\r\nthis  fear unless we replace it with something more\r\n\r\nconstructive.  I am glad that he had  stated  these\r\n\r\nthree  qualities as being necessary - that we  should\r\n\r\nhave  goodwill, love and tolerance. I for one, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  disagree  with  my friends on  the  Government\r\n\r\nbenches,  but  it  does not  mean  that  because  I\r\n\r\ndisagree with them therefore I should entertain any\r\n\r\nfeelings of ill-will towards them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose to touch next on economic\r\n\r\nexpansion and refer to the statement which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It has been their declared policy, clearly\r\n\r\nenunciated  during the election campaign,  to  give\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise,  both of  local  and  overseas\r\n\r\norigin,  all the encouragement and assistance  they\r\n\r\nneed...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nSir,   this  was  very  encouraging  and   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will implement this policy, it will help\r\n\r\nto build up a climate of confidence. But, Sir, as a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition, I have to point out  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain  statements  made  and  certain\r\n\r\nindications  which make people wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\npendulum is not swinging from the Colonial laissez-faire policy to one of excessive state control  and\r\n\r\ninterference.  Statements  have  been   made   that\r\n\r\nGovernment   proposes  to  control  all   community\r\n\r\ncentres, all boys' clubs and very likely all  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  The two do not seem to agree.  If  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to encourage private enterprise in one field,\r\n\r\nthe  same principle applies; it means that we  have\r\n\r\nto  encourage private enterprise also in the  field\r\n\r\nof  social welfare projects. Sir, I put it  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that they should reconsider this and  if\r\n\r\nthey  really  want to encourage private enterprise,\r\n\r\nthen  they should modify their policy so that where\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise has been abused and the  people\r\n\r\nhave suffered, then I for one would agree that  the\r\n\r\nState must interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of unemployment has been touched\r\n\r\nupon  very briefly in a short paragraph.  We  would\r\n\r\nhave liked, Sir, for the Ministers representing the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  elucidate their  policy.  Then  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  could really help to  point  out  where\r\n\r\nthere  are points to be reconsidered. But since  we\r\n\r\ndo  not know what is beyond the speech, Sir, we can\r\n\r\nonly  conjecture.  The problem of  unemployment  is\r\n\r\nvery closely connected with the problem of national\r\n\r\ndevelopment. It is stated here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"One of the gravest and most pressing problems\r\n\r\nfacing   the  Government  of  Singapore  today   is\r\n\r\nhousing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we wholeheartedly agree. Housing can have a\r\n\r\ngreat  effect on the unemployment problem. We  know\r\n\r\nthat  the population increase in Singapore is  such\r\n\r\nthat,  to  cope with just the annual  increase,  we\r\n\r\nshould build at least 10,000 housing units a  year.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore Improvement Trust has been  able  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  to  a maximum rate of only  about  4,000\r\n\r\nhouses  a  year.  With maybe increased  energy  and\r\n\r\ngreater  expenditure of money the number  could  be\r\n\r\nincreased. But with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  backlog of the years since 1945 or 1941,  with\r\n\r\narrears  of housing to be made good, we  know  that\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise must be encouraged to step  in.\r\n\r\nHere,  Sir,  we  find  that  there  are  two   very\r\n\r\ndiscouraging features. If an estate developer wants\r\n\r\nto  build 200 houses, he is now called upon to make\r\n\r\na  deposit for water and light even before  he  has\r\n\r\nstarted  building operations for the whole  of  the\r\n\r\n200 houses. Worked out at $1,500 per unit or $1,000\r\n\r\nper unit, it comes to $200,000. This means that the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  must  first deposit  $200,000  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   or   the  City  Council.   Sir,   this\r\n\r\ndiscourages the developer naturally. Why should  he\r\n\r\nput  in  $200,000  even before he starts  building,\r\n\r\nwhen  he feels that the climate is still uncertain?\r\n\r\nI have a constructive suggestion to make, Sir. That\r\n\r\nis,  if the deposit is reduced and payment made  in\r\n\r\nstages  for  20 or 50 houses at a time,  that  will\r\n\r\nencourage   estate  developers  to   invest   their\r\n\r\ncapital.  Then  again, Sir, this is  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nthose many workers who want to own small houses  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own.  They  are  scared  because  there  are\r\n\r\nreports that the assessment will be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain countries, Sir, to stimulate housing,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  exempted  owners  of  houses   or\r\n\r\nbuilders  of  houses from paying assessment  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod   of   time.  Sir,  I  put   forward   these\r\n\r\nsuggestions  in  order  that the  housing  industry\r\n\r\nmight  be  encouraged to develop further  and  that\r\n\r\nunemployment  would be helped. At the moment,  with\r\n\r\nthe  housing industry more or less at a  standstill\r\n\r\nexcept  for those who can afford it, the result  is\r\n\r\nthat many masons, carpenters, lorry drivers and  so\r\n\r\ndown the line, are unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to a subject in which I am\r\n\r\nnaturally   and  specially  interested.   That   is\r\n\r\neducation.  I  have been informed,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Minister was a teacher  before  he  went\r\n\r\ninto  the  field of insurance. I take it that  with\r\n\r\nthat  background  he  can see a  problem  from  its\r\n\r\ndifferent  angles. I am glad, Sir, that the  policy\r\n\r\nis  to  accept the recommendations of the All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee  Report on Chinese Education released  in\r\n\r\n1955.  In  that Report, Sir, it was stated  that  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of the educational development in  this\r\n\r\ncountry had been due to private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenterprise or public spirited merchants and  others\r\n\r\nwho had formed committees of management and started\r\n\r\ntheir   own   schools  in  villages   without   any\r\n\r\nencouragement from the then Colonial Government. In\r\n\r\nthe  same  way,  in  regard to  English  education,\r\n\r\nvarious  missions had established  schools  whereas\r\n\r\nthe  Government was interested in only just  a  few\r\n\r\nschools,  leaving the main task to private  bodies.\r\n\r\nSir, we are glad that after the war, the Government\r\n\r\ndecided  that it should play a more important  part\r\n\r\nand  invest  more  money on the  education  of  its\r\n\r\nfuture  citizens. This development has been all  to\r\n\r\nthe  good. Now that the Government has been  taking\r\n\r\nmore  and  more interest, it is natural, I suppose,\r\n\r\nthat  when people pay more money, they want to have\r\n\r\nmore  control, because they pay the piper.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame   time,  Sir,  for  the  sake  of  encouraging\r\n\r\ncompetition  and initiative, we feel  that  private\r\n\r\nenterprise must be encouraged and that these Boards\r\n\r\nof  Management  which are controlling  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  should  continue with the  least  possible\r\n\r\ninterference and Boards of Governors be formed  for\r\n\r\nGovernment as well as aided schools which do not as\r\n\r\nyet have Boards of Governors whereby there will  be\r\n\r\nmaintained the liaison between school and  home  to\r\n\r\nwhich  the  All-Party Committee Report  on  Chinese\r\n\r\nEducation has referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two questions at the moment which\r\n\r\nare   in   the   minds  of  parents  as   well   as\r\n\r\neducationists.  I  remember, Sir,  six  years  ago,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  problem of limited accommodation,\r\n\r\nthe then Director of Education said that there must\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  in  Singapore the  same  system  of\r\n\r\nSecondary Entrance Examination as in England.  That\r\n\r\nis known as the Eleven-plus Examination. But he did\r\n\r\nnot  recommend  the  full  implementation  of  what\r\n\r\nexists  in  England. He recommended the examination\r\n\r\nto exclude certain students and not to classify all\r\n\r\nthe students. He said to me that only a quarter  at\r\n\r\nthe  most  of  the students in the primary  schools\r\n\r\nshould  go  into  the secondary  schools.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nEngland, they have the Eleven-plus Examination as a\r\n\r\nclassifying examination. Those who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfit  for  the grammar type of education go  into  a\r\n\r\ngrammar  school; others into technical schools  and\r\n\r\nothers  again into modern schools. But here at  the\r\n\r\nage  of  Eleven-plus, Twelve-plus or Thirteen-plus,\r\n\r\nthousands  were dismissed and were told  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  not  get  into  the  secondary  schools.  We\r\n\r\neducationists believe, Sir, that at the Primary  VI\r\n\r\nlevel,  the  boys  and  girls  coming  out  of  the\r\n\r\nschools - whether English, Chinese,  Malay  or  Tamil\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools - are only  half-baked  products,\r\n\r\nand   half-baked   products  can   become   serious\r\n\r\nliabilities in the life of the country. One of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why we have so many juvenile delinquents is\r\n\r\nthat these boys and girls come out from the schools\r\n\r\nwithout sufficient education to be employed, and so\r\n\r\nthey  employ  themselves in their own  way  to  the\r\n\r\ndetriment   of   the  interests  of  the   country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  some of us suggested to the  Government\r\n\r\nthat   if   they  wanted  to  have  an  elimination\r\n\r\nexamination, it should be at the Form III level, or\r\n\r\nat  the seventh year level, when they would have at\r\n\r\nleast enough education to make use of whatever they\r\n\r\nhad learned to good purpose and be employable. Sir,\r\n\r\nwe were told that it could not be done. The schools\r\n\r\nwere given an ultimatum. Either we toed the line or\r\n\r\nthe  grant would be withdrawn. So, Sir, we  had  to\r\n\r\ntoe the line. Sad to say, thousands of children had\r\n\r\nto leave school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was a policy which was short-sighted.\r\n\r\nThe previous Minister for Education realised it too\r\n\r\nlate  and tried to reverse the policy. But  it  was\r\n\r\ntoo  late,  Sir. We tell the truth and we  believe,\r\n\r\nSir, that the Minister for Education today will not\r\n\r\ntake it amiss just because I am on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse and because in politics sometimes we take the\r\n\r\nattitude that if that is said by somebody from  the\r\n\r\nother  side, it must be bad. We hope that  it  will\r\n\r\nnot  come to that. Whatever is good that comes from\r\n\r\nthe  other side, we admit it as good. If  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we  have  to  criticise,  we   have   to\r\n\r\ncriticise because we are the Opposition.  So,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  suggest, if the Minister for Education has  not\r\n\r\nmade up his mind yet, that the examination which is\r\n\r\nnow  known  as  the  Government  Secondary  Schools\r\n\r\nEntrance Examination should be turned into a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclassifying  examination  or,  if  it  must  be  an\r\n\r\nelimination  examination, then it should  be  at  a\r\n\r\nlevel  so that our students come out at the age  of\r\n\r\n14 or Fourteen-plus when it will not be against the\r\n\r\nTrade Union Ordinance to employ them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the problem of the six-day\r\n\r\nweek.   Even  before  this  was  introduced,   many\r\n\r\nteachers had been doing a six-day duty freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But\r\n\r\nlet  us  also look at it from the point of view  of\r\n\r\nthe  students.  When we say that a student  does  a\r\n\r\nfive-day week, we must not think only of the school\r\n\r\nhours.  A  Form V pupil seems to have to  do  only,\r\n\r\nsay,  five  hours  a day, but he must  do  homework\r\n\r\nwhich entails labour for three or four hours at the\r\n\r\nminimum.  Some of them do five hours'  work  a  day\r\n\r\nafter  school  hours and, if we  take  it  in  that\r\n\r\nlight,  a Form V pupil has to put in five hours  in\r\n\r\nthe school and four hours at home - nine hours a day.\r\n\r\nWith  a  five-day week, it works up to 45  hours  a\r\n\r\nweek - it  already exceeds, I believe, the limit  set\r\n\r\ndown by the Trade Union Ordinance. So if we make it\r\n\r\na six-day week-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We  can bring about conditions  that  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  link us up with the Federation.  Sir,  my\r\n\r\nhope is that this may come about in my lifetime and\r\n\r\nyour  lifetime and that there will emerge a Malayan\r\n\r\nnation  when, although multi-lingual, multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-national or multi many other things, we shall\r\n\r\nbe  united in one loyalty to this country.

Sir, there  was\r\n\r\nno indication from him that the P.A.P. was thinking\r\n\r\nabout  pay  cuts. Indeed when the P.A.P. Mayor  was\r\n\r\nintroducing the City Council Budget, there  was  no\r\n\r\nmention  made  of any pay cuts, and if  I  remember\r\n\r\nrightly, there was mention of a surplus. Where then\r\n\r\nis  the  justification for pay cuts of City Council\r\n\r\nemployees? And to add to the injustice,  these  pay\r\n\r\ncuts   were  hurriedly  and  arbitrarily   imposed,\r\n\r\nflagrantly  ignoring  the  accepted  principle   of\r\n\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now, Sir, to the pay cuts of Government\r\n\r\nemployees. The P.A.P., as I said earlier,  did  not\r\n\r\ngive  any indication during the Budget debate  last\r\n\r\nyear that it would be desirable in the interests of\r\n\r\neconomy   to   introduce  cuts  in   the   variable\r\n\r\nallowance.  Nor did they at any time  during  their\r\n\r\nelection campaign give such an indication. As  soon\r\n\r\nas they got into the saddle, their economic expert,\r\n\r\nthrough  some  expert  computation,  declared  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  threatened deficit of  $14  million.\r\n\r\nSurely,  Sir, the economic expert, who has  been  a\r\n\r\ncivil servant for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  years, knows full well that for the past  few\r\n\r\nyears  there has been a surplus at the end of  each\r\n\r\nyear despite the budgetted deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not challenging the wisdom of the Government\r\n\r\nto  introduce  economies in the administration.

Only two meetings were held, and  these  on\r\n\r\nsuccessive days. Surely, Sir, in a matter  of  this\r\n\r\ngrave nature, the representatives of the Staff side\r\n\r\nwould have had to consult their trade unions before\r\n\r\nthey  could  speak  with  authority.

Surely, with  his  experience  of\r\n\r\ntrade union negotiations, what was required at  the\r\n\r\ninitial meetings was to agree on an operative  date\r\n\r\nand this, I understand, the Staff side was prepared\r\n\r\nto  do.  After the operative date had  been  agreed\r\n\r\nupon,  any  delay through negotiations in  reaching\r\n\r\nagreement on the quantum would have had no material\r\n\r\neffect.  Oh, no! This is not to be. The  Government\r\n\r\nmeans  business.  The Staff side  has  to  take  it\r\n\r\nbecause  their  champions,  or  rather  their   ex-champions,  say  so!  The  Government   cannot   be\r\n\r\npressured  into retreating. These are their  words,\r\n\r\nSir,  their  own words, \"The Government  cannot  be\r\n\r\npressured  into retreating\". But who is  exercising\r\n\r\npressure on whom in this case? I ask this House - who\r\n\r\nis exercising pressure on whom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Government, Sir, the much-maligned\r\n\r\nLim  Yew Hock Government, had an agreement with the\r\n\r\nStaff  side that in cases where no agreement  could\r\n\r\nbe  reached through negotiations, the matter  could\r\n\r\ngo to arbitration at the request of either side.  I\r\n\r\nam surprised that the Staff side did not try to get\r\n\r\nout  of  this  pressure by demanding - oh,  no,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  demand - by requesting that  the  matter\r\n\r\nshould  go to arbitration. The Government, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe  words  of the Minister for Finance, cannot  be\r\n\r\npressured,  and  so  even if  the  Staff  side  had\r\n\r\nrequested arbitration, the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  have said that it had scrapped the agreement\r\n\r\nreached  between  the Staff side and  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Perhaps  I  am  doing  the  P.A.P. an\r\n\r\ninjustice.  Perhaps they will agree  to  refer  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  arbitration, and  I  would  like  their\r\n\r\nanswer to this. I cannot help but keep on recalling\r\n\r\nto   my   mind  the  words  of  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance - that  the  Government cannot  be  pressured\r\n\r\ninto retreating. Judging from his speech during the\r\n\r\ndebate on the City Council (Suspension and Transfer\r\n\r\nof  Functions) Bill two days ago, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  is  doubtless  less  concerned  with   the\r\n\r\nobservance   of   the  democratic  institution   of\r\n\r\narbitration  tribunals. He is more  concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  substance, and the substance in this  case  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government's decision to introduce  pay  cuts.\r\n\r\nThe Government could not care less about the method\r\n\r\nof  achieving  this substance. To them  the  method\r\n\r\nadopted  by  them is democratic, and  if  the  poor\r\n\r\nOpposition  have the temerity to say  that  such  a\r\n\r\nmethod is undemocratic and dictatorial, they  would\r\n\r\nstand  up and remind us, maybe with grins spreading\r\n\r\nall over their faces: \"We have 43 members, and what\r\n\r\nabout  you - just  8.\"  That  is  the  substance   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. So, Sir, I do not think they would worry\r\n\r\nabout  arbitration at all. So obviously the  answer\r\n\r\nto   my  suggestion  of  referring  the  matter  to\r\n\r\narbitration is going to be no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then are they going to reconcile this stand\r\n\r\nif  they  were  to  say \"No\" with their  policy  on\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations? I quote  from  the  Hansard,\r\n\r\nVolume 11 No. 1, column 9:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the channel for the solution of industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes  is  direct negotiations between  employer\r\n\r\nand  Union, then conciliation through the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and Law, and only finally the  Court  of\r\n\r\nLabour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this  Court of Labour is to  have  powers  to\r\n\r\nenforce its awards.

How dare  the\r\n\r\nLim  Yew Hock Government strike a death blow at the\r\n\r\naccepted practice of trade unions negotiations, and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth. But what do we see today?  The\r\n\r\nvery  life of the trade union movement is at stake.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not the question of pay cuts at all. It  is\r\n\r\nthe negation of the right of trade unions to proper\r\n\r\nnegotiations. What do we see today?  All  quiet  on\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  front!  Even  the  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress, whose Secretary-General is the  Hon, the\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, is deadly silent. The P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunion leaders, the much-proclaimed champions of the\r\n\r\nworkers  of Singapore, have conveniently  forgotten\r\n\r\ntheir  training and their upbringing.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndeathly silence. The P.A.P. Government must  indeed\r\n\r\nbe  a  wonderful  government for the  workers.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, do you not know, is going  to  build  a\r\n\r\nTrade Union House. Yes, the Government is going to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild  a Trade Union House, and P.A.P. trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders   will  no  doubt  have  first   claim   to\r\n\r\noccupation  of  this  House  to  live   in   as....\r\n\r\nmarionettes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope and pray that this arbitrary and\r\n\r\ndictatorial action of the Government does  not  put\r\n\r\nideas into the heads of private employers. They too\r\n\r\nare  finding  their  profits  dwindling  and  their\r\n\r\nemployees  are  fearful that  a  similar  fate  may\r\n\r\novertake them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I get off this subject I want to\r\n\r\nreiterate  that  I am not opposing  the  wisdom  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to impose pay cuts. I am  not  opposing\r\n\r\nthat  at  all.  What  I  oppose,  and  oppose  most\r\n\r\nvehemently,   is  the  unilateral   and   arbitrary\r\n\r\nimposition of such cuts and the deadly blow to  the\r\n\r\nright of trade unions to proper negotiations, which\r\n\r\nright they have enjoyed so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government claims that \"by and large,\r\n\r\nthe  immediate prospects for economic expansion are\r\n\r\ngood.\"  They  are so good, Sir, that local  capital\r\n\r\nhas  run  away  and is still running  away  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Foreign capital is thinking twice about\r\n\r\ncoming to Singapore. There is a better climate  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  bigger  consumer  potentialities   just\r\n\r\nacross  the  causeway, and so  foreign  capital  is\r\n\r\ngoing there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The [P.A.P.] Government has in the few brief\r\n\r\nweeks  of  office received numerous enquiries  from\r\n\r\nforeign  and  local firms who want to  set  up  new\r\n\r\nfactories  in  Singapore.\" So they  say.  But  have\r\n\r\nthey?  The  Minister for Finance has chosen  to  be\r\n\r\nsilent  so  far and we have not been  told  of  the\r\n\r\nfacts and figures. I venture, Sir, to say that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government has inherited most if not all  of\r\n\r\nthese enquiries from the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government further claims that \"the Party in\r\n\r\npower enjoys the reputation of honouring its public\r\n\r\npronouncements.\"    What    about    the     famous\r\n\r\npronouncement of the Party Chairman who stated that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. City Councillors would remain in office\r\n\r\nto  serve,  as  he said, the proletariat,  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. honoured  this  public  pronouncement   by\r\n\r\nallowing their City Councillors to resign the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, and, to give cover to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  failure to honour their public pronouncement,\r\n\r\nthe City Council is now scrapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember rightly, Sir, during their election\r\n\r\ncampaign,  the P.A.P. leaders issued  a  threat  to\r\n\r\nprivate  capital  to  the extent  that  if  private\r\n\r\ncapital  co-operated with a P.A.P. Government  they\r\n\r\nwould  exist for twenty years or more, but if  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  co-operate with a P.A.P. Government  they\r\n\r\ncould not exist beyond five years, or words to that\r\n\r\neffect.  If  my  memory is wrong,  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will tell me that it is wrong. If it  is\r\n\r\nnot  wrong, Sir, what do they mean by that? Do they\r\n\r\nmean  what they said, or do they now say that  they\r\n\r\ndo not mean what they said when they said what they\r\n\r\nmeant? What a reputation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was indeed tickled when I heard this passage\r\n\r\nin  the Speech. I quote (Hansard, Volume 11, No. 1,\r\n\r\ncolumn 8):-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At the same time we must remember that a chronic\r\n\r\nstate  of  industrial unrest means the wrecking  of\r\n\r\nour  economy,  and if our economy is  damaged  then\r\n\r\nworkers, employers and the country as a whole  will\r\n\r\nsuffer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  during  the past four years  when  I  was  in\r\n\r\noffice, industrial unrest was the order of the  day\r\n\r\namong  P.A.P. trade unions. I  am  glad  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  learnt the error of their ways  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to take this opportunity to pay tribute\r\n\r\nto them for this change of heart for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now about trade unions. The Government has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  will  cancel  splinter  and  yellow\r\n\r\nunions. The Minister for Labour and Law has  chosen\r\n\r\nto be silent so far and I therefore do not have the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  his  definition. The hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  in  his  speech yesterday  said  something\r\n\r\nabout   the  undesirability  of  having   so   many\r\n\r\nregistered unions whose membership is small, it may\r\n\r\nbe  that he was speaking for the Government and was\r\n\r\ntrying to help out the Minister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\nBut  he too had given no clear definition. Perhaps,\r\n\r\nwhat  he was trying to imply was that there  should\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  so many unions registered  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment.  When  I was Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare, Sir, I had thought of this, and if  I  had\r\n\r\ncarried  out  what I thought the P.A.P. would  not\r\n\r\nhave had so many of their unions registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is a technical point which\r\n\r\nhas  occurred to me. I think I am correct in saying\r\n\r\nthat  there is a Bill which will be debated in this\r\n\r\nHouse on the question of splinter or yellow unions.\r\n\r\nCan  I  have confirmation of this from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I so confirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I must draw the\r\n\r\nattention of the hon.

It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It shall be out of order to anticipate an order\r\n\r\nof  the  day by discussion on a motion or amendment\r\n\r\ndealing with the subject matter of a Bill or  other\r\n\r\norder  of  the day on a day prior to that appointed\r\n\r\nfor the consideration of that order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So there is in this particular case an order of the\r\n\r\nday,  namely,  the Second Reading of  the  relevant\r\n\r\nBill,  and  perhaps the hon.

All these\r\n\r\ndiscussions are not in regard to yellow or splinter\r\n\r\nunions  at all. It is the question of the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment having registered so many trade  unions,\r\n\r\nwhose membership is more.

I would like to say that I did think at that\r\n\r\ntime  of not registering all the unions which  made\r\n\r\napplications to the Registrar. But because  I  felt\r\n\r\nthat the Government must give trade unions a proper\r\n\r\nrun,  there  should  be no restrictions  placed  on\r\n\r\ntheir   registration   nor  on   their   legitimate\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson.  It is obvious to me, Sir, that  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson had not searched his conscience\r\n\r\nwhen  he accused the previous Government of  having\r\n\r\ndone  nothing for the workers of Singapore  and  of\r\n\r\nbeing  anti-trade  unions.  Sir,  perhaps  he   has\r\n\r\nforgotten how the S.T.C. strike was solved and  how\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Airways strike was solved and how  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board strike was solved. I mentioned  these\r\n\r\nstrikes  only because their leaders are now Members\r\n\r\nof this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Member for Thomson's speech yesterday,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  was  a hint of warning  to  me  to  be\r\n\r\ncareful  about my trade union activities.  This  is\r\n\r\ntypical,  Sir,  of the P.A.P. trade union  leaders.\r\n\r\nThis  is what they call the substance of democracy.\r\n\r\nThe   hon.   Member  also  accused   the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment of having done nothing to ameliorate the\r\n\r\nworking conditions of workers in Singapore.  Is  he\r\n\r\ntrying  to  say  that  the Labour  Code,  the  Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants   Ordinance,   the   Clerical    Workers\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the  Factories  Ordinance  are   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nlegislation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our time, Sir, as records will show, we\r\n\r\nimproved  the standard of living of the workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, whereas the P.A.P.

The only difference is that  while  we\r\n\r\nhad provided arbitration tribunals, we did not make\r\n\r\nthese   compulsory.  We  did  not  have  compulsory\r\n\r\narbitration.  I  admit, because  the  trade  unions\r\n\r\nduring  our  time did not support it; because  they\r\n\r\nbelieved, and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreed  with them, that a militant trade union  can\r\n\r\nachieve more by direct action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trade unionist, Sir, I must register my\r\n\r\nvigorous protest against the Government's intention\r\n\r\nof  having  a Trades Union Congress with  executive\r\n\r\npowers. This is a move in the wrong direction and a\r\n\r\nmisconception of the purpose and role of  a  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nThis  sounds like turning the T.U.C. into a machine\r\n\r\nto  be used for political ends - and the sop, a Trade\r\n\r\nUnion House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to  implement  the  plans   which   the\r\n\r\nprevious  government introduced for the  relief  of\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed,  but I must say that  it  is  most\r\n\r\ncruel on its part so suddenly to withdraw the issue\r\n\r\nof  the ration of two katis of rice and one kati of\r\n\r\nsugar.  We did not go round, Sir, like the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\ntelling the people that we are a government for the\r\n\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

All  these\r\n\r\npeople,  Sir,  are  earning less  and  the  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle  goes round and round. All these  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  a  feeling  of  uncertainty,  a\r\n\r\nfeeling  of insecurity and a foreboding of  greater\r\n\r\nhardship to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an almost complete cessation of\r\n\r\nbuilding  and the reason has already been  advanced\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for  Tanglin.  This  cessation  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  has brought about hardship to the  allied\r\n\r\nindustries - brickmaking,    sawmilling,    furniture\r\n\r\nmaking,  and  so  on. Sir, in  spite  of  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may feel, we in the Opposition will keep\r\n\r\na  watchful  eye on how the Government  is  solving\r\n\r\nthis  growing  unemployment problem.  We  will  co-operate to the full in any measure that is good. We\r\n\r\nfeel  strongly,  Sir, that the  withdrawal  of  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  rations is not in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npoor  and  we would urge upon the Government - and  I\r\n\r\nwould  plead with the Government - that the issue  of\r\n\r\nthese rations be restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now refer to Hansard Vol. 11, No. 1, col.\r\n\r\n11.

They said that this proposed\r\n\r\nreorganisation  would not be to  the  detriment  of\r\n\r\nCity  Council employees, that is to say, they would\r\n\r\nnot  lose  their  jobs. I am  surprised  that  they\r\n\r\nshould have said this when they knew full well that\r\n\r\nthey  could not honour it. For how could  they?  Or\r\n\r\nmaybe  they have a different meaning to  the  words\r\n\r\n\"to eliminate duplication of functions and wasteful\r\n\r\nexpenditure\"? This is another instance, Sir, of how\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are going to enjoy the  reputation  of\r\n\r\nhonouring their public pronouncements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the City Council\r\n\r\n(Suspension  and  Transfer of  Functions)  Bill,  I\r\n\r\nreminded  the  Government that during the  election\r\n\r\ncampaign,  the  P.A.P. had stated  that  it  would\r\n\r\ncreate  an  autonomous Board to  take  over  public\r\n\r\nutilities.  I received no reply during that  debate\r\n\r\nand I hope I will receive a reply now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the Member for Changi was waxing\r\n\r\neloquent on his charge that the previous government\r\n\r\nhad  let down Chinese education. This goes to  show\r\n\r\nhow   little  he  knows  of  the  subject.  He  had\r\n\r\nconveniently  overlooked that it was  the  previous\r\n\r\ngovernment  which  appointed  the  1955   All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Chinese  Education  and   that   the\r\n\r\neducation  policy had been brought into  line  with\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of that Committee.  Even  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government now clearly says that it accepts\r\n\r\nthe  Report of this Committee. Furthermore, it  was\r\n\r\ndue to the previous government that Chinese schools\r\n\r\nhad  been  given their due place in  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem   as   a   result   of  which   considerable\r\n\r\nimprovements  have taken place in Chinese  schools.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  hon. Member seems to have forgotten  that\r\n\r\nbecause of the strong and successful stand  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious government on multilingualism, it had been\r\n\r\nmade  possible  for him and his fellow  members  to\r\n\r\ncontest  the general elections and get  elected  to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  and,  for the first  time,  as  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has said, Mandarin, Malay and\r\n\r\nTamil are heard in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, speaking generally on the\r\n\r\nSpeech, I do not see much difference in the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy  at all, apart from certain aspects such  as\r\n\r\nmaking Malay the national language, the creation of\r\n\r\na  Ministry of Culture, and so on. Most of what  is\r\n\r\nin  the  Speech  is  a  continuation  of  what  the\r\n\r\nprevious government has been doing. Of course, I do\r\n\r\nadmit  it - and admit it here - that the difference  is\r\n\r\nin  the approach to the problems. The P.A.P. claims\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  a more dynamic and a more  realistic\r\n\r\napproach  and  it  claims that it can  deliver  the\r\n\r\ngoods.  I  would  like to end my  speech,  Sir,  by\r\n\r\nwishing  them  the  very  best  of  luck  in  their\r\n\r\nendeavours in the task ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, this Government, returned  with\r\n\r\nthe   overwhelming  support  of  the   people   and\r\n\r\nresponsible  to them, considers that its  paramount\r\n\r\nduty  is  to  provide its citizens  with  the  best\r\n\r\neducation that it can afford to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the largest single head of\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  costing $63\u00bd million  or  nearly  a\r\n\r\nquarter of the Budget, and we should get full value\r\n\r\nfor  this money. Capital development costs  another\r\n\r\n$8.2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past colonial educational system must be\r\n\r\nchanged so that our citizens will have a purpose in\r\n\r\nlife; be proud of being citizens of a new State, be\r\n\r\nloyal  to it and be so trained in our schools  that\r\n\r\nthey  can be quickly employed and help build up  an\r\n\r\nindustrialised society. They must be taught to  use\r\n\r\ntheir   hands  with  their  brains.  \"White-collar\"\r\n\r\nmentality   belongs  to  the  colonial  past.   New\r\n\r\neducation begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's education policy is based on\r\n\r\nthree  main principles. Firstly, the acceptance  of\r\n\r\nthe  1955 All Party Report on Chinese Education  of\r\n\r\nthe  last Assembly provides for equal treatment  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the four streams of education: English,\r\n\r\nChinese, Malay and Tamil in the order in which  the\r\n\r\nnumber of pupils are to be found in our schools. In\r\n\r\nview of the previous emphasis on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish   education   by  past  Governments,   this\r\n\r\nGovernment will, in order to bring about parity  of\r\n\r\ntreatment,  pay much greater attention to  Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalay  and  Tamil schools in the years ahead  until\r\n\r\nsuch time as the appropriate balance is reached. It\r\n\r\nis necessary to add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that English education will be curtailed\r\n\r\nor  suppressed. It is simply a change in  emphasis;\r\n\r\nto restore justice and thus bring about the desired\r\n\r\nequality   of  status  of  education   with   Asian\r\n\r\nlanguages as the media of instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the acceptance of Malay as the national\r\n\r\nlanguage  by  this  Government  implies  that   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education will have to translate  this\r\n\r\ninto  a  living  reality.  This  brings  about  yet\r\n\r\nanother  change  in  emphasis  in  the  educational\r\n\r\nsystem as known in the past. According to the  All-Party  Committee  Report, it  aimed  at  bi-lingual\r\n\r\neducation   for  primary  schools  and   bi-lingual\r\n\r\neducation for secondary schools. To non-Malays,  it\r\n\r\nwill  now mean that the Malay language will  assume\r\n\r\nits importance next to their own mother tongue.  It\r\n\r\nwill  become the second and not the third  language\r\n\r\nfor  non-Malays: but as there are  only  400  Malay\r\n\r\nteachers  or  4 per cent of teachers looking  after\r\n\r\n16,000 pupils in 69 Malay schools and a few classes\r\n\r\nin   English  schools,  the  first  task  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to produce a sufficient  number  of\r\n\r\nteachers  in order to be able to teach Malay  as  a\r\n\r\nregular  subject in schools. With this in  view,  a\r\n\r\nspecial  two-year course in Malay  was  inaugurated\r\n\r\nthree  weeks ago at the Teachers. Training  College\r\n\r\nand  whilst it was originally intended to start off\r\n\r\nwith a first enrolment of 1,080 teachers, owing  to\r\n\r\nthe  great  enthusiasm and response from  qualified\r\n\r\nteachers, the first batch of qualified teachers now\r\n\r\nstudying  Malay, Mr Speaker, is l,560 - made  up  of\r\n\r\n1,088  teachers  from  English  schools,  440  from\r\n\r\nChinese  schools, 26 from teachers teaching English\r\n\r\nin  Malay  schools, and 6 from Tamil schools..  The\r\n\r\nsecond  enrolment  of  1,000  will  take  place  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1960, and a further 1,000 in July 1960. The\r\n\r\nstandard  aimed  at is the Government  Standard  II\r\n\r\nExamination and teachers should begin to take  this\r\n\r\nexamination in December\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1960,  after  which  they will  receive  a  special\r\n\r\nprofessional course of training to teach  Malay  in\r\n\r\nschools,  so that by the middle of 1961, the  first\r\n\r\nbatch of teachers will graduate and we shall be  in\r\n\r\nthe  happy position of being able to provide a  few\r\n\r\nteachers  in  every Singapore school, whatever  its\r\n\r\nmedia  of instruction, to teach Malay as a  regular\r\n\r\nsubject. However, until we have sufficient teachers\r\n\r\nable  to  teach  Malay  as  a  regular  subject  in\r\n\r\nschools, it shall remain an optional subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most gratifying experiences to date,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, has been the immediate and spontaneous\r\n\r\nresponse  to the study of Malay from all  quarters.\r\n\r\nRequests for syllabuses have been received  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   from  the  University  of  Malaya,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Council  of Adult Education,  commercial\r\n\r\nfirms and individuals. It has been decided to  give\r\n\r\nthe  fullest publicity to the syllabus in the Press\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry will be pleased  to  assist  all\r\n\r\ninterested  parties in their efforts to make  Malay\r\n\r\nthe national language grow and flourish; and it  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Ministry to make it  possible\r\n\r\nfor  those  now  doing private study  to  take  the\r\n\r\nGovernment examination if they so desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there will be a revision in the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  in schools in order that emphasis  will\r\n\r\nbe  on  practical  subjects  like  mathematics  and\r\n\r\nscience  and in the study of the various  languages\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. It is not intended to scrap subjects\r\n\r\nlike  history or geography, if only to give a  good\r\n\r\ngeneral and rounding-off in education. However,  it\r\n\r\nis  only  natural that in the awards for  bursaries\r\n\r\nand scholarships there will be a bias towards those\r\n\r\nwho   will   take  subjects  which  are  considered\r\n\r\ndesirable by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to answer the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  in his approach towards the six-day  week.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  felt  by  many  parents  that  their\r\n\r\nchildren have been rushed in their school work  and\r\n\r\nhad  to  make  up with long hours of  home-work  at\r\n\r\nhome.  With this partly in mind and the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum  in schools does  not  give  enough\r\n\r\nemphasis to the study of languages, this Government\r\n\r\nhas decided on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  six-day week so that the pupils may spend more\r\n\r\ntime in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic promotion in primary schools, which has\r\n\r\nbeen  going on for the past eight years, is  to  be\r\n\r\nstopped  owing  to deterioration in the  standards,\r\n\r\nboth  of  the  pupils' work and  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.  Another  reason for  stopping  automatic\r\n\r\npromotion  in  primary  schools  is  to  allay  the\r\n\r\nunnecessary  fear,  amounting to hysteria,  arising\r\n\r\nout  of  the weeding out of thousands of  children,\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the  Member for Tanglin,  after  the\r\n\r\ncommon  entrance examination for secondary  schools\r\n\r\nin   the  English  medium.  With  the  disposal  of\r\n\r\nautomatic promotion in primary schools, this common\r\n\r\nentrance   examination   will   be   just   another\r\n\r\nexamination along the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the proposed Education Advisory Council is\r\n\r\nappointed,  in which the four streams of  education\r\n\r\nwill be adequately represented, renewed work on the\r\n\r\nrevision  of  syllabuses and the Malayanisation  of\r\n\r\ntext-books will be started in earnest,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  aim  of  the Education Ministry  to  see  that\r\n\r\nMalayanised text-books will be in use  by  1961.  I\r\n\r\nhave lots of complaints from parents regarding  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  education in our schools - frequent changes\r\n\r\nof  text-books, yearly and so forth. That is why it\r\n\r\nhas  been  necessary for me to state that for  1960\r\n\r\nthere  shall be no change in text-books,  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  continue to use text-books for 1959,  if\r\n\r\nthat is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the remarks by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin regarding secondary education and its great\r\n\r\ndemand,   the  Government  has  decided  that   all\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools should also be on a  two-session\r\n\r\nbasis from 1960. Since it is Government's policy to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  vocational and technical  education,\r\n\r\nconsideration  will be given for the conversion  of\r\n\r\nsome of these secondary schools for vocational  and\r\n\r\ntechnical secondary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I shall deal with the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill who, it is to be remembered, was the last\r\n\r\nMinister for Education in the last Government,  and\r\n\r\nnow warms a chair on the opposite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nside of this House. In 1956 there was a fanfare  of\r\n\r\ntrumpets  when  two  so-called secondary  technical\r\n\r\nschools  were  built, namely,  Tanjong  Katong  and\r\n\r\nQueenstown  secondary  technical  schools.  To  my\r\n\r\nhorror,  I  have  discovered that  these  so-called\r\n\r\ntechnical  secondary  schools  are  just   ordinary\r\n\r\ngrammar  schools. As from today, these two  schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  known as Tanjong Katong Secondary  School\r\n\r\nand  Queenstown  Secondary  School,  not  secondary\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools. This action of  mine,  I  hope,\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  called  into  question  by  my   two\r\n\r\ncolleagues, the Minister for Home Affairs  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, who are the guardians of  our\r\n\r\nmorals.  By  this  act,  I  am  tearing  away   the\r\n\r\nproverbial  fig-leaf  from the  last  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation,  as  I wish to show him  up,  naked  and\r\n\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my unfortunate distinction to have been\r\n\r\ncalled  to order by you, Mr Speaker, on  the  very\r\n\r\nfirst  day of this Assembly; and yesterday  I  also\r\n\r\nhad  the doubtful pleasure of being called to order\r\n\r\nagain.  I shall try very hard, Mr Speaker, not  to\r\n\r\nbe  called to order a third time, and not to let it\r\n\r\ngo  down on record that a certain Minister had been\r\n\r\ncalled  to order every day of an Assembly  sitting.\r\n\r\nSo  I  shall, in the true parliamentary  democratic\r\n\r\nstyle, state that this term \"technical\" attached to\r\n\r\nthe  two schools was a terminological inexactitude.\r\n\r\nParliamentary democracy is so long-winded, and I am\r\n\r\na  man  of little words. I have joined the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party because of the action it produces, not\r\n\r\nverbal  diarrhoea, which we have come  across  from\r\n\r\ncertain politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscious of the needs to educate as many of the\r\n\r\ncitizens  as possible and to make good the  neglect\r\n\r\nof  the past, this Government has decided to launch\r\n\r\nout  on  a  mass  literacy and education  campaign.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  would  appear that  every  child  who\r\n\r\nrequires  an education is being catered  for,  with\r\n\r\n321,000   pupils  in  our  primary  and   secondary\r\n\r\nschools, this is far from the truth. There are many\r\n\r\nwho are unable to be in our schools because of over-age,  poverty,  or  ignorance.  Already  more  than\r\n\r\n50,000  pupils  have  registered  for  entry   into\r\n\r\nPrimary 1 for 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a large section of our adult\r\n\r\npopulation,  some of whom work during the  day  and\r\n\r\nothers who are unemployed unfortunately, who attend\r\n\r\nnight  classes  to better themselves  with  further\r\n\r\neducation.   The   Singapore  Council   for   Adult\r\n\r\nEducation alone has an enrolment of 14,000.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe   intention  of  the  Education   Ministry   to\r\n\r\nreorganise  and to expand this work, so that  those\r\n\r\ndesiring  education will be given proper syllabuses\r\n\r\nand receive instruction from qualified instructors.\r\n\r\nNight  sessions can be properly staffed instead  of\r\n\r\nbeing   manned   by   part-time  instructors   with\r\n\r\nindifferent syllabuses or text-books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present most school buildings at night are\r\n\r\ndark  and empty. It is the aim of this Ministry  to\r\n\r\nhave  as  many of its school buildings as  possible\r\n\r\naglow  and  active, so that they will  become  true\r\n\r\nbeacons  of  light  to those  who  desire  to  seek\r\n\r\nknowledge and to leave the darkness of illiteracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it will be asked how the Ministry expects to\r\n\r\ncarry out this ambitious programme of a two-session\r\n\r\nbasis for elementary and secondary schools, and  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  attempt  to  bring  about  a  mass\r\n\r\nliteracy and education campaign for the first  time\r\n\r\nin  the  history of this country. Will it entail  a\r\n\r\nfurther  increase to the already weighty  Education\r\n\r\nbudget?  The Ministry happily does not  think  that\r\n\r\nsuch a step is necessary, because our recent survey\r\n\r\nrevealed that maximum use has not been made of  the\r\n\r\navailable   school  buildings   and   staff,   both\r\n\r\nadministrative and teaching. At present, in English\r\n\r\nprimary school buildings alone, by working on a two-session   basis,  there  will  be  at   least   850\r\n\r\nclassrooms  available for pupils  next  year.  Each\r\n\r\nclassroom  normally  holds 40 pupils.  At  present,\r\n\r\nmost  schools  have a separate principal  for  each\r\n\r\nsession.  There is a case of one principal  looking\r\n\r\nafter   a   17-classroom  school  with   11   empty\r\n\r\nclasses - i.e. only six classes in session. There  is\r\n\r\nno  reason  why one principal cannot look  after  a\r\n\r\nschool  with two sessions, with a slight adjustment\r\n\r\nto working hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that we can do more to meet the needs\r\n\r\nof   education,   if  we  organise  all   available\r\n\r\nfacilities both in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuildings,  equipment and manpower.  Therefore,  as\r\n\r\nfrom  1960  every teacher in Government  and  Aided\r\n\r\nschools  will be required to put in, as a  part  of\r\n\r\nordinary duty and not for payment as overtime work,\r\n\r\na maximum of an extra one-half session. The teacher\r\n\r\nwho  normally teaches in a morning session  may  be\r\n\r\nposted   to  do  an  extra  half-session   in   the\r\n\r\nafternoon,  or an extra half-session at night,  and\r\n\r\nvice-versa. Night session classes will begin from 7\r\n\r\nto 10 p.m. Having been a school-master, as the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin stated earlier this afternoon, I\r\n\r\ncan assure Members of the House that the extra half-session   required  of  teachers  will  not   cause\r\n\r\nteachers  to do more hours than office workers,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  after  taking  into  account  their   free\r\n\r\nperiods during school hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons for deciding on this bold\r\n\r\nmove,  only possible from a P.A.P. Government,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  hoped that the 10,000 teachers  in  service\r\n\r\nwill  respond to this call with proper  spirit  and\r\n\r\nenthusiasm, and thus fulfil their important role as\r\n\r\nnation builders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Education bill at 25 per cent of the\r\n\r\nBudget  is  already high, and it  is  inconceivable\r\n\r\nthat  the  public would agree to an  increase  when\r\n\r\nother  urgent demands for social services, such  as\r\n\r\neasing of unemployment and housing will have to  be\r\n\r\nmet as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as also remarked by the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin,  those who are conscientious teachers  are\r\n\r\nalready  doing such extra hours voluntarily  unsung\r\n\r\nand  unknown, for example, going back to school for\r\n\r\nsports duties, library work, extra curricula  work,\r\n\r\nand  laboratory work. Of course, I do  not  include\r\n\r\nwork  in  Sunday schools. This new ruling therefore\r\n\r\nrecognizes  such  good  work and  distributes  work\r\n\r\nevenly amongst the staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the extra half-session does not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean teaching duties alone. It includes\r\n\r\nextra  curricula work mentioned just now.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso  include committee work on educational  bodies\r\n\r\napproved  of by the Ministry, because the  Ministry\r\n\r\nexpects much more of such committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork in its implementation of the new programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as a result of this extra half-session\r\n\r\nwork,  a  large pool of teachers will be  available\r\n\r\nfor posting elsewhere, not outside of Singapore, of\r\n\r\ncourse.  It  will  then  be  possible  for  greater\r\n\r\nintermingling of teachers in the various streams of\r\n\r\neducation,   and   immediately   bring   about   an\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the standard of language  teaching;\r\n\r\nfor   example,   Chinese   school   teachers   will\r\n\r\nimmediately  improve the standard  of  teaching  of\r\n\r\nChinese  in  English schools and vice  versa.  This\r\n\r\nwill  also  be a big step forward in breaking  down\r\n\r\nthe  walls  of  segregation between  the  different\r\n\r\nstreams of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, at present, physical education is not\r\n\r\ngiven  a proper place in the curriculum because  of\r\n\r\nshortage  of teachers looking after this aspect  of\r\n\r\nwork. Games are also not as well organised owing to\r\n\r\nlack of teachers taking an active interest in extra\r\n\r\ncurricula  activities. It is important to emphasise\r\n\r\nthat  education  is  not just  book  learning.  All\r\n\r\naspects  of  development of the growing human  body\r\n\r\nand mind come within the scope of education, and it\r\n\r\nis the aim of the Ministry of Education to raise  a\r\n\r\nhappy,  strong  and  healthy population  under  its\r\n\r\neducational programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to higher education, it should be\r\n\r\nmentioned   that   the  report  of   the   Prescott\r\n\r\nCommission on Nanyang University will be  published\r\n\r\nshortly.  It  should also be remembered  that  this\r\n\r\nCommission was initiated by the Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nand  that the members of this Commission were  also\r\n\r\nproposed  by  them  and approved  of  by  the  past\r\n\r\nGovernment. When the Prescott Report is  published,\r\n\r\nthis  Government will take active steps to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  future of Nanyang University and its graduates\r\n\r\nwith  responsible Chinese educational  bodies.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  also encourage  the  closest  co-operation  between  Nanyang  University   and   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya, as it is in the interest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that  the  two  institutions  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning should work in close harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, let us recollect that\r\n\r\nbefore  the  P.A.P. took office in the  Government,\r\n\r\nits educational policy was appropriately called the\r\n\r\nspring   source  of  the  nation.  This  Government\r\n\r\nrecognizes that the children of Singapore  are  the\r\n\r\nspring  source of our nation. If we take good  care\r\n\r\nof  it, the spring will develop into a stream which\r\n\r\nwill nourish an oasis; if we neglect it, the spring\r\n\r\nwill be lost in the sands of the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking on\r\n\r\nthe  motion  moved  by  the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday,  most of the Members on  the  Government\r\n\r\nside  stressed  its  aims for  the  improvement  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but did not stress definite  plans  for\r\n\r\nthis  improvement. In his speech, the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister reminded us of his Party's victory in  the\r\n\r\nelections and that it has formed the Government, as\r\n\r\nthough it is only the P.A.P. which is truly working\r\n\r\nhard  in  the interests of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey forget that their success today is through the\r\n\r\nefforts  of all political Parties in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nparticularly  of the Members of the past  Assembly,\r\n\r\nwhich have resulted in the Constitution under which\r\n\r\nwe now have self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to mention these matters because of the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the Government in this Assembly  that\r\n\r\nOpposition Members are trying to hinder the efforts\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is making for the good of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We have reiterated several times in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  that  the duties of the Opposition  are  to\r\n\r\nmake   constructive  criticism  and  to  give   co-operation  to  the Government in carrying  out  any\r\n\r\nprogramme   which  is  good  for  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  think  it  is  undemocratic  if  the\r\n\r\nattitude  is that the Opposition cannot  voice  its\r\n\r\nopinions  or  criticise  the  Government.  Such  an\r\n\r\nattitude  shows how far the Government is from  the\r\n\r\ndesire  to  consolidate  the  various  peoples   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be remembered, Mr Speaker, that we\r\n\r\nhave often said that the P.A.P. has been successful\r\n\r\nin forming the Government by the votes of only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54  per  cent of the people, and that there are  46\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the electorate who still do not  have\r\n\r\nfaith in the P.A.P. Government and do not support its\r\n\r\npolicy.  If  the P.A.P. Government  works  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the people irrespective of whether  they\r\n\r\nlike   the  P.A.P. or  not,  the  Government   can\r\n\r\nconsolidate  and  unite  the  people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the way the Government\r\n\r\nis  carrying out its work, without careful thought,\r\n\r\nsuch as cutting the pay of Government employees, is\r\n\r\nnot good. This is a step which has given rise to  a\r\n\r\nfeeling of unrest among the employees because  they\r\n\r\nfeel as though the Government is now taking revenge\r\n\r\non  those  who are mainly from the English-educated\r\n\r\nclass. I am of this opinion because I often read in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers that the P.A.P. leaders have stated\r\n\r\nthat  the main body of the educated people did  not\r\n\r\nvote for the P.A.P. - meaning, most of the Government\r\n\r\nemployees.  So not long after the P.A.P. held  the\r\n\r\nreins of Government, it took action to cut the  pay\r\n\r\nof  Government  employees. This appears  to  be  in\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  what has  been  stated  in  the\r\n\r\npapers.  This  will surely create the feeling  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  is  said by the P.A.P. it will  put  into\r\n\r\npractice.  So,  Mr Speaker, I hope that  the  step\r\n\r\ncarried  out to cut the pay of Government employees\r\n\r\nis not one of revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I have to speak on this matter, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, because the step which has been taken\r\n\r\nis,  first of all, taken in a hurry. Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has stated, as mentioned in the  speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, that the cuts  in\r\n\r\npay have been imposed on those who are most able to\r\n\r\nafford  them. What surprises me is that the opinion\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  seems to  be  that  Government\r\n\r\nemployees  belong to that class of people  who  are\r\n\r\nmost  able  to  bear pay-cuts. I  believe  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Government officials are not all  living\r\n\r\na  very  easy life because they have duties towards\r\n\r\ntheir   families   and  their  earnings   are,   as\r\n\r\nacknowledged  by  the Government, just  sufficient,\r\n\r\nand  commensurate  with their  responsibilities  in\r\n\r\nGovernment service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the points which concern the efforts of\r\n\r\nGovernment  and which attract my attention  is  the\r\n\r\nmethod  of  bringing  the people  together  as  one\r\n\r\nnation.  But  I  believe these  efforts  will  take\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time  and  energy.  The   effort   to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  the  views of these  people  who  have\r\n\r\ndifferent   languages,   different   cultures   and\r\n\r\ndifferent religions is one which, as I have  stated\r\n\r\nearlier, will take a long time and a lot of  energy\r\n\r\nto  carry  out. Therefore, if it is true  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wishes to carry out what it has  stated,\r\n\r\nsteps  should be taken from now to consolidate  and\r\n\r\nbring  together  these people who  are  of  various\r\n\r\nraces in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the steps which probably the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not seen fit to take is the  effort\r\n\r\nto  raise  the standard of living of the Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore so that they could live on the same level\r\n\r\nas   that   which  has  been  achieved   by   other\r\n\r\ncommunities. I say this, Sir, not because I wish to\r\n\r\nraise  the question of communalism. This, I  myself\r\n\r\nknow,  is dangerous. But what I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nis:  Can we bring together all these races if there\r\n\r\nare   communities   which  are  still   living   in\r\n\r\nconditions   far   below   those   of   the   other\r\n\r\ncommunities? I do not wish to say here,  nor  do  I\r\n\r\nwish  to demand the right, but what I wish to  draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of this Assembly to is that we today\r\n\r\nare  progressing under the constitution of a  self-governing State of Singapore. How did we  go  about\r\n\r\nto  shape this constitution? At the time when  this\r\n\r\nconstitution was formulated, we almost met with,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  say, a deadlock, but I could say, a course\r\n\r\nthat could be very difficult to follow. We are glad\r\n\r\ntoday  that we have reached a successful conclusion\r\n\r\nin  framing this constitution. In this constitution\r\n\r\nthere  is one chapter - in fact in its preamble - where\r\n\r\nit   is  mentioned  that  the  Government  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for safe-guarding the special  position\r\n\r\nof   the  Malays,  for  supporting,  fostering  and\r\n\r\npromoting their interests in all fields. But I see,\r\n\r\nin  the efforts of the Government to carry out  all\r\n\r\nthe requirements as contained in this constitution,\r\n\r\nno mention at all about this. So, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this is a matter which makes us  feel\r\n\r\nvery  concerned, especially on the part of my Party\r\n\r\nwhich  has  fought  very hard to  bring  about  the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of all this, in the constitution.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  the present Government  is  now\r\n\r\ngoing ahead with another constitution. But if  this\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  which has been done unintentionally,\r\n\r\nthen I urge that this matter be put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to say something\r\n\r\nabout the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry for that interruption.\r\n\r\nThere was some difficulty with the interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the\r\n\r\ndebate on the transfer of power to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development, I have drawn the attention of\r\n\r\nthe Government to-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I would like to emphasise that I  have  a\r\n\r\nmandate   from  the  inhabitants  of  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  to convey to this House matters concerning\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  their living  conditions.  When  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  the  efforts of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development in relation to  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  are  carried out without any communication\r\n\r\nto  me,  this does not mean that I am objecting  to\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  made  by  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  What I hope is that I will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticipate and help the Government in solving  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of the people in the Southern Islands.  I\r\n\r\nknow that we are here not to improve any particular\r\n\r\nward  but we are here specifically for the interest\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore as a whole. From what  I\r\n\r\ncan gather, the Southern Islands is a ward which is\r\n\r\nvery backward compared to other areas at present in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I fear that a casual survey conducted by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  National Development  will  not\r\n\r\nbring about an improvement in the living conditions\r\n\r\nof the people there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things which I find important\r\n\r\nthere: firstly, the education of the people in  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands  is lagging far  behind  compared\r\n\r\nwith the education of the people in other wards  in\r\n\r\nSingapore; secondly, many facilities on the islands\r\n\r\nare  inadequate. The Government, as I have read  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers, make a hue and cry about this  and\r\n\r\nthat - for   instance,  to  help  the  fishermen   by\r\n\r\nproviding  them with fishing equipment or  gear.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that such assistance alone will not have  its\r\n\r\ndesired  effect  on the future generations  of  the\r\n\r\ninhabitants  there. The reason why I  say  this  is\r\n\r\nthat  despite the Government's efforts  to  provide\r\n\r\nequipment or fishing gear for the fishermen  there,\r\n\r\nmany capitalists or financiers have stepped in  and\r\n\r\nundertaken   to  provide  the  required  equipment.\r\n\r\nBecause  they are unable to overcome oppression  by\r\n\r\nthe capitalists, although they are in possession of\r\n\r\nadequate  equipment  which  can  result   in   good\r\n\r\ncatches,  their income is still far from  adequate.\r\n\r\nIt  is  imperative  for the Government  to  provide\r\n\r\nseveral co-operative societies which can look after\r\n\r\nand control their income and their earnings. As  it\r\n\r\nis  at  present,  although there  are  co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties,   these   societies   have   not    been\r\n\r\nfunctioning. They are lacking in guidance,  in  the\r\n\r\ntrue  sense  of  the  word,  from  the  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned. Therefore, I state that it is imperative\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to improve  such  a  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which I have discovered in\r\n\r\nthe speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. There  is\r\n\r\nan absence on the part of the Government to mention\r\n\r\nsteps or efforts to deter Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nsubversion  among  the  people  of  Singapore.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with the Government side saying  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is a non-Communist Government but is\r\n\r\nnot  taking steps to prevent Communist infiltration\r\n\r\namong  the  people.  I fear that  this  absence  to\r\n\r\nmention steps to deter Communist subversion will be\r\n\r\na  serious threat in the future. We have  seen  how\r\n\r\nStates  which  failed  to  take  steps  to  prevent\r\n\r\nCommunist  infiltration have resulted in chaos  and\r\n\r\ntrouble  in  those  States.  Consequently,  several\r\n\r\nlives   were   lost  as  a  result   of   Communist\r\n\r\nactivities.   Therefore,   before   such    matters\r\n\r\neventuate,  it  is necessary for the Government  to\r\n\r\nstress  the  steps to be taken in order to  prevent\r\n\r\nCommunist infiltration in the island of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to remind that, in our efforts to bring\r\n\r\nabout  unity among the people of Singapore, serious\r\n\r\nattention must be paid to bringing about parity  in\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood  of  the people of  Singapore  with\r\n\r\nparticular  reference to the Malays  who,  I  would\r\n\r\nunhesitatingly say, are far lagging behind  in  all\r\n\r\nwalks of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara who delivered his speech\r\n\r\non  policies which embody the substance  which  has\r\n\r\nbecome  the basis for this Government to  formulate\r\n\r\nits   Five-Year  Plan  in  order  to  establish   a\r\n\r\nprosperous society. What is more pleasing  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Malay language, which was previously mentioned\r\n\r\nby  the  ex-Minister for Education of Singapore  as\r\n\r\nbeing  a language fit only for those who wished  to\r\n\r\nbecome  peons, or policemen, etc., is  today  being\r\n\r\nwritten  down  in the history of Singapore  because\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore delivered\r\n\r\nhis  speech  in  Malay, which is  accepted  as  the\r\n\r\nnational  language by the present  Government,  and\r\n\r\nthis  cannot  be  denied by anyone.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government did not have  the  courage  to\r\n\r\nfight for the Malay language and to claim it as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  sole  national language of this  country.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I again emphasise, on this  question\r\n\r\nof  a national language, if we view especially  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's education policy which has been  drawn\r\n\r\nup  and which can be implemented, it clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the objectives of the present Government will\r\n\r\nnot  remain  in theory only but will  be  put  into\r\n\r\npractice,  and  it  will be shown  that  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  is being fought for and being implemented\r\n\r\nas the sole national language on this island and on\r\n\r\nthe  same  footing  as it is in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to analyse the points one by one\r\n\r\ncontained in the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara, I think that will take a long time, because\r\n\r\nanalysing  the plan takes as much time  as  putting\r\n\r\r\ninto   practice   the  Five-Year   plan   of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  I  wish to clarify  here  certain\r\n\r\nmatters  in  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech,\r\n\r\nwhich  have caused dissatisfaction on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members. Firstly, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  expressed her fears over the  measures\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the Government in cutting allowances.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  this measure of cutting allowances is a  very\r\n\r\nbold  step taken by the Government in the interests\r\n\r\nof  our  State, which is faced with the problem  of\r\n\r\nfinance.  This courageous step should  be  accepted\r\n\r\nwith   calmness  and  goodwill  by  all  concerned,\r\n\r\nbecause,  in actual fact, the allowances that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  cut  contribute towards the finances  of  the\r\n\r\nState  which  is facing financial difficulty.  This\r\n\r\ncontribution prevents the loss of the  islands  off\r\n\r\nSingapore, as we have seen in the past the sale  of\r\n\r\nChristmas  Island, but the Government  led  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will not go begging for money in  order  to\r\n\r\nfill its coffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai expressed his fears\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Deputy Prime Minister who  moved  the\r\n\r\nmotion  did not mention any matters except that  of\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  the P.A.P. This cannot  be  denied\r\n\r\nbecause before we gained self-government the speech\r\n\r\nby  the Governor was made by himself, but this time\r\n\r\nthe speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas prepared by the Cabinet of the governing Party,\r\n\r\nand  therefore  coincides with the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nParty that is governing the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing the abolition of the City Council in\r\n\r\nthe  previous session, the Member said  we  do  not\r\n\r\ngive opportunities for the people to administer the\r\n\r\nState,  which will result in the emergence of  many\r\n\r\nleaders;  but we should remember that  this  matter\r\n\r\nhas already been finalised. There is no need for me\r\n\r\nto  raise this matter again in this Assembly, as it\r\n\r\nis  a  waste  of  time. If there  exist  many  more\r\n\r\nbodies, they will only delay the functions  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The main question that aroused the fear\r\n\r\nof  the  Member  for Geylang Serai is  nationalism.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of nationalism shall we form? And what is\r\n\r\nthe basis? Is it Malay? That, briefly, is the cause\r\n\r\nof the fear expressed by the Opposition Member, the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai. I feel it is not an  easy\r\n\r\nmatter  to  unite the races of so many  diversified\r\n\r\nreligions  and colour, but it is equally impossible\r\n\r\nfor a father or a mother to produce children of the\r\n\r\nsame  size,  the same black hair. Therefore,  in  a\r\n\r\nState with a multi-racial population, the basis for\r\n\r\nthe  consolidation of the people is the feeling  of\r\n\r\nundivided allegiance to that State, and it is  this\r\n\r\npolicy  that has become the basis for the  struggle\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. in its fight to establish a Malayan\r\n\r\nnation on this island. Concerning the fears of  the\r\n\r\nsaid  Member when he mentioned a society  which  he\r\n\r\nreferred  to  as  Malayan,  but  non-Communist,  it\r\n\r\nshould not be stated that Malaya is separated  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What should be stated is  a  socialist,\r\n\r\nnon-Communist Malaya. It is clear that the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwhich  holds  the  reins  of  government  now,   is\r\n\r\nfighting  for  the  merger  of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. Therefore,  if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nmention a Malayan society, it follows that we allow\r\n\r\nthe  British  colonialists to split  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of the Government said yesterday, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin expressed his fears and  doubts\r\n\r\nabout the relationship of the new State that it  is\r\n\r\nwithout a captain. I think only people who have not\r\n\r\nbeen on board a ship do not know who is the captain\r\n\r\nand who are the crew. Also, because of shortage  of\r\n\r\nfunds,  the  Member  accused  this  Government   of\r\n\r\nslaughtering their own staff first and robbing  the\r\n\r\nproperty of others in order to help someone else. I\r\n\r\nsay that if we take money from the right pocket and\r\n\r\nput  it  into the left pocket, it is not  stealing.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  a ship wishes to make a safe journey,  the\r\n\r\nholds of the ship should be well balanced. If it is\r\n\r\nheavy  on  one side, it will be difficult  for  the\r\n\r\ncaptain to navigate. For that reason and in fact it\r\n\r\nis  true,  there are many people living on  a  high\r\n\r\nlevel  and there are also many people living  on  a\r\n\r\nlow  level.  I was born in an attap hut  and  I  am\r\n\r\nstill  living in an attap hut, without  electricity\r\n\r\nand without pipe water; and I know the difficulties\r\n\r\nof  the  people. Therefore, the reduction of income\r\n\r\nof  the  higher  class in order  to  build  up  the\r\n\r\ncoffers  of the lower income group is not  robbing,\r\n\r\nbut  merely to put right the imbalance. If  we  are\r\n\r\ncarrying  two  tins of water, and  if  one  tin  is\r\n\r\nempty, do not fill the empty tin with stones.  That\r\n\r\nis stupid. But divide the water equally in each tin\r\n\r\nso  that there will be a proper balance. Also, with\r\n\r\nregard to the cutting of allowances, the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  said that there are many parents who  have\r\n\r\ncomplained, and asked their children to  economise.\r\n\r\nThis  shows that they can still economise. The poor\r\n\r\npeople cannot economise any longer. If we draw  the\r\n\r\nsarong up, we cannot conceal the lower part, and if\r\n\r\nwe  conceal the lower part, the upper part will  be\r\n\r\nseen. Therefore, to put the whole thing right, this\r\n\r\nmatter should be carefully considered. I think that\r\n\r\nis better than to expose the whole body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in his speech, the Member for Tanglin mentioned that thousands of students had\r\n\r\nbeen  dismissed from school. I think it is not  for\r\n\r\nme  to  reply, because this incident did  not  take\r\n\r\nplace  during  the time of the present  Government,\r\n\r\nbut it took place\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the past Government was in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, because I have visited the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands,  it  is proper that I give a clarification\r\n\r\nconcerning the remarks made by the Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands, who has expressed his doubts  as\r\n\r\nto the work carried out by the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  The  Member for the Southern  Islands\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the projects of the present Government,\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech, are according to their conception, not  for\r\n\r\nthe  people. I am completely surprised because they\r\n\r\nknow  that  this Government is a P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\nEvery  government must follow its outlined  policy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  impossible for the P.A.P. Government, which\r\n\r\nholds  the  reins of government now, to follow  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Labour Front, or for that matter that\r\n\r\nof  any other Party. They must remember that  every\r\n\r\nprogramme  launched  by the Government,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government, was approved by the  people\r\n\r\non 30th May last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning his allegation that, in the view of\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  the  Opposition  is   merely   a\r\n\r\nhindrance,  it  is  not  true  to  say   that   the\r\n\r\nOpposition   is  here  to  hinder.  If   we   allow\r\n\r\nOpposition   Members  to  speak   for   four   days\r\n\r\nconsecutively, then time is lost. There is no doubt\r\n\r\nabout  that.  But  we  give an opportunity  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  to think further - whether  they\r\n\r\nthink  along the lines of the policy of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThis  is not robbing, which has been misunderstood.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  interests of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthey  can give constructive criticisms. But if they\r\n\r\ncriticise for the sake of the outside group and not\r\n\r\nfor  the  people of Singapore, we will  defend  our\r\n\r\npolicy.   This   does  not   mean   that   we   are\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  On this matter the  Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands  and also other  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  have  stated that  the  P.A.P. victory\r\n\r\nrepresented  only 54 per cent of the  electorate - 54\r\n\r\nper  cent  only  of the electorate  voted  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in the elections. They say that this  means\r\n\r\nthat  there is still a balance of 46 per  cent  who\r\n\r\ndid not vote. They forget that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46  per  cent is divided amongst various  political\r\n\r\nParties  represented  by  the  Opposition.  On  the\r\n\r\naverage, more than half of these Parties voted  for\r\n\r\nthe present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the steps to cut the allowance of\r\n\r\nGovernment employees, which they alleged was  taken\r\n\r\nin revenge because they did not vote for P.A.P.,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  are some Members who are taking  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to inflame the feelings of those people\r\n\r\nwho  are dissatisfied, and who oppose the programme\r\n\r\nof   the  Government.  But  if  we  consider   this\r\n\r\ncarefully,  the  cut  in the  allowances  does  not\r\n\r\ndamage the economy of their domestic life at  home.\r\n\r\nI  myself  have lived on $80 a month with seven  or\r\n\r\neight  dependants,  and,  including  myself,   nine\r\n\r\npeople. It is not a headache to me. If these people\r\n\r\nsuffer  a reduction of $250 - some only $20 - I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it will be a burden to them. It is necessary\r\n\r\nthat the people who can afford it should contribute\r\n\r\nif  they  really  love the State  which  is  facing\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are people who mention\r\n\r\nthat  the  consolidation of the  various  races  of\r\n\r\nSingapore into one people will take a long time. We\r\n\r\nadmit that. Therefore we do not admit that when the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  is in power,  we  can  tomorrow\r\n\r\nevolve  one nation in Singapore. So we must mention\r\n\r\na  Malayan  nation, and this is being practised  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. Here I would like to say\r\n\r\nthat  in  the headline news appearing on the  front\r\n\r\npage  of  today's paper, the Utusan  Melayu,  dated\r\n\r\nFriday,  17th  July,  the Tunku  said  not  to  use\r\n\r\ncommunal sentiments. This means that the leaders in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya are fully  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers  which will arise in a State  comprising  a\r\n\r\nplural society. The P.A.P. Government is constantly\r\n\r\naware of this and vehemently opposes any element or\r\n\r\ngroup  which tries to inflame communal feelings  in\r\n\r\nthe  State of Singapore. This, I think, is in  line\r\n\r\nwith  the  attitude  of  the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nwhich is led by Dato Abdul Razak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on this issue there are people who put forward the question whether we can bring about\r\n\r\nthis  unity, this one nation, if there is a section\r\n\r\nof  the people who are very much backward? I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  emphasise  that in a  socialist  society,\r\n\r\nthere is no class distinction. Therefore, if we say\r\n\r\nthat we are going to fight for the poor people, the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the poor will be brought up to a  par\r\n\r\nwith the middle class. If the livelihood is low  we\r\n\r\nwill  raise  it up to the same level of the  middle\r\n\r\nclass, so that the livelihood of all the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will be on a par. If there is a community\r\n\r\nwhich  is lagging behind, then we say that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to raise the standard of living of the people\r\n\r\nwho  are  oppressed.  We will  try  to  uplift  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of these people to the same level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  has  said that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\ndid not mention in his speech the special rights of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays. On this matter, permit me to speak  in\r\n\r\nthe  debate,  as  I see there is a  debate  on  the\r\n\r\namendment   moved   by  the  Member   for   Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan.  I  would  like to emphasise  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is based on the present constitution  in\r\n\r\nwhich   the  special  rights  of  the  Malays   are\r\n\r\nmentioned.   This  is  in  the  preamble   of   the\r\n\r\nconstitution.  Therefore, if  the  running  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment is based on this Constitution, it  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. Government respects and will  put\r\n\r\ninto  effect  the special rights of the  Malays  as\r\n\r\nembodied  in the preamble of the constitution.  But\r\n\r\nwe  do not wish to take pride in saying that we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  fight for the rights of the  Malays.  We\r\n\r\nwish  to show it by deeds. If we are going to fight\r\n\r\nonly  in  theory  but  not  in  practice,  that  is\r\n\r\ndeceiving the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. Government has been formed a few months, and I have been appointed to\r\n\r\ntake   office   in   the   Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. As far as I know, among the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  are  the  most  depressed  are  the\r\n\r\ninhabitants of the Southern Islands. In  the  main,\r\n\r\nthey  comprise Malays. Therefore, I have been given\r\n\r\nthe  task  of making an investigation and rendering\r\n\r\nall possible assistance to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my efforts seem to have caused dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nto  the Member for the Southern Islands because  he\r\n\r\nwas not invited to accompany the team which visited\r\n\r\none island after another in the course of its work.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  feel,  Mr  Speaker,  that   it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that I should stress that my  visit  was\r\n\r\nnot  in  my capacity as the Member for Bukit Timah,\r\n\r\nto investigate someone else's area but my visit was\r\n\r\nmade  in my capacity as the representative  of  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department.  As  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Ministry of National Development,\r\n\r\nI   wished   to   investigate  to  get   first-hand\r\n\r\ninformation. Therefore my visit to the Islands came\r\n\r\nunder  my official capacity. If every investigation\r\n\r\nmade  by the Government has to be notified  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  concerned, I am afraid that the  Government\r\n\r\nadministration would not run smoothly.  It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  even notice servers, if they wanted to  serve\r\n\r\nnotices,  would be obliged to inform the Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  division  concerned. It is very difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to run a State or a  country  like\r\n\r\nthis.  So,  on this issue, I would like to  clarify\r\n\r\nthat   the  P.A.P.  Government  is  always   giving\r\n\r\npriority to the most backward places with a view to\r\n\r\nhelping  them  first.  Mr  Speaker,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nadmitted  by  the  Member for the Southern  Islands\r\n\r\nthat  the  backward  areas  require  education  and\r\n\r\nattention  to  be  given to the livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention to make a full report of\r\n\r\nmy  visit  and  what  I  did  there.  But  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation of the Member for the Southern Islands,\r\n\r\nI would like to say that all these difficulties and\r\n\r\nall  the  backwardness are the results of the  past\r\n\r\nColonial government. They must have forgotten  this\r\n\r\nsection  of  the  people who live in  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands. This is clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of this House to the\r\n\r\nefforts  of the past Government. There was  in  the\r\n\r\nyear  1957  a  vote  for  the  development  of  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands amounting to $80,000, but in  1958\r\n\r\nthe vote was reduced to $60,000, and in 1959 it was\r\n\r\nfurther reduced to $45,000. From the point of  view\r\n\r\nof  people who think like children, this means that\r\n\r\nif the vote is less, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe area is very well developed. But this is to the\r\n\r\ncontrary.  This  is  most  regrettable  because  it\r\n\r\nshowed   that   the  officers  from  the   Ministry\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the management  of  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  did not know how to make use  of  the  sum\r\n\r\nvoted.  I  repeat that in 1957, out of  a  vote  of\r\n\r\n$80,000, only more than $8,000 was spent; in  1958,\r\n\r\nout  of  $60,000, only more than $12,000 was spent.\r\n\r\nThe  balance went to the Government. It means  that\r\n\r\nthe  people of the Southern Islands did not receive\r\n\r\nany help at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, out of the $45,000 voted until the\r\n\r\n12th  of  April,  only $175 has  been  spent.  This\r\n\r\nclearly  shows  that  the past Government  had  the\r\n\r\nmoney but they did not know how to use it. For that\r\n\r\nreason  we  hurriedly went to the Southern  Islands\r\n\r\nwithout  a permit from the Member for the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  because  I know the conditions  there  are\r\n\r\nvery backward, and if we are to wait for permission\r\n\r\nfrom  each  division,  it  is  possible  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot function smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning education, I know what conditions will\r\n\r\nexist in the Southern Islands, if no positive  step\r\n\r\nis  taken by the Government. I think as to the fate\r\n\r\nand  destiny of the people in the Southern Islands,\r\n\r\ntheir children will be bequeathed with a much  more\r\n\r\ndepressed  state  of  life than  that  which  their\r\n\r\nforefathers    experienced.   The    re-orientation\r\n\r\nprogramme which was carried out last year  was  not\r\n\r\nimplemented  in the Southern Islands because  of  a\r\n\r\nshortage of teachers. Therefore, they only  receive\r\n\r\nMalay  education  today. On this matter  also,  the\r\n\r\nprogramme of the Malay Education Council, which was\r\n\r\naccepted  by the Government in 1957, has  not  been\r\n\r\ncarried out to the full in the Southern Islands. So\r\n\r\nmuch  so  that  there is no teacher  to  teach  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  English  or religion,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhaving  failed  to  send teachers  to  teach  these\r\n\r\nsubjects there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I wish to emphasise, on the\r\n\r\nstate  of the Southern Islanders, that if there  is\r\n\r\nno effort to resettle them or improve conditions, I\r\n\r\nthink  they  will face a bleak future  because  the\r\n\r\nIslands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill shrink through erosion and the fishing grounds\r\n\r\nwill  become  very  limited. This  will  result  in\r\n\r\nhardship  for  the people, and their children  will\r\n\r\nhave  no further opportunity for education. On some\r\n\r\nof  the  islands there is a school with 30  pupils,\r\n\r\nbut  consider how we are going to educate 30 pupils\r\n\r\nup  to  Standard VII with only two, three or  seven\r\n\r\nteachers. If we do not find new ways and means, the\r\n\r\npeople will face hardship in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the livelihood of the people. We\r\n\r\nare not a Party which likes to boast, as alleged by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Southern Islands who said  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  far from the truth that we were going to  help\r\n\r\nthe fishermen in the Southern Islands. However,  we\r\n\r\ndid  visit  them,  made  investigations  and  would\r\n\r\nrender  any help that is required by them. But  the\r\n\r\nMember for Southern Islands was not even aware that\r\n\r\nI  was in the Southern Islands! It would only be  a\r\n\r\nfuss  to publicise, say, a visit there on such  and\r\n\r\nsuch  a date by the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development, or by  a  party\r\n\r\nfrom the Primary Production Department. We make our\r\n\r\nvisits  quietly, get the results, and then announce\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the establishment of co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties  or  on  the question of capitalists  who\r\n\r\nhave  oppressed the fishermen, we already know  the\r\n\r\nposition and have a plan which will be carried  out\r\n\r\nin the not too distant future, and which the Member\r\n\r\nfor  the  Southern Islands will then know.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, I would like to say to the Member for the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands, who has expressed doubts  because\r\n\r\nhe had no opportunity of being with the party, that\r\n\r\non the co-operation which he has promised we of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  say. `Thank you', and I am prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  complaints  from  Opposition  Members   for\r\n\r\nsubmission  to my Minister. If the suggestions  are\r\n\r\ngood,  we  will willingly accept them. However,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  inform the Member for the Southern  Islands\r\n\r\nof all our efforts because, as a Government, we are\r\n\r\nresponsible  to all the people, and if  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  the  Southern Islands wishes to  be  similarly\r\n\r\nresponsible, the best way is for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim  to  cross the Floor. We are responsible  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment, not the Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands has expressed\r\n\r\nregrets  that  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech\r\n\r\ndid  not  touch  on  the suppression  of  Communist\r\n\r\nideologies in Singapore. Copies of the speech  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sent to Members, and I think people  who  say\r\n\r\nthere is no mention of the Communists in the speech\r\n\r\nmust  be asleep when the speech was being read,  or\r\n\r\nhave  not yet read it. Page 12 of the copy we  sent\r\n\r\nto  every Member concerns subversive activities and\r\n\r\nindicates the policy of the P.A.P. Government.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for the Southern Islands need not therefore\r\n\r\ntouch  on  this  subject  because  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nalready   taken   a   firm   stand   on   Communist\r\n\r\ninfiltration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, we have indeed in this House a\r\n\r\nvery  strange Opposition, and that is an Opposition\r\n\r\nwhich  cannot decide on its attitude to the  recent\r\n\r\ncuts  which  Government has had to  impose  in  the\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances of its officials. We have  had\r\n\r\nfrom   one  of  the  SPA  representatives  in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   that   is,  from   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten,  a bouquet, and that was very  strange\r\n\r\nindeed,  coming  as it did from  a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  She said that she had no objection  to\r\n\r\nthe  principle  underlining the  cuts  in  variable\r\n\r\nallowances.   In   fact,   she   complimented   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the  fair  way  in  which  it  had\r\n\r\ndistributed  these  cuts  in  variable  allowances.\r\n\r\nWell,  there was good reason for what  she  had  to\r\n\r\nsay.  She was doubtless aware that when these  cuts\r\n\r\nwere  imposed, they were imposed from the  top.  It\r\n\r\nwas the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nwho  bore  the greatest proportions of  the  salary\r\n\r\ncuts. I need not labour this point, but I think  it\r\n\r\nis common knowledge that there are Ministers in the\r\n\r\npresent Government today, who are carrying out  the\r\n\r\nportfolios of two Ministers in the past regime  for\r\n\r\nless than half the money which one drew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten had only one criticism\r\n\r\nto  make.  She  said that she felt that  a  month's\r\n\r\nnotice should have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to the Staff side so that the  persons\r\n\r\nconcerned  would  be  able  to  make  their  budget\r\n\r\nadjustments to lessen the shock from a  sudden  cut\r\n\r\nin these variable allowances. Now there was another\r\n\r\nMember  of the SPA, the hon. Member for Tanglin - all\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of  this House know  he  is  a  great\r\n\r\nbeliever  in  moral  rearmament, but  nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthough  he has his strong convictions, he  realises\r\n\r\nthat  being a headmaster he would also be  affected\r\n\r\nby  the rather sudden reduction in emoluments, that\r\n\r\nafter  working  so  hard to  get  a  seat  in  this\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly, which is worth $500, he finds\r\n\r\nthat,  in fact, after having lost $400, he will  be\r\n\r\nto  the good only by $100. That did not square with\r\n\r\nhis   beliefs   which   were  inspired   by   moral\r\n\r\nrearmament, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the hon. Member for Tanglin shouted in this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  he had heard whispers of rumours  that\r\n\r\nthe  cuts  were inspired by spite, and he expressed\r\n\r\nthe hope that this was not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, we have also heard what the\r\n\r\nformer Chief Minister - he is the present Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill - had to say about these salary  cuts  this\r\n\r\nafternoon.  He  carried  the  charges   very   much\r\n\r\nfurther.  He  pointed  an  accusing  hand   at   me\r\n\r\npersonally,  at  my  colleague,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  and  at the Deputy Speaker,  and  charged\r\n\r\nthat,  with duplicity, we had wormed our  way  into\r\n\r\nthe  confidence of Government servants, we had  got\r\n\r\ninto  their associations, we had climbed over their\r\n\r\nbacks to political power, and only then we face him\r\n\r\nhere  in  this Assembly on the Government side.  He\r\n\r\nsaid   that  we  were  behaving  in  a  crude   and\r\n\r\nirresponsible  way in our dealings with  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService with whom we had been closely associated in\r\n\r\nthe  past. We were meting out to them the  sort  of\r\n\r\ntreatment  which  we had never  expected  from  our\r\n\r\nColonial masters at a time when we were united with\r\n\r\nthe  Staff  side  in  a common  opposition  to  the\r\n\r\nColonial  masters, Sir. Now, is that a fair  charge\r\n\r\nto  make?  I can assure the ex-Chief Minister,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, that there are no grounds for\r\n\r\nthese  charges. What was the position in the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  as I knew it? It is true that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance, the Deputy Speaker and myself were closely\r\n\r\nassociated with the government servants' unions and\r\n\r\nstaff   associations   in   pressing   for   better\r\n\r\nconditions of service in the past. It is true  that\r\n\r\nwe  were very closely associated with them; but for\r\n\r\nthe  past  two or three years before  we  left  the\r\n\r\ngovernment   service  we  were  not  in   any   way\r\n\r\nassociated with the staff associations and  unions.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is no truth whatsoever in the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  we climbed on their backs to political power.\r\n\r\nI  can  say that I was closely associated with  the\r\n\r\nStaff side of the Civil Service Council, but I  can\r\n\r\nremember  no  occasion when any of us  brought  any\r\n\r\npolitical considerations into the work that we were\r\n\r\ndoing.  I can assure the Member for Cairnhill  that\r\n\r\nhad  we done so we would have broken our esprit  de\r\n\r\ncorps.  There would have been no team spirit  among\r\n\r\nourselves and there would have been no hope of  our\r\n\r\nachieving  the things that we were able to  achieve\r\n\r\nfor our colleagues in the government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, and Members of the House, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  I  need say or need maintain  that  any\r\n\r\nconsideration  should be given  to  the  accusation\r\n\r\nthat  the  leaders of the present  Government  were\r\n\r\ninspired  by spite when they found it necessary  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the variable allowances of serving officers\r\n\r\nin  the  civil service. The whole of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore know that this Government's policies  are\r\n\r\nnot  based on personal vendettas but are  based  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes  submitted to the electorate  and  which\r\n\r\nare  approved by the electorate. The leaders of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are well known for their  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nattitude. When power has passed into our hands,  do\r\n\r\nwe  deal  ruthlessly with the expatriate  officers?\r\n\r\nNo,  we  are prepared to negotiate cuts in variable\r\n\r\nallowances with their associations in the same  way\r\n\r\nas  we  were prepared to negotiate with  the  Staff\r\n\r\nside  of  the Whitley Council. What the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill overlooked to mention just now  were  the\r\n\r\nconsiderations which had led the present Government\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the variable allowances of its  serving\r\n\r\nofficers.  He  has  said  not,  a  word  about  the\r\n\r\ndepletion of the past reserves, built up by  former\r\n\r\nGovernments  over  many years, by  the  spendthrift\r\n\r\nGovernment of the past. He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  not  told  anybody here  that  large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney - sums amounting to $400,000 - were spent by  the\r\n\r\nlast Government in joy-rides round the world at the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers' expense. He has not said anything  about\r\n\r\nthe  alarming  growth  of expenditure  on  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments in relation to total expenditure and  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  Government  income  in  the  post-war\r\n\r\nyears.  The  ex-Chief  Minister,  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  would  doubtless  have  at  least  once\r\n\r\nlooked at the present state of the Estimates. If he\r\n\r\ndid  take  the trouble to look at page 378  of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates,  which his own Government had  approved,\r\n\r\nhe  would  have  seen  there listed  and  itemized,\r\n\r\ndepartment  by department, the expenditure  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments  which  were  then  under  his\r\n\r\ncharge.  He  would have found that  under  Personal\r\n\r\nEmoluments, the total expenditure was $115  million\r\n\r\nfor  1959. The estimated total expenditure for 1959\r\n\r\nwas   $268  million.  For  Other  Charges  Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent,  more  than  $118 million;  for  Special\r\n\r\nExpenditure, more than $35 million. If he had taken\r\n\r\nthe  trouble to go through the Estimates, he  would\r\n\r\nhave  found that the total expenditure on  Personal\r\n\r\nEmoluments  alone was 42.82 per cent of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure on the public service. Now, the  actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  salaries is very  much  more  than\r\n\r\n42.82  per cent because, as everybody knows,  under\r\n\r\nthe  item for Other Charges Annually Recurrent  are\r\n\r\nto be found a lot of items relating to the salaries\r\n\r\nof  Government servants, so that it would be  fair\r\n\r\nto  say  that out of the total expenditure of  $268\r\n\r\nmillion, more than 57 per cent has been expended on\r\n\r\nthe  Personal Emoluments of Government officers.  I\r\n\r\nam informed that in a highly industrialised country\r\n\r\nlike  the United Kingdom, the total expenditure  on\r\n\r\nGovernment services does not amount to more than 15\r\n\r\nper  cent of the Government revenue. If I am wrong,\r\n\r\nI stand to be corrected by the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to his turn to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will deal with the charges that were made\r\n\r\nby  the Opposition that the Government did not  put\r\n\r\nits  proposals  to the Staff Side  of  the  Whitley\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would  say, Mr Speaker, that there is no  truth\r\n\r\nwhatsoever in that charge. I know it as a fact that\r\n\r\nmy  colleague the Minister for Finance did put  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  proposals to the Staff  Side  of  the\r\n\r\nWhitley Council. Now, what did the Staff Side  say?\r\n\r\nIt  had no mandate to negotiate. It must wait until\r\n\r\nits  constituent bodies held general meetings in  a\r\n\r\nmonth's  time before it could negotiate. It  wanted\r\n\r\nan indefinite postponement. It did not want genuine\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with  Government.  My  colleague  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has already said publicly that\r\n\r\nagreement to this would have meant expenditure  and\r\n\r\na  loss  to the Treasury of more than $1 million  a\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, and Members of the House, we\r\n\r\nhave published our Five-Year programme. We need  to\r\n\r\nfind  the money to finance that programme. We  have\r\n\r\nto find it first by putting our own house in order,\r\n\r\nby pruning unnecessary expenditure and reducing the\r\n\r\ncost  of  government. That is the function  of  all\r\n\r\nreputable governments - governments that do not spend\r\n\r\nthe   taxpayers'  money  to  the  extent  of  about\r\n\r\n$400,000 a year on personal jaunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that there was a unilateral imposition\r\n\r\nof  these  cuts? Now, Mr Speaker, and  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House, I have been closely associated with the\r\n\r\nWhitley system and I know that the essence  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem is that both sides should always be ready at\r\n\r\nall  times to enter into negotiations resulting  in\r\n\r\nbinding  agreements. What did the Staff  Side  mean\r\n\r\nwhen  it  said that it had no mandate  to  discuss?\r\n\r\nWhen I discussed the constitution of the Staff Side\r\n\r\nwith  the  former colonial Government,  I  made  it\r\n\r\nplain to that Government that we on the Staff  Side\r\n\r\nwould  never accept the position that we  would  be\r\n\r\ntreated as a mere consultative body. We pressed  it\r\n\r\nhome  to  them  that we wanted to be treated  as  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  Staff  Side  that  could  always  conclude\r\n\r\nbinding  agreements  with its employers - the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  was  explained  to   us   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  the  Official  Side   could   not\r\n\r\nconclude  any  such agreement with us  because  the\r\n\r\nofficials who met us were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat most representatives of the Government whom they\r\n\r\nserved,  and the constitutional position  was  that\r\n\r\nthey  could  never be sure whether the monies  that\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  be found to honour  the  agreement\r\n\r\nwhich the officials made with us would be voted  by\r\n\r\nthe   Government   in  power.  The   old   colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment  did nevertheless give us an undertaking\r\n\r\nthat,  as far as possible, agreements made  by  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Side would be constitutionally honoured by\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the day. Did the Staff Side make\r\n\r\nany  counter  proposals?  Did  it  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  it should, in the  words  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Mountbatten, be given a month's  notice\r\n\r\nto  make Budget adjustments to lessen the shock? It\r\n\r\ndid  nothing  of the sort. It tried  to  shirk  its\r\n\r\nresponsibility by passing the matter  over  to  its\r\n\r\nconstituent bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, and Members of the House, I\r\n\r\nknow  the Minister for Finance quite well. He is  a\r\n\r\nvery  hardheaded,  practical man,  and  will  never\r\n\r\nallow  himself to be taken for a ride  by  anybody,\r\n\r\nmuch  less by the Staff Side of the present Whitley\r\n\r\nCouncil. Now, why did the Staff Side want to  \"pass\r\n\r\nthe buck\" to its constituent bodies? The Staff Side\r\n\r\nknows   that   there  are  31  unions   and   staff\r\n\r\nassociations in its organisation, and it also knows\r\n\r\nthat  only 6,000 represented by the unions  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  total number of more than 25,000 employees are\r\n\r\naffected by the salary cuts - only 6,000 out  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number of more than 25,000 are  affected  in\r\n\r\nany  way  by the salary cuts. The Staff  Side  knew\r\n\r\nthis  and also knew that it would be difficult,  in\r\n\r\nview of this, to get unanimity from its constituent\r\n\r\nmembers to oppose the Government proposals. After a\r\n\r\ngenuine  attempt at negotiations and  when  it  was\r\n\r\nclear  to  the Minister for Finance that the  Staff\r\n\r\nSide  did  not intend to have any negotiations,  he\r\n\r\nwas forced to issue a directive that the cuts would\r\n\r\nbe  imposed with effect from 1st July. Is there any\r\n\r\nbreach of trade union practice? Show me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me refer to what the Staff Side did in\r\n\r\nthe  last year of the Lim Yew Hock regime.  On  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that  the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  was\r\n\r\nreorganising the Government services including  the\r\n\r\nteaching service, normal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers  who  formed  the  bulk  of   the\r\n\r\nteaching service were asked to agree to a reduction\r\n\r\nin  their  basic  pay  scales.  Their  maximum  and\r\n\r\nminimum  and  incremental steps in the  pay  scales\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  lower than they were  then,  and  new\r\n\r\nnormal class recruits were to be recruited on  even\r\n\r\nlower basic pay scales. The same thing was done  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the nurses. Did the Staff Side make this\r\n\r\nan  issue  when the former Government was  fiddling\r\n\r\nabout  with  their pay scales and  not  their  mere\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances? When I was on leave prior  to\r\n\r\nretirement,  I associated myself with  the  normal-trained  teachers  in resisting the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  plan on the grounds that if there  were\r\n\r\nto  be  sacrifices, it would be more  equitable  to\r\n\r\nplace  the  burden  on those in the  higher  income\r\n\r\nbracket  than  on those in the lower in-come  group\r\n\r\nwho  might very well be unequal to the burden. What\r\n\r\ndid  the former Chief Minister do? He got the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary,  his subordinate, to warn  me  twice  in\r\n\r\nwriting that, as I was being paid a salary when  on\r\n\r\nleave  prior to retirement, I should not get myself\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  such matters. Then again,  the  Staff\r\n\r\nSide  representatives came to see me when I was  on\r\n\r\nleave  prior  to retirement, and asked  me  whether\r\n\r\nthey could get the firm of Lee and Lee to represent\r\n\r\nthem  in  arbitration proceedings in respect  of  a\r\n\r\nclaim  for  overtime  against  the  Lim  Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I had been associated with  the  Staff\r\n\r\nSide  in  negotiating a new structure for  overtime\r\n\r\nwith  the previous colonial Government which  would\r\n\r\nhave  cost the Lim Yew Hock Government millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  to implement. What did the Staff  Side  do\r\n\r\nwhen  the  previous Government refused to implement\r\n\r\nthe  new structure for overtime on the grounds that\r\n\r\nit  was too costly? And we can even give credit  to\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock Government that it was quite alive\r\n\r\nto  what the Staff Side had in mind. They asked  me\r\n\r\nand  Lee  Kuan Yew to represent them at arbitration\r\n\r\nproceedings,  which our Prime Minister  refused  to\r\n\r\nagree to. There had never been a bleat against  the\r\n\r\nformer Government for refusing to implement the new\r\n\r\novertime structure for the civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice, despite the fact that it had received  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of officials who represented the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock Government in that discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

When the former Government told them that  it\r\n\r\nwas  afraid  to  play, did they  press  the  matter\r\n\r\nfurther?  No,  because  they  knew  this   was   an\r\n\r\nunreasonable proposal which would never receive any\r\n\r\npublic support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker and Members of the House, I am not mentioning all this with any malicious motives to\r\n\r\nvilify  my former colleagues in the civil  service,\r\n\r\nbut  I am mentioning this to show that there is  no\r\n\r\ntruth  in  the  charge  made  against  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment by the Staff side and by the Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  that Government  has  unilaterally\r\n\r\nimposed   cuts   in  variable  allowances   without\r\n\r\nconsultation with the unions, which is a breach  of\r\n\r\ntrade   union  practice.  Rather  the  facts  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  Staff side,  representing  only\r\n\r\nabout a third of the Government employees affected,\r\n\r\ndid  not  at any stage want negotiations  following\r\n\r\ncuts  in the variable allowances. Now what has  the\r\n\r\nStaff  side  been  doing?  They  have  smashed  the\r\n\r\nWhitley machinery which we had taken years to build\r\n\r\nup,  and have inaugurated a new organization  which\r\n\r\nthey termed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil of Joint Action. The Staff side itself does\r\n\r\nnot  think  that the Whitley machinery is  a  good-enough forum for collective bargaining in the civil\r\n\r\nservice. It has said that it has taken the step  to\r\n\r\nform a Council of Joint Action to bring it home  to\r\n\r\nGovernment that it must follow accepted trade union\r\n\r\npractice in its dealings with the Staff side.

Member for Tanglin to support us in our\r\n\r\nfight  against the colonial Government for  denying\r\n\r\nus  family  allowances and giving family allowances\r\n\r\nto  the expatriate officers, he assured us that  he\r\n\r\nwas  completely  on our side.

He claimed credit for\r\n\r\nthe  Shop  Assistants  Ordinance,  for  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance, for the Clerks Employment Ordinance, and\r\n\r\nwhat have you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, in the very short time that I\r\n\r\nhave  been in office, I have been astounded to find\r\n\r\ndefects in our labour laws which completely escaped\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of a former Chief  Minister  and  a\r\n\r\nformer  Minister for Labour. I have looked  up  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ordinance, and I have particularly noted  a\r\n\r\nsection in it which is designed to punish employers\r\n\r\nfor  anti-union activities. What do I find? I  find\r\n\r\nthat  all that the section says is that an employer\r\n\r\ncommits  an  offence  only  when  at  the  time  of\r\n\r\nentering  into  a contract of employment  with  his\r\n\r\nemployee  he places a restriction on that  employee\r\n\r\nagainst  his  joining a trade union or against  his\r\n\r\nparticipating  in trade union activities.  That  is\r\n\r\nall that the Ordinance says. It does not prevent an\r\n\r\nemployer from dismissing an employee, after he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  engaged,  because he joins a trade  union  or\r\n\r\nassociates himself in trade union activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government, unlike the former Labour\r\n\r\nFront  and  the  S.P.A. Governments,  is  genuinely\r\n\r\nbacked by the labour movement in Singapore and is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlike  the former Governments, openly on the  side\r\n\r\nof  labour.  Go to the Ministry of Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\nnow.  As you come into the entrance you will see  a\r\n\r\nnotice  board, in the clearest of terms in writing,\r\n\r\ninviting  any representative of any trade union  to\r\n\r\ncall  in; and if he does so, he will have the right\r\n\r\nto   speak   personally  to   the   Minister,   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, the  Permanent  Secretary\r\n\r\nand the Controller of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, employers know that this Government is very\r\n\r\nloyal to labour and very pro-labour, and because of\r\n\r\nthat  they are trying to adopt a get tough attitude\r\n\r\nwith  their  employees. The legislation  which  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Cairnhill  claims  credit   for   is\r\n\r\ncompletely inadequate for the purposes that I  have\r\n\r\nin mind. That section of the law does not enable me\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  the  situation adequately.  Powers,\r\n\r\nhowever, will be taken under amending Ordinances to\r\n\r\nenable  employers,  who impose such  conditions  on\r\n\r\ntheir  employees  after they have been  engaged  or\r\n\r\ndismiss  them  on  their  joining  a  union   after\r\n\r\nengagement, to be adequately punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, as a Government, shall see to it that such\r\n\r\npunishments are adequate for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another inadequacy in the labour law which the\r\n\r\nformer  Labour Government seems to have  overlooked\r\n\r\nis  that  section of the law dealing with  payments\r\n\r\nfor  overtime.  The  law as it stands  enables  the\r\n\r\nemployers   to  apportion  the  same  wages   which\r\n\r\nemployees used to receive before statutory overtime\r\n\r\nwas  introduced  to include a portion  representing\r\n\r\nwages  and a portion representing overtime, and  in\r\n\r\nthis way a large number of employers have been able\r\n\r\nto  evade the provisions of the law regulating  the\r\n\r\npayment of overtime. Cases have been brought to  my\r\n\r\nnotice  where before the introduction of the Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance employees were receiving as little as  $3\r\n\r\na day. When this Ordinance was introduced employers\r\n\r\ntook the opportunity of apportioning that wage into\r\n\r\ntwo portions, one portion representing the wage and\r\n\r\nanother portion representing the overtime element,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that the employer said to his employee:  \"$2.50\r\n\r\nis your wage and 50 cents is the overtime which you\r\n\r\nwill  receive.\"  Was anything done  by  the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment to correct this position?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, under the present law, if an employee who\r\n\r\nis  daily-rated is paid by the day, he has no  wage\r\n\r\nperiod  for the purposes of these laws and  can  be\r\n\r\ndismissed  without notice. In addition, because  he\r\n\r\nhas no wage period, he is not eligible for many  of\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  under these laws. I can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Cairnhill  that  we  shall  introduce\r\n\r\namending legislation to correct all these defects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, what about the apprentices? Apprentices\r\n\r\nwho  work  long hours without payment of  overtime,\r\n\r\nannual leave, sick pay and other benefits which are\r\n\r\nprovided under the existing laws for adult  workmen\r\n\r\nare  not  protected by these laws, on  the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat  they do not work under a contract of service.\r\n\r\nThis also we shall put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, there is the question of contract\r\n\r\nlabour.  It  is  well known that the employment  of\r\n\r\nlabour  on contract terms leads to the exploitation\r\n\r\nof man by his fellowman. Cases have been brought to\r\n\r\nmy  notice  where  large factories  which  own  the\r\n\r\nbuildings and machinery in them, which control  the\r\n\r\nprocesses  used  in  those factories,  nevertheless\r\n\r\nchoose  to employ labour to work in those factories\r\n\r\non  contract  terms. Was the former Government  not\r\n\r\naware of all this? It looks as if they did not want\r\n\r\nto be aware of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only a few instances which I have had\r\n\r\ntime   to   mention  this  evening,  to  show   the\r\n\r\ninadequacies in our existing labour legislation. Is\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill  prepared  to  say  now\r\n\r\npublicly that he wants to claim the credit for  all\r\n\r\nthese Ordinances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill just now cast a number of aspersions on the Members of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  expressed very grave  concern  for\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  He  said, \"The  Government  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  their  concern for  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement,  and has promised to build a Trade  Union\r\n\r\nHouse costing millions of dollars to assist the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmovement.\"  He said that it was the same Government\r\n\r\nwhich   was  trying  to  destroy  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.  He  said  that if  he  had  had  similar\r\n\r\ndesigns, he would have closed down many unions when\r\n\r\nhe  was  in  office  as Chief  Minister.  Now,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I can assure you that we, as a Government,\r\n\r\nhave  a  real interest in the trade union movement,\r\n\r\nand the labour movement generally, in Singapore. It\r\n\r\nwill  be  our  first  task this session  to  create\r\n\r\nconditions of industrial stability without which it\r\n\r\nwill  not be possible for us to give effect to  our\r\n\r\nFive-Year  plan  as  announced  during  the  recent\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that not only must the trade\r\n\r\nunion  and  labour movement be placed on  a  proper\r\n\r\nfooting  for industrial stability, but it  is  also\r\n\r\nequally  important  that this  movement  should  be\r\n\r\nprovided with the facilities and amenities  whereby\r\n\r\nits   special  contribution  to  the  life  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  can be enhanced and manifested.  We  are\r\n\r\ndetermined  to correct past neglect on that  score.\r\n\r\nPending the selection of a suitable site and  plans\r\n\r\nfor  the erection of a Trade Union House worthy  of\r\n\r\nour  new  policies  in  these matters,  a  spacious\r\n\r\nGovernment building within easy reach of the centre\r\n\r\nof  the city is being renovated and redecorated  to\r\n\r\nserve  as a temporary trade union house until  such\r\n\r\ntime as the permanent structure we have in mind  is\r\n\r\nerected. We are sincere in everything that  we  say\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the labour movement and  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have prepared delightful things to say here this evening to show the close association\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Member for Cairnhill and unions  like\r\n\r\nthe   Petty   Traders  Association,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPainting and White-washing Workers Union and  other\r\n\r\nsuch  like  unions with which hon. Members  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government were closely  associated.  You\r\n\r\nhave  ruled, Mr Speaker, that all this  should  be\r\n\r\nreserved  till the debate on the Second Reading  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill which was tabled two days ago, so that  we\r\n\r\ndo not enter into discussion on this matter at this\r\n\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr   Speaker,  I  think  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  did make certain charges  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for having desires to destroy  community\r\n\r\nassociations    in    Singapore.    She    referred\r\n\r\nparticularly  to the pathetic cases of  a  few  ex-politicians who had spent a lot of time  and  money\r\n\r\nin  building  up  their prestige in such  community\r\n\r\ncentres to advance their own political interests. I\r\n\r\nthink  one of them mentioned recently that  he  was\r\n\r\nsurprised that, in spite of all the efforts he  had\r\n\r\nput in, others who left the community centres alone\r\n\r\nwere  able  to get seats in the present Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly,  whereas  he and others  were  very  much\r\n\r\ndisappointed, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, experience of the Department of Social Welfare has revealed that some politicians\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  community  centres  for  their   own\r\n\r\npolitical activities and, in one case, a politician\r\n\r\nhad for several years been using a community centre\r\n\r\nas  a centre of operations in order to build up his\r\n\r\nprestige in that area for the last election.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think it will be necessary for me to name that\r\n\r\npolitician. In another case, a politician tried  to\r\n\r\nmake use of members of youth clubs in order to help\r\n\r\nhim  in  his  political campaign.  But  fortunately\r\n\r\nmembers  of the youth clubs concerned resisted  his\r\n\r\napproach.  Mr  Speaker, if  there  should  be  any\r\n\r\npolitical activities in community centres, they are\r\n\r\nbound  to  result in friction between  the  various\r\n\r\nparties,  and  activities in the community  centres\r\n\r\nwill  suffer as a result. For example, in the Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Community  Centre  when  two  candidates\r\n\r\nstanding  for  election in the  area  used  it  for\r\n\r\npolitical purposes, the community centre remained a\r\n\r\ndead  centre  for many years, Sir. Mr Speaker,  we\r\n\r\nhave no such designs. It was not necessary for  ex-Government servants like the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Speaker and myself to get mixed up with\r\n\r\ncommunity centres to gain seats in this Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.  We were brought here not by  such  petty\r\n\r\nconsiderations. We were brought here by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe masses of the people which supported the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin   its  work,  both  in  the  former  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly and in the City Council. It was that  mass\r\n\r\nsupport  that brought us to this Assembly.  So  let\r\n\r\nthis  serve  as  a  warning to all  those  who  are\r\n\r\nbleating  about  the way in which we  handle  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  By this time  they  should  be\r\n\r\naware  that the way to get a seat in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nis  not by getting themselves involved in the  work\r\n\r\nof   these  centres  but  rather  in  getting   for\r\n\r\nthemselves  and their policies the support  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think it is necessary for me to say a few words on the attitude of the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  towards  these community  centres.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Government is alive to the need to  foster\r\n\r\ncommunity  living and to enrich  the  life  of  our\r\n\r\npeople through healthy, purposeful and constructive\r\n\r\nactivities. The reorganisation of the community and\r\n\r\nrecreation  services  that  are  afforded  to  the,\r\n\r\npublic, especially to the young, will be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  the utmost despatch by this Government and  a\r\n\r\nnew  spirit  will be infused into those responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  control  of these services  so  that  the\r\n\r\ncentres in which these services are given will more\r\n\r\ntruly  reflect  the  needs and the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses  of the people. Government is interested  in\r\n\r\nthose community development projects which directly\r\n\r\nassist  the economic and living conditions  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  It is, therefore, hoped to centralise  the\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   these   centres   under   a   single\r\n\r\norganisation truly representative of the masses  of\r\n\r\nour   people,  and  to  afford  these  centres  the\r\n\r\nfacilities and the amenities which will enable them\r\n\r\nto  stimulate  the creative, cultural and  artistic\r\n\r\nactivities  especially of our young people.  It  is\r\n\r\nour intention to make these centres the foci of the\r\n\r\neducational,  social, cultural and artistic  uplift\r\n\r\nof our young population. If community centres could\r\n\r\nbe successfully utilised for such purposes and also\r\n\r\nfor  the integration of communal groups, this  will\r\n\r\nassist   materially   towards  achieving   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and  solidarity.  The  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Culture  and my Ministry will play  their  full\r\n\r\npart in bringing about the reorganisation that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  in  mind.  Let  me  explain,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  what  the aims and objects  of  community\r\n\r\ncentres should be. Community centres are the  media\r\n\r\nthrough  which  the  aims  and  intentions  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can be communicated and explained to the\r\n\r\npeople.  They  are focal points for  programmes  of\r\n\r\nactivities  organised to promote  the  welfare  and\r\n\r\nrecreational needs of our people and involve  group\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  social,  cultural,  health   and\r\n\r\neducational   projects  on  a  mass  basis.   These\r\n\r\nprojects  include  language  classes  for   adults,\r\n\r\nmusic, drama, folk dancing, vocational training for\r\n\r\nthe  underprivileged, and recreational  activities.\r\n\r\nThese  centres also are the basis for the  training\r\n\r\nof  future  leaders. Let me say here and  now,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that it is not the intention of Government\r\n\r\nto    take   over   full   control   of   community\r\n\r\norganisations,  as  these organisations  can  still\r\n\r\ncarry  on  if  they  succeed in finding  their  own\r\n\r\npremises.  Government has only taken over  its  own\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres and intends to  run  these  with\r\n\r\nstaff  from the Department of Social Welfare  under\r\n\r\nthe   control   of  a  single  organisation   truly\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the masses of the people. Leaders\r\n\r\nare not debarred from taking part in the activities\r\n\r\nin  these  centres  as they are organised  for  the\r\n\r\nmasses.   I   hope  that  that  will  clarify   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  stand  on  the  question  of  community\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have recently been charged with being a dictator because I issued instructions\r\n\r\nrecently  that open-air cinema shows and activities\r\n\r\nin  youth  clubs and community centres must  cease.\r\n\r\nWhat   were  the  circumstances  which,   made   it\r\n\r\nnecessary for me to issue those instructions? It is\r\n\r\nwell  known  that  some youth clubs  and  community\r\n\r\ncentres exist mainly on the proceeds of such cinema\r\n\r\nshows  and  a  few  members  of  the  committee  of\r\n\r\nmanagement year after year monopolise the  business\r\n\r\nas  a result of' which members lose interest in the\r\n\r\nclubs  and  these community centres. I am  informed\r\n\r\nthat  some  committees of management have  not  had\r\n\r\nannual general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeetings for years because of the possibility of  a\r\n\r\nchange  of management and the fear that new members\r\n\r\nmay  get  control  of  the  cinema  show  business.\r\n\r\nFurther,  the  accounts of many clubs  are  not  in\r\n\r\norder  and  this  is a regular source  of  conflict\r\n\r\nbetween members. These do not contribute towards  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  development in youth clubs  and  community\r\n\r\ncentres. Cinema shows are not limited to members of\r\n\r\nyouth clubs and community associations only, as the\r\n\r\nidea is to get large audiences in order to make the\r\n\r\nshows pay. The result of this is that gangsters and\r\n\r\nsecret   society  members  have   found   these   a\r\n\r\nconvenient  meeting  place during  open-air  cinema\r\n\r\nshows.  The Police could not arrest them as members\r\n\r\nof  an  unlawful assembly since they  could  always\r\n\r\ngive  the excuse that they were attending a  cinema\r\n\r\nshow.  Further,  it gives them a chance  to  demand\r\n\r\nprotection   money,  not  only  from   the   cinema\r\n\r\noperators  but also from the hawkers who are  bound\r\n\r\nto  congregate  around when there  is  an  open-air\r\n\r\ncinema  show. In a recent case in the  Sims  Avenue\r\n\r\nCommunity  Centre,  a member of  a  secret  society\r\n\r\nmurdered a member of the staff of the film operator\r\n\r\nand  he was subsequently hanged. Most of the  open-air  cinemas are operated on a commercial basis for\r\n\r\ngain  so  that  only popular films likely  to  draw\r\n\r\ncrowds  are  exhibited. Since the majority  of  the\r\n\r\naudience  are  boys and girls of school-going  age,\r\n\r\nshows  involving fights and gangsters are regularly\r\n\r\nshown.  These exercise a very bad influence on  our\r\n\r\ngrowing  young population. It is the  intention  of\r\n\r\nGovernment to undertake to provide educational  and\r\n\r\ncultural films in youth clubs and community centres\r\n\r\nto take the place of these commercial films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one last point which I wish to refer to and that is a reference by the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Cairnhill  earlier  on  in  his  speech  that\r\n\r\nGovernment has not stated what policies it has  for\r\n\r\ndealing with the question of unemployment. I  would\r\n\r\ninform   Members   of  the  Opposition   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has plans for the relief of unemployment\r\n\r\non both a short-term and a long-term basis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  these  plans  will  in  the  near  future   be\r\n\r\npublished.  The  intention  is  to  concentrate  on\r\n\r\nprojects  employing the maximum number of unskilled\r\n\r\nor  semi-skilled workers and these short-term plans\r\n\r\nwill be closely related to national development. In\r\n\r\nthe  formulation  of  these  plans,  the  need  for\r\n\r\nkeeping our young and growing population in gainful\r\n\r\nemployment,  so as to reduce the opportunities  for\r\n\r\nand  the  incidence  of anti-social  activities  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  might otherwise be engaged,  has  been\r\n\r\nconstantly  kept in view as well as  the  need  for\r\n\r\naffording immediate relief to those suffering great\r\n\r\nhardship through prolonged periods of unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been taken to task by the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  for having instructed the discontinuance\r\n\r\nof  sugar  and  rice rations to all those  employed\r\n\r\nunder  the  unemployment relief  scheme  which  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government had initiated. Mr Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nfound  when  I  took office that there  were  about\r\n\r\n1,200 persons employed on these unemployment relief\r\n\r\nschemes and they were paid at the rate of $3 a day.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, they were geting dry rations  costing\r\n\r\nabout 80 cents per person. Mr Speaker, I have been\r\n\r\nvery  closely associated with workmen in the course\r\n\r\nof  my  political activities and I know that  there\r\n\r\nare  many  workmen in Singapore  who  are  in  fact\r\n\r\nreceiving  $3 a day as a living wage. The  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  paying $3 a day  plus  rations  as\r\n\r\nrelief for unemployment. I considered that if these\r\n\r\nrations were withdrawn we would be able to save  as\r\n\r\nmuch as about $1,000 a day and that would enable us\r\n\r\nto  employ another 300 on this unemployment  relief\r\n\r\nwork.  Is there anything wrong because we did this?\r\n\r\nHave  we  done anything wrong because we did  that?\r\n\r\nThat  is  just  common  sense  in  dealing  with  a\r\n\r\npractical situation. If there are workers  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to work for this wage, was it  not  right\r\n\r\nthat  we  should withdraw these rations  to  enable\r\n\r\nanother 300 to be employed on the proceeds?  Surely\r\n\r\nthat cannot be wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on a point of explanation.

Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning the debate on\r\n\r\nthe  policy  speech today in principle and  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  it is not without reluctance on my part  to\r\n\r\naccept the speech but it should be remembered  that\r\n\r\nat the moment when we are faced with the problem of\r\n\r\nestablishing a society and we should  know  how  we\r\n\r\nare  going to implement these policies in  a  self-governing state. I have carefully examined what has\r\n\r\nbeen  said and what has been embodied in the papers\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been circulated to all the Members.  I\r\n\r\noffer  my congratulations to the Government in  its\r\n\r\nsincere desire to prove that it will implement  the\r\n\r\npolicies laid down, particularly that Malay will be\r\n\r\nmade  the  national  language. That  is  a  serious\r\n\r\nmatter  for  attention which  the  Malays  on  this\r\n\r\nisland and I personally support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To revert to what is embodied in the speech\r\n\r\ndelivered  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  we  only\r\n\r\nwant  to  get clarification particularly  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side  that we have  no  desire  at  all\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  to  create  misunderstanding   in   our\r\n\r\nattempt  to establish a new society which we  think\r\n\r\nfit.  This,  I hope, will receive consideration  so\r\n\r\nthat  everything will be made known to this  House,\r\n\r\nthe  people  in Singapore, and the whole  world  at\r\n\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Government's education\r\n\r\npolicy,   I  would  like  clarification  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  to  the  true  state  of   affairs.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  my interpretation, I would  ask  for\r\n\r\nclarification  as  to whether  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to put aside the policy of the  Malay\r\n\r\nEducation Council. It has been explained  that  the\r\n\r\neducation  policy  of the Government  is  based  on\r\n\r\nthree principles. Firstly, the Government accepts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  All-Party  Report on Chinese Education,  1955.\r\n\r\nThe  Report mentioned equal treatment for  all  the\r\n\r\nfour channels of education: English, Malay, Chinese\r\n\r\nand  Tamil.  Secondly,  the  Government  agrees  to\r\n\r\naccept   Malay   as  the  national  language.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will encourage non-Malays to  learn  and\r\n\r\nstudy  the  Malay language, but in the  meantime  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government will clarify the position with\r\n\r\nregard  to  encouraging the  growth  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Thirdly, the syllabus, which  apparently\r\n\r\nwill  be  reviewed, will give priority to practical\r\n\r\nsubjects such as mathematics and science, which are\r\n\r\nof use to industry to fill the needs of society and\r\n\r\npriority  will also be given to the  study  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, and the Hon. the Minister for Education, according to my interpretation of the\r\n\r\neducation policy of the Government, education is of\r\n\r\nthe  first  importance, and the first principle  of\r\n\r\nthe  education policy of the Government shows  that\r\n\r\npriority is given to the acceptance of the 1955 All-Party  Committee Report on Chinese Education  only.\r\n\r\nThat   is  a  Committee  formed  by  the  coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment four years ago. Mr Speaker,  this  goes\r\n\r\nto  show  indirectly  that the  present  Government\r\n\r\nperhaps   unconsciously  adopted  such  a   policy.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  my  opinion, it is contrary  to  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  a Party holding the reins of government\r\n\r\ntoday,  although it mentions that similar treatment\r\n\r\nis  given  to all the four languages. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  it  is  true that this Government  is  to\r\n\r\nuphold  the  interests of the masses,  it  has  not\r\n\r\nmentioned  at  all or clarified in the  speech  the\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  the Malay education policy  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education Council, Singapore, a policy which\r\n\r\nwas accepted and carried out by the old Government,\r\n\r\nand  may  be carried out by the present Government.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened is that the rights of the Malays,\r\n\r\nor  to be more accurate, their special position far\r\n\r\nfrom   receiving   equitable  treatment - let   alone\r\n\r\nrecognize  the status of Malay education - has  been\r\n\r\nneglected  or deliberately belittled. This  is  our\r\n\r\nconcern when we heard the speech delivered  by  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara concerning  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not the slightest intention of creating\r\n\r\nthings  which  are undesirable in our struggle  for\r\n\r\nthe rights of the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle says \"revitalising Malay\r\n\r\neducation itself\". The phrase \"revitalising itself\"\r\n\r\nas  I  understand it is not firm, not positive.  We\r\n\r\ncannot use vague or loose phrases, but we should be\r\n\r\nmore  firm  or  positive. The  terminology,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  should  be  as follows:  \"will  give  new\r\n\r\nspirit  in  uplifting and the  development  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay   language   itself\",   because   the    word\r\n\r\n\"revitalising\" can be construed to mean that  Malay\r\n\r\neducation  which was previously vitalised,  is  now\r\n\r\ndead,  and  therefore,  this  Government  tries  to\r\n\r\nrevitalise  it is this the true intention  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Mr Speaker? This is  the  fact  which\r\n\r\nshould be emphasised to all. The general opinion is\r\n\r\nclear, that Malay education, about which previously\r\n\r\nthere  had  been  an  attempt  to  bury  through  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  of reorientation, has been reestablished\r\n\r\nby   the   Malay  Education  Council.  It  is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of this Government, elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to  govern, and time to  give  new  spirit\r\n\r\ntowards   uplifting   the  development   of   Malay\r\n\r\neducation. Then only can we implement Malay as  the\r\n\r\nnational language of our country, in order to  meet\r\n\r\nthe   needs  of  a  multi-racial  society   in   an\r\n\r\nindustrialised country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we now come to the stage where we would like to make a common policy regardless of\r\n\r\nrace.  This has become our policy, and I once again\r\n\r\nextend  my  congratulations to the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  of the P.A.P., which has the  courage  to\r\n\r\nmake  Malay the national language. It can  be  said\r\n\r\nthat this policy was inspired and backed by my  own\r\n\r\norganisation,    the   United    Malays    National\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  but  I  would  like  to  remind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that the Malays in particular would take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to voice our opinions in order  to\r\n\r\nfind  a healthy and constructive way so that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no room for doubt in the future. We  have\r\n\r\nsupported  the  policy to make Malay  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage, and I have also explained the position of\r\n\r\nthe education policy of the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to make the Malay language\r\n\r\nspecially  the  national language is  not  an  easy\r\n\r\nthing  to  accomplish, but could it be accomplished\r\n\r\nwithin  the  period  of  the  five  years  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment   or  maybe  longer?  Accordingly,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Malays, or my own Party in particular,\r\n\r\nsupport the policy of the P.A.P., which is  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  today,  in making  Malay  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage, but I would like to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to the fact that  whilst  we  make\r\n\r\nMalay the national language, let every Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe Government that exists today help the Malays in\r\n\r\ntheir  struggle  to  achieve a higher  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving,  which is part of our struggle to eradicate\r\n\r\ncommunalism from our land forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malays, as I have explained\r\n\r\njust now, always adopt a spirit of compromise; that\r\n\r\nmust  not  be overlooked. They support, as  I  said\r\n\r\njust  now,  the policy of the P.A.P. to make  Malay\r\n\r\nthe national language. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my\r\n\r\nlong-term  view,  if I am wrong I  am  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  criticism,  what  is  the  policy  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the  process  of  doing   what   is\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Singapore Constitution concerning\r\n\r\nthe  position of the Malays, which has been  agreed\r\n\r\nto  by  the  P.A.P  during the Rendel  Constitution\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  do not wish to remark unnecessarily\r\n\r\nbut  I  would  explain to this House that  if  this\r\n\r\nGovernment does not provide special privileges  for\r\n\r\nthe  Malays,  they  will continue  to  become  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers,  etc, as has been expressed. I  heard  the\r\n\r\nexplanation just now of the Member for Bukit Timah,\r\n\r\n\"The  preparations  to shape  the  new  nation  are\r\n\r\nready.\"  I am prepared to say that the preparations\r\n\r\nmay   be  ready,  but  these  preparations  do  not\r\n\r\nemphatically stress to raise the standard of living\r\n\r\nof  the  Malays who are backward and poor; they  do\r\n\r\nnot  come  from the capitalist or the  intellectual\r\n\r\nclass  and  others.  I  would  like  to  draw   the\r\n\r\nattention of the Government whose policy it  is  to\r\n\r\nmake  Malay the national language. Is this the  way\r\n\r\nto help the Malays today? How many Malays are to be\r\n\r\nthe  future graduates of the University of Malaya,\r\n\r\nas compared to the Nanyang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity    graduates?   Whether   the    Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  degrees  will  be  recognized  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, only time will tell. In my opinion, the\r\n\r\npolicy  speech  delivered by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  omitted to mention the special position  of\r\n\r\nthe  indigenous people of Singapore,  that  is  the\r\n\r\nMalays,  and  therefore it has become an  important\r\n\r\nissue which has nothing to do with encouraging  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language. This will not help the  Malays  to\r\n\r\ncompete  against the foreigners, if  their  special\r\n\r\npositions  are  not  implemented,  not  to  mention\r\n\r\ncommunalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.

Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, concerning the question of a nation which  was\r\n\r\nasked  by  the Hon. the Prime Minister in reply,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to clarify before I continue  with  my\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have hurt the feelings of the Hon. the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  I  wish to apologise. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nexplain that, in my opinion, we are today only in a\r\n\r\nstate  of  self-government. Just as the Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah has explained just now, the  state  of\r\n\r\nnationhood is absent. Similarly, the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, which is independent, has not been able  to\r\n\r\nformulate  a nationhood. This is in the process  of\r\n\r\nbeing  formed. The language I use is Malay. What  I\r\n\r\nam  aiming  at are the non-Malays. Mr  Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like   to  emphasise  that   that   is   my\r\n\r\ninterpretation  as to what was asked  by  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. I do not for a moment consider that\r\n\r\nthe  non-Malays who are domiciled in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nnot  our  brothers. They are our brothers and  have\r\n\r\nthe same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights  in  all matters according to the rules  and\r\n\r\nlaws of the country existing today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to emphasise to this House\r\n\r\ntoday  is the education policy which I talked about\r\n\r\njust  now. The non-Malays have good experience  and\r\n\r\nqualifications. Many of them are in the  University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya and in Nanyang University, and they will\r\n\r\ngraduate  with degrees which will be recognised  by\r\n\r\nthe   Government  and,  in  the  case  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, have perhaps already been recognised by\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  Therefore  there  is  no  golden\r\n\r\nopportunity for Malays at all to stand on the  same\r\n\r\nfooting.  It is left to the Government  to  clarify\r\n\r\nthe  ways and means of attaining this, so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  move  on a par with others, with one aim,  one\r\n\r\nmethod and with one objective. That is what we  are\r\n\r\naiming  for, because the Malay middle schools  have\r\n\r\nnot  yet  been  established. We all understand  the\r\n\r\ninadequacies.  The  percentage  of  Malays  in  the\r\n\r\nfields  of engineering, medicine, and law, as  well\r\n\r\nas  others  is very small. This too has  become  an\r\n\r\nimportant  issue  to us. How can  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  help the Malays, so that they can be  on  a\r\n\r\npar  with others, so that within five years we  can\r\n\r\ncreate  a  society with one aim-as I have explained\r\n\r\njust now-namely, that Singapore will be one hundred\r\n\r\nper   cent   free   from  the  Colonial   clutches.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government's\r\n\r\neducation policy is still a source of concern to my\r\n\r\norganisation,  particularly with  regard  to  Malay\r\n\r\nchildren, whose standard of education is  very  low\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, there is another point, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  It  is  connected with  the  question  of\r\n\r\neducation.  Can  the  Hon. Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nclarify the education policy of the Government with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  teaching  of  religion  in   Malay\r\n\r\nschools?   Are   the  teachers  who   are   trained\r\n\r\nrecognised by the Government? The time has now come\r\n\r\nto leave the question of the education policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to other matters, that is to say,\r\n\r\nmatters   concerning  culture.  On   culture,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  will give  encouragement  to\r\n\r\nexisting cultures. \"It will help foster the  growth\r\n\r\nof a Malayan culture which while drawing sustenance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  communal  cultures  now  flourishing  in\r\n\r\nMalaya   will   nevertheless   develop   its    own\r\n\r\ndistinctive characteristics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself am still in the dark,\r\n\r\nin  the  true  sense  of the  word,  regarding  the\r\n\r\nintentions of the present Government. As the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Timah has explained in the debate today,\r\n\r\nwhen  referring in this House to the  news  in  the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu,  that  His Excellency  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman  Putra  did  not  agree  whatsoever  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of communalism. Therefore, I am still  in\r\n\r\nthe  dark as to what has been stated, that is, \"...\r\n\r\ncommunal  cultures now flourishing in  Malaya  will\r\n\r\nnevertheless    develop   its    own    distinctive\r\n\r\ncharacteristics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to remind the House that the independence achieved by the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya was the result of the co-operation and  help\r\n\r\ngiven by the non-Malays. There, people of all races\r\n\r\nunited  to eradicate and bury colonialism  forever.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  how  can the Government  now  say  that\r\n\r\ncommunal  cultures  which are  now  flourishing  in\r\n\r\nMalaya   will   nevertheless  develop   their   own\r\n\r\ndistinctive  characteristics? In  my  opinion,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   policy  on  culture   will   lead   to\r\n\r\nconfusion.  Therefore, I sincerely  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  elucidate or  clarify  what  real\r\n\r\nculture  is,  which has become  the  basis  of  the\r\n\r\nstruggle of the Government to establish culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I will move now to\r\n\r\nanother matter which concerns Home Affairs. On this\r\n\r\nmatter   I  also  would  like  to  read   for   the\r\n\r\ninformation of this House. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The future of Singapore lies ultimately in re-uniting with the Federation of Malaya as a state in\r\n\r\nan  independent  country. It  is  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  during its term of office to create  and\r\n\r\nbring  about conditions favourable to an early  re-unification  with  the Federation.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  take firm action to prevent any irresponsible\r\n\r\nactivities  by  individuals  or  organisations   to\r\n\r\nnegate this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparamount  interest of the people of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya.  The  Government will always  consider  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the Federation Government. In  the  same\r\n\r\nway, the Government hopes the Federation Government\r\n\r\nwill  understand the hopes and aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, and the ways in  which  this\r\n\r\nGovernment seeks to fulfil them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to add further before  I comment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The basic political situation in Malaya has not\r\n\r\nchanged  today.  The  shooting  war  waged  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  and the  Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty enters the eleventh year. This Government has\r\n\r\nstated   its   position  clearly   on   subversion.\r\n\r\n\"Subversion\" is any political activity designed  to\r\n\r\nfurther  the  aims and interests  not  of  our  own\r\n\r\npeople  but  of  foreign powers. By foreign  powers\r\n\r\nthis  Government means not just Russia  and  China,\r\n\r\nbut also America and Formosa, and the Western bloc.\r\n\r\nThe Government will fight and counter subversion be\r\n\r\nit from the Right or from Left.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention of the Government to its policy  on  home\r\n\r\naffairs. In principle, it is favourable. But at the\r\n\r\nfirst sitting of this Assembly, I remarked that  if\r\n\r\nthis  Government wish to unite with the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  as  a State in an independent  country,\r\n\r\nthen  there  would be many matters which  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  discuss in this House, matters  in  which\r\n\r\nopinions would be contradictory. Yesterday, when we\r\n\r\ndiscussed this matter I explained that it  was  too\r\n\r\npremature  not  to have certain legislations  which\r\n\r\nare  in existence in the Federation, like City Town\r\n\r\nand  Kampong Councils. Why did I say this? We  know\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is only a self-governing State.  We\r\n\r\nhave   not  achieved  independence.  We   have   no\r\n\r\nrepresentatives abroad, no ambassadors abroad, even\r\n\r\nno  consulates  in  other countries.  Therefore  we\r\n\r\nunderstand the reason why we wish to merge with the\r\n\r\nFederation which alone can save Singapore from  the\r\n\r\nclutches of Colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
