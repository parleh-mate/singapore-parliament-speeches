Under the system, a political party fielding a minimum of six candidates qualifies for the minimum airtime of one period of 2 1/2 minutes in each official language broadcast. Beyond that, airtime is increased by half a minute for every four additional candidates fielded. There has been no change since 1980.

These are male prisoners below 60 years of age charged with committing serious offences which carry heavy punishments. Such prisoners have to wear the leg chain when they are detained in the remand prison while awaiting trial or when they are being transferred to courts or to other prisons. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The chain may be removed under certain conditions, for example, firstly, for good behaviour while under detention in the remand prison, as determined by the prison commander; secondly, when a prisoner has been transferred from the remand prison to a maximum security prison, after the Court has imposed sentence; thirdly, when a prisoner on death row has received the royal pardon and has his sentence commuted to life imprisonment or less. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Singaporeans abroad are arrested for offences, our Missions will assist to ensure that our nationals are fairly treated. But those who commit offences abroad must also accept the consequences under the laws of the foreign countries, so long as they are dealt with in accordance with the due process of law. In this regard, each country has its own methods of punishment and procedures for dealing with prisoners. We cannot interfere in the operation of their legal process and cannot demand special treatment for our nationals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that other prisoners in Thailand who have suffered the same punishment have their leg chains removed after the initial period, whereas Singaporean prisoners still have to suffer or undergo imprisonment with leg chains?

I have also ascertained from our Mission in Bangkok that the information and rules which I have described apply across the board and the Singaporean prisoners are not singled out for special treatment. If Mr Chiam has knowledge of any particular case where unfair treatment was accorded, and he will give me the specifics of the case, I assure him I will look into it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that although we cannot insist that special treatment be accorded, from time to time appeals are made to the Ministry and to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our Mission to make representations on specific cases. For example, there was a case where a Singaporean prisoner's legs were weak and the Mission did assist in conveying the appeal.

So the Mission and the Ministry will do their part whenever they can. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EMPLOYMENT OF PART-TIME FEMALE WORKERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Incentives)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) whether more incentives will be introduced to attract females who cannot go into full-time employment to work part-time and (b) whether a lower employee Central Provident Fund contribution rate will be introduced for part-time workers so as to allow them a higher take-home pay whilst maintaining the 20% contribution from the employer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, success in attracting the economically inactive females to join the part-time workforce depends on many factors. These include the benefits offered by the employers and the scheduling of part-time work for the convenience of housewives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will ensure that our labour laws do not stifle the employment of part-time workers. In August 1990, the Ministry introduced a set of guidelines to help facilitate part-time employment. The Guidelines on Part-Time Employment were drawn up based on tripartite consultation and consensus. Under the Guidelines, statutory benefits are pro-rated based on the part-timer's contractual working hours in a year vis-a-vis that of a full-timer. Employers are also given the flexibility to encash certain benefits such as annual leave and public holiday entitlement for the part-time workers. The Ministry is conducting a review to formalise these guidelines into Employment Regulations so that the rights and obligations of the employers and part-timers are more clearly spelt out. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Regulations in place to facilitate part-time employment, employers should come up with innovative schemes to meet the convenience of housewives so that more would come forward to work part-time. This would also help to alleviate our manpower shortage and reduce our reliance on foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's question of reducing the CPF contribution rate for part-time workers, my Ministry is not in favour of this. This is because CPF contribution is not the sole factor influencing the attractiveness of part-time employment. Reducing CPF contribution may not result in a larger number of people engaging in part-time work. On the other hand, any reduction in CPF contribution rates for part-time workers will affect some 47,000 part-time workers who are currently making full CPF contributions. Part-time workers also need to save for retirement and Medisave as much as full-time workers. The CPF scheme, as it is presently structured, helps them to do so. To lower CPF rate for part-time workers will create anomalies. A person working part-time but earning more may end up paying less CPF than another person working full-time but earning less. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, reducing the CPF contribution rate, even if it is the employee's contribution rate, may lead some employers to take into account the lower CPF contribution rate, hence, higher take-home pay, and therefore offering a lower basic wage to the part-time worker. The part-time worker may still not end up with a higher take-home pay. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there are many categories of part-time workers. One category could be those who are engaged full-time and choose to work part-time over the weekends as cashiers or as service personnel in hotels. They already have CPF contribution in their full-time jobs. So for such work, does the Minister think there is a need for them to have the employee's CPF contribution, because they already have the CPF contribution? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, my colleague, the Minister for Health, just explained a moment ago the principle behind CPF contribution. If you are working in several jobs, you will contribute according to the full CPF rate for all the jobs. But if the sums add up to more than the maximum required for CPF contribution, that is, $6,000 a month, then you can ask to have the contribution capped at this maximum of $6,000 a month. So this principle applies, whether it is full-time employment plus part-time employment, or a person working in many different jobs on part-time basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>JOB-HOPPING</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Labour if he is able to give an estimate of the percentage of the workforce that job hops. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from CPF records, in 1993, 5.5% (or about 60,400) of the 1.1 million active CPF members who were employees changed jobs more than once during the year.

In 1988, a task force on job-hopping was formed under the auspices of the Singapore National Employers' Federation. They made an in-depth and very comprehensive study of the problem of job-hopping and recommended several proposals to overcome this. Most of the recommendations focused on improved personnel management practices and more efficient use of scarce labour resources. The task force found that they should leave the problem of job-hopping to employers to tackle. They felt that it should be the employers' responsibility, apart from training their workers, to also encourage their workers to remain loyal to the company, and to remain with the company for as long as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PROMOTION EXERCISE IN EDUCATION SERVICE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Harun bin A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Encik Harun bin A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Education how many second language teachers were promoted to Senior Education Officers I and II in the last promotion exercise and how many of them were promoted to Principal and Vice-Principal in primary and secondary schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K.

Ghani:</b> Sir, I would like to know how many of the CL2, ML2 and TL2 teachers were promoted to SEO I and II, as well as to Principals. As she mentioned just now, only three were promoted to Principals. Why were so few of them promoted to SEO I and II, as well as to Vice-Principal and Principal, compared to L1 teachers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the eight former second language teachers who were promoted to the grades of Senior Education Officers I and II last year happened to be all Chinese language teachers. Among those who were promoted to Principals and Vice-Principals in secondary and primary schools, as I said, three of them were former second language teachers, and all of them also happened to be Chinese language teachers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of Education Officers to senior positions or leadership positions in schools is based on merit, as is within our system of meritocracy. People who are eligible for consideration for promotion are assessed systematically and no regard is given to ethnicity or other attributes. So the question raised by the Member for Hong Kah GRC does not arise. Our promotions are fair. Consideration is based on objective criteria. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, sometimes General Education Officers can be appointed as Principals and Vice-Principals. They hold such appointments and are paid a responsibility allowance. After being tested in these appointments for a number of years, they can be put up for promotion to the substantive grades of Principals and Vice-Principals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Services and programmes run by civic organisations)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community Development what services and programmes under his Ministry are run by civic organisations and what is the nature and extent of involvement of these organisations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Acting Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Community Development (MCD) provides a wide range of social services and programmes both directly and in conjunction with the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently more than 100 VWOs providing regular direct welfare services.

This is in recognition of their services to the community. Grassroots leaders are appointed by the Government through the People's Association. They are not PAP appointees, as misconstrued by the Member for Hougang. To be eligible for this scheme, grassroots leaders must be serving members of their grassroots organisations with at least three years of continuous service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of flats allocated under this priority allocation scheme has been very small. Since the introduction of the Booking System in July 1989, only a total of 745 HDB flats have been allocated under this scheme. This constitutes less than 0.7% of the 112,000 flats offered for booking during this period. Priority allocation for grassroots leaders therefore does not adversely affect the chances of success of the other applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has suggested extending this priority scheme to cover charitable and social organisations. The nature of the charitable and social work is very diverse. It ranges from the occasional weekend volunteer help to paid social work. Many Singaporeans are involved in charitable and social work of one kind or another. It is not feasible to extend the scheme to all of them. The number eligible would be too large. The contributions of volunteers working in charitable and social organisations will be recognised in other ways. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Acting Minister mentioned that I have misconstrued and that these grassroots members are actually appointees of the Government.

We do not distinguish between them. We appoint them based on their contributions to community work, their ability to serve and their dedication to serve. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, these grassroots members are obviously given such priority because of the public service that they have rendered. What is the difference between the public service rendered by the grassroots members and by people who do public service in charitable organisations? I am sure the latter sometimes gives more time, energy, effort and even money than the grassroots members. But they are completely kept out. Is that fair? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a question of effort, money or contributions. The main purpose of this priority scheme is to retain the grassroots leaders who are serving the community where they are working in. So by giving them priority allocation of flats, they will remain in the community as RC members, CCMC members, or CCC members.

The people who serve in the various grassroots organisations work very closely in the community that they are serving in and we find it useful to retain their ties with the community.

But it will disturb those Singaporeans who have given a lot of their time to charitable work and are not rewarded in concrete terms. Whereas those who work for the grassroots organisations, they are rewarded. I am sure they are very disturbed. Does the Minister not agree with me? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I will refer the Member's concern to the Minister for Community Development. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not think the Minister needs to be cheeky. The HDB has taken upon itself the right to make such priority. In fact, these flats are built with taxpayers' monies. Why should some Singaporeans benefit and the others do not? That is the crux of the matter. It is not a fair system, and this system should be enlarged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me assure the House that I was not being cheeky. In fact, this is the correct procedure. HDB is not allocating these flats on its own volition. If there is indeed concern that people working in charitable and social organisations feel that they are not recognised sufficiently, then I am sure the Minister for Community Development will, on their behalf, take up their case and ask the Government and Cabinet to extend this scheme to them. HDB provides this scheme, on behalf of the Government, and extends it to the community leaders. It is not that the HDB is doing itself a favour by looking after this group. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am sure the Minister is aware that there are letters of complaint from his own Citizens' Consultative Committee members and so forth that they themselves are dissatisfied because, amongst them, some of them are given priority whereas others are not.

All those who have served three years in the various grassroots organisations as a committee member are eligible for this scheme. They approach their Advisor if they want to make use of this scheme. This is not a big scheme. So there is no need to make a song and dance out of it. Just to give Members an example. Not only is the number of flats very small - 745 flats over five years - but also the number of grassroots leaders who makes use of this scheme is, in fact, very very small. Less than 6% of the grassroots leaders have actually applied under this scheme. So 94% of all the grassroots leaders do not make use of it. They are not unhappy and complaining, as pointed out by the Member. People work for their community and they gain satisfaction from it.

The Bus-plus scheduled service will cater to commuters who are willing to pay higher fares for a better quality of service than the basic bus/MRT service, while the Bus-plus maxicab service will cater to bigger families and groups who would otherwise need two or more taxis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, ROV briefed all interested operators, including the private bus operators, on the proposed Bus-plus pilot scheme.

In January this year, child care centres provided places for 10.7% of the total population of children aged 2 years to below 7 years. This is double the rate in 1989. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present enough places overall to cater for mothers who want to use child care centres.

This is irrespective of the number of residential houses owned by the deceased. Despite the recent increases in property prices, the existing ceiling should provide adequate relief.

The limit of $3 million was set sometime ago and property prices have gone up. The $3 million house which Dr Wang mentioned is now worth $6 million. So the family will still have to dispose of the house in case the owner dies. The aim of the $3 million limit was to prevent a family from disposing of the property. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That may be true. But I think for those who own properties exceeding $3 million, the estate probably has a good deal more in other assets. For people in that category, surely they cannot only own one house. We have estimated that only 11,000 or 1.7% of all the houses and properties in Singapore are worth $3 million or more. Therefore, we are talking about a very small group of people who are generally very wealthy and therefore need not require additional help, I hope. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SIGNING OF URUGUAY ROUND OF GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Significance for ASEAN Free Trade Area and Singapore)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the significance of the signing of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the ASEAN Free Trade Area and Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, Singapore is perhaps unique in being a small, almost totally open economy which is heavily reliant on trade. Our external trade accounts for some three times our GDP. The Marrakesh agreement, the product of the seven-year Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations, is an especially important agreement for economies like Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Marrakesh agreement achieved deep tariff reductions. Based on Singapore's 1993 trade figures, Singapore can look forward to potential tariff savings of about S$3 billion for our exports when the reductions are fully implemented. In the services sector, we can also look forward to greater transparency and liberalisation in the various regulations imposed by our export markets. In short, Singapore will gain when the market access barriers of our trading partners are lowered through the implementation of the Marrakesh agreement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the agreement provides for the implementation of a more effective GATT dispute settlement process. A new body, the World Trade Organisation (WTO), will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be set up, hopefully by 1st January 1995, to enforce international trade rules. Stronger rules and stronger enforcement will help provide greater predictability and certainty in the conduct of international trade. This will help provide some recourse for us should any trading partner decide to take unreasonable unilateral actions against our exports. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the significance of the UR on AFTA, the Marrakesh agreement requires countries to fulfil their tariff reduction and market opening commitments within a period of 10 years. On the other hand, tariff reductions in the AFTA Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme has a 15 year implementation period, starting from 1st January 1993. The UR has also extended the market access process to cover agricultural products, an area which has been excluded from the CEPT scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Economic Ministers discussed the implications of the UR for AFTA when we met informally in Genting on 22-23 April this year. The Ministers also took note of the rapidly changing external environment, including the strong competition from the emerging economies of China, India and Indochina. The ASEAN Ministers have asked the Senior Economic Officials to review how to keep AFTA relevant with the completion of the UR. The Senior Officials will be meeting in Jakarta from 6th to 8th June this year to review and recommend changes to the programme under the AFTA. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify whether there is any loss to Singapore if Singapore is not given the opportunity to hold the first World Trade Organisation's meeting in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I think the loss would be to the whole region, because the UR meetings have taken place in all the regions of the world except in Asia. And yet Asia is today the fastest growing trading region. Therefore, if the first meeting of the WTO Ministers is not held in Asia, it represents a loss for the whole region and not just for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider suggesting to the AFTA Senior Economic Officials the inclusion of services and investments?

Close to another 1,000 buildings have submitted planning applications for restoration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With conservation now widely accepted and supported, the focus now is turned to improving the quality of restoration. The aim of conservation is to retain the character of the identified buildings. To try and conserve the traditional environment is a different matter. Some incompatible trades are not allowed in these core areas. Aside from these guidelines, the adaptive reuse of the shophouses is left to market forces to decide.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Law Revision Commissioners who produced the 1985 Revised Edition of Acts and the 1990 Revised Edition of Subsidiary Legislation have identified two procedural shortcomings in the Revised Edition of the Laws Act which this Bill seeks to remedy. In addition, the Bill introduces a loose-leaf system for the publication of our statutes, an improvement over the current loose-booklet system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shortcoming is that, currently, the Act does not provide for Commissioners to be appointed for fixed terms. As a result, the appointments of the present Commissioners are indefinite in duration and can only be terminated by express revocation of the President. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners only work as a body during a major and comprehensive revision of all our Acts and subsidiary legislation. Hence, most of the appointments should be on fixed terms as this will allow for fresh appointments to be made from time to time as the need arises. The only persons who should be appointed on a permanent basis are the Attorney- General, the Solicitor-General and the Parliamentary Counsel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill therefore provides that every Commissioner, other than the Attorney- General, Solicitor-General and Parliamentary Counsel, shall be appointed for a fixed term of not more than three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second shortcoming is that, currently, the Act requires the Commissioners to publish a revised edition of every Act and subsidiary legislation after 1st January following the date of its enactment or amendment. In the case of Acts, this is dispensed with if the amendments have not been extensive, in which event, these minor amendments are collectively published in a separate booklet which the Commissioners are required to publish. This booklet was intended to provide a noter-up service to the Acts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement is unsatisfactory. The Commissioners cannot revise any Act or subsidiary legislation sooner than 1st January following the date of its amendment even if the Act or subsidiary legislation has been so extensively \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amended that it is desirable to revise it immediately. Moreover, experience has shown that the publication of the booklet of minor amendments is not necessary. Lawyers do not find it useful, preferring instead to notate any amendments directly into their statute books. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill therefore gives the Commissioners greater discretion to decide when an Act or subsidiary legislation should be revised and to do away with the requirement for the Commissioners to publish the booklet of minor amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the Bill introduces a loose-leaf system for the publication of our statutes. The present loose-booklet system was introduced in the 1985 revised edition of Acts, as an improvement over the book system which was then in use. The loose booklet is useful in that it ensures that both revised editions of Acts and subsidiary legislation are self-renewing and self-expanding, kept up-to-date by replacing those Acts or subsidiary legislation which have been amended with fresh booklets incorporating the amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, since our adoption of the loose-booklet system, countries such as Hong Kong, Canada and Brunei have begun to publish their statutes in loose-leaf form, which is even better because it allows for speedy, easy and convenient updating of any amended statute. Whenever a statute is amended, it is updated by simply replacing the actual pages affected by the amendment with new pages incorporating the amendments. In this way, Sir, users do not have to wait until a new revised edition of the statute is published to have a fresh updated copy of the statute. When such a system is fully operational, there will no longer be any need for annual revisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst this House has a heavy responsibility of debating Bills and making laws for Singapore, it is also important to publish these laws in such a manner that they are accessible to the legal profession and the public at large. The improvements moved by this Bill are based on the experience of the Law Commissioners. These learned men and women should know what is required to make their task more productive. In particular, I commend the implementation of the loose-leaf system of publishing our statutes. Those of us who have looked up statutes will realise how messy it can be when a statute has been heavily amended with lots of cuts and paste sections stuck all over the pages. With a loose-leaf system, such a cut and paste approach will be dispensed with. In addition, the amendment to give the Commissioners the discretion to reprint a heavily amended Act even before the ensuing 1st January is a very practical one. I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how the loose-leaf system will be implemented. Does it mean that all current loose-booklet statutes will be replaced? If so, will this be costly and extravagant? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I will also ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is the implication of this Bill on the use of information technology in the legal profession as in LawNet. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to clause 2 of the Bill, in particular to this amended section 3(1)(d), which reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) The President may appoint a Law Revision Commission comprising, as Law Revision Commissioners - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) such other persons as may be appointed by the President.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister be willing to recommend to the President that these \"such other persons\" may comprise at least one nominee from the Law Society? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statutes and laws of Singapore are the tools of lawyers and they are the people who are handling the law every day. It would be inappropriate if they were not included in this Law Revision \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Commission. They can certainly give important and relevant feedback to improve the revision of the laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the statutes were published in book form was in 1970. It was not until 1985 that the Revised Editions were published. So there was a long lapse of time and many lawyers found it very inconvenient with their statute books full of pasted and notated amended sections of the law. If the Law Revision Commission had a lawyer or a representative from the Law Society at that time, perhaps the revision could have come sooner and make the work of the lawyers more convenient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noted that every time Revised Editions of the laws are published, the cost of each of these publications goes up. I do not know whether the Law Revision Commission has something to do with the pricing, but certainly I would ask the Minister to look into the cost of these Revised Editions of the law. I believe the 1970 full edition of the Singapore Statutes costs less than $1,000, but when the Revised Editions were published in 1985 they cost more than $3,000. Perhaps the Minister could look into the cost of the publications of the revised laws and make them readily available to the man-in-the-street who would certainly like to know the progress of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, let me thank the Chairman of the GPC (Law) for his support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chairman of the GPC (Law) makes two points. The first relates to the manner in which the loose-leaf system will be introduced. He makes a good point, a valid point, a very keen observation, that if we were to introduce a loose-leaf system all at once to replace the loose-booklet system, it may seem wasteful. Therefore, Sir, the methodology we have envisaged, whereby the loose-leaf system would be introduced is to phase it in. Whenever a new Act is enacted or a Revised Edition of an Act is amended, the format in which the new Act or Revised Edition will come out will be the loose-leaf form. In other words, not a once- for-all replacement, it is a gradual phasing-in. Over several years we will have a loose-leaf system fully operational. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Chairman of the GPC (Law) makes is to ask whether the LawNet system, the statutes database, will replace the Revised Edition of the Laws. Sir, I think it is not envisaged that the statutes database in LawNet will replace the Revised Edition of the Laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, Sir, the publication of our written laws is required, both under the Constitution as well as under the Interpretation Act. Therefore, LawNet is not to replace the publication of our written laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under section 7 of the Revised Edition of the Laws Act, it is stated that in all courts and for all purposes the sole and proper Statute Book of Singapore is the Revised Edition of the Laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, is a more practical point. Whilst LawNet is used mainly by lawyers as a very useful research tool for quick updated information on the laws of Singapore, I am sure everyone in this House will agree that our laws should be made available to as wide a segment of the population as possible and at costs which are affordable. Therefore, Sir, it is envisaged that, and this is in fact provided for in the Revised Edition of the Laws, these laws shall be published and made available to the public. Therefore the LawNet system cannot fully replace the Revised Edition of the Laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam makes two points. First, he asks whether or not members of the Law Society - I would guess he means legal practitioners - will be appointed as Law Commissioners. Sir, as the Act provides, the appointment of Law Commissioners is made by the President. In the past, I think he will know that we have had, for example, members of the Law Faculty, eminent members, who have been appointed to the Law Commission. In other words, the Law Commission is not a closed-door affair. Even though we provide for the appointment of the AG, the SG and the Parliamentary Counsel, as and when there are members of the legal fraternity with expertise, they will be appointed. Prof. Tan Sook Yee provides an example. So I think we must leave it to the President in his wisdom to decide on who fits the bill to be appointed to the very important appointment of Law Revision Commissioner. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Chiam makes is about cost which is in fact a point met by this Bill. With the loose-leaf system, there will be no need to replace booklets in their entirety and, therefore, this should reduce costs in the long run. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

Phase I of the port development is in progress. The first five berths of Phase I are expected to be operational by early 1998. When fully completed in the year 2000, Phase I will have a total of eight container berths. Together with the present Brani, Tanjong Pagar and Keppel terminals, PSA will then have a total handling capacity of 22 million TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units. This will be sufficient to cope with the growing volume of container traffic up to the year 2000. Additional berths will be required to meet the growth in throughput thereafter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under Phase II, 18 berths will be developed. The first two berths of Phase II will have to come onstream in the year 2001 to meet the expected demand then. The remaining 16 berths of Phase II will be completed progressively to match the rate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of growth of container throughput.

Persons who do not intend to stay in an HDB flat should not purchase one. If they do so, they will deprive others who are in genuine need of an HDB flat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessees who vacate their flats for valid reasons, and who want to sub-let their flats, should seek HDB's approval. HDB will consider each case on its own merits. HDB will compulsorily acquire the flats if the entire flats are let out without HDB's permission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is aware that many lessees leave their flats temporarily vacant for renovation purposes. Some have to be away temporarily to take care of elderly relatives who are ill. Also, many Singaporeans go overseas on holiday, or to work or study. Therefore, HDB adopts a flexible approach to lessees who leave their flats vacant for valid reasons. It will not penalise such lessees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB may compulsorily acquire the flats of lessees who leave them vacant for long periods without valid reasons. However, HDB exercises its powers in this respect, very judiciously. Over the last three years, there have only been two instances where HDB initiated compulsory acquisition against lessees for such an infringement. In both cases, the lessees had left their flats vacant for five years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FULL-TIME NATIONAL SERVICE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Last six to nine months of training)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) why full-time National Servicemen generally view the last 6 to 9 months of their National Service as less challenging and wasteful and (b) whether reviews had been made to improve the stint of NSF so that they will leave with a more positive feeling. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the Member's misinformation, the last 6 to 9 months of our full-time National Service is not \"less challenging and wasteful\". Indeed, this period constitutes the high point of the unit's training syllabus. At this juncture, the unit proceeds for overseas training where the NSFs are trained in a totally new and unfamiliar environment. This phase of unit training is physically and mentally demanding. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary challenge in this period is getting the unit to function as a cohesive and well-oiled combat force in contrast to the earlier period when learning personal skills is the main focus. Three months before the NSFs are released, the unit is required to undergo a Battalion proficiency test conducted by an independent evaluating team. The unit will be evaluated according to operational scenarios and high standards of training proficiency are demanded before it can be considered an operationally ready NS Battalion. If it fails to achieve the required standards, the unit will have to undergo corrective training and be re-evaluated. With the possibility of going through the demanding tests twice, it is the SAF's experience that NSFs make the extra effort to pass the test at the first trial. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last 6 to 9 months of NSF training are thus far from wasteful. But this is the period when the NSF stint is coming to an end. At this stage some NSFs begin to focus their attention on what they are going to do after their full-time NS, be it work or studies. Anticipating the prospects of life after full-time service, inevitably leads some NSFs to feel impatient about completing their service and dampens their interests for military training. But it would not be right to therefore conclude that their training at this stage is a waste of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF always reviews and enhances its training system to maximise the contributions of NSFs to national defence during their NSF stint. We will continue to ensure that the training syllabus is relevant to the defence needs of Singapore, and NSFs' time in the SAF used meaningfully and efficiently. If the Member could provide detailed information regarding the unit where the training in the last 6 to 9 months is \"less challenging and wasteful\", the SAF would carry out the appropriate investigations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>OPERATIONALLY READY NATIONAL SERVICEMEN</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Overseas postings)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether more of our operationally ready National Servicemen will be working overseas in view of regionalisation; (b) whether these NSmen will be exempted from their National Service training during their overseas postings; and (c) how their absence will affect our defence strength. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF supports Singapore's drive to expand its external economy. More Singaporeans can be expected to venture overseas, and participate in the economic development of the region. Many of our NSmen are spearheading this regional expansion and the number working abroad is increasing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For NSmen intending to work overseas, MINDEF excuses them from NS duties in two ways - deferment and disruption. NSmen whose overseas posting is of less than a year's duration can be deferred. However, as they are still under their units' strength, they are expected to do make-up training upon their return. To facilitate greater responsiveness in granting deferment to NSmen, the authority to defer them from ICT has been decentralised to unit commanders since the early 1980s. The unit commanding officers, who are NSmen themselves, are in the best position to decide whether the deferment request can be accommodated after considering the unit's operational training schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen whose overseas posting is of 1 year or longer are disrupted for the period of the posting up to a maximum of 3 years at a time. The disruption can be extended, if justified. Upon their return, the NSmen will be required to continue their training from where they had left. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invariably, the disruption of increasing number of NSmen working overseas would affect the SAF. As of now, the numbers are not large enough to affect our defence capability adversely. In drawing up policies and guidelines on allowing NSmen to be absent from training, MINDEF takes into account operational considerations. To be an effective fighting force, NSmen must always train together in their own units throughout their NS cycle. In the case of an NSman who is posted for a long period overseas, he would be replaced by another suitable NSman to ensure that our defence capability is not affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All NSmen are required to inform MINDEF of their overseas address whenever they leave Singapore for more than 24 hours. This allows the SAF to maintain its operational readiness at all times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the need for regional economic expansion, NSmen should remember that deferment/disruption from NS comes with a price - to the NSman himself, to the SAF, and to the nation. Facilitating NSmen in their overseas work must not be at the expense of compromising the operational readiness of the SAF. Therefore, whilst MINDEF supports regionalisation, it needs to reconcile the defence of the nation with the economic aspirations of its NSmen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>VULGAR LANGUAGE ON NATIONAL SERVICEMEN</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that non- commissioned military officers and instructors are using excessive vulgar language on National Servicemen; whether this is part and parcel of the training programme and, if so, whether a stop will be put to such an uncivilised practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is a military organisation training soldiers to deal with life and death situations in times of war. Therefore, discipline must be strict, and forceful language in strong tones is used on occasions to help recruits adjust to a military environment. The SAF's training programmes are rigorous and soldiers are prepared for them, mentally and physically with the help of their instructors. However, MINDEF does not condone the use of vulgar language. Neither has vulgarity a role in the training of national servicemen. Specialists and Warrant Officers are men of proven competence and experience, with educational background improving over the years, in parallel with the general rising education levels of our population. Many national servicemen of `A' level and above qualifications also hold such appointments. All Warrant Officers, Specialists and instructors are trained to impart military skills and positive social values to national servicemen as well as to be concerned with their well-being. They are also required to set high personal standards in their conduct, bearing and discipline for the trainees to emulate. It is a misconception that Specialists and Warrant Officers and instructors are using excessive vulgar language on national servicemen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member could provide information on the use of excessive vulgar language, MINDEF will investigate into the matter and take action against the errant servicemen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FULL-TIME NATIONAL SERVICE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Utilisation of skills of graduates)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Defence, whether any special efforts are taken to utilize the technical and scientific skills of graduates while they are doing their full-time National Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence to provide a defence capability to safeguard the sovereignty and security of Singapore. To discharge its responsibility, the SAF must first and foremost have sufficient number of combat soldiers. They form the fighting edge of the SAF. Under our universal conscription, citizens who are physically and medically fit for combat are trained and deployed in combat units regardless of their educational qualifications. Those who are able and have leadership qualities would be trained and deployed as commanders and officers. The low national birth rate makes it even more critical for the SAF to deploy the available manpower resource to combat duties where they are most needed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of graduates in the SAF has been increasing over the years. This is a positive development. Increasing educational levels of our soldiers add to our defence capability, enabling the SAF to exploit science and technology to multiply its effectiveness. With higher education, our servicemen would be better able to operate new and sophisticated weapon systems as well as be trained in more complex operations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non combat-fit servicemen would similarly be deployed in areas where they could still make a maximum contribution to support the SAF's fighting capability.

The SAF has to ensure its training is effective in order to build up a credible defence force. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF recognises that many new NSF recruits are not in the best physical condition before enlistment. Training is therefore conducted progressively and with all possible safety measures. The progressive physical build up and safety measures help to minimise training accidents and injury.

This is a significant improvement over the rate of 3.5% in the mid-80s and reflects the results of medical research in the SAF. The SAF is constantly looking for ways to help soldiers to perform better and to reduce training injury. Some of the measures that have been introduced include: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. the 2-month pre-BMT Physical Training Phase to allow less fit recruits to gradually build up their level of physical fitness; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. appropriate rest periods scheduled into training programmes to allow recovery of strength and stamina; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. grouping recruits according to their levels of physical fitness to allow training to be conducted at a pace commensurate with their fitness levels; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. significant improvements to the combat boots through medical and ergonomic research (eg. the shock absorbent quality of the boots to better protect the feet of the soldiers). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF will continue to look for ways to reduce training injury even further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New recruits will find military training less onerous if they take on the personal responsibility of preparing themselves well physically before enlistment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>AUCTION OF #03-06 PEK CHUAN BUILDING</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) what are the reasons that led to the decision of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore to auction off the property at #03- 06 Pek Chuan Building at Lavender Street to recover property taxes due; (b) whether the auction price raised after deducting all expenses is enough to pay off the debts; and (c) whether further action will be instituted against the owner(s). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the property at #03-06 Pek Chuan Building at Lavender Street owes a substantial amount in tax arrears.

With the GST-related tax changes taking effect from Year of Assessment 1994, around 75 per cent of the individual taxpayers will no longer pay any income tax.

The increase in the number of persons sentenced to death in 1993, especially for drug-related offences was due to the faster court hearings and the switch from the two-judge system for capital cases to a one-judge system that year.

As a result some of the existing NPPs are no longer strategically located. Police is reviewing the number and locations of these NPPs to assess whether they are suitably located to serve the community.

Police have made various improvements to the NPP system to enable them to be more responsive to the community. Two years ago, a `problem-solving' approach was introduced and it is still being emphasised. Under this approach, NPP officers are trained and encouraged to look at the root causes of community problems rather than just respond to the symptoms. One example was highlighted in the newspapers recently where an NPP officer responded to frequent complaints of noise pollution by residents. He discovered that the cause of the problem was a resident who suffers from Down's Syndrome. Feeling bored during the day the resident had become a nuisance. The NPP officer eventually found the resident a job at a nearby centre and the problem was solved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NPP system was originally based on the Japanese Koban system. In January this year, Police invited a team of experts from Japan to observe the progress of our NPP system as against developments in Japan and make recommendations to improve the system. The experts were impressed with our system and endorsed the various schemes to integrate the Police into community life in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions of NPPs is to provide community services to the residents. This includes taking of police reports, dealing with loss and found cases, recording of change of addresses, registering deaths, etc. Currently, certain Police services to the public are offered by Police Divisional Headquarters and more specialised cases are dealt with by Traffic Police and CID. Police is considering devolving more services to the NPPs. This will bring an even greater range of police services nearer the community, thereby improving the quality of service to the public and integrating the police further with the community. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>APPLICATIONS FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Preference for ex-Singaporeans)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) if he will consider sympathetically the case of Singaporeans who had given up their citizenship and now wish to come back to Singapore on a permanent resident basis and are gainfully employed and (b) whether these persons will be given preference over other foreigners with similar qualifications who are applying for permanent residence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that many ex-Singaporeans can make positive contributions.

To do so may unwittingly encourage more Singaporeans to emigrate, and later to return to Singapore and obtain permanent residence status if they cannot adjust to life overseas. Giving preference to ex-Singaporeans will also not be fair to our citizens who remain in Singapore to contribute to its development. Finally, as permanent residence is a step towards citizenship, it should not be given liberally to persons whose commitment to Singapore is suspect or who from the outset may have no intention to take up Singapore citizenship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exception is made for female ex-Singaporeans who are married to foreigners and whose marriages have broken down or whose husbands had passed away.

There are also some employers who do not have company doctors, and their employees may visit the A&amp;E Department instead of polyclinics to obtain a medical certificate from a government medical officer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the problem, the Ministry of Health has requested the Singapore National Employers Federation to advise its members that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. employers with company doctors should encourage their staff to see their company doctors; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. employers without company doctors should appoint company doctors and ensure that their staff are aware of the names and addresses of the company doctors. They can also see government doctors at polyclinics, but not at A&amp;E Departments except for emergencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Transfer of savings from Ordinary</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>Account to Special Account)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Labour if Central Provident Fund members will be allowed to transfer savings in the Ordinary Account which they do not intend to withdraw to the Special Account. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings in the Special Account are meant for old age. Hence, CPF members cannot withdraw these savings for any other purposes (eg housing and investment) before age 55. At age 55, CPF members can use these savings to meet the Minimum Sum requirement. As such savings are kept with the CPF Board for a long term, additional interest at 1.25% point above the normal CPF rate will be paid on the savings from 1st July 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we allow transfer of savings in the Ordinary Account to the Special Account, such transfers can only be allowed if they are made irrevocably. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the Ordinary Account savings transferred to the Special Account will remain there for long term to warrant the payment of the additional interest. However, if that condition is imposed, CPF members who had transferred their Ordinary Account savings to their Special Account, could end up having insufficient savings in their Ordinary Account when they later wish to upgrade to higher quality housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is therefore not in favour of allowing transfer of CPF savings from the Ordinary Account to the Special Account. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RETIREMENT AGE LAW</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Applications for exemption)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Labour what is the number and outcome of applications made for exemption from retiring at the age of 60 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the retirement age law, the Ministry has received 63 applications for exemptions.

Since its formation in 1991, the MSJCE has embarked on several programmes to educate owners and drivers of diesel vehicles on preventing smoke emissions.

On our part, Singapore has already tightened up emission standards for Singapore registered motorcycles. Most two-stroke motorcycles cannot meet the new emission standards.

The agents subsequently sell the flats for an amount that is much higher than the agreed price, and pocket the difference. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND would like to emphasise that, in the resale transaction for an HDB flat, HDB deals directly with the buyer and the seller; HDB does not require the involvement of housing agents at any point of the transaction. Sellers who choose, of their own accord, to use agents nevertheless, and who do not wish their housing agents to profit from the sale of their flats, should avoid giving their agents power of attorney, and retain the right to receive the entire sale proceeds direct from HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sellers who wish to revoke the power of attorney which they have already given to their agents, can do so, if they write in to HDB at any time before the resale transaction is completed, and produce a Deed of Revocation, which cancels the power of attorney. HDB will then make out the cheque for the nett sale proceeds in the seller's name, and not in the name of the agent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940523/19940523-HA-0630079.htm\">Annex A - CLUBS AND NO.
