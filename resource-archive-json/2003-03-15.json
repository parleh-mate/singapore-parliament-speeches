I spoke on one yesterday.\r\n\r\nMay I proceed to the other two?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Proceed with the other two, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, my cut relates to taxi fares\r\n\r\nand  the pricing mechanism.  Recently, during the  debate\r\n\r\non  the  Road  Traffic Act amendment, we heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Transport that we had the highest number  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  per capita among major cities of the world.   That\r\n\r\ntaxi  should  be  considered as  a  premium  door-to-door\r\n\r\nservice  but our fares are relatively low that  it  makes\r\n\r\nsense for two or three persons to take a taxi, instead of\r\n\r\nthe  bus or MRT.  Soon after that, on 13th February 2003,\r\n\r\nthere  was a major article in the Straits Times  agreeing\r\n\r\nthat  our taxi fares were too low.  Now, is there a  hint\r\n\r\nthat  taxi  fares  are  likely to increase  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what will cause fares to increase? The\r\n\r\nGovernment no longer sets taxi fares.  Under the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  judging  by  the  popularity  of   taxis,\r\n\r\ncommuters  are  generally happy  with  the  current  fare\r\n\r\nstructure, taxi drivers are still making a decent  income\r\n\r\nalthough  some  are grumbling that income  has  declined.\r\n\r\nThere are many drivers queuing up to drive taxis and taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies are raking in huge profits.  It seems that  the\r\n\r\nonly  unhappy party may be the Government,  as  it  means\r\n\r\nthat  taxi  service is not priced properly leading  to  a\r\n\r\nloss of potential revenue for the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether that is good enough reason for an\r\n\r\nincrease in fares.  Although the Government does not  set\r\n\r\nfares  any  more,  it can still cause taxi  companies  to\r\n\r\nincrease  fares  by increasing their cost of  operations.\r\n\r\nThe  new  licence fee of $25 per taxi per  month  imposed\r\n\r\nrecently is a small component.  If it wants to, there are\r\n\r\nmany  other  areas where the Government can levy  charges\r\n\r\nand fees, such as COE, diesel charge, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, taxi drivers are charged about $60 per\r\n\r\nday  to rent the taxi.  If the driver takes in more  than\r\n\r\nthat, it is his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome.  If less, he takes home nothing and may even have\r\n\r\nto  come  out from his pocket.  If increases in fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges cause taxi companies to pass them on to the  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver by way of a higher daily rental for the taxi,  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver  will  stand the risk of a  bigger  loss  if\r\n\r\nbusiness is unusually bad.  I think it is not healthy  to\r\n\r\nsubject individual taxi drivers to greater financial risk\r\n\r\nand  liability,  and  hope that  any  increase  would  be\r\n\r\ncharged  to the taxi companies directly instead of  being\r\n\r\npassed on to the taxi drivers or the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have the highest number of taxis per\r\n\r\ncapita,  yet during peak hours and rainy days,  there  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough  to meet demand.  There are perennial  public\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about the non-availability  of  taxis  during\r\n\r\nsuch  times.  However, during non-peak hours,  there  are\r\n\r\ntaxis  aplenty  cruising  our  streets  or  waiting   for\r\n\r\ncommuters at taxi stands.  Therefore, any increase in the\r\n\r\nalready  high population of taxis will affect the  income\r\n\r\nof taxi drivers adversely.  The solution to this problem,\r\n\r\nas  advocated by the LTA, seems to be variable pricing to\r\n\r\nmeet  demand,  and by that, it appears that  the  LTA  is\r\n\r\nsubtly referring to (although not openly pushing for) the\r\n\r\nphone booking fee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are prepared to pay more by calling for a\r\n\r\ntaxi, according to the stipulated quality of service, you\r\n\r\nwill  most  probably  get your call  answered  within  30\r\n\r\nseconds,  confirmation for the booking within  5  minutes\r\n\r\nand  a taxi at your doorstep within 10 minutes.  That  is\r\n\r\nfor those prepared to pay the extra, that is, the pricing\r\n\r\ndifference.  For others, it means a long wait  along  the\r\n\r\nroadside, or in a queue at a taxi stand.  If this is  the\r\n\r\npreferred  solution, then I think we should publicise  it\r\n\r\nand  tell  commuters  not to waste time  waiting  by  the\r\n\r\nroadside or taxi stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we adopt this solution, I believe the situation\r\n\r\nfor  those  wanting to hail a taxi from the roadside,  or\r\n\r\ntaxi stand, will only worsen in time.  The QoS or quality\r\n\r\nof service does not help to alleviate the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation.   The five qualities of services require  that\r\n\r\nphone  booking service levels be met, otherwise a penalty\r\n\r\nof  up  to $100,000 per contravention will be imposed  on\r\n\r\nthe taxi operator.  Now, we know that demand for taxis is\r\n\r\nhigh  during  peak hours.  For fear of not  meeting  this\r\n\r\nQoS,  taxi  companies, especially the smaller ones,  will\r\n\r\nnaturally  want to take their taxis off the  streets  and\r\n\r\nkeep them on standby to make sure that they can attend to\r\n\r\nphone bookings.  If not, if their taxis are all committed\r\n\r\npicking up passengers from the roadside, and they are not\r\n\r\nable to attend to the calls, they will be fined.  CityCab\r\n\r\nis  offering  the lowest booking fee now to attract  more\r\n\r\ncalls.   But if their phone booking becomes more  popular\r\n\r\nand they are swamped with calls, how long can they manage\r\n\r\nwith a small fleet and not run foul of the QoS?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think the writing is clearly on the wall - better pay the higher price if you want to get a taxi,\r\n\r\notherwise  take  the  bus  or MRT.   Those  unwilling  or\r\n\r\nignorant,  especially  the  tourists,  will  continue  to\r\n\r\ncomplain and have a bad impression of our taxi service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move to my cut regarding competition in\r\n\r\nthe taxi industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have got to go faster, Mr Ong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I wonder how competition can be\r\n\r\nintroduced  at this late stage where there is  already  a\r\n\r\ndominant market leader which has the clout to set pricing\r\n\r\nand  market trends.

They would simply follow\r\n\r\nwhat   the  market  leader  does.

Thus, in Singapore, whenever\r\n\r\nI  board a taxi, I do not need to pay, but I have to  pay\r\n\r\nwhen I get down, as usual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the new regulatory framework for the taxi\r\n\r\noperators,  taxi companies are to pay a levy of  $25  per\r\n\r\ntaxi  per month to the Government to finance the cost  of\r\n\r\nenforcing  taxi service standards.  This means  that  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  industry needs to pay the Government  $5.7  million\r\n\r\nper year to enforce service standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government is trying ways and means to\r\n\r\nlower the business costs, I see this move as going in the\r\n\r\nopposite  direction  and driving  up  the  cost  of  taxi\r\n\r\ndriving.    The   taxi   drivers  are   concerned   that,\r\n\r\neventually,  they need to bear part or all  of  the  $5.7\r\n\r\nmillion.   The commuters now foresee that the  additional\r\n\r\ncost  will  be  passed to them and  I  believe  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies must be thinking of how to pass this additional\r\n\r\ncost to either the taxi drivers or the commuters.  So the\r\n\r\nquestion I would like the Minister to clarify is: must we\r\n\r\nimpose  a direct increase of $5.7 million operating  cost\r\n\r\non  the  taxi  operators?  If the issue is  taxi  service\r\n\r\nstandard,  is  the $25 levy per taxi per month  the  only\r\n\r\nviable  solution?  I would strongly urge the Minister  to\r\n\r\nreview this creative way of enforcing service standard by\r\n\r\nimposing  a fee rather than an incentive.  Are  our  taxi\r\n\r\nservices  that bad that require $5.7 million annually  to\r\n\r\nmake it better?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government is seeking vigorously to\r\n\r\nenforce  a  taxi service standard, may I ask whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  consider providing a clear  arbitration\r\n\r\nand  appeal  framework for the taxi drivers  without  the\r\n\r\nneed to go to the civil court?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently,  we  have the Traffic Police  driving  licence\r\n\r\ndemerit points system, the taxi companies' demerit points\r\n\r\nsystem  as  well as the enforcement unit of LTA  managing\r\n\r\nthe disciplinary procedures of taxi drivers.  So the only\r\n\r\nway  out  for taxi drivers to appeal against  any  unfair\r\n\r\njudgement on them is to go to the civil court.  The  cost\r\n\r\nis  high, let alone rental cost as well as loss  of  time\r\n\r\nand time wasted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, with\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  industry  now being liberalised,  it  is  with\r\n\r\nhopeful anticipation that standards of services will rise\r\n\r\nwith   competition.   Taxi  operators,  instead  of  just\r\n\r\nrenting vehicles out, can now be expected to do more  for\r\n\r\ntheir  taxi  drivers who, in turn, will be encouraged  to\r\n\r\ngive a better personalised service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from granting rebates and incentives to\r\n\r\ndrivers,  I would like to ask the Minister for  Transport\r\n\r\nif  he  can  consider a scheme where taxi  operators  can\r\n\r\nimprove  the  industry by working with  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTransport to create a dispute and resolution (D&R)  panel\r\n\r\nfrom  which  players within the taxi  industry  can  have\r\n\r\ntheir  problems heard and resolved before being penalised\r\n\r\nby the authorities and taxi operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the dispute and resolution panel can\r\n\r\nbe  independent from the taxi operators and report to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Transport.  Fellow members may  consist  of\r\n\r\nmembers from the taxi operators and taxi drivers as  well\r\n\r\nas  other  professionals nominated  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTransport.   In  a  liberalised industry  where  manpower\r\n\r\nmoves freely from one company to another, we must try  to\r\n\r\nseparate  the  actions  involved  in  disciplining   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers from those hearing the complaints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel can take up complaints and disputes\r\n\r\nbetween  individual taxi drivers and the taxi  operators,\r\n\r\ncustomers and other road users.  For example, one of  the\r\n\r\ncommon woes that taxi drivers have is being asked to stop\r\n\r\nat   places   where  it  is  in  violation   of   traffic\r\n\r\nregulations.   If an unreasonable passenger insists,  the\r\n\r\ntaxi driver has little choice but to comply,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworried   that  he  might  receive  a  complaint  against\r\n\r\nhimself.  His action puts him in a difficult position  as\r\n\r\nhe  might  risk  chalking  up  demerit  points  with  his\r\n\r\ncompliance as he would have violated traffic regulations.\r\n\r\nHowever, should he eventually receive a complaint by  not\r\n\r\nlistening to the customer, or attract a fine for stopping\r\n\r\nillegally,  the  driver can now  be  assured  of  a  fair\r\n\r\nhearing to his problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A taxi driver once told me that, apart from having\r\n\r\nto pay a traffic fine and receiving demerit points on his\r\n\r\ndriving licence, he has to, on top of all this, also  pay\r\n\r\na  penalty  amount to the taxi operator.  The  D&R  panel\r\n\r\nwill provide a listening ear for taxi drivers instead  of\r\n\r\nleaving  them  at  the  mercy of the  taxi  operators  or\r\n\r\ntraffic   authority   and  risk  having   their   licence\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  The panel will discourage one from being  too\r\n\r\nlitigious.  It is a less expensive, less punitive and non-adversarial method of dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up the panel allows taxi operators to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on providing good taxi services rather  than\r\n\r\nto  spend their resources in resolving conflicts, in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  eroding its image as a good provider  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Irene Ng is not here. Mr Ang Mong\r\n\r\nSeng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\ntaxi  service  is one of the three main forms  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport  in Singapore.  Apart from taxis, we have  air-conditioned buses and the MRT to provide very comfortable\r\n\r\npublic  transportation for our people.  Of  course,  taxi\r\n\r\nservice  is much faster, more comfortable and, of course,\r\n\r\nit costs more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some commuters are complaining that there are not\r\n\r\nenough  taxis  on  the  road, and are  asking  for  more.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel whether or not we should have more  taxis\r\n\r\nwill  depend on the demand and supply in the market.   If\r\n\r\nthe  demand  is  not so high or the high demand  is  only\r\n\r\nrestricted to peak hours, then during the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff-peak  hours there would be an over-supply  of  taxis,\r\n\r\nand  the  operating  cost will go  up.   Eventually,  the\r\n\r\nhigher  operational  cost  will  be  passed  on  to   the\r\n\r\ncommuters.   The commuters will have to bear  the  brunt.\r\n\r\nSo, we have to think of the consequences.\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. Recently, I was in\r\n\r\nTsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. I observed that there were a  lot\r\n\r\nof  taxis  but only about 30% of them were occupied,  the\r\n\r\nremaining  70% were not. As we know, taxi fares  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and  Tokyo are much higher than Singapore.   Do  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  end  up  like them?  Can the Minister  tell  us\r\n\r\nwhether there is any plan to increase the number of taxis\r\n\r\nin Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, recently, much has been said about\r\n\r\nencouraging the  commuters to make use of the radio  taxi\r\n\r\nservice.  It is a very good system.  But to use the phone\r\n\r\nservice, you have to pay a  $3 surcharge.  If we want  to\r\n\r\nadvocate wider use of radio taxi service, should  we  not\r\n\r\nconsider  lowering  the surcharge, perhaps  halve  it  to\r\n\r\n$1.50?  This will  encourage more people to use the radio\r\n\r\ntaxi service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as Mr Seng Han Thong has mentioned, we are\r\n\r\nimposing  a $25 licence fee on each taxi.  By right,  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  operators shall bear the cost of this  $25  licence\r\n\r\nfee, but can we say for sure that they will not pass this\r\n\r\non  to  the  taxi drivers?  I would like to know  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  ad  hoc  measure or  will  this  be  levied\r\n\r\nperpetually.  If the taxi service has already  reached  a\r\n\r\ncertain  standard,  and  there is  no  further  need  for\r\n\r\nimprovement, should not this $25 levy be lifted?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, it is\r\n\r\ncommendable  that  we are putting in place  a  system  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  service standards for the taxis,  ie,  the  QoS.\r\n\r\nTaxi   operators  would  no  doubt  be  assessing   their\r\n\r\noperations  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  they   are\r\n\r\ncompliant,   especially   in  the   face   of   increased\r\n\r\ncompetition from new entrants.  The question I am  asking\r\n\r\nis whether there are adequate measures being put in place\r\n\r\nto ensure that the livelihoods of older\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers - the majority of whom are wholly dependent\r\n\r\non   taxi   driving   -  would  not  be   unintentionally\r\n\r\ncompromised.  There would be occurrences of drivers  that\r\n\r\nwould  need time to cope with the changes.  For  example,\r\n\r\neven  as  technology is rolled out to our taxi fleets,  I\r\n\r\nhave  known  a  taxi driver who had been driving  for  17\r\n\r\nyears, he was dropped because he could not cope with  the\r\n\r\nnew  text messaging system.  Would others suffer the fate\r\n\r\nof summary dismissal, after failing a language test?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of poorer alternative employment\r\n\r\nprospects  for  older workers, we must  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ntransition  to high-tech systems required to achieve  the\r\n\r\nhigher  benchmarks of service delivery must be done  with\r\n\r\nsome compassion and, in the event that doubts arise as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  disagreement  between  the  drivers  and  the\r\n\r\noperators,  the Minister should look into adequate  cost-effective  recourse to be available to the drivers,  many\r\n\r\nof  whom  have  not got the adequate financial  means  to\r\n\r\ncontest effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Information,  Communications  and  the  Arts  (Encik\r\n\r\nYatiman  Yusof):   Sir, during my MPS, I  came  across  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of cases involving taxi drivers who were  alleged\r\n\r\nto  have  committed  offences ranging  from  discourteous\r\n\r\nbehaviour  to  arguing with passengers and  overcharging,\r\n\r\namong others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On receiving the complaints, the taxi companies or\r\n\r\nLTA  would investigate.  The taxi drivers were  asked  to\r\n\r\ngive  explanations,  mostly  in  writing,  and  when  the\r\n\r\ndrivers,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigators,   had\r\n\r\ncommitted  an offence, they would decide and  impose  the\r\n\r\npenalty.   In  many cases, it means that the taxi  driver\r\n\r\nwould  either face suspension or, worse still, lose their\r\n\r\nlicence if they exceed the demerit points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the decision is conveyed to the taxi driver,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no satisfactory avenue for him to  appeal,  so\r\n\r\nthey  approach the MPs.  In my experience,  out  of  more\r\n\r\nthan  three dozen or so appeals that I had handled, there\r\n\r\nwas only one success.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the reason is, among others, to uphold\r\n\r\nthe credible standard of taxi service in Singapore, I can\r\n\r\nstill emphathise with the drivers because, in most cases,\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  drivers feel that this is not  fair.   As  the\r\n\r\nnumber of retrenched workers who seek employment as  full\r\n\r\nor  part-time  taxi drivers increases, the  current  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  are made more vulnerable to losing their  source\r\n\r\nof  income.   To overcome this problem, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  we create some kind of transparent  appeal\r\n\r\nprocess through an arbitration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Mr Andy Gan, had more or less\r\n\r\nsuggested  the composition of the arbitration  panel.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  his suggestion.  I would like  to  know  the\r\n\r\nMinister's view on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first, let me thank all the Members who have spoken\r\n\r\non a very broad range of transport issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address some of the broader land transport\r\n\r\nissues  before replying to the specific points raised  by\r\n\r\nMembers.   One perennial concern of Members, and  of  the\r\n\r\npublic too, is that we have an affordable, quality public\r\n\r\ntransport system.  I, too, share this concern.   The  key\r\n\r\nto  achieving  this objective is to ensure that  we  have\r\n\r\nadequate  competition within each of the  land  transport\r\n\r\nsectors.   And  if  it  is not possible  to  have  direct\r\n\r\ncompetition, to ensure that there are adequate regulatory\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to  ensure  that the  service  providers  are\r\n\r\nincentivised  to  be efficient and cost-effective,  while\r\n\r\nmeeting the stipulated quality of service requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have over the years evolved the competitive\r\n\r\nframework for taxi, bus and MRT services, while  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  commuters' interests are safeguarded.   This  model\r\n\r\nhas  largely served us well.  But it does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nthere is no room for further improvement.  For this year,\r\n\r\none  of  the  priorities of my Ministry is to  completely\r\n\r\nopen  up the taxi industry.  We will allow market  forces\r\n\r\nto  determine  the taxi supply and the fare  levels.   In\r\n\r\nfact, we started in 1998 by allowing the taxi\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies to set their own fares.  However, we still have\r\n\r\nregular complaints about the mis-match between the supply\r\n\r\nand   demand,   especially  during  the   peak   periods,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the CBD area.  There are also  complaints\r\n\r\nabout poor service standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, I informed the House that we would\r\n\r\nbe  deregulating the taxi industry completely  under  our\r\n\r\nnew  licensing  framework.   Come  June  this  year,  new\r\n\r\nplayers  can  enter  the  market  and  compete  with  the\r\n\r\nincumbents  for a slice of the pie.  They can  then  help\r\n\r\nprovide for a better match between supply and demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we deregulate, we must still ensure that\r\n\r\ntaxi companies deliver good service to the commuters.  We\r\n\r\nwill do this by licensing them and requiring them to meet\r\n\r\nthe  Quality of Service (QoS) standards.  This is  a  new\r\n\r\napproach, and I would urge Members to allow some time for\r\n\r\nthe QoS to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will complement this licensing framework with a\r\n\r\ntaxi driver Vocational Licence Points System.  I will  go\r\n\r\ninto  that  further,  because quite a  few  Members  have\r\n\r\ntouched on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to answer the specific\r\n\r\npoints raised by Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay suggested an alternative approach to\r\n\r\nimposing a premium on the North East Line (NEL) fare.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to inform Members that the fare structure  for\r\n\r\nNEL  has  not  been  decided yet.  This  is  because  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit, the operator, has not submitted its proposal.  I\r\n\r\nexpect  SBS  Transit to submit its fare proposal  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council (PTC) within the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nOnly then will the PTC know what the company is proposing\r\n\r\nas the fare structure for NEL.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I had explained to Members a few months ago,\r\n\r\nNEL,  being  fully underground, will cost  more  to  run,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  existing  MRT  lines  now.    The  NEL\r\n\r\noperator  is  therefore more likely to have to  charge  a\r\n\r\nhigher fare in order to cover\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe higher operating costs.  In fact, this possibility of\r\n\r\na  higher fare on NEL was highlighted by Mr Mah Bow  Tan,\r\n\r\nthe  then  Minister for Communications in 1996,  when  he\r\n\r\nannounced the decision to proceed with the NEL project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked that, instead of a differential\r\n\r\nfare  for  NEL,  we explore the option of  maintaining  a\r\n\r\nuniform   fare  structure  for  the  entire  MRT  system,\r\n\r\nincluding NEL.  This is, of course, possible. As  pointed\r\n\r\nout  by  Mr  Chay, we will need to allocate some  of  the\r\n\r\nrevenues from the MRT lines to NEL.  This means that  the\r\n\r\nfares on the existing MRT system will need to increase to\r\n\r\ncover the higher operating costs of NEL.  PTC would  have\r\n\r\nto  consider this proposal very carefully.  The other MRT\r\n\r\ncommuters,  especially  those who  do  not  use  the  NEL\r\n\r\nsystem,  may  object to having to pay more  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncover the higher costs of NEL.  Nevertheless, I will  ask\r\n\r\nthe  PTC  to keep Mr Chay's suggestion in mind  when  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit submits its proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay next asked about the safety features of NEL.\r\n\r\nSir,  LTA has ensured that NEL has all the safety systems\r\n\r\nof the current MRT system, plus additional safeguards and\r\n\r\nsafety  features.  The key feature of NEL is that  it  is\r\n\r\nfully automated.  Train experts believe that this adds to\r\n\r\nthe  safety  of  the system.  This is because  experience\r\n\r\naround  the  world has shown that most the accidents  are\r\n\r\ncaused  by  human  factors.   For  these  reasons,  fully\r\n\r\nautomated  systems  are  becoming  increasingly   popular\r\n\r\nworldwide.   Other  safety  systems  on  NEL  include  an\r\n\r\nAutomated Train Protection System that ensures that there\r\n\r\nwill  always  be a safe distance maintained  between  the\r\n\r\ntrains.   In  addition,  the trains  have  built-in  fire\r\n\r\ndetection  systems, and there are two CCTVs on  board  in\r\n\r\neach  car.  This will enable the operators in the control\r\n\r\nroom  to  monitor  what is happening, as  well  as  allow\r\n\r\npassengers to communicate with the control centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the system will be constantly monitored by\r\n\r\nmultiple  sensor  systems as well as  by  highly  trained\r\n\r\nspecialist controllers in the Operations Control  Centre.\r\n\r\nI would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure Members that LTA and the  operator  have\r\n\r\nbeen  extensively  testing  the  operational  and  safety\r\n\r\nsystems  over the past few months.  They have  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   system   fully  satisfies  LTA's   stringent\r\n\r\nrequirements for operational safety before it is  allowed\r\n\r\nto  commence revenue service.  The operating licence also\r\n\r\nrequires the operator to implement a comprehensive safety\r\n\r\nmanagement system to the satisfaction of LTA.   As  such,\r\n\r\nLTA  designed  and ensured that NEL has  all  the  needed\r\n\r\nsafety   systems  required  for  its  safe   and   smooth\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to Mr Yatiman's cut. I am\r\n\r\nglad  that  Mr  Yatiman likes what LTA has  done  in  the\r\n\r\nstations  of  the  North East Line.  As mentioned  by  Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman, LTA has integrated works of art by local artists\r\n\r\nin  the  architecture.  They reflect the cultural, ethnic\r\n\r\nand  historical  settings  of the  neighbourhood  of  the\r\n\r\nstations.   By  doing  this, LTA  has  created  a  unique\r\n\r\nidentity for each station.  This makes the stations  more\r\n\r\ninteresting, and enhances the commuting experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman has asked whether this can also be done\r\n\r\nfor  the new Circle Line stations.  I understand that the\r\n\r\nbudget for the Circle Line is extremely tight, and it  is\r\n\r\nalready  a big challenge building the Circle Line  within\r\n\r\nthe  budget set for the project.  Nonetheless, I will ask\r\n\r\nLTA  to  review and see if there is any way that  we  can\r\n\r\ntake up Mr Yatiman's suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggested that LTA extend the MRT\r\n\r\nsystem  into Tuas and build new stations on the  existing\r\n\r\nMRT lines to serve the industrial estates that adjoin the\r\n\r\nMRT  lines.   I can assure Mr Yeo that LTA is  constantly\r\n\r\nworking  on improving the public transport system serving\r\n\r\nthe  various  parts of Singapore, especially  areas  with\r\n\r\nhigh   population   or  high  employment  concentrations.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  must  remember that the MRT  line  is  very\r\n\r\ncostly,  both to build and to operate.  For this  reason,\r\n\r\nnew  and extension MRT lines are constructed only if  the\r\n\r\neconomic value they bring to the nation exceeds the  cost\r\n\r\nof  developing and operating the station.  Otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nwill be wasting precious national resources.  I will  ask\r\n\r\nLTA to study\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  an  extension to Tuas makes economic  sense  and\r\n\r\nwhether  the operation of such a line can be  viable.   I\r\n\r\nwill  also  ask  PTC to study the need  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  and frequency of bus services to Tuas  from  Boon\r\n\r\nLay Interchange to meet what Mr Yeo had pointed out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also spoke about the possibility\r\n\r\nof introducing new stations along the existing lines.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  Dover  station, which he  quoted,  it  had\r\n\r\nalready been provided for when we built the existing East-West  MRT line.  It was therefore possible to build  this\r\n\r\nstation  without  too much complication.   For  locations\r\n\r\nwhere  provisions have not been made earlier,  LTA  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  explore  carefully whether the site  conditions\r\n\r\nallow   this.   But  more  importantly,  even   if   site\r\n\r\nconditions allow, a cost-benefit analysis will still have\r\n\r\nto be conducted on its viability.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min spoke on buses. He made two points\r\n\r\nin  his cut.  First he asked LTA and PTC to be more  open\r\n\r\nto  proposals for special bus services to serve the niche\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Sir, Mr Ong may wish to note that PTC supports\r\n\r\nthe  provision of such services and that this is  already\r\n\r\nbeing   done.   These  niche  services  include   premier\r\n\r\nservices  like  express buses and the Bus-Plus  services.\r\n\r\nThere  are also special services targeted at serving  the\r\n\r\npublic during specified times and for specific locations.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  we  have  special  shuttle  services  from\r\n\r\ncondominiums or industrial parks to link them to the  MRT\r\n\r\nstations or even to hawker centres, as Mr Ong has pointed\r\n\r\nout.   As at February this year, PTC had approved a total\r\n\r\nof 114 such non-basic services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who is interested in providing such a special\r\n\r\nservice can obtain the application form from the PTC, or,\r\n\r\nif  they wish, they can even go to the website for a copy\r\n\r\nof the application form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Ong asked about the progress of the\r\n\r\nPTC's  review on bus service standards.   I am  happy  to\r\n\r\ninform Mr Ong that the review is actively underway.  PTC\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  taking into account public feedback and is trying  to\r\n\r\nidentify  some best international practices in  measuring\r\n\r\nbus service performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the proposed standards are robust,\r\n\r\nthe  PTC  will  also conduct a trial audit on  these  new\r\n\r\nstandards once they are finalised.  The results from  the\r\n\r\ntrial audit will then be used to fine-tune the standards.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think  it  is important that  in  reviewing  the\r\n\r\nstandards,  PTC  balances very carefully between  meeting\r\n\r\nrising  expectations of the public and the need to  avoid\r\n\r\nover-imposing  additional costs on  the  operators.   PTC\r\n\r\nexpects  to complete its review and to announce  the  new\r\n\r\nstandards later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on now to the cuts on the taxi\r\n\r\nindustry.  Mr Chay spoke about the need for greater  fare\r\n\r\ndifferentiation and felt that it would not come about  if\r\n\r\nwe  merely  left  it  to  the taxi  operators.   Sir,  he\r\n\r\nsuggested  that LTA consider intervening to  bring  about\r\n\r\nthis  outcome.  I think the words that he used were  that\r\n\r\nwe  should put in place \"some micro mechanisms\".  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  Mr  Chay  that  taxi  drivers  need  to   be\r\n\r\nincentivised  to  be at where and when  they  are  needed\r\n\r\nmost.  He used the word \"fare differentiation\".  It is  a\r\n\r\nbig  word.  In simple terms, it means that not  all  taxi\r\n\r\ntrips, even if they are of equal distance, should attract\r\n\r\nequal fares.  Where and when the demand is greatest,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in the CBD and during the peak periods, or  even\r\n\r\nwhen  there  are  thunderstorms,  passengers  should   be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay more.  In fact, today,  Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\nalready  some  degree of fare differentiation.   This  is\r\n\r\nachieved   through  the  application   of   a   peak-hour\r\n\r\nsurcharge, a CBD surcharge, airport surcharge  and  other\r\n\r\ntaxi surcharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having just liberalised the taxi industry, I\r\n\r\nwould  be  reluctant to now turn around and  micro-manage\r\n\r\nit.   The  setting of fares and the design  of  the  fare\r\n\r\nstructure  are really matters for the taxi  companies  to\r\n\r\nconsider and decide.  I do not think their management  is\r\n\r\nlacking in imagination.  In fact, I think it will be a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsad  day for Singapore if the Government has to teach the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen on how to operate their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, I can ask LTA to look into\r\n\r\nthe possibility of linking some of the Quality of Service\r\n\r\n(QoS) requirements to our taxi service levels, especially\r\n\r\nduring  the  peak periods  - the key is  to  measure  the\r\n\r\noutcome rather than prescribe the micro measures for  the\r\n\r\nindustry  to follow.  In the meantime, LTA and  PTC  will\r\n\r\njoin  the  Member's call to urge the industry  to  better\r\n\r\nmatch supply with demand especially in the CBD during the\r\n\r\npeak periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min spoke on the quality of taxi\r\n\r\nservice.   He  asked why taxi companies are  required  to\r\n\r\nprovide a taxi-booking service, and why not allow  budget\r\n\r\ntaxi  operations  to be set up that are not  required  to\r\n\r\noffer telephone booking services.  Sir, this begs an even\r\n\r\nmore  fundamental  question,  ie,  where  does  the  taxi\r\n\r\nservice stand in the public transport framework?  I  must\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the Member that taxis are not  considered  a\r\n\r\nmeans  of  mass transport. We have very limited land  and\r\n\r\nthis means that buses and the MRT must form our modes  of\r\n\r\nmass   transport.   Taxis  are,  in  fact,  a   form   of\r\n\r\npersonalised transport.  Taxi commuters enjoy a  door-to-door  service, one that is more akin to travelling  in  a\r\n\r\nchauffeur-driven private car.  Ideally, taxis should  not\r\n\r\nbe  cruising  around  looking  for  passengers,  as  they\r\n\r\ncontribute to road congestion and air pollution. But this\r\n\r\nis  a  traditional practice, and I do not intend to  stop\r\n\r\nit.   But  we can, over time, encourage better  usage  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  and our limited roads by encouraging commuters  to\r\n\r\nmake a phone booking.  It gives all commuters who need  a\r\n\r\ntaxi  urgently  the  assurance  that  they  can  get  one\r\n\r\nquickly,  even during peak periods. That is why  we  have\r\n\r\nmade  it compulsory for new entrants into the taxi market\r\n\r\nto  also  provide a phone booking service and it  is  not\r\n\r\nmeant to protect the incumbents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in requiring taxi companies to provide phone-booking services, LTA is mindful of the cost. That is\r\n\r\nwhy LTA will only prescribe minimal requirements and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  the  specific technology to be used for the  booking\r\n\r\nand  despatch  system.  Mr Ong may be worried  about  the\r\n\r\ncost.  LTA has told me that the start-up cost of a simple\r\n\r\nradio-phone booking system for a fleet of about 400 taxis\r\n\r\nis between $250,000 and $420,000.  Sir, this works out to\r\n\r\nabout $600 per taxi, which is less than 1% of the cost of\r\n\r\na taxi.  The cost per taxi will, of course, reduce as the\r\n\r\ntaxi  company  increases the fleet size.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  a phone booking service will  not  be  a\r\n\r\nbarrier to entry of new taxi companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong next went on to talk about taxi fares.\r\n\r\nHe  is  concerned that taxi fares look set to rise.    He\r\n\r\nhas  been  reading the \"tea leaves\" in between  the  last\r\n\r\ntime he spoke in Parliament about the taxi fares and  the\r\n\r\nappearance of an article in the Straits Times  that  said\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  fare in Singapore is too low.  Sir, he  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  actually  it  is  the Government  that  is  unhappy\r\n\r\nbecause  this represents a loss of potential  revenue  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government.   I want to assure Mr  Ong  that  he  is\r\n\r\ntotally  wrong that we are unhappy with the  fare  level.\r\n\r\nNeither  LTA  nor my Ministry has any share in  the  taxi\r\n\r\nfare  revenue.  So  we are quite neutral.   It  makes  no\r\n\r\ndifference to us whether the fares are increased or  not.\r\n\r\nOur  primary  interest is only to ensure that  those  who\r\n\r\nbadly need a taxi are able to get one and that there is a\r\n\r\nbetter balance between supply and demand during the  peak\r\n\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked again that we publicise our preference for\r\n\r\ncommuters to phone for a taxi and tell them not to street\r\n\r\nhail.   Sir,  as  I stated a few minutes ago,  yes,  over\r\n\r\ntime,  we  would  like more commuters to  use  the  phone\r\n\r\nbooking service, especially those who want a taxi  badly.\r\n\r\nBut  for  those who are prepared to wait by the roadside,\r\n\r\nthey  can still continue to do so.  There is no need  for\r\n\r\nus  to stop this practice.  But commuters who do so  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  we cannot assure them  of  the  waiting\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong is also worried that the QoS would force taxi\r\n\r\noperators  to  take their taxis off the road  by  putting\r\n\r\nthem on stand-by.  He cited CityCab's decision to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduce  the charge for a phone booking and he is  worried\r\n\r\nthat  if  they get swamped with calls, they will  not  be\r\n\r\nable to manage with their current fleet size.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the existing taxi operators are more\r\n\r\nenterprising  than what Mr Ong is prepared to  give  them\r\n\r\ncredit  for.  I am sure that if the demand is strong  for\r\n\r\nboth the phone booking and street hail, they will find  a\r\n\r\nway  to  balance the two and not to totally ignore street\r\n\r\nhail  commuters.  This is because if they do ignore them,\r\n\r\nthey  will only encourage new entrepreneurs to enter  and\r\n\r\nto meet this unfilled demand.  If CityCab is swamped with\r\n\r\nphone bookings, I think this would be a happy problem for\r\n\r\nthem.  They  have the freedom to expand their fleet  size\r\n\r\nnow.  Previously, we restricted them to a certain number.\r\n\r\nNow they are free to expand as and when they like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong then went on to talk about competition in the\r\n\r\ntaxi  industry.   Sir,  he  expressed  concern  that  the\r\n\r\nComfort-Delgro merger would create an even more  dominant\r\n\r\nplayer  and that having this very dominant player,  where\r\n\r\nthey  can  determine their price and the taxi trends,  it\r\n\r\nwould  deter competitors from coming in or from having  a\r\n\r\ndifferent price structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong is indeed correct to be concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  merger.  In fact, I was too, which was  why  when  I\r\n\r\nheard about it, I straightaway asked my staff to find out\r\n\r\nfrom  Delgro and Comfort what were their intentions  with\r\n\r\nregard  to CityCab and Comfort taxis.  Comfort and Delgro\r\n\r\nhave  since explained publicly that after their  proposed\r\n\r\nmerger, their respective taxi operations will continue to\r\n\r\noperate  separately.  Each will have  its  own  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors  and  management.  But they  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nobtain  synergies  in  their  back-end  operations.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  they  can  do bulk purchases  of  fuel,  tyres,\r\n\r\nvehicles, etc.  This would give them greater economies of\r\n\r\nscale  and  result in cost savings which  I  think  would\r\n\r\neventually be passed on to commuters.  But we  will  have\r\n\r\nto   continue  to  watch  the  merger  very  closely  and\r\n\r\ncarefully.   LTA now has powers to ensure  that  dominant\r\n\r\nplayers  do  not  engage in anti-competitive  behaviours,\r\n\r\nwhich is what Mr Ong is concerned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout.  I can assure Mr Ong that LTA will not hesitate to\r\n\r\ntake  appropriate actions should the dominant players  be\r\n\r\nfound to be doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to pricing, I think despite the\r\n\r\nfact that we have a dominant player, this would not deter\r\n\r\ncompanies from varying their prices.  In fact, TIBS today\r\n\r\nhas  a  slightly  different price structure  compared  to\r\n\r\nDelgro  or Comfort and CityCab.  I am sure, with  greater\r\n\r\ncompetition, they will continue to innovate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Andy Gan, Mr Yatiman\r\n\r\nYusof and Mr Wee Siew Kim expressed concerns about having\r\n\r\nadequate  protection  for taxi drivers,  especially  when\r\n\r\nthere  are disputes or when there are complaints  against\r\n\r\nthem.   They asked for a more transparent appeal  process\r\n\r\nfor  the taxi-drivers and they suggested that we have  an\r\n\r\narbitration panel or a dispute resolution panel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me state that it is in the taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies' interest to ensure that they treat their  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  carefully and build up good rapport  with  them.\r\n\r\nThis is because while taxi drivers need the companies  in\r\n\r\norder  to  get their taxis, the taxi companies  need  the\r\n\r\ndrivers  equally much because, without the drivers,  they\r\n\r\nwill be in trouble.  The satisfied and happy drivers will\r\n\r\nalso be able to provide a better service to commuters and\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  will again eventually  flow  back  to  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Treating the drivers well also helps the taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies retain their good drivers.  I am glad that  the\r\n\r\ntaxi   companies  do  indeed  recognise  this   symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship  as  seen by the fact that  they  have  gone\r\n\r\nahead  to  introduce many measures to help their  drivers\r\n\r\nfinancially.  For  example, they have passed  on  to  the\r\n\r\ndrivers the diesel tax savings, they have offered  rental\r\n\r\nrebates  and they have passed down the bulk discounts  on\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of diesel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while most taxi drivers do a good job, from\r\n\r\ntime to time, there will be some who fail to deliver good\r\n\r\ncustomer service or, more importantly, infringe upon some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrules and regulations.  But I agree with Members that  in\r\n\r\nsuch cases, the disciplinary framework on the part of the\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies and LTA should be transparent,  fair  and\r\n\r\nnot arbitrary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to inform Members that LTA is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  revising the disciplinary framework.   Under  this\r\n\r\nrevised  framework, there will be a clear delineation  of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  between LTA  and  the  taxi  companies.\r\n\r\nLTA will deal with complaints relating to infringement of\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations by the taxi  drivers,  eg,  over-charging by the drivers.  LTA will accordingly award  the\r\n\r\ndemerit points under the Vocational Licence Points System\r\n\r\n(VLPS).   On  the  other hand, taxi companies  will  only\r\n\r\nhandle  the  complaints relating to customer service  and\r\n\r\nthey  will not be empowered to issue demerit points under\r\n\r\nthe VLPS.  Sir, to make it transparent, LTA would publish\r\n\r\na schedule of fines and demerit points and the guidelines\r\n\r\nfor  suspending or revoking the vocational licence.  This\r\n\r\nwill enhance the transparency of the framework.  The taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  will  have a clearer understanding  about  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and what is expected of them.\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the fairness of the system, under the\r\n\r\npresent  system,  when a passenger or commuter  lodges  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint,  LTA  or  the taxi company  will  examine  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint and they need not necessarily call up the  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  or  the passenger for an interview.   Under  this\r\n\r\nrevised system, LTA will require both the complainant, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  taxi driver, to turn up for interviews  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  full facts can be ascertained.  And only  when\r\n\r\nLTA  has  been clearly satisfied that there has  been  an\r\n\r\ninfringement  of  the  rules  and  regulations  will  LTA\r\n\r\nproceed  to  penalise the taxi driver.  The  taxi  driver\r\n\r\nwill still have an appeals process.  He can appeal to LTA\r\n\r\nor,  if  there  is  a suspension of the licence,  he  can\r\n\r\nappeal to the Minister for Transport as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the part of the taxi drivers, they will also\r\n\r\nbe required to carry out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  interviews  accordingly.  Sir, notwithstanding  this\r\n\r\nnew system of requiring interviews to be carried out,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  the disputes between  taxi  drivers  and\r\n\r\ncompanies  will still arise from time to time, but  there\r\n\r\nare  already avenues in place for taxi drivers to resolve\r\n\r\ntheir  disputes  with their company.  The aggrieved  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers   can  approach  their  respective  taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nassociations for help.  And, in fact, that is one of  the\r\n\r\nkey  roles  performed  by the taxi drivers  associations.\r\n\r\nThis  approach has worked fairly well, and I think  there\r\n\r\nis  no  need  for the Ministry to step in  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nseparate dispute and resolution panel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Ang Mong Seng spoke\r\n\r\nabout the $25 a month fee.  They are concerned about  the\r\n\r\nquantum  and  they  are  also  concerned  that  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  may just pass this on to the taxi drivers  and\r\n\r\nto commuters.  Sir, let me first explain the need for the\r\n\r\ntaxi licence fee and put the fee quantum in perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licence fee is linked to LTA's objective and its\r\n\r\nefforts  to  improve  the level  of  taxi  service.   The\r\n\r\nlicensing  regime will require LTA, as the regulator,  to\r\n\r\nclosely  monitor  the performance of taxi  operators  and\r\n\r\ntheir compliance with the QoS.  LTA will also investigate\r\n\r\nand  enforce  against errant taxi drivers under  the  new\r\n\r\nVocational  Licence  Points System.   As  these  are  new\r\n\r\nactivities,  additional  manpower  resources  and,  hence\r\n\r\nfunding, will be required.  The licence fee is to  enable\r\n\r\nLTA to fund these new activities.  The licence fee of $25\r\n\r\nper taxi per month works out to less than 1% of the gross\r\n\r\nturnover of the taxi companies.  It amounts to less  than\r\n\r\nthree  cents  per taxi trip, against an average  fare  of\r\n\r\naround  $7.00 per trip.  The impact on the taxi operating\r\n\r\ncost  is,  therefore, extremely small.  Sir, in addition,\r\n\r\nthe  taxi companies themselves have been making very good\r\n\r\nprofits.   In  fact,  Comfort  last  year  experienced  a\r\n\r\nsignificant increase in the profit level.  I  would  also\r\n\r\ntherefore hope, just as the Members have spoken, that the\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies do not pass on this taxi licence  fee  to\r\n\r\nthe drivers as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as LTA will need to set up an audit enforcement\r\n\r\nframework  immediately, the work would be more  intensive\r\n\r\nin  the  first two years of this system.  The $25 licence\r\n\r\nfee  is  based  on  the  budget  of  this  initial,  more\r\n\r\nintensive, phase of the regulatory work.  I am  happy  to\r\n\r\ntherefore inform Mr Ang that LTA will review the  quantum\r\n\r\nof  the  licence fee and look into reducing it after  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered all the questions put\r\n\r\nup  so  far.  I will ask my Senior Minister of  State  to\r\n\r\nanswer the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  raised an important point and I  want  to  just\r\n\r\nclarify.  I did not ask for the fare structure of SMRT to\r\n\r\nbe raised.  I said there should be feeder rebates between\r\n\r\nthe  systems  so  that when the North  East  Line  passes\r\n\r\npassengers  over to the SMRT line there will  be  certain\r\n\r\ngains  for SMRT.  Therefore, for such gains, there should\r\n\r\nbe  a rebates scheme whereby the cost is defrayed on  the\r\n\r\nNE  Line.   This kind of mechanism has to  be  looked  at\r\n\r\nbefore  we  straightaway  go  for  fare  increases,  just\r\n\r\nbecause there is some additional cost.

In  the\r\n\r\npast, this was never done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, let me first reply to the two cuts by Mr\r\n\r\nWee  Siew  Kim  yesterday.  Mr  Wee  spoke  on  licencing\r\n\r\nconditions  that we impose on public transport operators.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that  we should avoid over-stringent  licensing\r\n\r\nconditions  as  they  will  inevitably  lead  to   higher\r\n\r\noperating costs and transport fares.  I agree with Mr Wee\r\n\r\nthat every regulation has a cost and that we should avoid\r\n\r\nover-stringent   licensing   conditions.     Hence,    in\r\n\r\nformulating  rules and standards, we go for  the  minimum\r\n\r\nthat  will ensure an acceptable level of service,  safety\r\n\r\nand  operational efficiency.  The operating principle  is\r\n\r\nto  keep  the  cost  of  public  transport  low,  without\r\n\r\nsacrificing standards of safety and comfort.  But as  the\r\n\r\nneeds  and expectations of commuters do change with time,\r\n\r\nregulations  will  also have to evolve  with  time.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  air-conditioned buses were considered  a  frill\r\n\r\nwhen we were young, but this is now a basic item.  So, we\r\n\r\nhave  to raise the standards to allow for air-conditioned\r\n\r\nbuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee added that regulators should work closely\r\n\r\nwith  transport operators on such regular reviews as they\r\n\r\nhave  useful ground experience and would be in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition to advise on which licencing condition should be\r\n\r\nfurther  relaxed.  I totally agree with this  partnership\r\n\r\napproach.  In fact, it was through such industry feedback\r\n\r\nthat  we  decided, not too long ago, to extend the  life-span of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  buses  from 12 years to 15 years.  The  extension\r\n\r\nsaves  the  bus operators a lot of money, with downstream\r\n\r\nbenefits for commuters.  We will continue to consult  the\r\n\r\ntransport operators on such matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee's second cut was on transfer rebate. He said\r\n\r\nthat  transfer  rebate  should be regularly  reviewed  to\r\n\r\nensure  equitable treatment for all.  I  agree  with  him\r\n\r\nthat transfer rebate should be based on the principle  of\r\n\r\nequity.   Specifically, Mr Wee wanted to be assured  that\r\n\r\ncommuters using feeder services, without any transfer  to\r\n\r\na  trunk service, should not be unduly penalised.  Let me\r\n\r\nexplain how the transfer rebate came about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago, feeder fares used to be lower than the\r\n\r\nminimum  trunk  fares.  Actually, they were under-priced.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, the fare was lower than  the  operating\r\n\r\ncosts  of the feeder bus operator.  This was clearly  not\r\n\r\nsustainable as a viable bus operation requires  fares  to\r\n\r\nat  least  cover the cost.  Effectively, feeder  services\r\n\r\nwere being cross-subsidised by trunk services.  This  has\r\n\r\nto  be  rectified.  A simple solution was  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nfeeder  bus fare to the right level, and be aligned  with\r\n\r\nthe minimum trunk fares which were correctly priced.  But\r\n\r\nif  we  simply raise the feeder bus fares to the  minimum\r\n\r\ntrunk  fares, commuters who transfer between  feeder  and\r\n\r\ntrunk  services  will be overcharged.  To overcome  this,\r\n\r\ntransfer  rebates were introduced.  So this  has  allowed\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Transport  Council to  gradually  align  the\r\n\r\nfeeder  fares  with  the  minimum  trunk  fares,  without\r\n\r\nraising the cost of transfers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we adjust feeder fares, the transfer rebates were\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly raised.  The end result is that  the  net\r\n\r\nfeeder  fare  payable by the commuter remains  unchanged.\r\n\r\nIt  is  easier  if I can give you an example.   When  the\r\n\r\nfeeder fare for air-conditioned buses was increased by 10\r\n\r\ncents  to 60 cents in the year 2001, the transfer  rebate\r\n\r\nwas  also raised by 10 cents, from 15 cents to 25  cents.\r\n\r\nSo the end result, the net feeder fare payable remains at\r\n\r\n35  cents.   Incidentally, Members may wish to note  that\r\n\r\nthis is the same fare, as what the bus operators\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharged   in   1994  when  feeder  services  were   first\r\n\r\nintroduced.    In  short,  the  current   transfer   fare\r\n\r\nstructure does allow for a fair matching of cost to fare,\r\n\r\nand  nobody  is unduly penalised.  But I agree  with  him\r\n\r\nthat   we  should  regularly  review  the  structure   as\r\n\r\ncircumstances change so as to preserve equity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me reply to Mr Ong Kian Min's question\r\n\r\non  an aborted LTA project costing some $40 million.   He\r\n\r\nwas referring to the bus travel information system.  This\r\n\r\nwas  a project initiated by LTA in 1999.  The purpose was\r\n\r\nto  let  commuters know with better accuracy the  arrival\r\n\r\ntimes of buses.  Let me give Members the background  that\r\n\r\nled to this project.  At that time, several bus companies\r\n\r\nwere,  on  their own, developing what they called  \"Fleet\r\n\r\nManagement  Systems\" computer software  to  manage  their\r\n\r\nfleet.   The  purpose  was to locate the  whereabouts  of\r\n\r\ntheir  buses,  and there were thousands of them,  at  any\r\n\r\nparticular point in time.  LTA saw an opportunity to ride\r\n\r\non this Fleet Management Systems by (a) making it nation-wide through integrating them, because there were several\r\n\r\nsystems  and operators; and (b) adding a new  feature  to\r\n\r\npredict bus arrival times for the benefit of commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention was good but, unfortunately, LTA and\r\n\r\nthe   bus  operators  had  severely  under-estimated  the\r\n\r\ncomplexity  of the project, in particular,  the  computer\r\n\r\nsoftware  to interface the different bus company  systems\r\n\r\nturned  out  to  be a lot more complicated,  a  lot  more\r\n\r\ndifficult.   As  a result, the project experienced  major\r\n\r\ndelays  and  would  have  resulted  in  significant  cost\r\n\r\noverruns  if the project were to run to completion.   So,\r\n\r\nat  a  recent  meeting, not too long ago,  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors  of LTA reviewed the project.  After evaluating\r\n\r\nits  prospects, weighing the revised costs and  benefits,\r\n\r\nthe LTA Board decided to abort the project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, about $10 million, and not $40 million as\r\n\r\nreported  by  the media, has been spent on this  project.\r\n\r\nWhat  were the main cost items?  They were (a) a  nation-wide radio communications system; (b) the equipment for a\r\n\r\ncentral computer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  (c)  the computer software.   Although  the\r\n\r\nproject  has  been aborted, fortunately, the efforts,  in\r\n\r\nthis  instance,  put in have not all  been  wasted.   The\r\n\r\nequipment  which has been acquired will have  useful  use\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  Specifically, LTA will be modifying the radio\r\n\r\ncommunications system to support its existing  Expressway\r\n\r\nMonitoring  and Advisory System (EMAS).   In  fact,  this\r\n\r\nmodification will then save LTA about $2.2 million  every\r\n\r\nyear in data transmission cost, as it will then no longer\r\n\r\nneed to rely on a third party wireless service provider.\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked if there were feasibility studies\r\n\r\ndone  before  LTA  embarked on this project.  Yes,  there\r\n\r\nwere.   As  LTA  would  be breaking new  ground,  it  did\r\n\r\nseveral  smaller  scale trials in 1995,  1997  and  1999,\r\n\r\nbefore  the project went full scale. The trials  were  on\r\n\r\nsmaller  scales involving only a few buses.  In the  1999\r\n\r\ntrial,  the  team  was  able to achieve  accuracy  levels\r\n\r\nranging  from  87%  to 99%, which were quite  acceptable.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, major integration problems arose when  the\r\n\r\nproject was scaled up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to focus my comments on vehicle and fuel taxes,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  impact on transportation costs as well as business\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, financial measures, whether they\r\n\r\ncome  in  the  form  of  incentives,  disincentives   and\r\n\r\npenalties,  have always been used to achieve  social  and\r\n\r\nother  objectives.   For example,  we  have  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworker levy to control the population of foreign workers,\r\n\r\nand  we  also  have incentives given to couples  to  have\r\n\r\nlarger  families.  But I think nowhere do we  find  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  being  widely used than in the  case  of  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  to control road traffic congestion.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  we  have  seen  penalties after  penalties  being\r\n\r\nintroduced  and levelled against car owners  as  well  as\r\n\r\nusers.  This broad and complex range includes excise tax,\r\n\r\nroad  tax,  ARF,  COE, fuel and vehicle taxes,  and  also\r\n\r\nparking   fees.   All  these  have  added   on   to   the\r\n\r\ntransportation cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  have made it very expensive and, hence, have  also\r\n\r\naffected  business  costs,  because  transportation  cost\r\n\r\nforms a quite significant portion of business costs,  and\r\n\r\nwill therefore erode our business competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from having a very complex system, it\r\n\r\nhas  also  produced a few quirks.  For example,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to cite the example of second hand vehicles.  It  is\r\n\r\nmuch more profitable to scrap than to sell them as second\r\n\r\nhand  vehicles.  This is sheer wastage, because cars  can\r\n\r\nbe  used  beyond five years.  They can be used for  10-15\r\n\r\nyears,  or more than that.  Quite apart from wastage,  we\r\n\r\nalso have a significant capital outflow because we import\r\n\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quirk is that businesses which use diesel\r\n\r\nfor  their  equipment have also to  bear  the  burden  of\r\n\r\ndiesel   tax  when  they  do  not  contribute   to   road\r\n\r\ncongestion.   My  comment here is that we  are  now  very\r\n\r\nexperienced  in knowing what sort of measures  we  should\r\n\r\nhave  to  achieve  a smoother traffic  flow,  because  we\r\n\r\nreally  do have a very good road system.  We do not  have\r\n\r\nroad  congestion  and all these promote  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nbusiness centre.  But I think we need to consolidate.  We\r\n\r\nneed   to  simplify  our  system,  concentrate  on  those\r\n\r\nmeasures which work towards achieving a smoother  traffic\r\n\r\nflow  and  really unravel the very complex web  of  fees,\r\n\r\ncharges  and taxes, indirect as well as direct.   At  the\r\n\r\nend of the day, a simpler system would be much superior.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I speak with concern\r\n\r\nregarding the proliferation of ERP technologies currently\r\n\r\nadopted  by  several  private car park  managements.

It has brought convenience\r\n\r\nto  the  residents.  Quality service along the  frequency\r\n\r\nand reliability dimensions has been enhanced.  Truly,  we\r\n\r\nmust commend the LTA for bringing to life the White Paper\r\n\r\non  Public Transportation of 1996.  While the light  rail\r\n\r\nsystem  now has provided enhanced reliability and to  the\r\n\r\ndot  predictability,  one must not forget  that  the  LRT\r\n\r\nsystem, by and large, is expensive to build and maintain.\r\n\r\nCost must always remain paramount at the forefront of our\r\n\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there have\r\n\r\nbeen  continuing  studies  and considerations  for  other\r\n\r\nforms  of  transportation, so that future generations  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can continue to look forward to increasingly\r\n\r\nmore    efficient   and   cost   effective    modes    of\r\n\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  commend the Ministry on the work that has  been\r\n\r\ndone in both ensuring the disabled and elder friendliness\r\n\r\nof  the North East Line, and also on the ongoing work  in\r\n\r\nretrofitting  existing stations  so  that  they  will  be\r\n\r\naccessible  to  the  semi-ambulant and wheelchair  bound.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in the public transport system, it is  actually\r\n\r\nof  little  use if only segments of the system are  elder\r\n\r\nfriendly,  as the user is then still unable  to  complete\r\n\r\nhis or her journey from one point to the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the MRT stations as an illustration, having\r\n\r\nthe  stations internally totally accessible to the  frail\r\n\r\nand  wheelchair bound is useless if the connecting  buses\r\n\r\nare  inaccessible, or if the frail or semi-ambulant elder\r\n\r\nis  unable  to  get to the station, because  of  overhead\r\n\r\npedestrian  bridges,  underpasses,  raised  pavements  or\r\n\r\nkerbs  surrounding  the station.  I  am  not  quite  sure\r\n\r\nwhether overhead\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npedestrian bridges, underpasses, pavements and kerbs  are\r\n\r\nunder the purview of the Transport Ministry or MND.   But\r\n\r\nI  do  hope  that  whichever  it  is,  the  planning  and\r\n\r\nimplementation of access across systems and precincts are\r\n\r\nbeing well coordinated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to buses, I understand that the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  assessed that it will not be practical to  introduce\r\n\r\nsuch wheelchair accessible features as kneeling buses, as\r\n\r\nit  is  anticipated that this would slow down  the  whole\r\n\r\nsystem  too much.  However, there are many other  simpler\r\n\r\nfeatures that our buses can have that will make them much\r\n\r\nmore user friendly to ambulant senior citizens, and these\r\n\r\ninclude zero step boarding, stepless aisle buses or steps\r\n\r\nof lower height, properly placed rubberised handgrips and\r\n\r\nsuch features.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, again, that the Ministry has prescribed\r\n\r\nsteps  height  of 360 mm or less  for all new  buses.   I\r\n\r\nwant to ask whether, in fact, all the buses in our system\r\n\r\nhave already been converted by now.  It was sometime  ago\r\n\r\nthat this was prescribed.  If not, when is it anticipated\r\n\r\nthat this will be achieved?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger bus service numbers will also be helpful for\r\n\r\nsenior   citizens   to   quickly  and   easily   identify\r\n\r\napproaching  buses.  And also software features  such  as\r\n\r\nbus  workers'  skills  and attitudes  in  providing  some\r\n\r\nassistance or simply being mindful not to accelerate  and\r\n\r\ndecelerate too quickly coming into and leaving bus  bays,\r\n\r\nand  allowing enough time for the older passengers to get\r\n\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusion of cost of wheelchair lifts and\r\n\r\ninstallation of such lifts from the OMV of a vehicle when\r\n\r\ncomputing  the  ARF  in  the budget  this  year  is  most\r\n\r\nwelcome.  And this is targeted at the vans used  by  VWOs\r\n\r\nto provide transport service for the elderly and disabled\r\n\r\nclients.   But, in many developed countries, it has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised that it is actually far more cost effective to\r\n\r\ntransport  the  disabled and elderly by mainstream  taxis\r\n\r\nwith special transportation service, often carried out by\r\n\r\nthe mainstream taxi operators.  They can provide door-to-door\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  round the clock and give travel assistance  such\r\n\r\nas  helping  the  passenger in and out  of  the  vehicle.\r\n\r\nEssentially,  all  that it takes is some  basic  training\r\n\r\nalthough, of course, added features in the cabs like grab\r\n\r\nhandles  to  aid entry and exit, swivel seats  and  wider\r\n\r\ndoor openings are also very helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi fares in Singapore compare very favourably with\r\n\r\nmany  other  developed countries.

I would like to  take  up  the\r\n\r\nplight and plea of older persons, otherwise known as  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  in  heeding  the  call  of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\npractise  active ageing, including remaining or rejoining\r\n\r\nthe workforce where possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many senior citizens who would like\r\n\r\nto be in employment, but who find difficulty in doing so.\r\n\r\nThey cite a number of factors.  One of these is commuting\r\n\r\nby mass public transport.  While eligible senior citizens\r\n\r\nare  appreciative  of the concessionary public  transport\r\n\r\nfares for off-peak travel, they find the applicable  time\r\n\r\nperiod  for travel restrictive.  They mentioned that  for\r\n\r\nthem, because of reduced employment income, they have  to\r\n\r\nrely  on the mass public transport to commute to and from\r\n\r\nwork, and many have working hours that require them to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nride  the  buses,  MRT  or LRT during  peak  hours,  thus\r\n\r\nincurring higher transport costs, especially in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  recent  fare hikes.  Then there are  those  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  fit  and healthy and who can take public transport\r\n\r\nat  all  times of the day that the mass public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem is in operation.  They do not think it a danger to\r\n\r\nbe  part of the rush hour human traffic.  Besides, senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  are sensible persons.  They would not  wish  to\r\n\r\njeopardise   their own safety nor that of others.    They\r\n\r\nwould know that for themselves whether it is safe or  not\r\n\r\nfor  them  to travel during peak times.  So there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed to confine them to off-peak periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, would the Minister kindly\r\n\r\ninitiate   a   review   of  existing   public   transport\r\n\r\nregulations that impede opportunities for senior citizens\r\n\r\nto  be  gainfully  employed and to enjoy  active  ageing?\r\n\r\nThis  is  also  in line with the thrust of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nReview  Committee's recommendations regarding  employment\r\n\r\nof  older workers.  I know that this has been brought  up\r\n\r\nbefore  in  this House and the older persons  would  just\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to please review and assist them as far\r\n\r\nas possible, and thus make their day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I would like to move on to a\r\n\r\nfree  do-it-yourself  mode  of  transport,  ie,  cycling.\r\n\r\nOften  times,  we  have heard that the  unkind  Singapore\r\n\r\nweather is not conducive to cycling and that seems to  be\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for not promoting cycling as a more  popular\r\n\r\nmeans of transport.  But I believe that the habitants  of\r\n\r\nany  place  on  earth have to learn to  cope  with  their\r\n\r\nenvironment.   In  discussing for more  to  be  done  for\r\n\r\ncyclists,  we  seem  to have a mental  picture  of  quiet\r\n\r\ncountry   roads,  where  the  sun  is  shining  but   the\r\n\r\ntemperature is a cool comfortable 15 degrees Celsius  and\r\n\r\nthe humidity is low.  We seem to believe that cycling can\r\n\r\nonly  be  done  in  such an ideal environment.   But  the\r\n\r\nreality  is that even in a cycling country like  Holland,\r\n\r\nthe  sun does not always shine every day.  Cyclists  have\r\n\r\nto  learn  to face the rain, the cold and even the  snow,\r\n\r\nbut  many  people  there  still  cycle  as  a  means   of\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  face  different,  but equally unpleasant,  problems\r\n\r\nwith the elements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we just have to adapt and learn to cope with\r\n\r\nthe  weather.  We should take a deeper look at how we can\r\n\r\nmake  it easier for those who may want to cycle,  if  our\r\n\r\ndrivers are less harsh on cyclists and our roads safer.\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from cycling to and from work, we should also\r\n\r\nconsider   the   needs  of  the  recreational   cyclists.\r\n\r\nNowadays,  I see more and more serious cyclists,  donning\r\n\r\ntheir  brightly  coloured racing suits and  riding  their\r\n\r\nexpensive  bicycles on weekends in areas such as  Holland\r\n\r\nRoad and Bukit Timah.  At present, I see many of them are\r\n\r\nexpatriates.  Nevertheless, this is a happy sight and  we\r\n\r\nshould  encourage  more  people to  participate  in  this\r\n\r\nhealthy  affordable  sport.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider  setting  aside  for  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncyclists  during  weekends the left  lane  of  three-lane\r\n\r\nroads  in certain suitable areas and making some  efforts\r\n\r\nto  educate motorists to look out for and have due regard\r\n\r\nfor  these cyclists.  I believe this will be a good start\r\n\r\nand,  over  time, the attitude and behaviour  of  vehicle\r\n\r\ndrivers  towards cyclists will change for the  better  to\r\n\r\nmake our roads safer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  spate of complaints by pedestrians on what  they\r\n\r\ncall the \"bicycle menace\" on pedestrian footpaths.  I can\r\n\r\nemphathise with them.  Just last night, I was almost  hit\r\n\r\nby a cyclist racing by from behind.  But I can emphathise\r\n\r\nwith  cyclists  too, as most roads are too dangerous  for\r\n\r\nthem,  especially the main roads.  Cars and  buses  often\r\n\r\nzoom  by very closely to the cyclists, endangering  their\r\n\r\nlives,  and  taxis are particularly treacherous  as  they\r\n\r\nswerve  suddenly to the kerb with little notice, to  pick\r\n\r\nup passengers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pedestrians angry with cyclists on pavements\r\n\r\nare  really barking up the wrong wheel.  They  should  be\r\n\r\ndirecting  their unhappiness at the wheels of bureaucracy\r\n\r\nof LTA.  The LTA does not factor in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  need  for bicycle lanes in its road planning.   With\r\n\r\nmore  taking to cycling, they should widen the roads  and\r\n\r\nbuild  an  extra  lane  for cyclists  in  certain  areas,\r\n\r\nseparate from the pavements for pedestrians.  Indeed,  in\r\n\r\nTampines,  it is not uncommon to see cyclists, especially\r\n\r\nwomen, transporting their children to school on bicycles.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has replied that there are  already  park\r\n\r\nconnectors, but these tracks so far mainly only link  our\r\n\r\nmajor  parks and nature sites.  And the purpose  for  the\r\n\r\npark connectors is for leisure cycling and not as a means\r\n\r\nof transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to connect them to roads to allow\r\n\r\nresidents  to  ride  to places that  they  frequent,  for\r\n\r\nexample, schools, markets, shops and to their homes.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has also said before that town councils should\r\n\r\nbe  the ones to look into providing cycling tracks within\r\n\r\ntheir   HDB   estates.   I  agree  that  town   councils,\r\n\r\nespecially with the support of their MPs, should  be  the\r\n\r\nright  channel to advise the LTA on the areas  that  need\r\n\r\nbicycle  lanes.  Indeed, in Tampines, we are  looking  at\r\n\r\nhow  to build cycling lanes and cycling tracks to connect\r\n\r\nto  the park connectors.  But, in the end, we still  have\r\n\r\nto  seek the approval of the LTA.  And there is a lot  of\r\n\r\nred  tape  involved.  The park connectors are  under  the\r\n\r\nNational Parks Board; the roads are under LTA; the common\r\n\r\nareas in town councils are under the town councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that the right agency - the lead\r\n\r\nagency  -  in building bicycle lanes should be LTA.   LTA\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  one  planning for and providing  bicycle\r\n\r\nlanes  as  part of the public transport for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, as more Singaporeans take up cycling, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that there should be a concerted effort to  educate\r\n\r\nthem  on  road  safety.   I  think,  very  frankly,  many\r\n\r\ncyclists  do not know the traffic rules very  well.   But\r\n\r\nyou  cannot really blame them, because they do  not  take\r\n\r\ndriving theory tests, like the way that drivers have  to.\r\n\r\nBut  I am not saying that they should take tests.   I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  that there should be education mounted  to  teach\r\n\r\ncyclists what are the rules.  Frankly, at one time I  was\r\n\r\ncycling to work everyday, from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper  East Coast Road to Kim Seng Road, never  mind  the\r\n\r\nweather  -  very  hot, but I cycled  to  work  because  I\r\n\r\nenjoyed cycling and I was training.  One night when I was\r\n\r\ncycling  home,  I  was  knocked  down  by  a  taxi  in  a\r\n\r\nroundabout.   Frankly, I was not sure whether  I  or  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver was in the wrong.  But later when I took  up\r\n\r\ndriving  and  I  had to go through the  theory  tests,  I\r\n\r\nrealised  that the taxi driver was in the  wrong;  so,  I\r\n\r\nfelt better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, you have to cycle faster\r\n\r\nbecause your time is nearly up!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Today, there is a big\r\n\r\ncontroversy  about  whether  cyclists  could  use   zebra\r\n\r\ncrossings.   So  I  think  there should  be  some  effort\r\n\r\nmounted to educate cyclists on road safety.  And I  worry\r\n\r\nnow,  because of the outcry about cyclists on  pavements,\r\n\r\ncyclists  will  now feel compelled to go onto  the  roads\r\n\r\nwithout  being  prepared  to  take  on  the  dangers   of\r\n\r\ncompeting with the big vehicles for space on the roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, there is a hotchpotch of\r\n\r\ncuts.  Let me take them chronologically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the cut by Mrs Fang Ai Lian. In\r\n\r\nprinciple, I agree with her that taxes and levies  should\r\n\r\nbe  as  simple as possible for easier administration  and\r\n\r\ncompliance.  She asked whether we could continue to  work\r\n\r\nand  simplify  further our vehicle taxes.  Actually,  our\r\n\r\nvehicle  taxes  are not that complicated.  When  vehicles\r\n\r\nare   registered,   they  are  subject   to   a   nominal\r\n\r\nregistration  fee  of  $140.  In addition,  there  is  an\r\n\r\nAdditional  Registration Fee (ARF)  and  an  Excise  Duty\r\n\r\n(ED).   Both serve the purpose of curbing car population.\r\n\r\nAfter that, you just pay the annual road tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, these taxes allow us to achieve a\r\n\r\nbalance between cost of ownership and cost of usage.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  cannot be a static picture, and my  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  always  work with Ministry of Finance to  fine-tune\r\n\r\nthis  balance.  Over the years, we have done so.   But  I\r\n\r\ntake  the  point  of  Mrs Fang that  the  situation  does\r\n\r\nchange,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  if  it  does,  I think we should always  be  on  the\r\n\r\nlookout.  Especially, she mentioned about quirks here and\r\n\r\nthere, which have distorted the consumer behaviour.  Then\r\n\r\nwe  should  try  to fix them.  I am open to  suggestions.\r\n\r\nAnd  some  of those quirks that she mentioned, I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  personal knowledge of them, but we will  look  into\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did make a point that we sometimes\r\n\r\ninadvertently contribute to business cost, and  she  gave\r\n\r\nthe example of diesel tax.  For diesel tax, we do not add\r\n\r\nto  business  cost.   Goods vehicles  and  buses  run  on\r\n\r\ndiesel,  are not charged diesel tax at all, and precisely\r\n\r\nfor  the reason that she gave, which is we wanted to keep\r\n\r\nbusiness cost low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia spoke about the increasing use of ERP\r\n\r\ntechnology  in  car parks and so on, and he  was  greatly\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  security and whether some  people  will\r\n\r\ncome along with some gadget and zap away all the money in\r\n\r\nour  cashcards.  This is certainly a valid concern.   Let\r\n\r\nme  give  a little bit of background to provide a  bigger\r\n\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cashcards were introduced in 1996, when we took a\r\n\r\nbig step into the cashless society.  We were not alone in\r\n\r\nthis movement but we were among the early adopters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons for promoting cashcards.\r\n\r\nBasically, handling cash is a very inefficient and costly\r\n\r\nbusiness.   To  businesses, going cashless  spells  lower\r\n\r\ncost   and  higher  productivity.   To  consumers,  going\r\n\r\ncashless  means greater convenience.  A cashless  society\r\n\r\nis, therefore, an ideal worth pursuing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to gain consumer acceptance, security concerns\r\n\r\nof  the type that Mr Steve Chia talked about have  to  be\r\n\r\nrobustly  addressed.  People will be  willing  to  use  a\r\n\r\ncashcard  only if they can be assured that they will  not\r\n\r\nget unduly short-changed or have their money zapped away.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why the usage and security of cashcards,  or  a\r\n\r\nmore correct\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical term, stored value cards, are governed  by  the\r\n\r\nBanking  Act.   Only banks are allowed  to  issue  multi-purpose stored value cards.  And MAS imposes very  strict\r\n\r\nrules and regulations on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have taken these concerns seriously,\r\n\r\ncashcards  have  become widely accepted by  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now  very much part of our life and we  literally\r\n\r\ncannot  leave home without it.  There are now 10  million\r\n\r\ncashcard  transactions per month in Singapore - quite  an\r\n\r\nachievement!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my Ministry, a key usage is for electronic road\r\n\r\npricing  (ERP) payments.  How do we ensure  security,  in\r\n\r\nour  case,  for  ERP  transactions?  The  ERP  system  is\r\n\r\naudited  regularly, both by the internal audit department\r\n\r\nof  the  LTA  as  well  as  its  external  auditor.   The\r\n\r\nprocesses and transactions are all subject to audit.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the charge tables are meticulously checked  both\r\n\r\nbefore and after they are downloaded into the system.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the live transaction data are also checked  as\r\n\r\nthey come into the system to confirm that the ERP charges\r\n\r\ndeducted are correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia observed that increasingly car parks\r\n\r\nare  adopting the ERP technology, much to the convenience\r\n\r\nof   motorists.   For  example,  I  have  been  attending\r\n\r\nperformances in the Esplanade, it is such a breeze - just\r\n\r\ndrive through.  But Mr Chia can be rest assured that  the\r\n\r\nsystem  is secure.  He just has to remember to  insert  a\r\n\r\nvalid  cashcard into his in-vehicle unit.  In  fact,  you\r\n\r\ncan  check  it yourself quite easily, if you are  worried\r\n\r\nabout  the  system being faulty, or whatever.  Just  take\r\n\r\nout  your cashcard, check what is your cash balance,  and\r\n\r\nwhen   you  go  through  the  toll  gate,  do  it  again.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I do that, just to be sure, and it  works  all\r\n\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he made a new point and asked: are there gadgets\r\n\r\nthat  you  can  carry and go to the car  park  and  start\r\n\r\nzapping away the money?  You can try.  But I do not think\r\n\r\nit will work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me reply to the cut by Mr Wee Siew Kim on\r\n\r\nalternative public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  agree with him that we should always be on the lookout\r\n\r\nfor  cheaper,  less costly, alternative modes  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport.  We are not fixated on MRT or buses.  But  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains  that,  based  on  current  technology,   a\r\n\r\njudicious mix of MRT and buses still serves our interests\r\n\r\nbest.   But  we are not alone in this game.  Every  other\r\n\r\ncity has to grapple with this problem.  So, we have other\r\n\r\ncities'  experience to study and to learn from.   But  we\r\n\r\nwill continue to monitor what is happening elsewhere, and\r\n\r\nsee if there are better solutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the cuts by Dr Jennifer Lee and\r\n\r\nProf.  Ngiam.   Dr  Jennifer  Lee  asked  if  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport system is friendly to the elderly.  Let me make\r\n\r\nit quite clear.  The top priority of our public transport\r\n\r\nsystem is to cater to the needs of the masses.  It cannot\r\n\r\nbe  helped,  because  large  numbers  have  to  be  moved\r\n\r\nspeedily   from  point  A  to  point  B,  and   that   is\r\n\r\nfundamental.  If we cannot meet that objective, we  would\r\n\r\nhave  failed.  Nevertheless, our public transport  system\r\n\r\ndoes  try  to  accommodate the needs of the elderly,  the\r\n\r\nfeeble  and  the  disabled, for as long as  it  does  not\r\n\r\nseverely compromise the needs of the masses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee talked about buses - when will we get all our\r\n\r\nbuses   elderly-friendly?   I  think  we  are  doing   it\r\n\r\nsystematically and progressively.  When buses  are  being\r\n\r\nreplaced,  they  are required to become elderly-friendly.\r\n\r\nI  think  this is a practical way going forward,  because\r\n\r\nthe other alternative, which is, big bang, overnight, ask\r\n\r\nthe  few thousand buses to be replaced, that will be high\r\n\r\ncost.   Somebody has got to bear that cost.   I  remember\r\n\r\nvividly  our  three-cent debate not too many months  ago,\r\n\r\nand this will cost more than three cents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what is the progress to-date. I checked.\r\n\r\nI  think,  right now, about one-third of SBS Transit  and\r\n\r\nTIBS fleet of buses are elderly-friendly with low floors.\r\n\r\nYes,  she talked about bus drivers, that they have to  be\r\n\r\nmore  careful when they have the elderly and the disabled\r\n\r\non   board   and   should  not  do   sudden   brakes   or\r\n\r\naccelerations.   I checked.  Yes, this  is  part  of  the\r\n\r\ntraining for bus drivers.  Actually\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  is common sense, but sometimes, common sense  needs\r\n\r\nto be reiterated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for MRT, the same thing. We are progressively\r\n\r\nupgrading our stations.  To-date, we have completed  five\r\n\r\nstations,  one  of  which  is  Novena,  which  is  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, coincidentally.  But the other 40  will  be\r\n\r\nprogressively completed by 2005.\r\n\r\n<br>12.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi is a very important mode of transport for the\r\n\r\nwheel-chair  bound.  I totally agree with her.   Some  of\r\n\r\nour taxi operators have begun to be doing that.  In fact,\r\n\r\nyesterday,  while driving here from MITA, at the  traffic\r\n\r\nlight junction, I saw one of the Comfort taxis with  that\r\n\r\nHandicare  Cab  Service logo, a very  kind  looking  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  and very proud of this logo.  They are  providing\r\n\r\nvery  good  service  for  those who  require  handicapped\r\n\r\nfriendly taxis.  But we will continue our efforts to work\r\n\r\nwith  the  various operators to see how we can  make  the\r\n\r\ntransport system to be even more friendly to the  elderly\r\n\r\nand the disabled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her that this is a project not MOT\r\n\r\nalone  can deliver.  And I thought I made that point  too\r\n\r\nsome  months ago when a similar question was raised here,\r\n\r\nie,  to  ensure that it is seamless travel  all  the  way\r\n\r\nrequires contribution from everybody - MND, MOT - but  we\r\n\r\nwill do our part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam joined in the debate and talked about\r\n\r\nfare concessions.  And I thought we discussed that too  a\r\n\r\nfew  months  ago.   Fare concessions  scheme  for  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  is  operated  by  the  operators;  we  are  not\r\n\r\ninvolved.   As rightly pointed out, once we get involved,\r\n\r\nwe   have  to  do  it  nation-wide  and  cross-subsidise.\r\n\r\nSomebody  has  got  to  fund  the  subsidy.   For  us  to\r\n\r\nintervene  to  say  that  the operators  must  have  fare\r\n\r\nconcessions  and do it 24 hours, seven  days  a  week,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the load would then have to be shouldered  by  all\r\n\r\nthe  commuters.  Whether that is fair, I think that there\r\n\r\nwill be people who feel otherwise.  But what we can do is\r\n\r\nthat we will encourage the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperators, as I think the Members do, and all  the  other\r\n\r\ncivic organisations as well.  And I think the level  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  reached today is a reasonable one.   Off-peak\r\n\r\ntraffic  is less any way and, as we all know,  seats  are\r\n\r\nperishables.   So the cost of subsidy is very  much  less\r\n\r\nduring  off-peaks.   But to turn it into  a  peak  period\r\n\r\nconcession,  that  is  a completely different  kettle  of\r\n\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam's concern is: are we, because of not\r\n\r\nproviding concessions during peak hours for the  elderly,\r\n\r\nmaking it difficult for the elderly to get a job?   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  so.   I  think the barriers  to  the  elderly\r\n\r\ngetting  a  job  are many.  I do not think  concessionary\r\n\r\nfare  is  the  make or break barrier to their  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about bicycle lanes, raised so\r\n\r\npassionately  by Mr Ong and Ms Irene Ng.   Like  both  of\r\n\r\nthem,  I enjoy cycling too.  But we are practical people,\r\n\r\nI  am  engineer-trained.  When we manage  mass  transport\r\n\r\npolicies  to move large number of commuters in  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient way, we have to give priority, not to bicycles,\r\n\r\nbut  to MRT and buses.  LTA is involved in road reserves.\r\n\r\nWe  do not take charge of the whole Singapore island.  We\r\n\r\nonly  take charge of about 12% of Singapore island, which\r\n\r\nis called road reserves, and those are our assets.  So we\r\n\r\nhave  to  manage  this 12% very carefully.   If  12%  can\r\n\r\nbecome  40%, then, yes, we have many more road  space  to\r\n\r\ngive to some other users.  But when we are constrained by\r\n\r\nthis  12%,  we have to be careful.  Yes, in cities,  like\r\n\r\nBeijing,  Hanoi, you will see on TV thousands of cyclists\r\n\r\nand,  because  of  that, they set aside  special  bicycle\r\n\r\nlanes.   That is because they are at a stage of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  where,  for the masses,  bicycles,  in  most\r\n\r\ncases,  are  still the most affordable.  I do  not  think\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  in that situation.  We have  already  gone\r\n\r\npast that stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Beijing, which I visit quite\r\n\r\nfrequently, as the middle class expands and the  standard\r\n\r\nof  living goes up, they are now rapidly putting in MRTs,\r\n\r\nupgrading their buses and expanding their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroads.   It  is a matter of time when they will  also  be\r\n\r\ntaking  away  the  bicycle lanes.   So  this  progressive\r\n\r\nswitch  from  bicycles to buses and MRTs for the  masses,\r\n\r\nyou  can  see  it  all  over the  world  and  is  closely\r\n\r\ncorrelated with GDP growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not discourage people from commuting by\r\n\r\ncycling.   In fact, just this morning, when I  came  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Transport in Alexandra Road to here, not\r\n\r\na  long distance - because I remember this cut - I was on\r\n\r\nthe look-out for cyclists, and there were half a dozen of\r\n\r\nthem, some young, some old, and they were cycling on  the\r\n\r\nroads,  not  on the pavements, in a very common  sensical\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my message to cyclists is to continue to cycle.\r\n\r\nOur  roads are safe relatively, but please exercise  some\r\n\r\ncommon  sense.  Because if you are careful, look out  for\r\n\r\ntraffic,  do  not cycle in Orchard Road, but  most  other\r\n\r\nroads,  I  think it is all right.  If you do not exercise\r\n\r\ncommon  sense,  sometimes  you  get  into  trouble.    My\r\n\r\ndaughter  was cycling in the park the other day  and  she\r\n\r\nalso had an accident.  So I asked, \"What happened?\"   She\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"A friend called her on her mobile.\"  She  had  to\r\n\r\nanswer.   Of course, please have some common  sense.   My\r\n\r\nmessage  to motorcyclists is the same too:  Live and  let\r\n\r\nlive.   This  is a lane that we all have to  share.   And\r\n\r\nwhenever  you see a cyclist or motorcyclist in  front  of\r\n\r\nyou, just slow down.  Better be slow than sorry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered all the cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can I seek your\r\n\r\npermission for two clarifications?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The Minister has not\r\n\r\nanswered my questions.

We  will  try  to  tackle  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant   barrier  first.   Yes,  there  are  countless\r\n\r\nbarriers  to  employment.  Right now, there  is  economic\r\n\r\nrecession, jobs are down anyway, and so on and so  forth.\r\n\r\nSo  there  are  many, many problems, especially  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly getting a job.  I do not think fare concession is\r\n\r\nsuch a big barrier that we have to put in our efforts  to\r\n\r\nsolve  it  and, with that, you can solve the unemployment\r\n\r\nfor the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, we have been told that PSA\r\n\r\nhas   done   it  again.   It  increased  its  twenty-foot\r\n\r\nequivalent units (TEUs) by, I think, about 7% or 9%  last\r\n\r\nyear, amidst all the hullabaloo about losing its top  two\r\n\r\ncustomers.  We also read that PSA has been giving  severe\r\n\r\ndiscounts to its customers and extra service during  this\r\n\r\nperiod under review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this show? It shows that sensitivity\r\n\r\nto  customers  is very important in attracting  customers\r\n\r\nand  sales  revenue.   If  we had  been  more  responsive\r\n\r\nearlier, perhaps we would not have lost the top\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  customers  which account for at  least  20%  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness and so much of the downstream businesses in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  How does the Minister ensure that the  port  is\r\n\r\nresponsive to industry-wide and global changes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about IT, or network, or good\r\n\r\nmanagement, etc.  Big time shipping companies and private\r\n\r\nport  operators or terminal operators with sales  revenue\r\n\r\nbigger  than  PSA  earned possibly in  a  more  difficult\r\n\r\nenvironment  also have good IT systems, good network  and\r\n\r\ngood  management.  We are talking about listening to  the\r\n\r\nvoice  of  the  customers and repositioning ourselves  to\r\n\r\nanchor  and  serve  our  customers  to  collaborate  with\r\n\r\npartners   in   new  ventures  under  changing   industry\r\n\r\nenvironment.   The  shipping  industry  and  the   global\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  are  moving towards  network  connections,\r\n\r\njust-in-time  logistics to maximise  efficiency.   Supply\r\n\r\nchain efficiency and just-in-time logistics can power the\r\n\r\nport customers, shipping lines, the terminal operators to\r\n\r\nbe  partners.  And private port operators can also manage\r\n\r\na  network of ports and this can drive shipping lines  to\r\n\r\nadjust routes and schedules for mutual gains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even IBM or Microsoft can control the forces\r\n\r\nwhich  drive  industry-wide changes.  It is industry-wide\r\n\r\nchanges  which drive dinosaurs out of business when  they\r\n\r\nreact  too  slow.  IBM lost the key business  because  it\r\n\r\nthought  the contractor Microsoft was offering  something\r\n\r\nthat would not be a challenge to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port management is also changing.

Are  we\r\n\r\ncollaborating   with   industry  players   and   building\r\n\r\nalliances  to avoid being muscled in, as the episodes  in\r\n\r\nthe last two years showed?

However,  out\r\n\r\nof  this  29%, only 4% was derived locally while 25%  was\r\n\r\nfrom  its operations at other ports, eg, those in  China.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is the trend, then the throughput of containers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore will be moved overseas.  Would we then lose\r\n\r\nour  ranking  as the second busiest port  in  the  world?\r\n\r\nWould  this also result in a second round of retrenchment\r\n\r\nin PSA?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, recently, the Malaysian government\r\n\r\nannounced  that it was going to remove the  causeway  and\r\n\r\nreplace it with a funny-looking bridge so that ships  can\r\n\r\npass through the Johor Straits.

Needless  to  say,  many\r\n\r\nenterprises  in  Singapore  continue  to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ncontinued  growth of these hubs for continued  existence.\r\n\r\nHence,  the  success  of the hubs  cannot  be  singularly\r\n\r\njudged  within  the boundary fence of the  port,  or  the\r\n\r\nconfines of the airport.

I was also told that Star  Cruise,\r\n\r\nwhich  used to call twice weekly at the Singapore  Cruise\r\n\r\nCentre,  has now reduced the number of calls and  is  now\r\n\r\nusing  Changi  Ferry Terminal, which  is  operated  by  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  company,  to  bring passengers  to  board  its\r\n\r\ncruise  ships  anchored at Tanjung Langsat  in  Malaysian\r\n\r\nwaters.   It seems that by doing this, it is much cheaper\r\n\r\nfor  the cruise operator than berthing its ships  at  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Cruise Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we priced ourselves out of this market?

This loss\r\n\r\nof  the cruise business has severe implications for other\r\n\r\ntourism-related  industries.  I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  there are any  plans  to  regain  this\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me take the cuts one by\r\n\r\none.   I will start off with the points made by Mr  Chay.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, Mr Wee Siew Kim also made similar points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked how do we ensure that PSA remains\r\n\r\nresponsive to its customers, and he asked how do we  make\r\n\r\nsure that we have a global network of ports that fits  in\r\n\r\nwith  the trend of shipping lines going more into  supply\r\n\r\nchain  management, and how do we make sure that we remain\r\n\r\na world-class player.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how we make sure that the port is responsive to\r\n\r\ncustomers  is  something  which  PSA  alone  has  to   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for, because PSA is a corporatised  body,  it\r\n\r\nhas  its  own  Board of Directors and its own management.\r\n\r\nIt has to set its own strategies and address the business\r\n\r\nchallenges as it sees fit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the loss of the two shipping lines in\r\n\r\nthe  last two years, I think PSA has changed its mindset.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been a change in management and a significant\r\n\r\nchange  in  mindset.  As such, PSA has been reaching  out\r\n\r\nvery actively, especially over the last six months or so,\r\n\r\nto  its key clientele, to see how best it can meet  their\r\n\r\nneeds.   I  understand that the discussions  include  the\r\n\r\npossibility of dedicated terminals operated jointly  with\r\n\r\nits  key  clientele.  So, PSA has been making  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nefforts and we are seeing the results.  For example,  PSA\r\n\r\nwas actively engaged in negotiations with Hanjin Shipping\r\n\r\nLine  of  Korea.   This was reported in the  press.   And\r\n\r\ndespite  a lot of competition from other ports,  PSA  has\r\n\r\nmanaged  to enter into a long-term agreement with Hanjin.\r\n\r\nAgain, this shows that PSA has managed to be flexible and\r\n\r\nto remain highly competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the network of ports, this is also what\r\n\r\nPSA has been doing over the last six or seven years.   As\r\n\r\na  result, PSA today has an overseas network of 14  ports\r\n\r\nin eight countries, and I understand that PSA is actively\r\n\r\nstriving to further enlarge this network of ports.   What\r\n\r\nis  crucial is that it intends to build a global  network\r\n\r\nof  ports  that are strategically located along  the  key\r\n\r\ninternational shipping routes.  In this way, it can offer\r\n\r\nbasically a world-wide service to their partners, who are\r\n\r\nsailing worldwide.  It will also allow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPSA  to  link  all  the  ports  electronically  onto  one\r\n\r\nplatform.   If  it can do that, this will  save  its  key\r\n\r\nshipping  clients the cumbersome administrative paperwork\r\n\r\nand  allow  those companies to focus more  on  their  key\r\n\r\nbusiness  requirements,  ie,  managing  their  ships  and\r\n\r\nsupply chain management services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think PSA is indeed rapidly restructuring and\r\n\r\ntransforming itself, and I am quite hopeful that it  will\r\n\r\nbe able to retain its position as a global player.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad said that the port must be able to\r\n\r\nrise  to  the  occasion and must be  able  to  craft  its\r\n\r\nresponses to meet the competition effectively.  He  asked\r\n\r\nthat  we  position  ourselves to take  advantage  of  our\r\n\r\nposition as a hub, in terms of both air and sea hubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is exactly what we are doing. We are now\r\n\r\nexploiting the synergies that can be developed  from  the\r\n\r\nmulti-modal transport arrangements.  For example,  today,\r\n\r\ncargo can be shipped from the region to either PSA or  to\r\n\r\nSeletar and, from there, because we have a very good road\r\n\r\nnetwork, they can be trucked very quickly to the airport.\r\n\r\nAgain,  because of the tremendous connectivity at  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport,  these  cargoes  can  leave  very  quickly   for\r\n\r\ninternational  destinations.  So, today, we  see  flowers\r\n\r\nand,  in fact, even tropical fish coming from the  region\r\n\r\nbeing  exported  through Singapore.  We are  now  working\r\n\r\nclosely  with EDB and CAAS on how we can further  develop\r\n\r\nthese multi-modal shipping arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that we are looking at also is our\r\n\r\ncruise  hub.  As Mr Ahmad Magad knows, we have  a  cruise\r\n\r\ncentre  which  is  quite active.  In  recent  years,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Cruise Centre has also benefited from the  fact\r\n\r\nthat we are an aviation hub.  So, now we see more of  the\r\n\r\ncruise  lines running fly-cruise packages.  They  fly  in\r\n\r\npassengers to Changi who stay maybe one or two days here,\r\n\r\nand  then  they  leave  through  the  port  for  regional\r\n\r\ncruises.  So this is another exciting idea which  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking  at, which is really a multi-modal transportation\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ahmad Magad also mentioned that he would\r\n\r\nlike  us to review our customs procedures so that we  can\r\n\r\nbetter benefit from the FTAs that we are signing.  Indeed\r\n\r\nwe are doing so.  We are working closely with Customs and\r\n\r\nthe   relevant  agencies  to  ensure  that  our   customs\r\n\r\nprocedures  and our IT systems allow for the  smooth  and\r\n\r\nconvenient  movement of goods between Singapore  and  our\r\n\r\nrespective FTA partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng expressed concerns that PSA's\r\n\r\ngrowth appears to be more focused on their overseas ports\r\n\r\nand, if that is the case, whether we will run the risk of\r\n\r\nlosing  our position as the No. 2 container port  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  whether this would in turn lead to  a  fresh\r\n\r\nround of retrenchments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr Ang probably did not interpret the\r\n\r\nfigures  very  clearly.   Yes, PSA  has  grown,  both  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and globally.  Yes, the global growth has  been\r\n\r\nhigher  in terms of percentage.  But that is because  the\r\n\r\nglobal  throughput of containers is starting from a  very\r\n\r\nlow  base.  So, from a very low base, it is very easy  to\r\n\r\ngrow  by a high percentage.  For example, Guangzhou  port\r\n\r\ngrew by 40% last year, and that is because it started  as\r\n\r\na  very  small  port.  But in terms of  actual  container\r\n\r\ngrowth,  it  is  really  not very big,  compared  to  the\r\n\r\ncontainer growth in PSA Port.  PSA Port last year grew by\r\n\r\n8.8% to 17 million TEUs, ie, there was a growth of over a\r\n\r\nmillion  TEUs in Singapore alone.  As I explained  to  Mr\r\n\r\nChay,  PSA has been more innovative and flexible in their\r\n\r\napproach to customer service.  I am quite confident  that\r\n\r\nPSA  in  Singapore will be able to hold its own and,  not\r\n\r\nonly that, continue to grow.  And if they can do that,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think we need to fear that there will be another\r\n\r\nround of retrenchments.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang asked about the bridge that has been\r\n\r\nannounced  to replace the Causeway.  He asked  about  the\r\n\r\nimpact.  Sir, the bridge will allow only small barges  to\r\n\r\nconnect Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelapas.  This is because\r\n\r\nof  the clearance required and the bridge will only be 25\r\n\r\nmetres\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh.  So  only small barges can sail under  the  bridge.\r\n\r\nEven  then, it would take the barges slightly  longer  to\r\n\r\nsail from Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelapas as compared  to\r\n\r\nsailing from Pasir Gudang to PSA.  I think the impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  bridge on PSA is therefore not expected  to  be\r\n\r\nserious at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad talked about leveraging on our port\r\n\r\nexpertise.  He asked that we consider marketing our  port\r\n\r\nexpertise abroad, especially to China and India,  and  he\r\n\r\nasked for MPA to collaborate with other countries because\r\n\r\nMPA  also  has  significant expertise.  Sir,  I  want  to\r\n\r\nassure  Mr  Magad that that is exactly what PSA  and  MPA\r\n\r\nhave  been doing.  PSA has been actively expanding, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned just now, they are now in eight countries\r\n\r\nwith 14 port projects.  In fact, China is one of the  key\r\n\r\nfocal  points  of PSA's efforts.  In China now,  PSA  has\r\n\r\nfour  ports  in  Dalian, Fuzhou  and  Guangzhou.   And  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that PSA is actively looking  for  more  port\r\n\r\nlocations in China.  In India too, PSA has two ports and,\r\n\r\nagain, it is actively looking to collaborate on more port\r\n\r\nprojects in India.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA too has been active internationally. It\r\n\r\nprovides training assistance to other port authorities in\r\n\r\nport    management,   oil   spill   response   and    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of  IMO conventions.  This  last  part  is\r\n\r\nquite   extensive  because  there  are  a  lot   of   IMO\r\n\r\nconventions  and they are amended from time to  time.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  lot of updating and training required.   We\r\n\r\nplay  a big part in providing this training, not just  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  but  also  to  trainees  from  the  region,\r\n\r\nincluding from Africa as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim asked about the multiplier impact of\r\n\r\nour air and sea hubs.  He asked us whether we measure the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  our  air  and  sea  hubs  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\ndownstream multiplier impact, ie, do not focus  too  much\r\n\r\non  the  profits of just PSA and the airport but look  in\r\n\r\nterms of how we grow the air and sea sectors, so that the\r\n\r\nmultiplier  impact  on the economy can  be  achieved.   I\r\n\r\nthink he is probably referring to the many SMEs that  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in these two sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mr Wee that indeed the multiplier\r\n\r\nimpact is very important, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is  why we do focus a fair bit on our air  and  sea\r\n\r\nhubs.   The air and sea sectors alone contribute to  5.6%\r\n\r\nof  our whole economy. So the benefit is not just to  PSA\r\n\r\nand  CAAS but, really, there is a huge impact on the rest\r\n\r\nof  the  economy.   If you look in terms  of  the  entire\r\n\r\ntransport  sector,  which  includes  the  land,   storage\r\n\r\nfacilities,  etc,  it contributes  to  9%  of  our  total\r\n\r\neconomy.  This is one of the key pillars of our  economy.\r\n\r\nBeing  a  key local activity, SMEs do benefit a fair  bit\r\n\r\nfrom these two sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are definitely committed to growing the two\r\n\r\nhubs  and  not just looking at making sure that  PSA  and\r\n\r\nCAAS  are able to generate reserves and surpluses.   That\r\n\r\nmeans  we  are looking at how we increase the volumes  of\r\n\r\nbusiness at both the PSA and the airport.  On the port, I\r\n\r\nhave  already spoken quite a fair bit in reply to Mr Chay\r\n\r\nand Mr Ang on what PSA is doing.  On the airport, I think\r\n\r\nit  is important for me to point out one factor and, that\r\n\r\nis,  Singapore is actually not a natural air hub.  We are\r\n\r\nnot  geographically located in the right  place  and  our\r\n\r\ndomestic market is really too small for us to be  an  air\r\n\r\nhub.   But we have become an air hub. This is because  of\r\n\r\nthe  tremendous efforts that we have put in in the  past,\r\n\r\nin   terms  of  growing  the  infrastructure  and  making\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a business hub which then contributes  to\r\n\r\nthe development of the air hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But new technology and equipment will pose\r\n\r\nsignificant challenges to us in the growing  of  the  air\r\n\r\nhub.  For  example, the new long range planes will  allow\r\n\r\nflights  between  Europe  and  Australia  to  take  place\r\n\r\nwithout the need for an intermediate stop. At the moment,\r\n\r\nwe  are  a  very convenient intermediate stop.  With  the\r\n\r\nlong  range planes, they can actually over-fly Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  how  do  we respond to this challenge?  I  think  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  we have to be really nimble, alert  and  make\r\n\r\nsure  that we continue to offer value-added services that\r\n\r\nmake  it  worth their while for the airlines to  stop  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  for visitors who still want  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially businessmen visitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we are doing to develop the air\r\n\r\nhub  is the development of the Airport Logistics Park  at\r\n\r\nChangi,  or  ALPS.  This  is  located  strategically   in\r\n\r\nChangi's  free trade zone and ALPS will then be  able  to\r\n\r\nleverage  on the excellent connectivity and the  superior\r\n\r\nhandling  efficiency  of  Changi Airport.  The  logistics\r\n\r\ncompanies  can enjoy very rapid turnaround  with  minimal\r\n\r\ncustoms formalities.  The opening of ALPS will definitely\r\n\r\nhelp  strengthen our position as a leading air  logistics\r\n\r\nhub,  and  we will definitely look into working with  the\r\n\r\nother agencies to see how we can further develop our  air\r\n\r\nand sea hubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min spoke about the cruise centre. He\r\n\r\nstated  that  Star  Cruise has reduced  its  callings  at\r\n\r\nSingapore and is instead ferrying passengers from  Changi\r\n\r\nFerry Terminal to Tanjung Langsat.  He asked whether this\r\n\r\nis another example of how we have priced ourselves out of\r\n\r\nthe cruise market and asked how do we plan to regain this\r\n\r\nmarket.   Sir,  the real picture is quite different  from\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr Ong had painted.  First, let me assure the House\r\n\r\nthat  Star  Cruises is still operating from the Singapore\r\n\r\nCruise Centre.  It currently has three cruise ships  that\r\n\r\ncall  regularly  at our port - the Superstar  Virgo,  the\r\n\r\nMegastar Aries and the Megastar Taurus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be useful for me to explain to Mr Ong some\r\n\r\nof  the developments in our cruise industry.  In 2002, we\r\n\r\nhad 740 calls by cruise ships. This was a significant 40%\r\n\r\ndrop  compared to the year before.  So, in a way,  he  is\r\n\r\nright  that  there  has  been a  decline  in  the  cruise\r\n\r\nindustry.  Was this due to competition from Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nhigh PSA charges?  I think the answer is an emphatic  no.\r\n\r\nThe  drop  was  due  to  two  factors.   First,  we  must\r\n\r\nunderstand that the cruise industry is a leisure industry\r\n\r\nand the leisure industry is very, very much dependent  on\r\n\r\nhow strong economic growth is.  And the fact that we have\r\n\r\nvery  weak  local and regional economies means  that  the\r\n\r\nclientele  for  the  cruise industry has  declined,  both\r\n\r\nlocal  as well as foreign clientele.  Secondly,  we  also\r\n\r\nhad  the  heightened security concerns  amongst  holiday-makers after 911.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  these two factors together resulted in the number  of\r\n\r\ncruise  ship  calls  dropping  by  40%.   In  fact,   the\r\n\r\nreduction in the calls by Star Cruises was only  30%.  So\r\n\r\nthe  other cruise lines suffered a bigger drop,  compared\r\n\r\nto Star Cruises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the entire cruise industry worldwide is also\r\n\r\nexperiencing a slowdown.  According to the UK independent\r\n\r\nresearch  company, Ocean Shipping Consultant, the  global\r\n\r\ncruise  industry is expected to see continued weak market\r\n\r\nconditions over the short to medium term.  It is expected\r\n\r\nonly  to  start  recovering in the second  half  of  this\r\n\r\ndecade.  So, basically, we are all in the same boat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong suggested that perhaps the high berthing\r\n\r\ncharges could be a possible factor. Again, let me  assure\r\n\r\nhim  that this is not so.  Our berthing rates for  cruise\r\n\r\nships  have remained unchanged.  Since 1991, we have  not\r\n\r\nchanged  the rates at all. This is because we  know  that\r\n\r\nthe  cruise business is very sensitive to cost,  and,  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  MPA  regularly  reviews the  berthing  charges  to\r\n\r\nensure that we remain competitive.  The ship that Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nreferred  to  is actually the Superstar  Aries.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  that this ship is normally home-based in  Taiwan\r\n\r\nbut  because this is the off-season in Taiwan, the owners\r\n\r\nhave  brought it back to this region.  They have  brought\r\n\r\nit  back  for  only three months from January  to  March.\r\n\r\nThey  have  parked  it  at Tanjung  Langsat.   But  while\r\n\r\nparking  there,  the ship still makes  destination  calls\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore. So it comes to Singapore and from  here,\r\n\r\nit   goes  on  cruises  to  Malaysia,  Phuket  and  other\r\n\r\ndestinations.   It did 12 cruises from Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\npast  two  months  and  for March, they  will  have  four\r\n\r\ncruises.  So it is not that they are not using Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  just  that this is a surplus ship, so  they  have\r\n\r\nparked it in Tanjung Langsat presumably because it  is  a\r\n\r\nlot cheaper to just park it there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay, are you withdrawing the\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> I thank the Minister and his\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State for their answers, and beg leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2).

Perhaps,  these  six\r\n\r\npoints  may be for a period of just six months.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  taxi  drivers  will not be penalised  unduly,  just\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  non-cooperation  of  some  unreasonable\r\n\r\npassengers.  Also, the time spent by a taxi driver on the\r\n\r\nroad  is  many  times  more as compared  to  the  others,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  should  consider  allowing  them  these  six\r\n\r\npoints, especially in these difficult times, as many taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers are also sole breadwinners of their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister actually has already replied to my cut\r\n\r\non  the taxi disciplinary board and thus I would like  to\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nalthough  we  understand that the purchase  and  sale  of\r\n\r\ncars,  whether passenger cars or commercial cars,   is  a\r\n\r\ntransaction between the buyers and sellers, I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  proper regulation for  this  trade  to\r\n\r\nensure there is transparency in the transaction so as  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  consumers, because every purchase  involves\r\n\r\ntens  of  thousands of dollars, and these are hard-earned\r\n\r\nmoney  of  our  citizens.

For example,\r\n\r\nsome  purchasers have complained that there were inherent\r\n\r\nproblems  with  the car the moment it  came  out  of  the\r\n\r\nshowroom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also quite a lot of complaints concerning\r\n\r\nthe   car  financing  plans.  Many  dealers  told   their\r\n\r\ncustomers  that  they  would have  no  problem  obtaining\r\n\r\nfinancing  from  the  finance  company,  and  coaxed  the\r\n\r\ncustomer   to   pay   a   deposit   for   the   purchase.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, they found that the finance company  turned\r\n\r\ndown  their  loan  application for some reason,  and  the\r\n\r\ndeposit was then forfeited.  I suspect some dealers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  using  this trick to cheat the customers  of  their\r\n\r\ndeposit  which  could amount to a few  thousand  dollars.\r\n\r\nThere   should   be  more  transparency  in   all   these\r\n\r\ntransactions to protect the interest of the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Dr Chong suggested that taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  be subject to a higher demerit points  cap  than\r\n\r\nother  motorists.  As he correctly pointed  out,  demerit\r\n\r\npoints are managed by the Traffic Police under the Driver\r\n\r\nImprovement Points System (DIPS).  The purpose  of  DIPS,\r\n\r\nas  we  know,  is  to  promote safe driving  and  to  get\r\n\r\ndangerous  drivers  off  our road.   Demerit  points  are\r\n\r\nlevied  on all motorists who commit offences, eg, beating\r\n\r\nthe  red  light at junctions.  Increasing the cap,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid,  would send the wrong signal.  Yes, I agree  that\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  are  heavy road users, but  they  shoulder\r\n\r\nheavier  responsibility too, as they have the passengers'\r\n\r\nsafety  in their hands.  We should, therefore,  expect  a\r\n\r\nhigh,  not  lower, standard of safety from taxi  drivers.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the law must be applied equally on  all\r\n\r\nmotorists.   To differentiate them for penalty  would  be\r\n\r\ninvidious and unconscionable.  But I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake Dr Chong's point that there could be occasions,  eg,\r\n\r\nhe   quoted  the  example  of  non-cooperation   by   the\r\n\r\npassengers, which may lead to a penalty being imposed  on\r\n\r\nthe  taxi driver.  In those circumstances, they  need  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  it - in this case, by the Traffic  Police,  I\r\n\r\npresume  - before they decide whether demerit points  are\r\n\r\nto be imposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's cut, he would like us to\r\n\r\nconsider regulating the motor dealers to cut out,  as  he\r\n\r\nput  it, \"unfair trading practices\", so as to protect car\r\n\r\nbuyers.   Although  he talked about  motor  dealers,  his\r\n\r\ncomment   could   have  applied  to  any  other   trading\r\n\r\nactivities.  But regulating trading is really a very  big\r\n\r\nstep to take.  If we make more rules to regulate trading,\r\n\r\nwe  will  increase business costs, which would eventually\r\n\r\nbe  passed on to consumers and that is why the Government\r\n\r\nhas  always  resisted taking such a big  step.   But,  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  feedback from CASE and several  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House, MTI has been working with CASE on a consumer\r\n\r\nprotection Fair Trading Act.  I understand that under the\r\n\r\nproposed  Act,  consumers  will  have  some  recourse  if\r\n\r\nsellers,  and that would include car dealers,  engage  in\r\n\r\nunfair  trade  practices.   However, as the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  is  to  protect small consumers  who  lack  the\r\n\r\nresources  or expertise to protect themselves,  there  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be a cap on the amount that the consumer  can\r\n\r\nclaim.   But I agree with Mr Yeo that the industry should\r\n\r\npromote greater transparency and self-regulate to cut out\r\n\r\nunfair practices.  They should try to avoid the situation\r\n\r\nwhereby  the Government is forced to step in to  regulate\r\n\r\ntightly.   The best way to prevent this is  for  them  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a high standard of practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has been working with the Motor Traders\r\n\r\nAssociation  and the Automobile Association of  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  promote  transparency in the buying  and  selling  of\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicles.

Events and\r\n\r\ncircumstances are shifting and changing fast.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nissue  I would like to raise with the Minister for  Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry  is what should be Singapore's  fundamental\r\n\r\neconomic policies in the light of a changing world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was barely 10 years ago that Japan was considered\r\n\r\nthe world's No. 1.  That book of the same name by Harvard\r\n\r\nprofessor, Israel F Vogel, published in 1980, was  a  top\r\n\r\nseller   then.    Japanese  companies  were   buying   up\r\n\r\neverything  in sight, including top US golf  courses  and\r\n\r\nthe   Rockerfeller  Centre.   Today,   Japan   has   been\r\n\r\nlanguishing  for over 10 years, laden with a mountain  of\r\n\r\ndomestic debts and a sickly economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home, and a more comparable example, is Hong\r\n\r\nKong.  They are now in deep trouble, it seems.  Hong Kong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecently  announced  that they would  incur  deficits  of\r\n\r\nHK$70  billion.   The official reserves  will  drop  from\r\n\r\nHK$303  billion  to HK$185 billion, or  about  only  S$41\r\n\r\nbillion, by year 2005/2006.  Analysts have even predicted\r\n\r\nthat Hong Kong would die.  Hong Kong has touted itself as\r\n\r\nthe  gateway  to  China.  This strategy backfired.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong  becomes  increasingly  marginalised  as  MNCs  seek\r\n\r\ndirect entry into China with huge FDIs.  Hong Kong  faces\r\n\r\nhollowing  out  of  its manufacturing industries  to  the\r\n\r\ncheaper  Chinese cities nearby, such as Shenzhen,  Zhuhai\r\n\r\nand Guangzhou.  Their services sector faces the threat of\r\n\r\nShanghai, which is fast eroding Hong Kong's position as a\r\n\r\nmajor financial centre.  Shenzhen has a population  of  7\r\n\r\nmillion  people and Shanghai has a population of over  14\r\n\r\nmillion people, and still growing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how about Singapore? We are a small city with\r\n\r\nonly  4  million people.  Our domestic market  is  small.\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   becoming   an   increasingly   high-cost\r\n\r\nmanufacturing centre.  We are lacking in sufficient  pool\r\n\r\nof   people   with   gung-ho  and  enterprising   spirit.\r\n\r\nGovernment is too dominant in the business sector.  Faced-off  against  the growing mega-cities like Shanghai,  how\r\n\r\ncan we handle such threats?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and India are two potential growth areas. Are\r\n\r\nwe  doing  enough to plug into these two countries?   How\r\n\r\nmuch  have we done to establish closer trading ties  with\r\n\r\nthese countries?  The Government has identified the  need\r\n\r\nto focus on nurturing the twin engines of growth, namely,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services sectors.  I wish to remind the\r\n\r\nMinister  not  to neglect other sectors as  well.   Every\r\n\r\namount  of  contribution helps, eg, the  smaller  sectors\r\n\r\nlike  tourism, retail and logistics are also good sectors\r\n\r\nto earn foreign income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very fearful that a super-Asian nation\r\n\r\nlike  Japan and a dynamic and vibrant Asian economy  like\r\n\r\nHong  Kong have seen their fortunes turned for the worse,\r\n\r\nliterally overnight.  Even in the US,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident  Bush  has  announced  the  roll-out  of   US$3\r\n\r\ntrillion,  that means US$3,000 billion budget, with  long\r\n\r\nterm  tax  cuts to spur growth.  Therefore,  we  must  be\r\n\r\nperpetually watchful over Singapore's long term survival.\r\n\r\nCan  the Minister gaze into his crystal ball and tell  us\r\n\r\nif  we  are doing right?  What can go wrong, and what  we\r\n\r\ncan do about them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Ho Geok Choo is not here. Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on investment promotion, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister what is the  outlook  of\r\n\r\ninvestment promotion for Singapore in the next few years?\r\n\r\nWe have heard, over and over again, that China is said to\r\n\r\nbe  a huge suction for foreign direct investments (FDIs).\r\n\r\nIt  is estimated that 20% of all FDIs in emerging markets\r\n\r\naround  the  world currently goes into China.   In  2002,\r\n\r\nChina  attracted  US$50 billion of  FDIs.   What  is  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the attraction of China in terms of  FDIs  on\r\n\r\nSingapore?   How  much FDIs and what type  of  industries\r\n\r\nhave  we in Singapore to be able to attract so far?  What\r\n\r\nare the new desirable industries that we wish to attract?\r\n\r\nIs  the EDB facing increasing difficulty to attract  MNCs\r\n\r\nto Singapore?  I would also like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nis   the  estimated  new  employment  creation  from  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  commitments we have received so  far.   These\r\n\r\nnew   jobs   would  help  to  alleviate  the   employment\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister about the idea that\r\n\r\nASEAN  itself is a huge market of 500 million people  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  could be a good region to attract  MNCs.   How\r\n\r\ncan  we cooperate on this concept amongst ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nso as to counter the attraction of China for FDIs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concept is to promote Singapore as an\r\n\r\nalternative  location to China.  Many MNCs often  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to put all their eggs in one basket, ie, to  invest\r\n\r\nonly  in  China.  Hence, many MNCs may want  to  have  an\r\n\r\nalternative  production or operating headquarters  centre\r\n\r\noutside  of  China.   Singapore can, indeed,  be  such  a\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I raised the\r\n\r\nissue of cost competitiveness many times before, and also\r\n\r\nduring the Budget debate a few days ago.  I feel that the\r\n\r\nresponse so far does not give a comfort feeling  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  identified  the solutions of  all  the  factors  of\r\n\r\ncosts.   During  the Budget debate, of course,  I  got  a\r\n\r\nstraight  \"No\" answer from the Minister for Finance  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  my  suggestion on differential  pricing  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  land. The Minister felt that we already  have\r\n\r\nsufficient initiatives in place to address the  issue  of\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of  land.  The Minister also  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will ensure sufficient and affordable land for\r\n\r\nindustrial  use,  and will always be  available  to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  competitive  in  the  long  term.  During  the\r\n\r\ndebate, I also highlighted the issue of the image that we\r\n\r\nhave  created  outside Singapore, and I  brought  up  the\r\n\r\nexample of a project which would have been competitive in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but the customers that I spoke to preferred to\r\n\r\ndo  it  in China or in countries like Philippines, simply\r\n\r\nbecause they felt that Singapore could not do it.  And  I\r\n\r\nfelt that it is competitive because it was mainly capital\r\n\r\ncost that was involved, and the labour content was really\r\n\r\nvery  small.  But the issue of land could then  become  a\r\n\r\nsignificant factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of image and perception that we have\r\n\r\ngiven to others regarding our cost being high could be  a\r\n\r\nbig  issue  for  us.  And one lesson that I  have  learnt\r\n\r\nthroughout my working life is that the perception can  be\r\n\r\nas  bad,  if not worse, than reality.  With this  as  the\r\n\r\nbackdrop,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  a  few\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on industrial land, I believe that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance really meant that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  continue to provide affordable industrial  land  to\r\n\r\nJTC.  Can I ask the Minister what are the JTC initiatives\r\n\r\nand  plans  to assure the affordability of factory  space\r\n\r\nover the long term?  Also, whether JTC and its 100% owned\r\n\r\nsubsidiary, Ascendas, have indeed passed on  all  of  the\r\n\r\nsavings from property tax\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrebates  to  their tenants.  I have often heard  feedback\r\n\r\nthat Ascendas did not quite do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what initiatives does the Minister have to\r\n\r\naddress  the  high  cost  image  and  to  eliminate   the\r\n\r\nunhealthy perception problem that we are facing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also brought up the issue of many hidden\r\n\r\ntaxes,  Government charges and fees, and if they are  all\r\n\r\nadded  up will make our overall effective tax rate  looks\r\n\r\nworse  than  many countries  -  taxes like property  tax,\r\n\r\npetrol  tax,  COE, road tax and so on,  which  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by  many  Members.  Is  the  Minister  still\r\n\r\nconvinced that we are indeed cost competitive if  we  add\r\n\r\nup all these factors of cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee Siew Kim, you can take your\r\n\r\ntwo cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, Singapore industries can look\r\n\r\nforward  to  harnessing the cheaper factors of production\r\n\r\nof  labour  and land on the islands of Bintan and  Batam.\r\n\r\nOn top of the proximity to Singapore, the two islands are\r\n\r\nnot unfamiliar to most Singaporeans, having become choice\r\n\r\nholiday getaways.  Now that our Government has taken  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  to include the two islands in our FTAs,  this\r\n\r\naugmentation  to  our industrial base would  continue  to\r\n\r\nanchor  manufacturing as the key driver for our  economy.\r\n\r\nHowever,   some  SMEs  that  had  studied   this   latest\r\n\r\ndevelopment    cite    logistical   and    cross-boundary\r\n\r\nadministrative issues or transfer of goods and  materials\r\n\r\nas   continuing   impediments  to  achieving   the   full\r\n\r\nintegrative  potential  of  Bintan  and  Batam   as   our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing hinterland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for the expeditious\r\n\r\nstreamlining   of   procedures   with   the    Indonesian\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  facilitate the  movement  of  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices.   In  a  cut on the Ministry of Transport,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Transport had assured that we are  tackling\r\n\r\nthe  customs procedures for importers and exporters,  but\r\n\r\nthis  is the Singapore side.  Let us extend these to  our\r\n\r\nIndonesian friends as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the transfer of the security measures\r\n\r\nand  precautions  and  knowledge  that  we  have  already\r\n\r\nattained to the islands would give additional comfort  to\r\n\r\nour   export  markets  that  our  extended  manufacturing\r\n\r\nhinterland comes with the same assurance that  they  have\r\n\r\ncome to expect of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even as we expand our manufacturing hinterland,\r\n\r\nit  is  our  goal to spur entrepreneurial development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Through innovations, we hope to generate  the\r\n\r\nfuel   that  propels  our  manufacturing  base.   It   is\r\n\r\nrecognised that in prototyping new products, testing  new\r\n\r\nproducts  and proofs of concepts, enhancements  to  bring\r\n\r\nforth  new  versions  of  products,  require  a  base  of\r\n\r\nsupporting  industries.  These are the people  who,  with\r\n\r\nengineering ingenuity and skilful hands, craft and  bring\r\n\r\nto  life  the ideas.   These too are the same  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries that have cut their spurs being key  suppliers\r\n\r\nto  the  MNCs  that have located their manufacturing  and\r\n\r\ndesign  centres  here.  Hence, SMEs that are  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthese downstream activities may need to be identified and\r\n\r\ngiven  special attention and incentives.  I ask that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider that when we approach the twinning  of\r\n\r\ntopics  of  promoting entrepreneurship and manufacturing,\r\n\r\nwe  give  special attention to alleviating the challenges\r\n\r\nfacing the SMEs in our supporting industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, over the\r\n\r\nyears, we have had to reinvent ourselves in terms of  our\r\n\r\nofferings to tourists to Singapore.  Where we were once a\r\n\r\nshopping haven for luxury products, we now often hear the\r\n\r\nrefrain  that we are expensive, or that our products  are\r\n\r\ntired.   Even when visitors ask their Singaporean friends\r\n\r\nfor  ideas on what to see or where to go, the suggestions\r\n\r\ndo  not come readily, except when it comes to food or the\r\n\r\nusual  suspects   -   the  zoo, Sentosa.   This  is  well\r\n\r\nmanifested  in the challenge for us to push  the  average\r\n\r\nlength of stay beyond the 3.19 days and raise the tourist\r\n\r\nexpenditure above $758.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Tourism Board itself declares\r\n\r\nthat there is no such thing as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntypical  visitor, and that there is a huge  variation  in\r\n\r\nneeds.   At the same time, we have had to adapt to sudden\r\n\r\nshocks,  such as the September 11 disaster which affected\r\n\r\nlong-haul  markets  and reshaped travel  patterns.   Yet,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  plan, not surprisingly, we consider the  longer\r\n\r\nterm  effects.   In  this regard, I  note  that  the  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives proposed by the STB represent an intention to\r\n\r\nshift  the  emphasis  beyond  volumes,  such  as  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals or top line numbers, as I would refer to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I note that there is still a tendency to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  make-overs and single products on  a  discrete\r\n\r\nattraction basis.  The same appears to be true,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nlack  of  a  holistic approach to accommodation capacity,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the seemingly ad hoc proposal to offer HDB-type\r\n\r\nexperiences.   What is yet more worrying is our  tendency\r\n\r\nto  look after only the hardware aspects, rather than the\r\n\r\nsoftware  issues.   I do not know, for  example,  whether\r\n\r\nChinatown  is  a  case in point  -  huge fanfare  at  the\r\n\r\nopening,  encouraging  start but, understandably  now,  a\r\n\r\npitiful stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many visitors like to go where the locals go.\r\n\r\nMany  would  love exploring the HDB commercial  areas  or\r\n\r\ndining at the coffee shops, whilst enjoying the MRT  trip\r\n\r\nalong  the  way.   Stand-alone tourist  attractions  have\r\n\r\ntheir  place in the overall scheme of things,  but  where\r\n\r\nthere is little association with the Singaporean identity\r\n\r\nor  lifestyle, they lose their shine rather quickly.   We\r\n\r\nhave enough failures like Haw Par Villa to learn from.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore   like  to  ask  the  Minister  the   following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, have we explored sufficiently the natural\r\n\r\ncharm and heritage of Singapore when developing ideas for\r\n\r\nboth tourists and Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how do we translate the new initiatives\r\n\r\ninto  economic  reality,  so  that  it  will  not  be   a\r\n\r\nsuperficial make-over exercise, and how will progress  be\r\n\r\ntracked and assessed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what structural changes are needed within\r\n\r\nthe hospitality sector, eg,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  projections  for the different  class  of  hotel\r\n\r\ncapacity?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  an issue with regard to Malaysian Airlines  having\r\n\r\nChina  girls as stewardesses to boost tourist  visits  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  According to the Oana-Xinhua report, MAS plans\r\n\r\nto employ some 100 China cabin crew this year.  The tell-tale  sign  is not about the cabin crew, but  rather  the\r\n\r\nincreasing attraction of Malaysia as a favourite  tourism\r\n\r\ndestination   for  Chinese  travellers.   It   has   been\r\n\r\nforecasted that MAS' sales volume for 2003 is expected to\r\n\r\ndouble  that  of  next year.  It has been  reported  that\r\n\r\nduring  the Chinese New Year holidays in early  February,\r\n\r\nsales  increased by 60% compared to that of the  previous\r\n\r\nyear.   Sir,  surely we can add value to  Malaysia's  new\r\n\r\nfound  strategy  of attracting China tourists.   How  can\r\n\r\nSingapore  attract  this group from China?   How  can  we\r\n\r\nensure  that  this group will not bypass  Singapore?   Is\r\n\r\nthere any arrangement with the Malaysian Tourism Board to\r\n\r\npackage a bi-neighbour attraction package perhaps,  which\r\n\r\ndestinations  could include both Malaysia and  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWill  Singapore  take the initiative  to  offer  a  joint\r\n\r\nprogramme  which  can work both ways in  this  particular\r\n\r\narea,  since tourist arrivals from China are growing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst offering Singapore's hotspots, we can also\r\n\r\noffer   to  market  Malaysia's  hotspots  through  direct\r\n\r\ntourists to Singapore.   This way, we will work towards a\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial arrangement.  How  many  other  such\r\n\r\narrangements are there today with Malaysia?  Is there any\r\n\r\nspecial tourist attraction that we can offer?  For  sure,\r\n\r\nwe  are no shopping haven, neither do we have the wonders\r\n\r\nof  the world.  Sure, we have Sentosa, the Esplanade  and\r\n\r\nthe  lights.   What more can we have that  will  offer  a\r\n\r\ndifference?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we started to look also at our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness at the tourist dollars and  our  standard\r\n\r\nof   customer  service.   Chinese  tourist  arrivals   to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  from  January to November 2002  numbered  about\r\n\r\n517,000.  Projecting  from this  figure,  the  year  2002\r\n\r\nfigure  will be about 560,000.  The Singapore figure  for\r\n\r\nChinese tourists\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  January to November 2002 numbered 611,000  visitors.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be projected to about 660,000 for  the  whole\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, Malaysia recorded a tourist revenue figure\r\n\r\nof  RM24.2  billion, about S$11.1 billion, an average  of\r\n\r\nRM$1,890  per  visitor.  If Malaysia  is  earning  S$11.1\r\n\r\nbillion  from  this  sector, it  can  illustrate  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians that, mutually, we can grow the pie,  so  much\r\n\r\nmore  if  only we combine our efforts.  Perhaps Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  be  the coordinating hub to link Malaysia  with  the\r\n\r\nother  regional islands in Indonesia for the tourists  to\r\n\r\nvisit.   Not  only  will  increased  tourism  boost   the\r\n\r\neconomy,  but  it will also help to create jobs  for  the\r\n\r\nretrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister enlighten the House as to whether\r\n\r\nthere   are    existing  programmes  with  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncounterpart?   If not, is there any intention  to  pursue\r\n\r\none?   Also,  are  we  embarking on  a  massive  customer\r\n\r\nservice  training for our service providers, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  increasing service excellence programmes  that  both\r\n\r\nChina and Malaysia are embarking on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Penny Low, you can take your two\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, each year,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Tourism Board spends much effort and money\r\n\r\nlooking into ways to attract the big spending tourists to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Whilst it makes economic  sense  to  attract\r\n\r\nhigh  tourist dollars, the diversity of Singapore can  be\r\n\r\nappreciated  by tourists of all classes.  If efforts  are\r\n\r\nmade to attract all, I believe the numbers would all  add\r\n\r\nup  to sustain Singapore as a top tourist destination  in\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I was delighted to read the Straits Times\r\n\r\narticle entitled \"Welcome to Hotel HDB\".  It is meant  to\r\n\r\nbe a sort of budget hotel, aimed at the China market.   I\r\n\r\napplaud the move by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, there is another group of globetrotters, who\r\n\r\nhas  been  somewhat neglected and certainly deserves  our\r\n\r\nattention.   They are the backpackers.  Perhaps  in  this\r\n\r\npart\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  world,  backpackers are perceived  to  be  \"poor\r\n\r\ntravellers\",   and  not  much value  add.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  true.   In fact, in Europe,  Australia,  New\r\n\r\nZealand  and other countries, backpacking and  caravaning\r\n\r\nis  a  prized travel choice, and a way of life for  some.\r\n\r\nBackpackers  in  good numbers can contribute  substantial\r\n\r\ntourist dollars  and provide employment for many.  In all\r\n\r\nmajor  cities  in the world  -  London, New York,  Paris,\r\n\r\nyou  name  it  -  there are niche markets which cater  to\r\n\r\nthese backpackers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backpackers have more to offer than just tourist\r\n\r\ndollars.  Backpackers add to the vibrancy and dynamism of\r\n\r\ncities  of  the world, adding colour and flavour  to  the\r\n\r\ncities.    In   many   cities,   backpackers   contribute\r\n\r\nsignificantly to the creativity and culture of the place,\r\n\r\nas they bring along with them different world views and a\r\n\r\nkeenness  to  exchange  ideas at a  heartlander's  level.\r\n\r\nTourists are always attracted to places with all kinds of\r\n\r\ntourists,  and  certainly this  is  not  a  group  to  be\r\n\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many backpackers may be fresh graduates out to\r\n\r\nconquer the geographical world, many of them graduate  to\r\n\r\nconquer  the  corporate  world subsequently.   Therefore,\r\n\r\ngiving  them a good impression of Singapore may  one  day\r\n\r\nbecome a deciding factor in the relocation of themselves,\r\n\r\nor their companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there have been reports of lodges\r\n\r\nthat  provide  accommodation to these  backpackers  being\r\n\r\nclosed  down  due  to  their  inability  to  renew  their\r\n\r\nlicences.  The famous Peony Mansion, Lee's boarding house\r\n\r\nand many other popular backpackers lodge are now history.\r\n\r\nMany  of those around are also in a deplorable state  and\r\n\r\nlook  more  like crammed bunkers with dirty  toilets  and\r\n\r\nvery little sanitary attention.  I have spoken to some of\r\n\r\nthe  operators along Bencoolen Street, and they have told\r\n\r\nme  that  the premises sit on gazetted land that  may  be\r\n\r\nrecalled  at  short notice.  As such, it  was  not  worth\r\n\r\ninvesting in the place, even though there were profits to\r\n\r\nbe made from running it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome  of  the  operators' licences were subsequently  not\r\n\r\nrenewed,  as  it was said that they could  not  meet  the\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like the Minister to comment on\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  a policy to discourage  or  encourage\r\n\r\nbackpackers;  whether these owners or licensees  had,  in\r\n\r\nfact, not met the standards set and hence unable to renew\r\n\r\ntheir  licences.   If the latter is the case,  then  what\r\n\r\nmeasure  is MTI taking to help the licensees upgrade  and\r\n\r\nkeep  their licence?  Will there  be efforts to grow this\r\n\r\nmarket  and,  if so, what should we be expecting  in  the\r\n\r\nnear  future?   Last but not least, could the  Hotel  HDB\r\n\r\nconcept be expanded to become a backpackers Lodge HDB?\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on medical services hub. When I\r\n\r\nfirst  heard of the call for Singapore to be  a  regional\r\n\r\nmedical  services hub, I had a feeling of deja vu.   This\r\n\r\ncall was first heard in the early 90s, which saw millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars going into dressing up public hospitals,  and\r\n\r\nwords   like   \"restructured\",   \"semi-privatised\"    and\r\n\r\n\"privatised\"  hospitals became fashionable.   This  year,\r\n\r\nthe  budget  of the Ministry for Health is up  by  33.9%,\r\n\r\nmuch  of  which  will go into financing of  new  hospital\r\n\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am hopeful that our efforts this time will\r\n\r\nbe  successful, I would like to seek assurance  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister that our efforts and resources will not be spent\r\n\r\nin  vain  this  time.   The fear is  that  while  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding ourselves into a regional medical hub to attract\r\n\r\ntop-end  clients from the region, so are  our  neighbours\r\n\r\nlike  Malaysia, Thailand and, very likely, Shanghai.   In\r\n\r\nfact, in 2001, Thailand's Bumrungrad Hospital saw 225,000\r\n\r\nforeign  patients,  which  is  more  than  that  of   all\r\n\r\nSingapore hospitals combined.  Cost was a critical factor\r\n\r\nas  these  countries  are able to  provide  good  medical\r\n\r\nservices  at cheap rates.  Talent may be the  other,  but\r\n\r\ntalents  are  mobile.  Hence, could the Minister  comment\r\n\r\non:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Our competitive edge vis-a-vis our neighbours,\r\n\r\nand the difference then and now?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the steps planned to build Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  a  medical hub for the region?  How do we  plan  to\r\n\r\ncounter this competition and stay ahead?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What steps have we taken so far to woo more\r\n\r\nforeign patients to seek consultation in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, will this emphasis on high-end service,\r\n\r\nwhich means more expensive machines and facilities,  also\r\n\r\ntranslate  into  locals having to pay higher  dollar  for\r\n\r\nmedical services rendered?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the experience during this downturn, should we\r\n\r\nnot  focus  on  basic medical so that  locals  can  enjoy\r\n\r\nadequate  medical  services at reasonable  rates,  rather\r\n\r\nthan to up the ante for all concerned?  Would it also  be\r\n\r\nbetter  for  Singapore  to concentrate  on  building  its\r\n\r\ncapability,  capacity and experience in coping  with  the\r\n\r\nageing population?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides attracting overseas patients, another\r\n\r\nimportant  area where we can look at is the provision  of\r\n\r\nan  educational centre or a learning centre  for  foreign\r\n\r\ndoctors,  medical workers and researchers.  We have  over\r\n\r\nthe years built a world-class infrastructure, systems and\r\n\r\nbest  practices.  Our physicians and doctors  are  highly\r\n\r\nproficient.    In  fact,  we  have  some  of   the   best\r\n\r\npractitioners here.  A good starting point  would  be  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  world-class learning centre  that  attracts\r\n\r\ndoctors from the region to come here to gain insights  on\r\n\r\nour  top-end practices, and have them develop and enhance\r\n\r\ntheir expertise here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will boost our image as a first-class medical\r\n\r\nhub  of  the region where not only patients come for  our\r\n\r\nservice, but also having a world leading learning  centre\r\n\r\nfor  the medical profession of the region.  Perhaps, with\r\n\r\nthe  recent  emphasis on education, bio-medical  research\r\n\r\nand  life  sciences, plus a few medical breakthroughs  in\r\n\r\nrecent years, it will not be too farfetched to include in\r\n\r\nour  vision,  to fashion Singapore into a hot  house  for\r\n\r\nmedical breakthroughs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, every time I speak on\r\n\r\ncompiling macro statistics,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember my request to the Minister for the publication\r\n\r\nof  gross  national product (GNP) statistics, in addition\r\n\r\nto  gross  domestic product (GDP) figures  on  a  regular\r\n\r\nbasis.   He  has yet to do so, I believe.  But  my  point\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond  asking for GNP numbers to be published.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  Government can play  a  key  role  in\r\n\r\nbroadening  the  perspectives of all Singaporeans  beyond\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right Government signals have significant\r\n\r\nimplications.  Why else are Singaporeans disinterested in\r\n\r\nwhat  is going on outside of Singapore?  We speak of  GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth  whenever we want to dwell on our  economic  well-being,  but  our domestic market should not be  our  sole\r\n\r\nfocus;   otherwise,  our  working  norms  revolve  around\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many Singaporeans' minds, working abroad is not\r\n\r\nseen as an opportunity to widen the horizon but an option\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  cannot find jobs here in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nregard  postings  outside  of  Singapore  as  the   least\r\n\r\npreferred   alternative  and  expect  to  be   adequately\r\n\r\ncompensated.   It  is  thus  not  surprising  that   many\r\n\r\nSingapore   companies   expanding   overseas   frequently\r\n\r\nexperience difficulties recruiting Singaporeans for these\r\n\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in today's Business Times, we read about this\r\n\r\nsame  difficulty  in getting Singaporeans  out  of  their\r\n\r\ncomfort zone.  Apart from not realising our potential  as\r\n\r\ngood  managers,  we  also  forgo  the  opportunities   of\r\n\r\nlearning  more  about  the global market  that  Singapore\r\n\r\noperates in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a major economy that we all know of, many of\r\n\r\nthe  citizens have not travelled or worked outside of the\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  have no particular motivation  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThey  can probably afford to do so as their GDP  is  many\r\n\r\ntimes   ours.    There   is  ample   industry   and   job\r\n\r\ndiversification  within  their  domestic  market  itself.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  we  do not have this luxury.  We,  therefore,\r\n\r\nneed   to   go   beyond  visiting  other   countries   to\r\n\r\nunderstanding the different economic and cultural norms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, apart from repeating my request to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for regular\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublication of GNP-type statistics, I would also like  to\r\n\r\nrequest  for  indicators  and  messages  that  are   more\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  our  efforts  at  globalisation.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  it will be useful to know how far our companies\r\n\r\nhave  ventured, what businesses we have engaged  in,  and\r\n\r\nwhat  business associations and networks are particularly\r\n\r\nimportant.  This should not be one-off PR exercises but a\r\n\r\nconstant  feature.  Ideally, over time, our  geographical\r\n\r\nborders  should  blur when Singaporeans  contemplate  the\r\n\r\neconomic participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, may I take this opportunity to\r\n\r\napplaud  MTI's vision and hard work in securing the  many\r\n\r\nFTAs,  industry and trade agreements.  However, the  real\r\n\r\nwork  begins when the deals are sealed.  By this, I  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the full benefits of FTAs and other agreements  can\r\n\r\nonly be reaped when our businessmen join MTI's bandwagon,\r\n\r\nto  explore all possible business opportunities and  take\r\n\r\nfull  advantage of it.  I understand that  this  will  be\r\n\r\nMTI's top agenda, but the process must be expedited so as\r\n\r\nto   reap  the  first  mover's  advantage,  since   other\r\n\r\ncountries  are  also busy concluding similar  agreements.\r\n\r\nEven   more   so   is   that   a  widespread   awareness,\r\n\r\nunderstanding and eagerness to actively explore  business\r\n\r\nopportunities will help give hope to our people, lift the\r\n\r\nspirit and mood of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest some ideas to connect policymakers\r\n\r\nwith entrepreneurs of most, if not all, types and sizes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We could hold various seminars via the\r\n\r\nassociations,  and even at grassroots  level,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nincrease  reach  as  well as depth.  This  can  encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship from the very basic level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Organise more target-oriented publicity via the\r\n\r\nmass media.  For example, country-specific opportunities,\r\n\r\nindustry-specific  opportunities,  and  highlight   those\r\n\r\nwhich   enable   Singapore  to  have  a  comparative   or\r\n\r\ncompetitive  advantage due to lower  or  no  trade  duty,\r\n\r\ncharges, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Organise more trade missions and exchange\r\n\r\nprogrammes to include a wider group of entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nparticipants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Establish liaison office in Singapore and the\r\n\r\nrelevant countries (eg, via IE Singapore), with dedicated\r\n\r\nstaff to help answer queries, provide background research\r\n\r\nand facilitate high level introductions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could MTI comment on when they will be rolling out\r\n\r\nthe various programmes and what more can be done?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate note, can MTI also comment on how the\r\n\r\nFTAs  can  increase  the  efficiency  in  our  production\r\n\r\nnetworks, especially in the context of our high value-add\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services, and expand on the demands  of\r\n\r\nour new twin engines of growth?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the EU-Singapore FTA, since the Minister\r\n\r\ncommented  that it is a very important one  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nand it is a very difficult one to conclude at the moment,\r\n\r\nwhat   is  the  Ministry  doing  to  overcome  the   EU's\r\n\r\nreluctance or focus?  Does Singapore present itself as  a\r\n\r\nstrong business case for EU?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, how can various sectors of the\r\n\r\nsociety,  ie,  parliamentarians,  business  leaders   and\r\n\r\nothers, help to cast Singapore in a favourable light,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  be  in a better position to  conclude  the\r\n\r\nvarious trade and business agreements with other nations?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh, take both your\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my topic is on China and\r\n\r\nIndia.   We  all have heard many times in the  House  and\r\n\r\nalso  elsewhere the Minister sharing with  all  of  us  a\r\n\r\ndefined  strategy  for  China.   Some  examples   are   - investing   aggressively  in  China,  moving   low   cost\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  or  the  low value-added  activities  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  to China, providing our services and expertise\r\n\r\nto China, because that is what is probably lacking there,\r\n\r\ntraining  of  our  scholars in China to  ensure  that  we\r\n\r\ndevelop  a good network for the future, and also  working\r\n\r\non an ASEAN-China FTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have is: how confident is the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  we  will  be  successful  in  our   China\r\n\r\nstrategy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on how China will respond to\r\n\r\nus.   Are we a preferred partner or just another business\r\n\r\ncontact for China?  If we go with a mindset that we think\r\n\r\nthat China is going to respond to us favourably, compared\r\n\r\nto  everyone  else, and if China does not feel  the  same\r\n\r\nway,   then  we  may  have  difficulty  in  pushing   the\r\n\r\nstrategies that we want to push.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on India. Do we have a defined\r\n\r\nstrategy,  just like what we have for China, to  tap  the\r\n\r\nopportunities that are available there?  And, if so, what\r\n\r\nis  that strategy?  One question that many have asked  me\r\n\r\nis  whether  the  Government is serious  or  half-hearted\r\n\r\nabout going into India.  Another question I have is:  are\r\n\r\nwe  too  late entering into India?  Finally, how are  the\r\n\r\nIndians  rating  Singapore as a partner?   And  are  they\r\n\r\nwilling  for  us  to be a preferred partner  to  tap  the\r\n\r\nopportunities?   I  know  these questions  are  wide  and\r\n\r\nvaried,  but,  I think, if we understand  how  China  and\r\n\r\nIndia  feel about us, it is going to be easier for us  to\r\n\r\nexecute our strategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on to the issue of world class companies\r\n\r\nor    globalising    Singapore   companies,    I    agree\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that it is important\r\n\r\nthat  we globalise our Singapore companies.  We also have\r\n\r\nheard  from  many  local companies that when  we  started\r\n\r\ntalking  about the second wing for our economy,  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  did  regionalise.  But when the Asian crisis  came,\r\n\r\nthey  got  hurt, and therefore they have backed  off  and\r\n\r\npulled back on their efforts.  So we really need to think\r\n\r\nof  new initiatives that can help us to more aggressively\r\n\r\nglobalise our companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all talk about the clustering of companies, big\r\n\r\nand  small, going to the region.

These sentiments are the  result\r\n\r\nof  not just the current economic downturn, but also  the\r\n\r\nimpact of global\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetition.  The fact of the matter is that our domestic\r\n\r\nmarket is just too small - only 4 million people.  On top\r\n\r\nof  this,  the  MNCs,  the  international  companies  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses will come into our backyard and take away  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  customers.  Singapore companies must  therefore\r\n\r\nglobalise  or face the threat of survival.  How  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  the  leading member of  Singapore  Inc.,\r\n\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that IE Singapore should step up its effort\r\n\r\nto    increase   Singapore's   share   in   the    global\r\n\r\nconscientiousness for her products and services.  The ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations   in  this  respect   should   be   fully\r\n\r\nsupported.  Our presence should be enhanced through  more\r\n\r\nactive  participation  in events  like  trade  shows  and\r\n\r\nexhibitions.   At  such  shows,  for  example,  CeBit  or\r\n\r\nComdex,  it  is  not unusual to find entire  halls  fully\r\n\r\noccupied  by Taiwan, represented by both large and  small\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  Korean presence is  also  very  strong.\r\n\r\nMany more of our SMEs must be encouraged to take part  in\r\n\r\nsuch  events.  Perhaps our Government agencies could help\r\n\r\nto lower costs by buying space, hotel rooms, air tickets,\r\n\r\netc, in bulk and through grants and subsidies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, IE Singapore should also actively consider\r\n\r\nsetting  up  offices  in  more cities  to  look  for  new\r\n\r\nbusiness   opportunities  whenever  there  is  sufficient\r\n\r\ninterest.  These offices can act like representative  and\r\n\r\nagent  offices to handle enquiries and channel them  back\r\n\r\nto  the  appropriate companies in Singapore.   References\r\n\r\nlike  trade, product or company handbooks should be  made\r\n\r\nfreely  available in these cities.  More  remote  cities,\r\n\r\nfor example, those in China, India and even South America\r\n\r\nand  Africa, could be explored.  They can be our business\r\n\r\nscouts  and pioneers to open up new territories  for  our\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If resources are a problem, our Majulah network\r\n\r\ncould   be   fully  exploited  to  obtain   support   for\r\n\r\ninformation gathering, contacts, and assistance with  the\r\n\r\ninitial work that needs to be done when a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  first starts up in a new city.  A  scheme  with\r\n\r\nvolunteer  businessmen  can be  instituted.   I  know  of\r\n\r\ncompanies who are quite established in certain cities  in\r\n\r\nChina  where  IE  Singapore is  not  represented.   These\r\n\r\ncompanies may be quite willing to assist IE Singapore  in\r\n\r\nits efforts to help other Singapore companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I agree with the ERC when they pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  what Singapore needs are a few more global  brands.\r\n\r\nStrong brands allow companies to enjoy high gross profits\r\n\r\nand  continued  customer support.  We  are  already  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  with SIA and Creative Technology.   Could  we\r\n\r\nget  more?  How can the Government help?  Global branding\r\n\r\nrequires  global awareness, global presence,  and  global\r\n\r\nrecognition,  and  this is not easy to achieve.   Support\r\n\r\nand  assistance from the Government can go  a  long  way.\r\n\r\nEven  SIA  needs Government's help, in terms of  securing\r\n\r\nair   services  agreements  from  other  countries.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment    should    therefore   seriously    consider\r\n\r\nidentifying  a few Singapore products and  help  them  to\r\n\r\ngrow   both  locally  and  internationally.   Take,   for\r\n\r\nexample, Tiger Beer, our earlier policy on import of beer\r\n\r\nhas enabled it to grow strongly in Singapore.  How can we\r\n\r\nnow   help   it   to  grow  overseas?   Although   widely\r\n\r\nacknowledged  as  one  of the best beer  by  expert  beer\r\n\r\ndrinkers,  its  brand presence in Europe and  America  is\r\n\r\nstill weak, if not non-existent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other recent examples with international aspirations\r\n\r\nare  Tee  Yih Jia Food and even Super Coffee.   They  are\r\n\r\nmaking increasing presence abroad.  Government and  GLCs,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  SIA,  can  help  in promoting  their  products.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  we  can start by serving Tiger  Beer,  Tee  Yih\r\n\r\nJia's  roti  prata  and Super Coffee exclusively  at  our\r\n\r\nEmbassy  functions abroad.  Would the Minister look  into\r\n\r\nthese suggestions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I would like to add on to the\r\n\r\npoints  made  by Dr John Chen regarding the  role  of  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  their officers.  There are some  overseas\r\n\r\ncentres and advisors in some 36 locations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround  the  world.  Its role is to help Singapore  based\r\n\r\nbusinesses enter foreign markets and thereby contributing\r\n\r\nto the growth and internationalisation of local companies\r\n\r\ninto world-class enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paramount for successful entry to a foreign market\r\n\r\nis  the  intimate understanding of the country.   As  Sun\r\n\r\nTze's  Art of War states: 'Know thyself, know thy  enemy.\r\n\r\nHundred  battles  fought,  hundred  battles  won.'   This\r\n\r\nknowledge  includes its culture, its social and political\r\n\r\nstructures,  its business and market structures,  and  so\r\n\r\non.  In order to give our entrepreneurs an insight and  a\r\n\r\nheadstart, qualitative briefing by the relevant  officers\r\n\r\nof IE Singapore must extend beyond newspaper cuttings and\r\n\r\nwidely   available  published  articles.   In  fact,   IE\r\n\r\nSingapore,   by  setting  up  offices  at   the   various\r\n\r\nlocations, has the economies of scale and is perhaps  the\r\n\r\nbest  agency to conduct such research and collate  first-hand  market intelligence that is crucial to the survival\r\n\r\nof our entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from business community has been that such\r\n\r\npertinent and relevant qualitative briefing had not  been\r\n\r\nvery  forthcoming.   Instead, the experiences  were  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  been merely given publicly available  reading\r\n\r\nmaterials, directory listings of businesses or Government\r\n\r\ncontacts and not so useful information about the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot do the business for our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  but we can facilitate our  external  wing\r\n\r\nwith  qualitative  market intelligence to  enhance  their\r\n\r\npresence  in  a  foreign land.  Can the  Ministry  please\r\n\r\ncomment  on  what  can an entrepreneur expect  when  they\r\n\r\napproach  IE  Singapore?  And, two, how are IE  Singapore\r\n\r\nofficers   chosen,  meaning  those  who   are   stationed\r\n\r\noverseas?  And what is their role?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance our chances of success, our IE\r\n\r\nofficers  must have skill sets that will extract  maximum\r\n\r\ninformation  from  the  respective  countries  they   are\r\n\r\noperating in.  IE officers must do more than just  acting\r\n\r\nas  a  facilitator or writer of research articles.   They\r\n\r\nmust be more proactive and business oriented, as my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Dr John Chen, has uttered.  In fact,  our  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore officers must also adopt, not just a high-tech,\r\n\r\nbut  also a high-touch approach.  I would like to propose\r\n\r\nthat  such  officers  be  recruited  from  a  variety  of\r\n\r\ndisciplines and have good grounding in sociology, or even\r\n\r\nanthropology.  Frequently, knowing the business can  only\r\n\r\nget one so far.  It is knowing the clients that makes all\r\n\r\nthe  difference.  Hence, the officers must be well versed\r\n\r\nwith  the  nuances  of the country,  the  key  individual\r\n\r\nplayers,   the  economy,  government  red  tape,   common\r\n\r\nmistakes  made  and how to avoid them.   In  short,   the\r\n\r\nofficers  must play the role of our intelligence officers\r\n\r\nfor our local businesses venturing overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, it is clear from the comments of many\r\n\r\nMPs  that the economic uncertainty caused by the prospect\r\n\r\nof  war  in Iraq weighs heavily on everyone.  Even  after\r\n\r\nthe  Iraqi crisis has been resolved, I do not think  that\r\n\r\nthe global uncertainty will completely clear.  The reason\r\n\r\nis this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iraqi issue has been very divisive\r\n\r\ninternationally.  And it has caused probably  irreparable\r\n\r\ndamage to the western alliance and there are bound to  be\r\n\r\nfar-reaching  political and economic  implications,  long\r\n\r\nafter  the  war has ended.  Perhaps, this was waiting  to\r\n\r\nhappen.   The  western alliance was formed to  counter  a\r\n\r\ncommon threat, that of the Soviet Union.  That threat has\r\n\r\nnow  disappeared, and we are beginning  now  to  see  the\r\n\r\ncrack   in   the  alliance.   And  Iraq   is   only   the\r\n\r\nprecipitating force to break up something which, perhaps,\r\n\r\neventually must come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is we are in for a more prolonged\r\n\r\nperiod of uncertainty.  And the question before us is how\r\n\r\ndo  we  adjust  ourselves to a  new  situation.   In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  as  many  MPs have pointed  out,  we  see  the\r\n\r\nemergence of China and India as global powers.  And there\r\n\r\nis  also the new threat of Jihadi Global Terrorism.   And\r\n\r\nunderlying all this are powerful technological forces  at\r\n\r\nwork, undermining old structures, miniaturising the means\r\n\r\nof destruction and changing the nature of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife itself.  We cannot be sure what the world would look\r\n\r\nlike  10 years from now.  But one thing we know, and that\r\n\r\nis, the past is no more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked if we have a good strategy\r\n\r\nto   take   into  account  this  fast  changing  external\r\n\r\nenvironment,  and this has been a concern of  many  other\r\n\r\nMPs  as  well.   What is within Singapore, we  have  some\r\n\r\ncontrol over, including our overall business environment.\r\n\r\nAnd  we must watch our cost, upgrade our skills, increase\r\n\r\nour  productivity and develop local companies.   We  have\r\n\r\nlimited  influence over developments in the  region,  and\r\n\r\nbeyond the region, we are just price takers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Report, which has been debated in detail in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  addresses in detail  the  internal  factors\r\n\r\nwhich  are  within  our control.  On the  issue  of  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  raised by Mr  Inderjit  Singh,  my  SMS\r\n\r\nTharman  will go into the questions he raised, in detail,\r\n\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On MTI today, several MPs, including Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee,  Mr  Inderjit Singh, Mr Wee, Mrs  Lim  and  Dr  Chen\r\n\r\nraised questions about our external linkages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ERC Report, I would like to make one point,\r\n\r\nwhich bears upon the questions raised by many of our MPs,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  how do we stay competitive in the  new  world.\r\n\r\nMany  investors and analysts study closely the ERC Report\r\n\r\nand they know that, far from ducking difficult issues, we\r\n\r\ntackle   them   head-on.   PERC   noted   carefully   the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  our  purpose.  And many  MNC  CEOs  told\r\n\r\nChairman, EDB, that it is a remarkable report, and a  few\r\n\r\nwent  so  far  as  to  say  that  they  wish  their   own\r\n\r\ngovernments could do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may argue sharply over issues, and we should, but\r\n\r\nin the end, as a people, we are united and our collective\r\n\r\nwill  is  strong.  And this gives us a solid  reputation.\r\n\r\nFor   this   reason,   we  continue  to   attract   major\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Leong Horn Kee's questions, EDB is\r\n\r\nconfident that it can attract\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$8  billion of manufacturing fixed asset investment  this\r\n\r\nyear  and  $1.9 billion of total business  spending.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have  been  attracting  the  lion's  share  of\r\n\r\ninvestments  coming to Southeast Asia  in  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears.  Our reputation is our greatest asset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Inderjit Singh and Miss Penny\r\n\r\nLow asked questions about FTAs.  The aim of our  FTAs  is\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  our  links to our key economic  partners,\r\n\r\nespecially the US, Japan and Europe, which are  our  main\r\n\r\nsources of investment and technology, and also our  major\r\n\r\nmarkets.   They  help our manufacturing  sector  to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive  with  respect to China and other  countries.\r\n\r\nFor  example, our FTA with Japan makes it more attractive\r\n\r\nfor  petrochemical companies to invest in  Jurong  Island\r\n\r\nbecause it can export many products tariff-free to Japan,\r\n\r\nand  that  FTA, as Mr Lim Chin Beng noted yesterday,  has\r\n\r\nalready  increased the volume of trade  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  made Singapore an even  more  attractive\r\n\r\nplatform for the export of electronic products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US-Singapore FTA, which will be signed in\r\n\r\nWashington  in May, will save us hundreds of millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  a  year  in tariff savings.  And  we  are  still\r\n\r\nworking on FTA with the EU, as I elaborated in Parliament\r\n\r\nlast month.  And to answer Miss Penny Low, the EU takes a\r\n\r\nposition that there should be no new FTAs till after  the\r\n\r\nDoha  round.   But I am still working on my good  friend,\r\n\r\nCommissioner Pascal Lamy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Leong Horn Kee pointed out, we must ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our businesses benefit from the FTAs.  I agree with\r\n\r\nMiss  Penny  Low  that Government officials  must  always\r\n\r\nconsult  the  private sector and make sure that  business\r\n\r\nconcerns  are adequately addressed during the process  of\r\n\r\nnegotiation.  MTI has been working with business  groups,\r\n\r\nlike   the  Singapore  Business  Federation,  to   gather\r\n\r\nfeedback on what our demands should be, and we explain to\r\n\r\nour business community how their members can take full\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the FTAs that we have concluded.   In  the\r\n\r\ncoming  months,  the SBF will be organising,  with  MTI's\r\n\r\nsupport,  a comprehensive outreach programme in different\r\n\r\nlanguages,  consisting  of talks,  briefings  and  sector\r\n\r\nspecific workshops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to the future, to answer Mr Leong Horn Kee\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Inderjit Singh, China and India will  become  as\r\n\r\nimportant to us as the US, Japan and the EU are now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen also asked whether we are doing enough\r\n\r\nin  the case of China.  We are strengthening our links to\r\n\r\nboth  countries  and steadily building  up  our  economic\r\n\r\nportfolios  and networks and, one day, our  children  and\r\n\r\ngrandchildren  will  benefit  from  these  networks   and\r\n\r\ninvestments, the way the Dutch, the Swiss and the British\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  benefit  from the investments  which  their\r\n\r\nforefathers made a long time ago in the US.  So this is a\r\n\r\nmission  with  long-term implications  for  our  survival\r\n\r\nchances for decades to come, and which is why we give  it\r\n\r\nthe highest importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is a big story and is already the most\r\n\r\nimportant  destination  of  our  outward  investment   in\r\n\r\ncumulative  terms,  overtaking Malaysia  six  years  ago.\r\n\r\nLast year, our non-oil domestic exports to China grew  by\r\n\r\na  whopping  40%.   IE Singapore, EDB  and  STB  are  all\r\n\r\nincreasing their presence in China, and to facilitate the\r\n\r\nsharing  of information among Singaporean businessmen,  a\r\n\r\npoint  raised  by many Members here, a Singapore  Chamber\r\n\r\nwas  established in Beijing last year and, in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nNetwork   China  was  formed.   And  the  flow  will   be\r\n\r\nincreasingly two way.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When China's Vice-President, Hu Xintao, visited\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  April last year, he proposed that  Chinese\r\n\r\ncompanies   partner   Singapore   companies   in    their\r\n\r\nexternalisation policy, what they call their zou  chu  qu\r\n\r\npolicy.  So, when I visited Hangzhou in August last year,\r\n\r\nI proposed to the provincial government that they might\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to  consider  establishing  a  Zhejiang  Centre  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   because  Zhejiang  is  one   of   the   most\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial   provinces   in   China,    particularly\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  from  Shaoxing, Ningbo  and  Wenzhou.   They\r\n\r\nfollowed  up  in  double quick time, and they  have  been\r\n\r\nputting  the heat on us.  Just a few days ago, the  Vice-Governor was in town with a large business delegation  to\r\n\r\nannounce  the launch of this Centre.  We hope that  other\r\n\r\nChinese provinces will follow suit, because this is  good\r\n\r\nfor  us.   And,  as China invests in Southeast  Asia,  in\r\n\r\norder to secure resources and markets, I believe many  of\r\n\r\nthem  will see Singapore as a natural base of operations,\r\n\r\nincluding the listing of their companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true - what Mr Leong Horn Kee and other\r\n\r\nMembers have said - that China's competitiveness presents\r\n\r\na  big  challenge, particularly in some industry sectors.\r\n\r\nBut  China's prosperity would eventually bring prosperity\r\n\r\nto  all  of  Southeast Asia, as was the case historically\r\n\r\nduring all the previous dynasties - the Tang, Song, Yuan,\r\n\r\nMing  and  Ching.   China has become a huge  importer  of\r\n\r\nproducts  from  Southeast Asia, and Chinese  tourists  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia are increasing rapidly, as  Members  have\r\n\r\nnoted.   In Singapore, we expect one million arrivals  by\r\n\r\n2005.   Our  children - provided there is  peace  -  will\r\n\r\ninherit  an  Asia full of opportunities,  from  Northeast\r\n\r\nAsia,   to  Southeast  Asia  and  to  India,  linked   by\r\n\r\nexpressways, by road, rail, air and sea links, and by the\r\n\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about our\r\n\r\nstrategy for India.  India is on the move, perhaps not as\r\n\r\nfast  as China, but making steady progress year by  year.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last 10 years, India grew at an annual  compound\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  of 6%, which is very good, considering  the\r\n\r\nfact  that, once upon a time, they talked in terms  of  a\r\n\r\nHindu  growth  rate  of 2, 3 or 4%.  Now,  they  blithely\r\n\r\ntarget  7-8% to make a 'dent on poverty', to use a phrase\r\n\r\nwhich   has   now   become  in  vogue   in   the   Indian\r\n\r\nestablishment.  We have been alive to these  developments\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact,  from  the time   former  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nNarasimha Rao began his new policy of reform and  opening\r\n\r\nup in 1981, we have positioned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves strategically as a long-term partner of India.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our links are developing nicely. IE Singapore and\r\n\r\nSTB  have  been increasing their presence in  India,  and\r\n\r\nmany  other  things  are being done.  Next  month,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh will be visiting India, and we are likely to\r\n\r\nlaunch   negotiations   for  a   Comprehensive   Economic\r\n\r\nCooperation  Agreement, which includes a FTA.   Even  two\r\n\r\nyears ago, the idea of an FTA with India would have  been\r\n\r\nunthinkable.  But, today, we are going to negotiate  one.\r\n\r\nIndia is increasingly looking eastwards, and increasingly\r\n\r\nwatching  what  China is doing.  As they look  eastwards,\r\n\r\nthey see Singapore as a natural facility and partner.   I\r\n\r\nhope   that   the   Comprehensive  Economic   Cooperation\r\n\r\nAgreement with India will make us an extension  of  India\r\n\r\ninto East and Southeast Asia.  It is good for them and it\r\n\r\nis good for us.  EDB has been attracting Indian companies\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.   Already, 17 out  of  the  20  Indian  IT\r\n\r\ncompanies with export revenue operate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With occasional tension between India and Pakistan,\r\n\r\nIndian   IT  companies  need  disaster  recovery  centres\r\n\r\noutside,   and  they  see  Singapore  as  being   ideally\r\n\r\npositioned  for  that purpose.  Following Polaris,  iFlax\r\n\r\nSolutions  and others, Satyam, one of the leading  Indian\r\n\r\nsoftware  companies, announced recently its  decision  to\r\n\r\nestablish  such a centre in Singapore.  In an  emergency,\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  their professionals will fly to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTheir  computer  systems will already be  operating,  and\r\n\r\nthey  will come in on pre-approved passes so that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  waste  time  processing the applications.   And  EDB\r\n\r\nbelieves  that more Indian software companies will  come.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple.  Their customers - who are the MNCs\r\n\r\nin  America, Europe and Japan - want assurances that even\r\n\r\nif there is conflict between India and Pakistan, there is\r\n\r\nan  alternative.   So, when these software  companies  go\r\n\r\noverseas,  they say, \"Look, this is what we  can  do  for\r\n\r\nyou, and our insurance is Singapore.\"  It burnishes their\r\n\r\nproduct.   It  adds value to their product, and  it  adds\r\n\r\nvalue to Singapore.  And this is only one way in which we\r\n\r\ncan help India in its development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which Indian Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nAdvani  pushed very hard when he was in Singapore was  to\r\n\r\nget  Singapore  to help develop tourism  in  India.   The\r\n\r\nwhole  of  India,  with  all its  mountains,  plains  and\r\n\r\nhistorical  sites,  attracts  fewer  than  three  million\r\n\r\ntourists a year!  So, there is huge potential.  There  is\r\n\r\na  lot of infrastructure which is required, but this is a\r\n\r\nlong-term  undertaking, which we intend to partner  India\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As China and India recover their historical\r\n\r\npositions  as major economies in the world,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nintegrate our economies in ASEAN so that we are not  left\r\n\r\nbehind.   Both today and yesterday, during the debate  on\r\n\r\nMFA,  many Members are worried for ASEAN, whether we  are\r\n\r\nmoving fast enough and in a determined enough way.   But,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  despite  the Asian financial  crisis  and  the\r\n\r\nglobal  economic downturn, ASEAN has not done too  badly.\r\n\r\nThis  year,  ASEAN  is  likely to  make  major  moves  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen   the  organisation  and  to   ensure   better\r\n\r\nimplementation  of decisions taken.  Our  bilateral  FTAs\r\n\r\nhave  helped to catalyse trade liberalisation  in  ASEAN,\r\n\r\nand  between ASEAN and other regions.  ASEAN is now being\r\n\r\ncourted  by  all the major powers, such as China,  Japan,\r\n\r\nthe  US, EU, Australia and New Zealand.  We are in a good\r\n\r\nposition.  We have no submarines, no ICBMs.  We  threaten\r\n\r\nnobody.   We can be friends with everybody.   I  mean  no\r\n\r\nnuclear  submarines.   We  have conventional  submarines.\r\n\r\nAnd  this is the best position for ASEAN to be in,  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-polar world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November, in China, the leaders of ASEAN signed\r\n\r\na   framework  agreement  to  establish  an   FTA,   with\r\n\r\nprovisions for an early harvest.  This is an agreement of\r\n\r\nhistorical importance which all of us should fully  grasp\r\n\r\nbecause,  when we talk about our portfolio in  China  and\r\n\r\nwhat  we hope to do in China in the future, this FTA will\r\n\r\nchange  the  entire landscape.  By the time it  is  fully\r\n\r\nimplemented  by 2010, it will create by far  the  largest\r\n\r\nFree Trade Area in the world, of two billion people.  Our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  scholars, tourists  and  students  will  be\r\n\r\ntravelling up and down\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  Northeast  Asia down to Southeast  Asia.   It  will\r\n\r\ntransform  East  Asia  not  only  economically  but  also\r\n\r\npolitically and culturally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is prepared, partly out of goodwill, to engage\r\n\r\nthe countries of ASEAN flexibly, to take into account the\r\n\r\nfact that the 10 countries of ASEAN are at very different\r\n\r\nstages  of  economic development, and it has indicated  a\r\n\r\nwillingness to have bilateral Free Trade Agreements  with\r\n\r\nmember  countries within an overall ASEAN framework.   We\r\n\r\nwill certainly consider this for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic links to Indonesia are growing again\r\n\r\nafter the Asian financial crisis.  Last year, we were the\r\n\r\nNo.  1  investor in Indonesia.  Others watch  our  moves,\r\n\r\nbecause  they know that we watch Indonesia very  closely,\r\n\r\nand they take note of our guarded confidence in the long-term  economic prospects of Indonesia.  Mr Wee  Siew  Kim\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  importance  of  seamless  links  between\r\n\r\nBatam,  Bintan  and  Singapore.  In  fact,  I  have  been\r\n\r\nworking  very closely with Indonesian Minister  Ibu  Rini\r\n\r\nSuwandi on the various administrative aspects on customs,\r\n\r\ntrade  facilitation  and so on, and  we  have  made  good\r\n\r\nprogress.   Yes, there are still problems, but  they  are\r\n\r\nbeing solved one by one, and more Singapore companies are\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  the Riaus.  Some of our SMEs have  shifted\r\n\r\noperations there to take advantage of much lower land and\r\n\r\nlabour  cost, which is a persistent problem that we  face\r\n\r\nhere.  For example, Nam Lee, a factory which Ibu Rini and\r\n\r\nI  visited  just  a  couple of months  ago,  manufactures\r\n\r\nwrought iron doors and gates for apartments in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSince then, it has increased its capacity 50%, because it\r\n\r\nhas found Bintan to be very attractive and  makes it very\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Sourcing Initiative under the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which means that some\r\n\r\ncomponents  manufactured there will  count  as  being  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  origin, will be of particular  helpfulness  to\r\n\r\nthe Riaus.  I encourage our SMEs to look at possibilities\r\n\r\nin those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nislands,  because it can help them to reduce  their  land\r\n\r\nand labour cost dramatically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine provinces of Sumatra are also keen to have\r\n\r\ncloser direct economic links with Singapore.  Subject  to\r\n\r\nJakarta's  approval, the Governors  have  invited  me  to\r\n\r\nbring  a delegation of officials and business leaders  to\r\n\r\nmeet  them informally in Padang in a few months' time  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss how we can work more closely together.  There  is\r\n\r\na  natural  synergy  between the two sides  which  should\r\n\r\nbenefit  us.   To  help  our businessmen  to  operate  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia, IE Singapore will be establishing, in the near\r\n\r\nfuture, Network Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo spoke about our relations with\r\n\r\nMalaysia, particularly in tourism cooperation.   We  have\r\n\r\nbeen having hiccups in our relations with Malaysia.   But\r\n\r\ndespite  these  hiccups,  our economic  relations  remain\r\n\r\nstrong, and I work closely with Minister Rafidah on ASEAN\r\n\r\nmatters  and,  when there are practical problems  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  sides, we solve them.  Of course, it  would  be\r\n\r\nmuch  better, and certainly much more reassuring for  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  if  the  political relationship  were  also\r\n\r\nbetter.   We  do promote joint tourism, and  the  tourism\r\n\r\nboards do work closely together.  But, unfortunately, the\r\n\r\nefforts  are sometimes negated by Malaysian media reports\r\n\r\nwhich, from time to time, make it seem as if we are about\r\n\r\nto go to war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Thailand - and I should mention Thailand also\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a core country in ASEAN -  our  economic\r\n\r\nlinks  have been raised to a new level by Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nThaksin  and Prime Minister Goh, and we are now exploring\r\n\r\nnew areas of cooperation with the establishment of an air\r\n\r\nhub  at  Chiangmai,  the import of Thai  foodstuffs,  the\r\n\r\nintegration of our auto-industry sectors, and the  mutual\r\n\r\nrecognition of standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An integrated ASEAN can be a major manufacturing\r\n\r\nbase  in the world for a whole range of goods, and be  an\r\n\r\nalternative manufacturing base to China for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese,  American and European companies, and  this  is\r\n\r\nhow we should position ourselves, because no one wants to\r\n\r\nput all his eggs in the same basket.  Many CEOs have told\r\n\r\nus that Singapore, in alliance with our ASEAN neighbours,\r\n\r\ncan  match China in many areas of manufacturing.  The CEO\r\n\r\nof  Agilent  Technologies, Ned Barnholdt,  said  recently\r\n\r\nthat  he expects Asia, especially Singapore and Penang  - he  has over 3,000 workers in Singapore and over 6,000 in\r\n\r\nPenang  -  to  increase  its share  of  Agilent's  global\r\n\r\nproduction from about 30% to 40% in two years.  So, he is\r\n\r\nplacing his bets on Southeast Asia.  Just a few days ago,\r\n\r\nPasquale  Pistorio, CEO of ST Microelectronics, announced\r\n\r\nplans to invest an additional US$250 million in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  expand  its wafer fab capacity, fully confident  that\r\n\r\nfrom  here he can compete with China.  Of course, we  can\r\n\r\nonly  maintain the share of manufacturing in our  economy\r\n\r\nif  we  keep  on upgrading and improving our  system  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, MTI expected that the disc drive\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore would be hollowed out, and  we  are\r\n\r\nstill expecting that 10 years from now.  But what is  the\r\n\r\nsituation  today?  The situation today is that  we  still\r\n\r\nproduce  about one-third - sometimes higher and sometimes\r\n\r\nlower  -  of total global production of hard disc drives,\r\n\r\nalbeit with a smaller workforce.  How?  By going for high-end  products  and  by  being highly  automated  for  the\r\n\r\ncheaper  lines.   So, when Seagate shut down  its  Penang\r\n\r\nfactory two to three years ago, some bits went to  China,\r\n\r\nthe high-end bits were re-consolidated in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nmust  keep  pushing this, and we have every intention  to\r\n\r\nmaintain manufacturing as a pillar in our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB, IE Singapore and SPRING will continue to\r\n\r\npromote  the cluster approach, and this is one  important\r\n\r\nway  to  address  Mr Wee Siew Kim's point  about  helping\r\n\r\nsmaller companies in the supporting industries.   We  are\r\n\r\nhelping  local  companies  to  form  clusters.   I   know\r\n\r\nsometimes they wish that the Government can give  them  a\r\n\r\nleg-up  by favouring them in tenders.  We cannot do  this\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  against  the WTO Government  Procurement\r\n\r\nAgreement.  In any case, it is not a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  principle because, if you are protected,  you  will\r\n\r\nnever be globally competitive.  But we do help them  form\r\n\r\nclusters, giving them advice, sometimes providing grants,\r\n\r\nand  helping  them  to compete in international  tenders.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  best  way to help our SMEs  in  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sectors, like the biomedical sector, would also\r\n\r\nhelp  us.   Last  year, the sector was a star  performer,\r\n\r\nwith  manufacturing output rising nearly 50%,  to  almost\r\n\r\n$10  billion.  The sector now accounts for about  18%  of\r\n\r\nthe  total manufacturing sector, in terms of value-added,\r\n\r\nwhich is not bad at all. The jobs created are high value,\r\n\r\nwell-paying  jobs and the total number of jobs  increased\r\n\r\nby  about 11% last year.  The biomedical sector will also\r\n\r\nboost  the  standard  of  healthcare  in  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nestablish  Singapore as a premier medical  hub  within  a\r\n\r\nseven-hour flying radius.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low asked how our healthcare industry\r\n\r\ncompares to Thailand and Malaysia.  Our costs are  higher\r\n\r\nbut  we  are  at the high end of the market  because  our\r\n\r\nstandards are higher.  But we must watch our costs and we\r\n\r\nmust make sure that we stay competitive, if necessary, by\r\n\r\nbringing  in more foreign doctors, nurses and technicians\r\n\r\nto  supplement  our own limited supplies.   The  ERC  has\r\n\r\nidentified this area as a promising area of growth.  Will\r\n\r\nit  cause local healthcare cost to go up?  Well, we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  watch for side effects. The Health  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  about this. We have got to make sure  that  in\r\n\r\npromoting  healthcare services, we do  not  inadvertently\r\n\r\ncause unnecessary hardship to Singaporeans.  But the fact\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  an international medical hub will  benefit\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   It  is  like Mayo Clinic  in   Rochester,\r\n\r\nwhich is a small town up, far away, in the middle of  the\r\n\r\nprairies.   The people of Rochester enjoy a  standard  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  unimaginable  in  any  prairie  town.    Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  Mayo  Clinic is there.  And why is  Mayo  Clinic\r\n\r\nthere?  Not because of the patients that they can find in\r\n\r\nRochester  but  because  they  are  a  worldwide  medical\r\n\r\ncentre.  In the same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway,   there   is  no  necessary  contradiction   between\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  an  international  healthcare  centre  and\r\n\r\nSingapore   providing   cost-effective   healthcare   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not neglect traditional sectors like\r\n\r\ntourism,  logistics  and retail, as  Mr  Leong  Horn  Kee\r\n\r\nreminded us.  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua spoke about tourism in the\r\n\r\nhospitality sector. With the rapid growth in  the  middle\r\n\r\nclasses  in Asia, especially in China and India, this  is\r\n\r\nan industry with a lot of potential.  Look at Bali.  Ever\r\n\r\nsince  the  December 12th bombings, it is  now  targeting\r\n\r\nAsian tourists.  Yes, they spend less, but one day,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  spending more.  Throughout the Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis and the global economic downturn, tourist arrivals\r\n\r\nfrom  India  and China grew double digits.  Recently,  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few months, we noticed a sudden surge  in  the\r\n\r\narrivals  from Japan.  When we analysed the  numbers,  we\r\n\r\nfound  out that more Japanese retirees and more  Japanese\r\n\r\nstudents   have  been  travelling  to  Singapore.    Why?\r\n\r\nBecause we are seen to be a safer destination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even though we lack natural wonders - anyway we\r\n\r\nare  a  small city-state - there are many things we  have\r\n\r\nwhich  commend  ourselves to people  from  all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld.   Of  course, we should think of new products,  we\r\n\r\nshould  burnish  existing  products.   In  the  case   of\r\n\r\nSentosa,  there  is  a  quiet  revolution  going  on   to\r\n\r\ncompletely transform the island.  Many things are not yet\r\n\r\nvisible,  but  within 2-3 years, you  will  find  a  very\r\n\r\ndifferent  Sentosa.  There was a time when  we  had  gate\r\n\r\nhours at Sentosa because it was inconvenient for visitors\r\n\r\nthere  to  stay  on  after 10 pm. Now, we  are  marketing\r\n\r\nSentosa  as a 7/24 destination for both Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nforeigners.  Recently, a Hong Kong company, run by Victor\r\n\r\nCha,  put in millions of dollars to upgrade a really top-class  restaurant in the Beaufort and to open a new  spa,\r\n\r\nthe first spa in a tropical setting in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to seize these new opportunities, we have\r\n\r\nrecently reorganised STB to transform it from being  only\r\n\r\na tourism promotion agency into an economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  agency.  Our indicators  will  be   economic\r\n\r\nindicators and not just tourism arrival numbers.  Tourism\r\n\r\nstill  accounts  for about 10% of our economy  and  total\r\n\r\nemployment.   STB has a joint venture with  a  number  of\r\n\r\nhotel   groups   to  establish  an  international   hotel\r\n\r\nmanagement school.  And as part of the effort to  enhance\r\n\r\nour tourism products and infrastructure, STB will set  up\r\n\r\na  $100  million  tourism investment fund  for  strategic\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua is right that we should cater to\r\n\r\ndifferent  segments to make sure that  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nrooms  allocated  for  the  different  segments.   It  is\r\n\r\nimpossible to predict these numbers accurately,  so  what\r\n\r\nwe have done is to allow the market to operate by letting\r\n\r\noff  more  and  more white sites. So we  let  the  market\r\n\r\nadjust to what the real demands are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low wanted to know our attitude towards\r\n\r\nbackpackers.   Well, many of us were backpackers  in  our\r\n\r\nyouth  and  we should encourage our ITE, polytechnic  and\r\n\r\nuniversity graduates to backpack when they graduate,  the\r\n\r\nway  New  Zealander  youths and Israeli  youths  backpack\r\n\r\nafter  they graduate, sometimes for months, in  order  to\r\n\r\nsee  the world and understand the world before they  come\r\n\r\nback  to  work and set up a family.  It is  good  for  us\r\n\r\nbecause it broadens our mentality.  We know that when  we\r\n\r\ntraipse  in  various continents, we form  our  views  and\r\n\r\nthese  attitudes last for a long time.  So, in  the  same\r\n\r\nway,  we should welcome backpackers into our midst, treat\r\n\r\nthem  well.   I will ask STB to look into the details  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the licensees have been properly regulated.   If\r\n\r\nwe want to provide good standards, we should not have sub-standard accommodation.  If we need to have youth hostels\r\n\r\nand  if  we  need to convert HDB blocks, we will  do  so.\r\n\r\nEven though the numbers are not big, it adds something to\r\n\r\nthe local economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs asked how Singapore can maintain its global\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness when our costs are sometimes higher.  Let\r\n\r\nme   mention   two  important  factors.    One   is   our\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  (IP)  infrastructure.   We  offer\r\n\r\nstrong protection of IP,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially  patents,  copyrights  and  trademarks.    And\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  become  a centre  for  the  trading  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  IP  in  the region.   Recently,  a  major\r\n\r\npharmaceutical company told EDB that it is expanding  its\r\n\r\noperations  in Singapore and scaling down its  operations\r\n\r\nin   other   locations  because  of  our  protection   of\r\n\r\nintellectual property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited Olivia Lum at her factory a few\r\n\r\nmonths ago, she explained to me the elaborate precautions\r\n\r\nshe  takes to ensure that her most important intellectual\r\n\r\nproperties  (IP)  are in Singapore,  and  not  elsewhere,\r\n\r\nbecause  elsewhere, they may be stolen.  This  is  a  key\r\n\r\nadvantage  that  we  have, and is an  advantage  that  we\r\n\r\ninherited from the institutions bequeathed to us  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish  -  legal  standards,  accounting  standards,   a\r\n\r\njudicial system that enforces contracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look into the future, a lot of the value of\r\n\r\nassets  in the world will not be in the physical reality,\r\n\r\nbut  will  be  in  the coding and in  the  ideas.  Today,\r\n\r\nbetween  ASEAN  and the US, 1%, by weight  of  the  total\r\n\r\ntrade is carried by aeroplanes. But that 1% makes up  60%\r\n\r\nof the value of the trade.  In other words, by sea, it is\r\n\r\n40%.   More  and  more in the future, the global  economy\r\n\r\nwill  weigh less and less.  For America now, hundreds  of\r\n\r\nbillions  of  dollars are carried electronically  and  in\r\n\r\nhuman brains, and this is our future too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both manufacturing and services to become more\r\n\r\ninnovation- and knowledge-driven, we must make sure  that\r\n\r\nideas   and   IPs  are  protected  and  that  there   are\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  these  ideas  and  properties  to  be\r\n\r\ncommercialised in Singapore.  Our comprehensive  approach\r\n\r\nto  IP protection is thus a major strength.  If we do all\r\n\r\nthat  we have set out to do under the ERC, we will be  an\r\n\r\nentrepot  for  ideas and intellectual  properties.   This\r\n\r\nwill   generate  good  jobs  for  Singaporeans  and   add\r\n\r\nsubstantial value to our economy.  We must make sure that\r\n\r\nwe  educate our young in the schools about the importance\r\n\r\nof   intellectual  property,  to  safeguard  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty, not to resort to piracy, and the attitudes that\r\n\r\nwe  have  towards  physical property,  we  must  transfer\r\n\r\ntowards intellectual property.  Yes, it may cost them a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbit more money to buy the original software and DVDs, but\r\n\r\nit makes a big difference to the future of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cosmopolitan culture is also another crucial\r\n\r\ncompetitive  advantage and which will set us  apart  from\r\n\r\nother cities in Asia.  Without so many foreigners helping\r\n\r\nus, many of them helping us because they like us, we will\r\n\r\nnot have the economy that we have today.  What we want to\r\n\r\ndo, and this has a bearing on the concerns raised by many\r\n\r\nMPs  about  the  mindsets  of Singaporeans,  is  we  want\r\n\r\nSingapore  to be a home away from home for the  Japanese,\r\n\r\nAmericans,  Europeans, Chinese, Indians and  Australians.\r\n\r\nSo  when  they  come here, they find  a  people  who  are\r\n\r\nwelcoming,   welcoming   of  them   as   co-workers,   as\r\n\r\nbackpackers  and tourists and, maybe sometimes,  even  as\r\n\r\nsons-in-law and daughters-in-law.  And because they  feel\r\n\r\nwelcomed here, they want to use Singapore as their hub of\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Dr Tony Tan chaired EDB's International\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Panel and some members told him that  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  that  we have done  was  to  build  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade because it represents an icon of what we  stand\r\n\r\nfor.   We did not build the Esplanade just for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe  built  it  as a regional facility and is a  statement\r\n\r\nabout what we consider to be important.  If we want to be\r\n\r\na  brain  centre, a centre for talent, then the Esplanade\r\n\r\nexpresses  in  a very attractive way what  our  attitudes\r\n\r\nare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, MTI reorganised every one of\r\n\r\nits  statutory boards, including changing some  of  their\r\n\r\nnames   in   order   to  achieve  this  fundamental   re-orientation.  Where it is cost-effective, we will set  up\r\n\r\noverseas  offices to help our businessmen  all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld.  I assure Miss Penny Low that we recruit officers,\r\n\r\nnot  only  for their IQ, but also for their  EQ  and  for\r\n\r\ntheir culture and language skills.  I also assure Dr John\r\n\r\nChen  that our statutory boards know that a crucial  part\r\n\r\nof   their   mission  is  to  help  Singapore   companies\r\n\r\nglobalise.  Of course, some of our officers are still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung  and  lacking  in  experience,  but  they  are   an\r\n\r\nenthusiastic bunch and they are learning fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua reminded me that I owed her an\r\n\r\nanswer  on  reporting of GNP. We do  report  GNP  numbers\r\n\r\nannually.   We  have  considered  reporting   them   more\r\n\r\nregularly,  say, at quarterly intervals, but this  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  done in a practical way because these GNP numbers are\r\n\r\nnot  as  easy to collect as GDP numbers.  And because  of\r\n\r\nthe  time  lag,  they  are not very accurate  quarter  by\r\n\r\nquarter.   In order not to convey a wrong impression,  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided to confine the reporting of GNP numbers  on\r\n\r\nan  annual  basis.  Just for the information of  Members,\r\n\r\nthe  statisticians now refer to it as GNI, and  not  GNP,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  income  concept  captures  the  idea   more\r\n\r\naccurately than the product concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked how Singapore would compare\r\n\r\nwith Shanghai and Hong Kong in the coming years.  As  all\r\n\r\nof  us who visit Shanghai regularly would note, it is  on\r\n\r\nits  way to becoming the greatest city in Asia, which was\r\n\r\nits  position  before the Pacific War.  It  will  recover\r\n\r\nthat  position, and I have no doubts in my mind  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  become  the  New  York of  China,  because  of  the\r\n\r\neventual  size of the Chinese economy.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nHong Kong, if you read the speech by Chief Executive C  H\r\n\r\nTung  recently, he sees Hong Kong's future in  the  Pearl\r\n\r\nRiver  Delta,  which already accounts  for  some  40%  of\r\n\r\nChina's  total  exports, and they talked about  a  bridge\r\n\r\nlinking Hong Kong to Zhuhai and Macau.  So I believe that\r\n\r\nwill be Hong Kong's position.  Yes, as Mr Leong Horn  Kee\r\n\r\ntold us, they face difficulties now, but the Hong Kongers\r\n\r\nare  a  tough  people and, one way or another,  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing   to   bounce  up  again  and  benefit   from   the\r\n\r\ndevelopments in China.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of Singapore? I believe Singapore would become\r\n\r\nthe  London of Asia.  In other words, our hinterland will\r\n\r\nbe  a multi-national hinterland.  We serve a diversity of\r\n\r\ncultures  and markets.  We will be a centre  for  talent,\r\n\r\nfor ideas, for IT\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement.   We  will  be  the  healthcare  centre   and\r\n\r\neducation  centre,  centre for  R&D,  a  centre  for  the\r\n\r\ncreative  services.  Low taxes, a facilitating regulatory\r\n\r\nenvironment, use of the English language, a multi-lingual\r\n\r\nfacility,  and,  most importantly, citizens  who  operate\r\n\r\nmulti-channels  in their brains and in their  hearts,  so\r\n\r\nthat  anybody who comes here finds himself not  far  away\r\n\r\nfrom home.  I believe if we put our minds and efforts  to\r\n\r\nit,  this will be a position which is ours for the taking\r\n\r\nin the coming years and decades - Singapore as the London\r\n\r\nof  an  Asia, which for the next 20-30 years will be  the\r\n\r\nmost  dynamic region in the entire world.   Many  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs in that Singapore will be Singaporeans, and\r\n\r\nmany  more  will  be  foreigners who  have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that we are the best place to be in in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify a story in yesterday's Straits Times\r\n\r\nreporting  that Government contributed little or  nothing\r\n\r\nto  the  initial success of local entrepreneurs like  Ron\r\n\r\nSim  and  Kenny Yap.  We have to be realistic.   EDB,  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  SPRING cannot be handing  out  taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney freely to anyone who asks.  There are 100,000  SMEs\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  So, even though we try very hard to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number of forms, we will still need forms, and there\r\n\r\nmust  still be criteria.  Of course, we will try to  make\r\n\r\nour  criteria as objective as possible and, where  it  is\r\n\r\npossible, we will try to use a market test.  But, in  the\r\n\r\nend   we  have  to  concentrate  our  efforts.   We  have\r\n\r\nfacilities  for companies in different stages  of  growth\r\n\r\nand  I will be the first to admit that, in deciding which\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  help,  we  do not  always  get  it  right.\r\n\r\nSometimes  we  get  it wrong.  But it is  right  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  help  Osim and Qian Hu when they  show  signs  of\r\n\r\ntaking  off.   For companies like Tee Yih Jia  and  Tiger\r\n\r\nBeer,  they  have no difficulties getting help  from  our\r\n\r\neconomic agencies because they are well-known brands.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we want as many Singaporean brands as  possible,\r\n\r\nand  where  we  can help companies achieve  international\r\n\r\nbranding, we do so.  But, you all know it is not easy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a comment that EDB favours MNCs. Let me\r\n\r\nclarify this.  Although EDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  encourage technology start-ups as part of T21,  EDB\r\n\r\nhas  to concentrate on the big accounts, because the  big\r\n\r\naccounts   matter   a  lot  to  us.   Without   the   big\r\n\r\ninvestments,  the  pharmaceutical  companies,  the  wafer\r\n\r\nfabs,  the petrochemical complexes, we will have  a  much\r\n\r\npoorer  economy, and there will be much less feeding  for\r\n\r\nSMEs.   If  EDB had not worked its guts out to  bring  in\r\n\r\nTexas  Instruments, Matsushita, HP, many  years  ago,  we\r\n\r\nwould  not have today's economy, and we will not be  here\r\n\r\ntoday to talk about our hopes for the future.  And it was\r\n\r\nright that they had someone posted to Apple to make  sure\r\n\r\nApple was happy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public sector can do many things. But, in\r\n\r\nthe  end, what we do is what a gardener does.  We  water,\r\n\r\nwe  fertilise,  we  weed.  The key is  having  the  right\r\n\r\nseeds.   If  we  have the right seeds,  local  seeds  and\r\n\r\nimported  varieties,  beautiful  things  will   grow   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and there will be a bountiful harvest  for  all\r\n\r\nof  us.  But without good seeds, no amount of watering or\r\n\r\nfertilising  will  help.  And,  in  that  sense,  we  are\r\n\r\nreinventing  what  Raffles did  in  1819.   He  turned  a\r\n\r\nfishing   village  into  a  bustling  entrepot  by   good\r\n\r\nadministration, protecting property, enforcing  contracts\r\n\r\nand opening the doors to traders from all over the world.\r\n\r\nAnd they came, and it grew and it grew.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do the same for the digital economy, and\r\n\r\nthis will give every Singaporean his place in the sun and\r\n\r\nhundreds of thousands outside will want to come  in.   We\r\n\r\nare getting there, despite the current downturn.  EDB  is\r\n\r\nsucceeding in making Singapore a Global Entropolis.  Many\r\n\r\ncountries   have   already  established   centres   here,\r\n\r\nincluding  Germany, Japan, China, India,  Australia,  New\r\n\r\nZealand,  Israel, Chile, Norway and Korea, and many  more\r\n\r\nare  considering Singapore.  Their SMEs and start-ups are\r\n\r\nhere  to  exploit opportunities and to make  use  of  the\r\n\r\npresence  of the 6,000 multi-nationals which are  already\r\n\r\nhere.   We  hope many of them will link up with  our  own\r\n\r\nlocal SMEs and that creative sparks will fly and make the\r\n\r\nwhole sector much more diverse and interesting.  We have,\r\n\r\nas  a  matter  of policy, decided that for  our  overseas\r\n\r\ndelegations,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe will bring foreign companies based in Singapore along,\r\n\r\nso that when they are together with Singapore businessmen\r\n\r\nin  the  coaches, in the hotels, they talk to each other,\r\n\r\nexchange ideas and maybe things will happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective in doing all these is not to depress\r\n\r\nvalue  in Singapore, which is Mr Leong Horn Kee's  worry.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to increase value so that our assets are\r\n\r\nworth  more,  so  that just being a Singaporean  commands\r\n\r\neach of us a premium in the global market place, and  all\r\n\r\nthis is because of what we are and what we stand for.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The  ERC  Report\r\n\r\nalso seems to suggest that our cost of doing business  is\r\n\r\nhigh.  However, we have also heard contrary opinion  that\r\n\r\nbusiness cost is manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the anecdotal evidence, have the various\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies gathered more facts and  information\r\n\r\nregarding  this matter?  Have we conducted  an  objective\r\n\r\nbenchmarking  exercise  to  compare  the  cost  of  land,\r\n\r\nutilities,   Government  fees,  etc,  against   competing\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should conduct such exercises at regular\r\n\r\nintervals, say, every three years, to check our  business\r\n\r\ncost  structure.   The study should also  normalise  such\r\n\r\ncosts to take into account our higher productivity.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we can check what and how much are the  various\r\n\r\ncost  components to produce, say, one disk-drive  or  one\r\n\r\nmobile  phone. If the land cost component  is  too  high,\r\n\r\nthen  we can take steps to reduce it.  Likewise,  if  the\r\n\r\nutility costs are too high, we can also reduce them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land and factory cost, the Government policy has\r\n\r\nalways  been  to charge local market price.  My  question\r\n\r\nis:  as  the largest land and factory supplier, how  does\r\n\r\nthe  Government determine what the market price  is?  Not\r\n\r\nlong  ago,  a  company told me that  it  had  rejected  a\r\n\r\nfactory  offer  by  JTC because of its price  and  bought\r\n\r\nanother factory from the market several months later at a\r\n\r\nsubstantially lower price.  In an economic downturn  such\r\n\r\nas  the present one, there are JTC and HDB factories that\r\n\r\nare empty.  How does the Government then determine market\r\n\r\nrent  for  these and other factories that are unoccupied?\r\n\r\nIs  downward  adjustment  of  market  rent  for  existing\r\n\r\nlessees fast enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to note is that JTC land is often\r\n\r\nleased  with  strings attached.  These conditions  placed\r\n\r\nupon  the lease, such as subjecting transfer of lease  to\r\n\r\nJTC's  approval,  make  it  less  attractive  as  a  loan\r\n\r\ncollateral due to the inflexibility imposed.   This  adds\r\n\r\nto the lessee's financing cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me also address one more point on\r\n\r\nGovernment fees.  I understand that most fees are decided\r\n\r\nbased  on  a  cost  recovery basis.  DPM  has  said  that\r\n\r\notherwise,  the taxpayer will have to pay more  tax.   My\r\n\r\nquestion  is: are the costs calculated based on the  most\r\n\r\nefficient operations model?  How often does the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  review  the work involved  in  processing  an\r\n\r\napplication and ensure that it is the most efficient?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add: do the calculations take into\r\n\r\naccount   the  additional  taxes  collected  when   these\r\n\r\napproved businesses become successful in later years?   I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest that the Government take a business\r\n\r\nchance.  Show by example the meaning of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nLower these fees to encourage more business applications.\r\n\r\nSet them at a level to discourage frivolous applications,\r\n\r\nnot  more than that.  My argument is that in a few years'\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Government will be more than compensated  for\r\n\r\nits  own  entrepreneurial  spirit  of  lowering  fees  by\r\n\r\ncollecting  a  larger  tax revenue  from  the  additional\r\n\r\nbusinesses that would be set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister respond to my views?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since the 1997 financial\r\n\r\ncrisis, the immediate action of the Government was to cut\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of business.  The first to be cut was workers'\r\n\r\nCPF  and wages.  The question mark hanging in my mind is:\r\n\r\nwho is the culprit for the high cost of business?  Is  it\r\n\r\nGovernment charges or high wages of workers, or both?   I\r\n\r\nlook  to the ERC Report for guidance.  Chapter 2  of  the\r\n\r\nReport on lower costs and staying competitive, which runs\r\n\r\nto seven pages out of a total of 199 pages of the Report,\r\n\r\ndid  not provide any clue to my question.  Chapter  7  on\r\n\r\nWages   and   the   CPF,   under  the   sub-title   \"Wage\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness\",  it  is  stated  that  \"our  wages  are\r\n\r\nalready  much  higher than many countries.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nwe  are  still  competitive because our  productivity  is\r\n\r\nhigher too, so adjusted for productivity our labour costs\r\n\r\nare not excessive.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also read The IFER Report: Restructuring of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Economy published by the Institute  of  Policy\r\n\r\nStudies   (IPS).   After  making  some  comparisons,   it\r\n\r\nconcluded  that \"labour costs in Singapore  are  not  too\r\n\r\nhigh in relative terms.\"  So, I am puzzled.  Since labour\r\n\r\ncost  does not seem to be a problem, then why is workers'\r\n\r\nCPF not restored?  I hope the Minister can enlighten me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the IFER Report also pointed out the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Government artificially jacks up land\r\n\r\nprices resulting in high cost of business.  Examples  are\r\n\r\nthe   tender  system  and  reserve  price;  JTC's   lease\r\n\r\nagreement for industrial land rental is subject to upward\r\n\r\nrevision   every  year;  Government  grants  to   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  and concessionary rates given to  large  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  help to support the demand for  factories  and\r\n\r\nland at high prices and high rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The foreign worker levy does not serve the\r\n\r\nobjective of providing more jobs for Singaporeans who  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  take up the jobs anyway, but  resulted  in\r\n\r\nhigher cost for employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The policy goal of asset enhancement led to\r\n\r\nhigher labour cost and other distortions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Excessive charges of Government departments. It\r\n\r\ngives  examples  like  the Maritime  and  Port  Authority\r\n\r\ncharges  $2,500 for a boat ride by a company's  staff  to\r\n\r\ninspect  a minor oil spill incident.  URA charges  $1,200\r\n\r\nper  application  submission.   And  the  Singapore  Land\r\n\r\nAuthority sells plans by sets instead of allowing  single\r\n\r\nplans  to  be purchased.  Other examples are: PSA  making\r\n\r\nmore  money  per container than shipowners; and  a  prime\r\n\r\nmover  costing $35,000 in Malaysia can cost  as  much  as\r\n\r\n$120,000 in Singapore because of COE and ARF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I have time to list out all that\r\n\r\nis  in  the  report,  but I hope that the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nrespond  to  the  above and the analysis  of  the  report\r\n\r\nwhich, among other issues and suggestions, also concluded\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  should try to contain  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncosts, especially in relation to land, labour, regulation\r\n\r\nand  transportation, where business  costs  are  inflated\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  by  policies which are outdated  or  which\r\n\r\nhave unintended consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng Chee How, you can take both\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, a proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  factor  productivity  is  crucial   to\r\n\r\nsustaining competitiveness and real wage growth.  Nominal\r\n\r\nwages  in  a  country  like China  can  be  very  low  by\r\n\r\ninternational comparison, and this has contributed to the\r\n\r\nview that China is able to take away investments and jobs\r\n\r\nfrom  other locations around the world, because of  their\r\n\r\nlow   cost   including  low  nominal  wages.   A   closer\r\n\r\nexamination will, however, reveal that it is not the  low\r\n\r\nnominal  wages  alone that matter, but  the  unit  labour\r\n\r\ncost, ie, labour productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If China's labour productivity, taking into account\r\n\r\nits  wage  levels, places it increasingly ahead of  other\r\n\r\ncountries,   then  that  will  be  the  source   of   its\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   So too for all other  countries.   Put\r\n\r\nanother way, countries with higher wage levels than those\r\n\r\nof,  say,  China  must  fight  on  the  basis  of  higher\r\n\r\nproductivity and lower unit labour cost, rather than  try\r\n\r\nto  compete  with  the likes of China  on  lower  nominal\r\n\r\nwages.   And  unless  they do so, they  will  risk  being\r\n\r\novertaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, prosperity, ultimately, is underpinned by\r\n\r\nproductivity. And unless Singapore's productivity matches\r\n\r\nthat  of developed nations and maintains a gap with those\r\n\r\nof  developing countries, then we cannot sustain the high\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living.   The  importance  of  continuously\r\n\r\npushing  productivity  growth therefore  cannot  be  over\r\n\r\nemphasised.   I  therefore urge MTI to continue  to  give\r\n\r\nemphasis  to  this area of productivity   -   to  promote\r\n\r\nproductivity    and   implementation   of    productivity\r\n\r\nenhancement amongst companies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to my other cut on industrial land policy, I\r\n\r\nhave  already spoken about it in the main debate.  So,  I\r\n\r\ndo not want to speak on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, when we were\r\n\r\npromoting  industrialisation  in  the  1970s,   the   JTC\r\n\r\nsucceeded in developing a very large  and typically Asian\r\n\r\nindustrial estate. It attracted not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  foreign  investors but also local SMEs  to  set  up\r\n\r\nfactories there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the lease granted by JTC was for a\r\n\r\ntenure  of  30  years  which  would  be  expiring   soon.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  JTC's  policy,  if  the  lease  is  to  be\r\n\r\nextended,  it would run for another period of  30  years,\r\n\r\nwhich means the existing lessees would have to put  in  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  capital investment to extend it.   In these  bad\r\n\r\ntimes  and  the  prospects of the next  few  years  being\r\n\r\nuncertain, the local SMEs operating in the JTC industrial\r\n\r\nestate  are in a dilemma. To extend the lease means  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  have  to pour in lots of money  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncapital  investment. Not to extend means they would  have\r\n\r\nto  fold  up.  I  hope that the JTC would  exercise  some\r\n\r\nflexibility in dealing with the matter. Must the lease be\r\n\r\nnecessarily  extended  by  another  30  years?   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  not consider  giving them a shorter  lease  of,\r\n\r\nsay,  five  years,  without  any  commitment  of  further\r\n\r\ninvestments, so that they will be able to tide  over  the\r\n\r\npresent  difficult time?  If JTC persists in its original\r\n\r\npolicy  of requiring fresh investment as a condition  for\r\n\r\nthe  mandatory 30 years' extension, then many of the SMEs\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  able  to  carry on  with  their  business.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  a lot of employees will lose  their  jobs,\r\n\r\nand  the  performance of the entire manufacturing  sector\r\n\r\nwill also be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, according to the terms of the lease,\r\n\r\nthere  would  be a 5% increase in the rent  annually,  in\r\n\r\ngood  and bad times.  It will be increased automatically.\r\n\r\nAt  this difficult time, I think we should review whether\r\n\r\nthere should be this annual 5% rent increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, I speak in support\r\n\r\nof  raising the service standards of the retail sector in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  state of the retail industry  has  been\r\n\r\nmuch   lamented  during  this  economic  downturn.    The\r\n\r\nretailing industry is an important one for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail sector contributed $5.2 billion to GDP in\r\n\r\nthe  fourth quarter of 2002, and employs close to  75,000\r\n\r\nworkers,  between 3-4% of our workforce.  Most  retailers\r\n\r\nattribute the drop in consumer spending\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  economic downturn.  This would  not  be  totally\r\n\r\nuntrue  seeing how Singaporeans have been cast under  the\r\n\r\ngloom and doom of sustained economic hardship, structural\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  the possibility of  war.   However,  I\r\n\r\npropose that we take a closer look at the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the economic downturn that had\r\n\r\ncontributed  to lower consumer spending, I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  service standards in the retail industry are equally\r\n\r\nto  blame.  As it stands, overall value added per  worker\r\n\r\nin  the retail trade sector is about $30,000.  This is  a\r\n\r\nthird of the manufacturing sector.  A survey conducted by\r\n\r\nSPRING   Singapore  has  revealed  that  60%  of  service\r\n\r\ncompanies  do  not have clear work performance  standards\r\n\r\nand  procedures  in place.  In fact, most companies  only\r\n\r\nhave  broad guidelines, resulting in different  standards\r\n\r\nof service across the industry.  Retail workers are often\r\n\r\nleft  to  their own devices.  The situation is no  better\r\n\r\nfor retailers in the HDB heartlands.\r\n\r\nI  commend  the Minister's decision to push  through  the\r\n\r\nformation of the Retail Academy of Singapore.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  need to retrain our retail workers as  fast  as\r\n\r\npossible.  We cannot afford to leave service standards as\r\n\r\nthey are.  Otherwise, consumers here will shop elsewhere,\r\n\r\nlike   Malaysia,  Thailand  and  other  popular   holiday\r\n\r\ndestinations.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore consumers are becoming increasingly\r\n\r\nsophisticated.  They are becoming more and more demanding\r\n\r\nand  discerning,  whether in terms of  service,  quality,\r\n\r\nconvenience and variety.  I myself have been astounded by\r\n\r\nthe  poor  service quality demonstrated  by  some  retail\r\n\r\nworkers  here.   There  is  very little  customer-centric\r\n\r\nmentality  among  our sales people,  a  lack  of  product\r\n\r\nknowledge  and a correspondingly poor service  level.   I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt that leaving things as they  are  in  the\r\n\r\nretail  industry will mark the beginning of the  end  for\r\n\r\nretailers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Retail Academy of Singapore will add\r\n\r\nvalue  on  top of the national skills recognition  system\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretail  industry.   I hope that it will increase  service\r\n\r\nstandards and provide the blueprint for hands-on training\r\n\r\non   the  job.   Combined  with  the  various  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes,  ranging  from the Retail  Essential  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme  and  the Franchise 21 Assistance Scheme,  we  are\r\n\r\nmoving  in  the  right  direction to professionalise  and\r\n\r\nrevitalise the retail industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise, however, that no amount\r\n\r\nof  training  would do when it comes to service,  if  the\r\n\r\nservice  provider has a bad service attitude.  A waitress\r\n\r\nwho scores five A1s in subjects of table setting, service\r\n\r\ntechniques,  order taking, familiarity of  the  menu  and\r\n\r\nhygiene,  but  puts  on  a long face,  and  comes  across\r\n\r\ngrouchy  will do no service to the restaurant.  It  would\r\n\r\nthen  be ludicrous and, indeed, laughable to have offered\r\n\r\na  course titled \"When to Smile\" or a course titled  \"How\r\n\r\nto Seem Friendly\" to address this deficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to relate ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do not have much time to relate.\r\n\r\nYou only have got a few seconds more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> I will move forward.

Just as our Minister  for  Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry has mentioned, there must be a  fundamental\r\n\r\nreorientation  in  the service attitudes  of  our  retail\r\n\r\nworkforce.  I hope the Retail Academy will fulfil this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  consumers  are expected  to  exercise  caveat\r\n\r\nemptor  when purchasing goods or procuring services.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  there  is  no  one  single all-embracing  Consumer\r\n\r\nProtection  Act  in Singapore to protect  consumers  from\r\n\r\nunfair   and   unscrupulous  practices   of   businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever,  based  on the thousands of consumer  complaints\r\n\r\nreceived by CASE, Singapore Tourism Board and the  media,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  that we need a Consumer Protection  Act  to\r\n\r\nprotect some consumers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, three groups of consumers are vulnerable to\r\n\r\nunfair  and unscrupulous business practices, namely,  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  the  illiterate and young  children.   We  have\r\n\r\nheard  of  many  hard selling door-to-door salesmen,  who\r\n\r\nhave  conned many elderly and housewives.  This is  still\r\n\r\nprevalent  in Singapore today.  In fact, I have  received\r\n\r\nfeedback from my grassroots leaders that some people even\r\n\r\nposed  as  \"God  of Fortune\" to do house-to-house  visits\r\n\r\nduring  Chinese  New Year to demand  ang  pows  from  our\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarifications from the Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerning  the proposed Consumer Protection  Act.   One,\r\n\r\nhow can the Act protect the elderly, illiterate and young\r\n\r\nconsumers?   Two, how can the Act be enforced  without  a\r\n\r\nFair Trading Office?  And, three, will the Act cover  all\r\n\r\nindustries?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the introduction\r\n\r\nof  the  Fair Trading Act is a major step for consumerism\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.   Principally,  we  want   to   introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  protect consumers,  but  without  adding\r\n\r\nonerous burden to businesses and costs.  We are confident\r\n\r\nthat  we  can find a balance between consumer  protection\r\n\r\nand business concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the proposed scope of legislation was\r\n\r\npublished,  CASE  has noticed a new tactic  by  timeshare\r\n\r\ncompanies, for example, trying to beat the proposed  law.\r\n\r\nI  hope to see the Act enacted as soon as possible as the\r\n\r\nlonger we wait the more of such cases we may see.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the MAS started industry\r\n\r\nconsultations on a proposed extension of the scope of the\r\n\r\nAct  to  include  all financial services regulated.   The\r\n\r\nconsumers  welcome this move.  I would like to  know  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's   assessment   on  how   soon   the   industry\r\n\r\nconsultations with the financial sector can be completed,\r\n\r\nand  when  we  can  expect to see the  Fair  Trading  Act\r\n\r\nbecoming a reality in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise two related points on the\r\n\r\nFair Trading Act.  First, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$20,000 limit.  The proposed Fair Trading Act defines the\r\n\r\n$20,000  limit  on the value of the goods  and  services.\r\n\r\nCASE  has  studied  this  and feels  that  if  a  cap  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  the  limit  should  be  on  the  compensatory\r\n\r\namount,  instead  of  on  the  value  of  the  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices.   Second, the infrastructure  support  for  the\r\n\r\nFair Trading Act.  We understand that there are those who\r\n\r\nfeel that there is a need to set up a Fair Trading Office\r\n\r\nto  police  the Act.  While CASE agrees that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary at this stage to set up a Fair Trading  Office,\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  should  give  the  assurance  that  basic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  support will be  put  in  place  to  help\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be, in the first instance, the contact\r\n\r\npoint of some sort, for example, a call centre that  will\r\n\r\nfilter  out complaints.  In Australia, the percentage  of\r\n\r\nphone calls that are resolved without being turned into a\r\n\r\nwritten  complaint  comes up to  about  95%.   After  the\r\n\r\nwritten  complaint stage, some form of  conciliation  and\r\n\r\nnegotiation  should also be put in place.   Most  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  would  turn up for mediation.  In Australia,  the\r\n\r\nrate of resolution at this stage is more than 50%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary to have mediation centres and\r\n\r\ncall  centre as a contact point.  The percentage of cases\r\n\r\nthat  eventually  end up in the formal legal  process  is\r\n\r\ntherefore very small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic infrastructure, another key\r\n\r\npart  of  the  fair  trading  regime  is  education,  ie,\r\n\r\neducation for consumers and traders.  A website  is  also\r\n\r\nessential for both information dissemination, as well  as\r\n\r\ngathering of complaints.  I hope MTI will give support in\r\n\r\nsuch  an educational drive initiated by CASE or any other\r\n\r\nbusiness  organisations.  Some form of  publicity  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  done to inform traders of unacceptable conduct.\r\n\r\nOur  media can play an essential and significant role  as\r\n\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to go on to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Review of the Hire Purchase Act.\r\n\r\nCurrently,   car  loan  providers  apply  a  mathematical\r\n\r\nformula\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalled  the  'Rule of 78' to most car loans.   While  the\r\n\r\nname  seems  harmless, it actually hurts  car  buyers  by\r\n\r\npenalising those who pay off their loans early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hire Purchase Act covers car purchases where the\r\n\r\nprice  of a car is under $55,000, excluding the price  of\r\n\r\nCOE.  Under the Act, car financiers apply the Rule of  78\r\n\r\nand  stack a disproportionate amount of interest into the\r\n\r\nearly  period  of the loan.  The situation is  even  more\r\n\r\nonerous  for those cars priced above $55,000,  where  the\r\n\r\ncar  loans  are governed by common contractual  law.   If\r\n\r\nthey  pay  off their loans early, they get  back  only  a\r\n\r\nproportion  of the interest rebate.  Indeed,  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  concluded that the rule was so  onerous  for  the\r\n\r\nconsumers that they have already outlawed using this rule\r\n\r\nfor  loans  which are longer than 61 months.  Britain  is\r\n\r\nalso reviewing the practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to do likewise here. At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the Hire Purchase Act should be updated  with\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  the car value which the Act  covers,  to\r\n\r\nwiden  the requirement for full rebate, or better  still,\r\n\r\nmake the Act to cover all car loans.  The US practice for\r\n\r\ncar  loans can also be studied and implemented here.   In\r\n\r\nthe  US, car loans are transparent because details of the\r\n\r\nhire purchase agreements are readily available in all the\r\n\r\nbanks' websites.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I like to echo the point that\r\n\r\nmy  colleague,  Mr  Yeo Guat Kwang,  has  brought  up  on\r\n\r\nreviewing the Rule of 78 which is commonly applied to car\r\n\r\nloans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22nd January 2003, MAS liberalised its 1995 car\r\n\r\nloan guidelines to enable 100% financing for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  a  car  and  repayments can be spread over  a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time.  This created an euphoria  in  the  car\r\n\r\nmarket, much to the delight of car dealers and financiers\r\n\r\nalike.  Recent articles in the Straits Times confirmed my\r\n\r\nsuspicion  that  many car buyers are  not  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nimplications  of the 'Rule of 78'.  And I  like  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to further expand on  the  workings  of\r\n\r\nthis rule, which Mr Yeo\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rule 78 applies the moment a borrower signs the\r\n\r\nloan  agreement.  Be it a floating rate, or a fixed rate,\r\n\r\nhe  or she will be legally obliged to pay back all of the\r\n\r\nprincipal and all of the interests that will accrue  over\r\n\r\nthe term of the loan.  If the borrower redeems his or her\r\n\r\nloan before expiry, the lender would \"generously\" forgive\r\n\r\nsome of the future accruable interest payments.  This  is\r\n\r\ndespite  the  fact that, at the time of  redemption,  the\r\n\r\ninterest payable for the future has yet to be accrued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Rule 78 has a pernicious effect on\r\n\r\nborrowers  by  way  of  hidden prepayment  penalty.   The\r\n\r\nborrower's  disadvantage is heightened by the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  banks  and  finance companies often  refer  to  this\r\n\r\npractice or the application of Rule 78 as a rebate of the\r\n\r\nfinance charge.  To a layman, this can be misleading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, without getting too technical, early\r\n\r\nredemption  of  a loan at different times  for  different\r\n\r\nmaturities  and  different interest  rates  will  produce\r\n\r\ndifferent penalty sizes.  The rule of thumb is  that  the\r\n\r\nhigher  the interest rate, the greater the penalty amount\r\n\r\nand  the earlier the prepayment in relation to the  term,\r\n\r\nthe  greater the penalty amounts.  This is highly  unfair\r\n\r\nto  the  customer  and encourages indebtedness  which  is\r\n\r\ncontrary towards what we want to advocate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain states, as Mr Yeo has said, in the US and\r\n\r\nEurope, have already outlawed the application of Rule  78\r\n\r\nif  the loan is for more than five years, or for a  given\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time.   Could  the Minister  comment  on  the\r\n\r\ncurrent practice and whether a review of this rule can be\r\n\r\nexpected, and whether the loan deal could be stated  more\r\n\r\nclearly and fairly to the consumers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, there are two pieces of\r\n\r\nlegislation  that CASE has been advocating.   First,  the\r\n\r\nFair  Trading  Act  to  protect consumers.   Second,  the\r\n\r\ncompetition law to level the playing field for all.   The\r\n\r\nFair Trading Act is making good progress and if we should\r\n\r\nsee the law enacted this year, it is no surprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition  law is something that I hope to see  enacted\r\n\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition law will protect small firms from unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition  by  big  firms.  It also  ensures  that  all\r\n\r\nplayers  will have an equal and fair chance.  Competition\r\n\r\nlaw  will also benefit consumers as well.  If the playing\r\n\r\nfield  is  level, companies will be free to  compete  and\r\n\r\ninnovate,  and  this  will  be  translated  into   better\r\n\r\nproducts and higher quality of services for consumers.

I have no quarrels  with  the\r\n\r\nprinciple,  ie,  one  of ensuring  fair  play  and  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment.  However, I believe that we should be clear of\r\n\r\nthe  desired  outcomes about having such  a  legislation.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the goal?  Is the sustained competitiveness  of\r\n\r\nSingapore the desired outcome?  Or is an ideal  state  of\r\n\r\ncompetition per se the goal?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in pursuit of an ideal state of\r\n\r\ncompetition,   what   are  the   costs   of   introducing\r\n\r\ncompetition?   Sir,  let me cite  a  few  examples.   But\r\n\r\nbefore  that,  allow  me to declare  my  interest  as  an\r\n\r\nemployee  of  Temasek Holdings which is involved  in  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  mentioned.  In mobile telephony,  how  do  we\r\n\r\ndecide that three operators would do just fine?  Why  not\r\n\r\ntwo, or four?  Obviously, the size of our domestic market\r\n\r\nand    the    sources   of   competition   are    crucial\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  Too much zeal in introducing competition\r\n\r\nor  insisting  on a certain level of domestic  originated\r\n\r\ncompetition,  as opposed to ensuring fair  play,  can  be\r\n\r\nvalue destroying of Singapore as an aggregate whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know for a fact that competition does not\r\n\r\noriginate  only  from  Singapore  sources  and  that  the\r\n\r\ntypical  definition  of monopoly, or oligopoly,  may  not\r\n\r\nalways hold.  At some point, we have to ask\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves  if we are unwittingly disadvantaging  our  own\r\n\r\noperators in the name of competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take another example. Competition in print\r\n\r\nand  broadcast media.  Certainly, when one speaks to  the\r\n\r\nconsumers, the conclusion is that the variety  of  choice\r\n\r\nis  welcome.  But I think the jury is still out in  terms\r\n\r\nof  the cost of the introduction of competition.  In this\r\n\r\narena,  thousands of publications by non-domestic sources\r\n\r\ndistributed  through the various channels constitute  the\r\n\r\nreal  competition.   So  it  is  not  really  a  case  of\r\n\r\nMediaCorp Singapore versus Singapore Press Holdings,  but\r\n\r\nwith  the  advent  of  the Internet  and  cable  TV,  the\r\n\r\ncompetition   is  really  out  there,  not  just   within\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I leave the impression that I am against\r\n\r\nhaving  a  Competition Law, I must say  that  it  can  be\r\n\r\nmeaningful for businesses such as those dwelt on earlier,\r\n\r\neg,  bus services.  Competition must, therefore,  be  the\r\n\r\nmeans  to  an  end,  ie,  sustained  competitiveness  for\r\n\r\nSingapore, and not an end unto itself.  In this regard, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister to reiterate the  guiding\r\n\r\nprinciples for drafting the competition law, and  how  he\r\n\r\nproposes  to guard against any overkill situation,  which\r\n\r\nwould be manifested ultimately as cost for doing business\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nseverity  of  the  economic crisis  is  mostly  felt  and\r\n\r\nindicated  through the disconnection of utility supplies.\r\n\r\nThe  situation seems more acute lately, as we  have  seen\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans affected by it.  Certainly, there  are\r\n\r\nthose who are recalcitrant defaulters, but I am referring\r\n\r\nto  the  genuine hardship cases who are often victims  of\r\n\r\ntheir economic circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my understanding is that Singapore Power will\r\n\r\ndisconnect electricity supply first and, if no payment is\r\n\r\nreceived,  water supply is disconnected,  often  about  a\r\n\r\nweek  later.  Depending on the size of the arrears,  they\r\n\r\nwill  then  require  a  substantial  amount  before   the\r\n\r\nutilities are reconnected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate the response from the Minister, ie,\r\n\r\nthese actions are necessary because, basically, Singapore\r\n\r\nPower  is  not a welfare organisation. Sure, I understand\r\n\r\nthat.   It  is a profit-oriented organisation and  should\r\n\r\nmake  profits.   Indeed, it was reported that,  excluding\r\n\r\nfactors  like divestments, Singapore Power's  net  profit\r\n\r\nfor   2001   rose  15%.   While  it  is  not  a   welfare\r\n\r\norganisation, I am sure it can afford to be a caring one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disconnection of these supplies robs the\r\n\r\nindividuals and families of their dignity and self-worth,\r\n\r\nas they are made to feel that they cannot afford even the\r\n\r\nbasic human needs, such as water.  I would like Singapore\r\n\r\nPower to consider the following suggestions for a win-win\r\n\r\nsituation between them and the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, following the assessment and\r\n\r\nrecommendations  by the CDCs or family  service  centres,\r\n\r\nallow  genuine hardship cases to defer payments to  their\r\n\r\narrears, akin to what HDB is doing with those who are not\r\n\r\nable  to  pay  their monthly mortgage  loans.   They  can\r\n\r\nresume  paying  their arrears by instalments  when  their\r\n\r\neconomic situation improves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, allow people to decide and prioritise what\r\n\r\nthey  want  to use.  Most people would choose water  over\r\n\r\nelectricity  in  terms  of  priority.   For  cases  where\r\n\r\nelectricity supplies have been disconnected, I  encourage\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power to accept payments for  usage  of  water\r\n\r\nonly,   thus  preventing  the  water  supply  from  being\r\n\r\ndisconnected.  It will be more affordable and  manageable\r\n\r\nfor  them.   Their electricity supply can be  reconnected\r\n\r\nwhen they feel that they can afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some have commented that these households need\r\n\r\nto  be more responsible and discerning in their usage  of\r\n\r\nutilities.   This is true, and we should encourage  users\r\n\r\nto be more responsible.  In this regard, can we think out\r\n\r\nof the box and consider different possibilities to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  people have greater responsibility to manage  their\r\n\r\nlives?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider the\r\n\r\npossibility of supplying utilities through a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstored-value system.  Stored-value system is  already  in\r\n\r\nuse  in  our  transportation system through  the  ez-link\r\n\r\ncards  and  the  cashcards in paying  ERP  charges.   The\r\n\r\nsystem I am proposing is for the users to store a certain\r\n\r\npre-paid value for both water and electricity.  The meter\r\n\r\nwill show how much supply they have used and how much  is\r\n\r\nleft  for them to use.  The user will then be responsible\r\n\r\nin  deciding on cutting down on his usage, or topping  up\r\n\r\non  the stored value.  In this way, his dignity and self-worth  are  maintained, as he is given the responsibility\r\n\r\nto  manage  his  own  life.  He  is  in  control  of  the\r\n\r\nconnection or disconnection actions.  For the low  income\r\n\r\nand  hardship  families, it is a  way  of  teaching  them\r\n\r\nskills in managing and budgeting their expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such a system is already in operation in some\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  UK  and  the US.  I would  encourage  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to study these systems and implement them  here\r\n\r\nto  overcome future problems of people not being able  to\r\n\r\npay  for  their utilities. Let us ensure that we continue\r\n\r\nto  allow  our people to manage their lives with  dignity\r\n\r\nand self-worth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, several Members have\r\n\r\nrightly  spoken about our cost competitiveness.  This  is\r\n\r\nan important issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective, which all Members will agree on, must\r\n\r\nbe  to  sustain a high income economy.  We want a society\r\n\r\nbrimming  with  affluence and dynamism, leading  and  not\r\n\r\njust following.  This must mean, as Mr Leong Horn Kee has\r\n\r\npointed out, that Singapore ultimately cannot compete  as\r\n\r\na low cost economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must do, however, is to minimise costs where\r\n\r\nthey   are   artificially  propped  up  and   wring   out\r\n\r\ninefficiencies  wherever we find them, in Government,  in\r\n\r\nthe  markets.   We  do  this  by  streamlining  services,\r\n\r\nkeeping   our   markets   open   and   introducing   more\r\n\r\ncompetition,   wherever  feasible,  to   moderate   price\r\n\r\nincreases.   We must also work relentlessly  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity, keep upgrading the skills of the workforce,\r\n\r\nand build deeper pools of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninnovative expertise.  If we succeed in this, the outcome\r\n\r\nwill be higher incomes, higher wages, not lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have referred to the image of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  \"high cost\" and, therefore, uncompetitive.\r\n\r\nIs  this  image, or perception of an image, in sync  with\r\n\r\nthe  facts?   Each Member would, I am sure, have  at  the\r\n\r\nback  of  his  mind, some real examples  of  firms,  even\r\n\r\nindustries,  that  are  no  longer  able  to  compete  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There will be real examples.  But  the  facts\r\n\r\noverall,  for the economy as a whole, provide a different\r\n\r\npicture.   We are a competitive economy.  Our  wages  are\r\n\r\nhigh  but,  on the whole, they are made up for by  higher\r\n\r\nproductivity.   In  BERI's  workforce  study  last  year,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was ranked first internationally, in  Relative\r\n\r\nProductivity.    This   refers  to  productivity-adjusted\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the board, our cost structures have in fact\r\n\r\nadjusted downwards significantly in recent years.  Office\r\n\r\nrentals have fallen by about 38% since 1996, and are  now\r\n\r\ncheaper  than in most competing cities, including  cities\r\n\r\nlike  Seoul and Beijing, never mind cities like Hong Kong\r\n\r\nand  Tokyo,  which  are  of course much  more  expensive.\r\n\r\nIndustrial  space is not cheaper than in  many  competing\r\n\r\nAsian   locations,  but  the  gap  has   been   narrowed.\r\n\r\nIndustrial  land prices have dropped by about  45%  since\r\n\r\n1996.   JTC  rentals are down to the levels of the  early\r\n\r\n1990s.  Competition in the electricity market has brought\r\n\r\ntariffs  down significantly, despite rising  oil  prices.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  full  liberalisation of the  telecommunications\r\n\r\nmarket has also brought charges down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr John Chen, Mr Low Thia Khiang\r\n\r\nand  others  have referred to our many Government  taxes,\r\n\r\nfees   and  charges,  and  asked  whether  we  are  still\r\n\r\ncompetitive after adding all these up.  Let me first  say\r\n\r\nthat   the   total   Government  burden  on   businesses,\r\n\r\ncomprising   taxes,   both  direct  and   indirect,   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  fees  and charges, is low -  certainly  lower\r\n\r\nthan  in most other countries.  It is two-thirds  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal tax burden in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUS,  taken as a percentage of GDP, for example.  And  the\r\n\r\nUS  is  regarded as an environment that is supportive  of\r\n\r\nenterprise.  We have achieved this because we  have  kept\r\n\r\nGovernment  spending low and kept Government smaller  and\r\n\r\nmore  efficient than most.  That is the only  sustainable\r\n\r\nway  to  keep  Government-imposed  costs  down,  not   by\r\n\r\nlowering  fees  and  charges  to  prevent  the  costs  of\r\n\r\nservices from being recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with the several Members that we have to\r\n\r\nkeep reviewing Government services, keep looking for more\r\n\r\nefficient ways of doing things so as to reduce costs, and\r\n\r\ntrim  charges  wherever it is possible  to  do  so  while\r\n\r\nrecovering  costs.   In  this spirit,  MTI  has  recently\r\n\r\ncompleted  a  review  of TradeNet charges.   We  will  be\r\n\r\nsignificantly   reducing  Government  permit   fees   for\r\n\r\napplications   made  through  TradeNet,   from   $4   per\r\n\r\napplication  to $0.90, with effect from 1st  April  2003.\r\n\r\nThis  measure does not seem like a large one, but it will\r\n\r\nalone save businesses more than $20 million annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, we are competitive. There are pockets of\r\n\r\ninefficiency in the economy, areas where we  find  excess\r\n\r\noverheads   or  redundant  procedures,  and   there   are\r\n\r\nindustries  where costs and wages are still  higher  than\r\n\r\nwhat our capabilities can justify against the competition\r\n\r\nin  China and elsewhere.  But there are many areas  where\r\n\r\nwe  retain an edge in productivity and capabilities,  and\r\n\r\noffer  an  operating environment superior to  what  other\r\n\r\nlower  cost economies can offer.  That is why we continue\r\n\r\nto  attract  high  quality  investments,  OHQs,  and  new\r\n\r\nfinancial  market  teams, even as we lose  some  existing\r\n\r\nactivities.   If we were not competitive, the  EDB  would\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  able  to attract  $8-9  billion  of  new\r\n\r\ninvestments  each year in manufacturing alone.   So,  our\r\n\r\neconomy is going through a difficult period, with most of\r\n\r\nthe external engines of demand weak or sputtering, but we\r\n\r\nhave  not  become  uncompetitive and  we  are  not  being\r\n\r\nhollowed out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang had asked why then did we cut the\r\n\r\nCPF in 1998 and why have we deferred the restoration of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   CPF   for  another  two  years.   We  have   stayed\r\n\r\ncompetitive  precisely  by making  quick  adjustments  in\r\n\r\nwages  during the downturn, and we will stay  competitive\r\n\r\nby  taking the recommendations of the ERC to enhance  the\r\n\r\nflexibility of our labour markets, stay flexible in wages\r\n\r\nand  work  practices.  That is the way in which  we  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  During recessions and slow growth, as  what\r\n\r\nwe  have seen in the last few years, profits fall.   Even\r\n\r\nproductivity falls.  So, if wages do not fall, there is a\r\n\r\nsimple  result:  unemployment goes up.  By  making  quick\r\n\r\nadjustments to the CPF and, therefore, to wages, we  have\r\n\r\navoided a much sharper increase in unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, restructuring our markets to inject more\r\n\r\ncompetition  has been an effective strategy for  bringing\r\n\r\ncosts  down.   The telecoms and energy markets  are  good\r\n\r\nexamples of the dividends gained by consumers from market\r\n\r\nliberalisation.   Energy,  especially,  is  an  important\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  costs.   By restructuring  the  market  to\r\n\r\ninject  competition, and by competitive pressures leading\r\n\r\nthe  generation companies to switch to natural gas, which\r\n\r\nis   more  efficient,  we  have  brought  tariffs   down.\r\n\r\nElectricity  tariffs today are 8% lower than in  December\r\n\r\n2001.  Tariffs would in fact have come down much further,\r\n\r\nif  not  for the significant increase in oil prices  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits are even greater for the larger\r\n\r\nconsumers  of  electricity,  who  are  now  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncontestable  retail market, which the suppliers  can  bid\r\n\r\nfor.  These larger users have made additional savings  in\r\n\r\ntheir electricity bills ranging from 2-7%, over and above\r\n\r\nthe  8% drop in tariffs enjoyed by the rest.  The EMA  is\r\n\r\nnow  working with industry players on the next  phase  of\r\n\r\nretail   market   liberalisation.   From  224   customers\r\n\r\ncurrently  in  the contestable retail market,  we  expect\r\n\r\nanother 5,000 customers to be contestable by around  June\r\n\r\n2003, and another 5,000 by the end of this year.  By  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  year,  therefore, 75% of total  electricity\r\n\r\nsales  of  annual  value worth about $3 billion  will  be\r\n\r\ncontestable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen suggested that PowerGrid should\r\n\r\nbenchmark  its  grid charges internationally.   We  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.   EMA  has recently completed  a  benchmarking\r\n\r\nexercise  for  grid  charges.  While  PowerGrid  must  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to earn sufficient returns to be able to finance\r\n\r\nnew  investments in the grid network, EMA  will  use  the\r\n\r\nbenchmarks as an indication of how much scope there is to\r\n\r\nextract efficiencies out of PowerGrid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA's findings are that our grid charges for\r\n\r\nhouseholds   compare  favourably  with  that   in   other\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  But there is scope to reduce charges  for\r\n\r\nboth  commercial  and industrial users.   PowerGrid  will\r\n\r\ntherefore reduce its grid charges by 8% on average,  with\r\n\r\neffect  from 1st April 2003.  For industrial users,  grid\r\n\r\ncharges will be reduced by up to 14%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, however, we must brace ourselves\r\n\r\nfor  higher electricity prices.  We do not know how  high\r\n\r\noil prices will go as the situation in Iraq plays out, or\r\n\r\nhow  long  oil  prices will remain high.  Consumers  must\r\n\r\nconserve energy, and manage their energy bills prudently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our utilities costs do not make us\r\n\r\nuncompetitive.   Even the cost of water in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nstill  comparable to other major cities,  and  less  than\r\n\r\nhalf  the  cost  of  water in Frankfurt  and  Tokyo,  for\r\n\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked questions on industrial\r\n\r\nland,  including Dr John Chen, Mr Inderjit Singh  and  Mr\r\n\r\nAng  Mong  Seng.  This is an important area  of  economic\r\n\r\npolicy.   We will ensure that our industrial land  market\r\n\r\nis  competitive  and  responsive to changing  conditions.\r\n\r\nFirst,  as Deputy Prime Minister Lee has explained during\r\n\r\nthe Budget debate, the Government will release sufficient\r\n\r\nindustrial land for sale under the Government Land  Sales\r\n\r\nframework   to   achieve   sustainable,   internationally\r\n\r\ncompetitive land prices.  There is sufficient  supply  of\r\n\r\nindustrial land to do this for a long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Mr Inderjit Singh, this is indeed\r\n\r\ndifferential  pricing  at  work.   By  zoning  land   for\r\n\r\nindustrial  use, we allow the market for industrial  land\r\n\r\nto settle at a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent  level from land for commercial  use.   Second,\r\n\r\nJTC  pegs its rentals to the prevailing market rates, and\r\n\r\nnow  exercises considerable flexibility in the terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  its leases so as to be business-friendly.\r\n\r\nThird, we intend to grow a stronger private sector in the\r\n\r\nindustrial  land  market  for  greater  competition   and\r\n\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen and others have asked if industrial\r\n\r\nland  prices really reflect the market.  JTC keeps  close\r\n\r\ntrack  of  private  industrial  rental  rates,  and  does\r\n\r\nquarterly  reviews  to  peg  its  own  rentals   to   the\r\n\r\nprevailing  market  rates.   In  January  this  year,  it\r\n\r\nreduced  rentals by a further 2-7%.  So, since the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis, JTC has reduced rentals by nearly  40%.\r\n\r\nThis shows that JTC is responsive to the market, and that\r\n\r\nits  rentals are not sticky downwards.  In general, JTC's\r\n\r\nrentals   are  comparable  to  the  private  sector   for\r\n\r\nequivalent  facilities  and are  even  lower  in  several\r\n\r\ncases.  However, JTC cannot simply slash prices to  clear\r\n\r\neach  and every piece of vacant space, because this  will\r\n\r\nlead  to  an  unstable market and shake  confidence.   No\r\n\r\nresponsible  developer will do so,  even  in  competitive\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC's scheme for making annual rental adjustments\r\n\r\nalso  seeks  to reduce risks for the customer.   It  caps\r\n\r\nincreases and rental rates at 5.5% per year, when  market\r\n\r\nrates  are  moving  up,  but allows  customers  to  fully\r\n\r\ncapture  the  benefit of any downward price movements  in\r\n\r\nthe   market.   Some  customers  on  older  schemes  have\r\n\r\ndifferent rental adjustment conditions, but all  of  them\r\n\r\nhave been offered the option of moving to this new market\r\n\r\nadjustment scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of keeping posted rentals in line with the\r\n\r\nmarket, JTC has been giving significant rental rebates to\r\n\r\ncustomers, as Members know.  Mr Inderjit Singh has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  asked if JTC and Ascendas have passed the  property\r\n\r\ntax rebate onto their customers. The answer is yes.  With\r\n\r\nthe  recent  announcement to extend rental rebates  until\r\n\r\nDecember 2003, the total value of the rebate package from\r\n\r\n1998  to  2003  will amount to $1.1 billion.   More  than\r\n\r\n7,000 companies are benefiting from these rebates.  These\r\n\r\nrebates  are  helping  businesses to  tide  over  current\r\n\r\ndifficulties, but they cannot be permanent.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ngradually move back towards market pricing over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether JTC could be more\r\n\r\nflexible  in  its  lease terms.   This  is  an  important\r\n\r\nquestion   for  companies  in  this  uncertain   business\r\n\r\nenvironment.   JTC  has indeed been  responsive.  It  has\r\n\r\nbroadened  the range of lease tenures that it  offers  to\r\n\r\ninvestors.  In addition to its standard 30-year  and  60-year  leases, it now offers leases of 20 years  or  less.\r\n\r\nLeases  of  12  years or more have, in fact,  been  quite\r\n\r\npopular, and a lease of as short as 8 years has, in fact,\r\n\r\nbeen granted.  Last year, JTC also enhanced its Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation  Licence scheme, which now allows  for  short-term  use of between one and three years, with an  option\r\n\r\nfor renewal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has also changed its requirements, or as someone\r\n\r\njust  put  it, \"the strings attached\" to its new  leases.\r\n\r\nIt  previously  imposed  a minimum  plant  and  machinery\r\n\r\ninvestment as a condition for the lease to be awarded, so\r\n\r\nas  to optimise land use.  Since last year, it has scaled\r\n\r\ndown  this  requirement so that companies  only  need  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  the amount of investments they intend  to  make.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  help JTC to make a decision  if  there  are\r\n\r\ncompeting uses for a specific plot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For existing leases, JTC has changed its lease\r\n\r\nconditions to allow companies to extend their leases  for\r\n\r\nup  to  10 years without having to comply with the  usual\r\n\r\nterms,  in other words, without having to meet  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  fresh investments.  This scheme was introduced on  a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case basis last year.  From April this year,  the\r\n\r\nscheme will be extended to all customers whose leases are\r\n\r\ndue  to  expire within the next three years.  This short-tenure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrenewal scheme will help companies to continue operating,\r\n\r\nwithout  having  to  make large  new  expenditures  in  a\r\n\r\ndifficult business environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC's flexibility in renewing leases has helped many\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Khong Guan Biscuits, a household name, is one\r\n\r\nexample.    Khong  Guan was keen to keep its  factory  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  where it has been for over 20 years.   But  it\r\n\r\nfound  that  it was not viable to pump in new investments\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore  operations in  the  current  business\r\n\r\nenvironment.     They    have   20    plants    operating\r\n\r\ninternationally, but they wanted to stay in Singapore for\r\n\r\nreasons of history and sentiment.  JTC allowed Khong Guan\r\n\r\nto renew its lease for another 10 years without having to\r\n\r\nmeet the usual renewal conditions.  We kept Khong Guan in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and saved jobs for over 200 employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has put in place other initiatives to help\r\n\r\ncompanies  save  costs during these trying  times.  As  a\r\n\r\nfurther measure, JTC will reduce its rental deposit  from\r\n\r\ntwo months to one month for customers on GIRO with effect\r\n\r\nfrom  1st April 2003.  This small step will free  up  $27\r\n\r\nmillion for JTC's customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, we have to add more depth and\r\n\r\nbreadth in the industrial land market, increase the  role\r\n\r\nof  the  private  sector and inject greater  competition.\r\n\r\nJTC  has  already reduced its presence in  the  high-rise\r\n\r\nfactory  market,  where  its  share  is  31%.   It   will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  let  the  private  sector  take  over   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  generic industrial facilities,  such  as\r\n\r\nready-built factories and business-park properties.   JTC\r\n\r\nwill instead focus on its developmental role, engaging in\r\n\r\nnew and higher risk projects where it is better placed in\r\n\r\nthe  private sector.  This includes projects with a  long\r\n\r\npayback,  such as Jurong Island, or projects  which  push\r\n\r\nthe envelope, such as Biopolis in One-North.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC will engage and collaborate with the private\r\n\r\nsector   to   develop  a  more  vibrant  and  competitive\r\n\r\nindustrial   land  market  that  responds   quickly   and\r\n\r\ncreatively to new business needs. One-North is  itself  a\r\n\r\ngood example.  JTC kick-started\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe project. Once the project began to draw interest from\r\n\r\nprospective  customers,  other developers  developed  the\r\n\r\nconfidence to join in.  We expect the private  sector  to\r\n\r\ndevelop up to 80% of One-North over the next 15-20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, as the manufacturing sector moves up the\r\n\r\nvalue  chain, our industrial facilities will increasingly\r\n\r\nbe  light and non-pollutive. There will be greater  scope\r\n\r\nto  integrate industrial sites within our HDB  townships.\r\n\r\nJTC  will  work  with  HDB  to redevelop  and  rejuvenate\r\n\r\nindustrial sites in HDB towns, starting with a couple  of\r\n\r\npilot sites. This will have two benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will bring more employment to the doorstep\r\n\r\nof  residents.  This will become more  important  as  the\r\n\r\npopulation ages.  In the long-term, it will make it  more\r\n\r\nconvenient  for  our  older  workers  to  remain  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  Second, the rejuvenation of these  industrial\r\n\r\nestates  will help to support start-ups and viable  SMEs.\r\n\r\nHaving this broader range of work opportunities, and SMEs\r\n\r\nhumming away, will contribute to the vibrancy and  rhythm\r\n\r\nof life in HDB towns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI agrees fully with Mr Heng Chee How and other\r\n\r\nMembers about the importance of productivity growth.   It\r\n\r\nis  ultimately the only basis for sustaining  high  wages\r\n\r\nand remaining attractive to investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve our GDP growth potential of 3-5% per\r\n\r\nannum   over   the  next  10-15  years,  we   will   need\r\n\r\nproductivity  growth  of  2-3%  per  annum.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenging  goal.  It exceeds what has been achieved  in\r\n\r\nother  developed  countries, which are  generally  ranged\r\n\r\nbetween 1-2%, or even the exceptional 2% rate achieved by\r\n\r\nthe United States during the economic boom of the 1990s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we sustain productivity growth of 2-3%?\r\n\r\nThe  most  important factors will still be  our  economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals.    This   means   ensuring   macro-economic\r\n\r\nstability,  keeping  our economy  open  to  international\r\n\r\ntrade and investments, and removing artificial restraints\r\n\r\non competition.  It also means investing in our people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  build  human capital, at all levels of education  and\r\n\r\ncontinuous    learning.    And   it   means   stimulating\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fundamentals are the best way of promoting\r\n\r\ninnovation  and  efficiency.  The  Government  will  also\r\n\r\ncontinue  to support industries with specific  programmes\r\n\r\nto  help  firms to move up the value chain.  Productivity\r\n\r\nimprovement  is about all firms, the new economy  or  the\r\n\r\nold  economy, humble or established.  Let me give you two\r\n\r\nexamples  of  companies  from  the  HDB  heartland,  both\r\n\r\nclients  of SPRING.  The first is Sincere Photo  Shop,  a\r\n\r\nHDB   retailer  in  Tampines.   Sincere  makes   use   of\r\n\r\nFujifilm's Internet portal to allow its customers to send\r\n\r\nover  digital  pictures  and  images  for  printing.  The\r\n\r\ncustomers  can collect the processed pictures at  outlets\r\n\r\nof  partner shops or have the photographs mailed to them.\r\n\r\nThe  portal  also enables customers to make payments  for\r\n\r\nSincere  Photo's  services via the handphone.   One  year\r\n\r\nafter  adopting these innovations, Sincere  Photo  Studio\r\n\r\nhad achieved more than 20% improvement in sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even something as simple as leveraging on an\r\n\r\nestablished franchise can yield significant  gains.   Hui\r\n\r\nYi  Collection  & Colour Lab in Jurong  West  is  a  good\r\n\r\nexample.  Joining the Kodak Express franchise in November\r\n\r\n2001  enabled Hui Yi to improve on its store  design  and\r\n\r\nlayout to improve its image.  Also, Hui Yi benefited from\r\n\r\na  transfer of management and retail expertise,  enabling\r\n\r\nit  to improve on its customer service, product knowledge\r\n\r\nand operational efficiency.  Since joining the franchise,\r\n\r\nHui Yi's sales have improved by 50%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong expressed his support for efforts to\r\n\r\ndevelop the retail sector.  I agree with him and Mrs  Lim\r\n\r\nHwee  Hua  that we need to rejuvenate the retail  sector.\r\n\r\nIt  is not just a matter of numbers - how many people are\r\n\r\nemployed in the retail sector and how much it contributes\r\n\r\nto  GDP.   A  competitive and lively landscape of  retail\r\n\r\nplayers  is  integral to any vision  of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nleading cosmopolitan city.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower training is the key to jacking up\r\n\r\nproductivity  in  the  sector.   The  Retail  Academy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (TRAS) will be the focus of this effort.  TRAS\r\n\r\nis  driven  by the private sector, with the  support  and\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  Government.  It is  aiming  high.   It\r\n\r\nplans  to  train  and certify 23,000 workers  over  three\r\n\r\nyears.   It  will also attempt to place at least  50%  of\r\n\r\nunemployed  trainees in retail jobs  upon  completion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  training.   To help TRAS get off the  ground,  MTI\r\n\r\nwill  provide  a  dollar-for-dollar  matching  grant  for\r\n\r\ncontributions raised by the industry, subject to a cap of\r\n\r\n$1  million.   TRAS  will also be  eligible  for  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  funding  under  MOM's  Manpower  Development\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme (MDAS).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Arthur Fong that it is ultimately\r\n\r\nthe  culture  of  service excellence  that  marks  out  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  retail sector.  It is what  gives  customers\r\n\r\ngood  memories. TianPo Jewellery is a good example  of  a\r\n\r\nretailer that has taken customer service seriously.   All\r\n\r\nits  staff undergo a rigorous training schedule, focusing\r\n\r\non  customer service and product knowledge.   In 1998, it\r\n\r\nembarked  on  a Service Excellence Programme (which  uses\r\n\r\nscripting  and  casting to achieve  service  excellence).\r\n\r\nSince  2000,  TianPo has won an average of  15  Excellent\r\n\r\nService  Awards every year.  More importantly, its  sales\r\n\r\nhave more than doubled in three years, from $4 million to\r\n\r\n$10 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, consumer protection. Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat  Kwang  have  enquired about the  proposed  Consumer\r\n\r\nProtection (Fair Trading) Act.  CASE and other members of\r\n\r\nthe public have told us that the $20,000 cap on the value\r\n\r\nof  goods  and  services is too low.   Mr  Yeo  has  just\r\n\r\nreiterated  this.  MTI has reviewed this  issue  and  has\r\n\r\ndecided to change the way the cap is defined.  It will be\r\n\r\na  $20,000 cap on the value of the claim instead  of  the\r\n\r\nvalue of goods and services purchased.  The consumer  who\r\n\r\npurchases  goods and services with a value of  more  than\r\n\r\n$20,000 will thus be able to bring a claim under the Fair\r\n\r\nTrading  Act if his claim is $20,000 or less.  This  will\r\n\r\ntake care of most of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplaints received by CASE, nearly all of which  have  a\r\n\r\nclaim value of less than $20,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked if the Fair Trading Office is needed to\r\n\r\nenforce  the  Fair  Trading Act.  The  Fair  Trading  Act\r\n\r\nadopts  a  different  approach from  a  number  of  other\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  The  difference  is  that  it  does   not\r\n\r\ncriminalise  unfair trade practices. There  is  hence  no\r\n\r\nneed  for  a  Fair  Trading Office to  enforce  the  Fair\r\n\r\nTrading  Act in Singapore.  What the Act will  do  is  to\r\n\r\nempower  consumers  to  obtain civil  remedy  themselves,\r\n\r\nwithout   having  to  rely  on  Government's  protection.\r\n\r\nBesides allowing for quick redress, this approach of self-reliance  will  encourage greater consumer responsibility\r\n\r\nand proactivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo and Mr Yeo have drawn attention to the need\r\n\r\nfor  basic  infrastructure to be in place  for  the  Fair\r\n\r\nTrading Act to work.  This is indeed crucial.  The  Small\r\n\r\nClaims   Tribunal  provides  an  affordable  avenue   for\r\n\r\nconsumers  to  seek  redress. CASE has  had  a  mediation\r\n\r\nservice  in  place since June 1999, which  consumers  can\r\n\r\nturn   to   before  taking  legal  action.   Some   trade\r\n\r\nassociations  have also expressed interest in  developing\r\n\r\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  MTI  welcomes\r\n\r\nsuch  initiatives. We will work with them to set up  such\r\n\r\nmechanisms, to help resolve complaints without  consumers\r\n\r\nhaving to end up taking legal action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key component is the education of traders\r\n\r\nand  consumers. We are glad that CASE will play an active\r\n\r\nrole  to  support  the  Fair  Trading  Act  by  educating\r\n\r\nconsumers and helping consumers seek redress in court. As\r\n\r\nhighlighted by Dr Teo, vulnerable consumers, such as  the\r\n\r\nelderly and the illiterate, will be especially in need of\r\n\r\nhelp.   MTI  will give its full support to CASE  and  the\r\n\r\nbusiness associations in the educational drive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has asked if the Fair Trading Act will cover\r\n\r\nall  industries.   It is intended to be  generic  in  its\r\n\r\nscope.   The original plan was to exclude only two  areas\r\n\r\nfrom the Act, the purchase of residential property, which\r\n\r\nis  already  covered by an extensive body of conveyancing\r\n\r\nlaw, and financial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestments.   However, during public  consultations,  we\r\n\r\nreceived  feedback  that  the Act's  coverage  should  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  financial investments.  MAS  has  therefore\r\n\r\nconducted  a  follow-up  industry  consultation  on   the\r\n\r\npossible  extension of this Fair Trading Act  to  include\r\n\r\nfinancial investments.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS' consultations ended early this month. MTI will\r\n\r\nincorporate  possible amendments and table  the  Bill  in\r\n\r\nParliament within the next 4-5 months. Mr Yeo Guat  Kwang\r\n\r\nand  Miss  Penny  Low spoke about the  Rule  of  78  that\r\n\r\napplies  to  the early repayment of car  loans.   MTI  is\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  Hire  Purchase  Act.   We  have  recently\r\n\r\ncommenced  a  review which will cover  various  elements,\r\n\r\nincluding  the application of the Rule of 78.  In  making\r\n\r\nany  revisions  to the Act, we will have  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\ncareful  balance.   We  will  want  to  make  sure   that\r\n\r\nconsumers  are not unfairly disadvantaged, but we  should\r\n\r\nregulate  with a light touch so as to minimise compliance\r\n\r\ncost of businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat  Kwang, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, have\r\n\r\nspoken about the intended competition law.  Currently, we\r\n\r\nhave  a sectoral approach to competition law, with sector\r\n\r\nspecific  competition  frameworks in  telecommunications,\r\n\r\nelectricity, gas, and media industries.  As MTI announced\r\n\r\nlast  year, in line with the recommendations of the  ERC,\r\n\r\nthe Government will enact a generic competition law.   We\r\n\r\ntarget to do so by 2005.  MTI is studying the legislative\r\n\r\nframeworks, practices and experiences of other countries.\r\n\r\nWe  are  mindful that the Singapore economy is small  and\r\n\r\nopen  and  will  adopt  features  of  laws  that  we  see\r\n\r\nelsewhere that best suit our circumstances.  Our  aim  is\r\n\r\nto  develop  a  legal framework that will  enable  us  to\r\n\r\nfurther  maintain and promote vigorous competition  among\r\n\r\nfirms, without adding unduly to business cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Singapore Power, Dr Maliki had asked how\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power manages utilities accounts  in  arrears,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  utilities  can  be billed separately  for  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity so that households who can only afford to pay\r\n\r\nfor  their  water bills will not have their water  supply\r\n\r\ndisconnected.   Singapore Power Services (SP Services) is\r\n\r\nflexible   in   working  with  households   on   suitable\r\n\r\ninstalment   plans   to  help  them   tide   over   their\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Utilities are only disconnected  after  SP\r\n\r\nServices has made numerous attempts to get the households\r\n\r\nto pay their arrears and to commit to an instalment plan.\r\n\r\nIf  they do not contact SP Services to work out a payment\r\n\r\nplan,  they will get their electricity disconnected.   If\r\n\r\nthey continue to default on payments, PUB will install  a\r\n\r\nthimble  in the household's water-pipe to limit, but  not\r\n\r\nhalt, the flow of water.  This thimbling of water is  not\r\n\r\ndone  until  at  least  five  months  after  the  initial\r\n\r\ndefault.   If  the  household is still in  default  after\r\n\r\nanother  six months, in other words, eleven months  after\r\n\r\nthe   initial   default,  then  the   water   supply   is\r\n\r\ndisconnected.    So  the  water  supply   will   not   be\r\n\r\ndisconnected  if  these households pay, at  least,  their\r\n\r\ncurrent  utilities bills, which would then only  comprise\r\n\r\nwater and refuse charges.  In effect, the result is  what\r\n\r\nDr Maliki wanted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separating electricity and water billings and\r\n\r\ncollections is not a sustainable solution.  At the end of\r\n\r\nthe day, the arrears and utilities charges must still  be\r\n\r\npaid.   The  crux  of  the matter is that  households  in\r\n\r\ndifficulty  will  have  to control their  consumption  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  water.  Those in hardship  should  also\r\n\r\nseek assistance from their relatives or from the CCCs and\r\n\r\nCDCs.   As  for  Dr Maliki's suggestion of  using  stored\r\n\r\nvalue   cards  and  other  measures,  the  Energy  Market\r\n\r\nAuthority will look into any creative solutions that will\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState  has  not responded to my query on the  IPS  report\r\n\r\nwhich says that business costs are inflated unnecessarily\r\n\r\nby Government policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, I have responded\r\n\r\nquite thoroughly on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissue,  not  just  on  business costs  as  a  whole,  but\r\n\r\nspecifically  to  do  with  Government  taxes,  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges.

I would like\r\n\r\nto make a few points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to congratulate the Minister of\r\n\r\nState,  Mr Raymond Lim, for being appointed the  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  in charge of promoting entrepreneurship.   The\r\n\r\nprocess  of  creating an entrepreneurial nation  needs  a\r\n\r\ntotal approach, more so, a total mindset change, as  said\r\n\r\nby  many MPs and I in this House.  Our people have become\r\n\r\ntoo  rigid  in  thoughts and methods.  How  then  can  we\r\n\r\nencourage  our people to take risk and start  businesses?\r\n\r\nThese are some of the points made by many Members as well\r\n\r\nas the Minister of State himself in his speech during the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate.  The Budget Statement actually  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the  MTI  would  set aside  $500  million  to  grow\r\n\r\nSingapore companies and help them to venture abroad.   It\r\n\r\nwas  mentioned at page 23, paragraph 2.22 of  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.  However, I have not found any detail  on  how\r\n\r\nthis $500 million is going to be spent.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nhear  from the Minister some details on how this sum will\r\n\r\nbe  used.   Can  the Minister of State also  give  us  an\r\n\r\ninsight  into  some  of his initial thoughts  on  how  he\r\n\r\nintends  to fulfil his new role as the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  Entrepreneurship?   Has  he  any  initial\r\n\r\nprogramme or course of action that he can enlighten  this\r\n\r\nHouse?   Would  he  get  private  sector  input  on   his\r\n\r\ndeliberations?   If so, how?  Has the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nthought about the various measurable data, parameters and\r\n\r\ntargets  to  track  the  progress  and  success  of  this\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship drive over the years to come?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, in the last few days, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  from a few Members in this House  about  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  Government in promoting entrepreneurship.   The\r\n\r\ncommon  argument we have heard is that true entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nshould not wait for the Government and should know how to\r\n\r\nfind  their  ways  and  they should  stop  expecting  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do things for them.  Sir,  speaking  from\r\n\r\nexperience and having done it myself, a few times over, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say  that  all  of  these  are  academic\r\n\r\narguments and they do seem logical.  But I must also  add\r\n\r\nthat  unless one has done it or gone through  the  trials\r\n\r\nand  tribulations  of becoming an entrepreneur,  he  will\r\n\r\nnever  understand why the likes of Ms Olivia Lum, Dr  Gan\r\n\r\nand myself, still feel that the Government can indeed  do\r\n\r\nmany things to help.  I must also add that the few of  us\r\n\r\nin  this  House, who are advocating this suggestion  that\r\n\r\nGovernment's involvement is indeed needed, did it without\r\n\r\nthe  Government's help in the first place.  And,  if  you\r\n\r\nlook at the background of every one, we did not wait  for\r\n\r\nthings  to  change.  We struck out on our  own,  with  or\r\n\r\nwithout  Government's help.  But having  experienced  the\r\n\r\nheadaches  and heartaches, and having had to resolve  all\r\n\r\nof  them  by ourselves, we now want to help others  avoid\r\n\r\nsimilar  problems so that they can better focus on  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses and have an easier chance of succeeding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we indeed want a thousand flowers to bloom, then\r\n\r\nwe  will  need many more thousands to try and  fail,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is precisely where the Government can help - making\r\n\r\nit  easier  for  those few thousands to try.   Some  will\r\n\r\nnever  need Government's help, but many could do  with  a\r\n\r\nlittle  support  here and there.  If  nothing  else,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could,  at least, clear the  obstacles  which\r\n\r\nexist  today  and  which  stifle  entrepreneurship.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  could, at least, create a more level  playing\r\n\r\nfield  as  Singapore-based companies face  the  GLCs  and\r\n\r\nMNCs.   The  Government  could, at  least,  allocate  its\r\n\r\nresources,  such  that every company,  whether  large  or\r\n\r\nsmall, will have equal access to these resources.  As you\r\n\r\ncan  see,  the  private enterprises and the entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nhave never asked for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhandouts.  All they want are equal opportunities and  for\r\n\r\nthe obstacles to be cleared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this respect, I congratulate Mr Raymond Lim\r\n\r\nfor  being  appointed, and I am glad that the  Government\r\n\r\nappointed him because it shows that they do realise  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a need for a champion, and there is  something\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government can do about it.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\ngive him three suggestions on what he could do as his key\r\n\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is on a conducive environment for the\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations.   I  will  not  go  through  the\r\n\r\ndetails.  We have talked a lot about these.  I would like\r\n\r\nto take just one example that stifles entrepreneurship  - the  patent laws which will jail a person who first files\r\n\r\nhis    patent   outside   Singapore.    This    is    not\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship friendly.  In fact, it is negative  when\r\n\r\nwe try to attract entrepreneurs to be based in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI   know   that  the  Government  is  trying  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore's IP industry.  But why do we think that we can\r\n\r\ndo  it by forcing people to do it down here?  In fact, it\r\n\r\nhas a negative impact on us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the suggestions I would like to propose are\r\n\r\nthese.   We have the pro-enterprise panel - we  all  know\r\n\r\nthe role - and I think this could be transformed to a pro-active agency that reviews the rules and regulations,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  reacting to them through feedback.   To  do\r\n\r\nthis, they will need a much bigger secretariat because it\r\n\r\nis  a  part-time role for many people involved.   Second,\r\n\r\nfor  every  rule  and  regulation that  is  presented  in\r\n\r\nParliament, I suggest that we do a study of its impact on\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  business.  What is the cost of compliance?\r\n\r\nAnd  if  every Bill that is presented comes along with  a\r\n\r\ncost  of compliance, we can basically make it a lot  more\r\n\r\nbusiness friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of EDB, I would like to clarify the\r\n\r\npoints  that  some  Members and I  have  made.   And  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has raised this just now, on what EDB does  for\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals.  I do not think that anyone  has  argued\r\n\r\nthat  EDB did wrong.  In fact, they did an excellent job.\r\n\r\nMany, including\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmyself,  praised EDB for its success.  They  have  really\r\n\r\ndone well for Singapore.  But, in the same breath, I say,\r\n\r\nlet  EDB continue to do what it does best, and, that  is,\r\n\r\nto  bring in the big accounts, as the Minister said,  and\r\n\r\nto focus on multi-nationals.  It is precisely because EDB\r\n\r\nwas  successful  in what it did that I  am  advocating  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  approach - a one-stop agency for  start-ups  and\r\n\r\nlocal companies based in Singapore.  We already have  the\r\n\r\nmaking  of  such  an  agency.   SPRING  Singapore  is  an\r\n\r\nexcellent example.  But, in my own experience with  them,\r\n\r\nthey need a lot more clout, teeth and resources, the  way\r\n\r\nEDB has resources to help multi-nationals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area which the Minister of State can focus\r\n\r\non  is  in the area of financing of SMEs, and this  is  a\r\n\r\ntopic that I will talk in my next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nneed  to  groom local entrepreneurs cannot be  overstated\r\n\r\nand  it is for this reason that today, we have a Minister\r\n\r\nof  State in charge of Entrepreneurship.  Sir, I like the\r\n\r\nanalogy  stated by Minister George Yeo a while  ago.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we are like a garden, and the Government  can\r\n\r\nfertilise, water and nurture it, but the ultimate test is\r\n\r\nin  the quality of the seed.  I agree and, in fact,  like\r\n\r\nto  go  one  step further.  Perhaps, within  this  garden\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  number  of pots of bonsai  that  are  very\r\n\r\nvaluable and, if we give them special tender loving care,\r\n\r\none day they may grow to become a treasure and may become\r\n\r\na collector's item.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it is good to encourage all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  become more entrepreneurial, it is also important for\r\n\r\nus  to focus our efforts to groom a number of what I call\r\n\r\n\"super-entrepreneurs\", who can become business leaders in\r\n\r\ntheir respective fields.  These super-entrepreneurs  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to put Singapore on the world map.  They will be\r\n\r\nable to help us connect to the world and allow us to ride\r\n\r\non  the  waves of the growing economies.  As a  start,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that  our GLCs and perhaps  some  of  the\r\n\r\nbigger private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies   can  play  this  role  and  become   business\r\n\r\nchampions  one  day.  We must work with them,  understand\r\n\r\nthem  and  find ways to help them to succeed.  And,  when\r\n\r\nthey  do  succeed,  they must in turn  help  groom  other\r\n\r\nSingapore companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we groom super-entrepreneurs, we must not forget\r\n\r\nthe  problems faced by many local businesses,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs.   One  of  the main obstacles  for  the  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs is the lack of financing.  Many have spoken\r\n\r\non this subject and I shall not repeat the arguments.  To\r\n\r\nhelp  them, Sir, I would like the Government to seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up a special bank  for  the  SMEs.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve the DBS Bank was initially set up to provide  the\r\n\r\nmuch  needed financing for developing new industries and,\r\n\r\nhence,  the  name  \"Development Bank of Singapore\".   Now\r\n\r\nthat  DBS  has  become  a full commercial  bank,  it  has\r\n\r\nchanged  its  name and shifted its focus,  by  necessity.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad thing for DBS, but it has created a gap\r\n\r\nthat  needs to be filled.  Therefore, we should  consider\r\n\r\nsetting up a new SME bank to fill this gap.  With  proper\r\n\r\nsafeguards,  I  believe the SME bank can be  viable.   It\r\n\r\nwill  certainly signal the Government's determination  to\r\n\r\nhelp  local  businesses and it will be a major  boost  to\r\n\r\ngroom entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, many Members have\r\n\r\nspoken about Government's red tape and the need to remove\r\n\r\nit  so  as  not to stifle entrepreneurship.   However,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that what is most important and difficult  to  do\r\n\r\nis  to effect a mindset change in the civil service, from\r\n\r\none of rigid implementers of rules to a friendly business\r\n\r\nadvocate.  This will contribute positively to creating an\r\n\r\nenvironment   where   entrepreneurship   can    flourish.\r\n\r\nHowever,  such  a  change  can only  come  about  if  top\r\n\r\nGovernment leaders, the media and the general public keep\r\n\r\nup   the   publicity,  exhortation  and,  if   necessary,\r\n\r\npressure.  To be truly successful, our Minister in charge\r\n\r\nof  Entrepreneurship certainly needs all the help he  can\r\n\r\nget, to not only remove old rules and red tape, but, more\r\n\r\nimportantly, change all our civil servants'  mindset,  so\r\n\r\nthat they will become pro-business, customer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  oriented  and advocates to the businessmen  that\r\n\r\nthey deal with.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, creating the right civil service mindset is\r\n\r\nonly   one   aspect.   Entrepreneurship   requires   many\r\n\r\nattributes.   Besides talent, it requires the willingness\r\n\r\nto take risks, the grit to keep on going despite failure,\r\n\r\nand the passion and belief in a dream.  How do we nurture\r\n\r\nsuch  qualities?  Do we suffer from too  much  order?   I\r\n\r\ntend  to  think so.  Maybe we need to loosen up a little,\r\n\r\nallow  greater flexibility and diversity.  We should  not\r\n\r\nbe  too  quick to put someone down just because he  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle   different   or  has  different   strengths   and\r\n\r\naptitudes.   As  we  all  know,  there  is  strength   in\r\n\r\ndiversity.  A diverse economy is more resilient and  more\r\n\r\nsurvivable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem we seem to have is that of the\r\n\r\ncopycat  entrepreneur.   Look at the  bubble  tea  craze.\r\n\r\nJust because one or two outlets made some money from this\r\n\r\nidea,  we had hundreds of bubble tea businesses sprouting\r\n\r\nup  overnight.  The end result?  They all lost money.   I\r\n\r\nam  sure  Members can cite a few more examples.  What  we\r\n\r\nreally  need are entrepreneurs with original  ideas  that\r\n\r\ncontain a good amount of innovation that can be protected\r\n\r\nlegally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship will only flourish when our young\r\n\r\nidealists  dare  to dream, be willing to sacrifice  their\r\n\r\ntime and effort to chase these dreams and be brave enough\r\n\r\nto  risk  all  for their belief.  A few will succeed  and\r\n\r\nreap  the  benefits.  Many will survive and get  by,  and\r\n\r\nsome  will fail, but the Government must create the right\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  these people to  bounce  back  and  try\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made general points on what characterise\r\n\r\nand  promote entrepreneurship.  For us to succeed, it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   for   the  Government  to   consciously   and\r\n\r\nconstantly  build into its policies, be  they  social  or\r\n\r\neconomic,  be  they  in  school  or  the  workplace,   an\r\n\r\nenvironment  conducive to the nurturing of  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I am impressed with the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   initiative   to   market   test   non-core\r\n\r\nGovernment    activities,   and   divest    non-strategic\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked   companies.    This   does   open   up\r\n\r\ntremendous  opportunities for  both  mature  and  budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.   However,  these  well-intentioned  moves\r\n\r\nmust  consciously  avoid the evil of a  private  monopoly\r\n\r\nreplacing public monopoly, especially if that monopoly is\r\n\r\na  privatised  \"Government-cloned\" monopoly.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister comment on what measures will be put in place to\r\n\r\nprevent this development?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have highlighted in my Budget debate speech, we\r\n\r\nwill need to do more to rebalance some of the risk-reward\r\n\r\nratios  of  our  four  factors of production,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nincentivise    our   entrepreneurs.    Ultimately,    the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur is the ultimate value creator,  who  employs\r\n\r\nthe  other factors of production.  However, he will  only\r\n\r\ndo so if the rewards outweigh the relative risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of land and labour must be kept\r\n\r\nreasonable, and the upward pressure on these two  factors\r\n\r\nmust be kept in check.  On the other hand, capital return\r\n\r\nis  at  an  all-time low now and it is, indeed, opportune\r\n\r\nfor entrepreneurs to access funds and, in return, give  a\r\n\r\nbetter  return  on capital,  albeit with some  degree  of\r\n\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On accessing funds, again, it has been talked about\r\n\r\nmany  times in this House.  But it is a constant  refrain\r\n\r\nof  SMEs that there is a lack of adequate supply of  risk\r\n\r\ncapital.   There  appears to be an  inherent  risk-averse\r\n\r\nculture  of  capital providers, particularly  banks,  for\r\n\r\nrisky  start-up  efforts.   The  Global  Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nMonitor  (GEM)  Report 2001 noted that failures  are  not\r\n\r\ntolerated   and  capital  providers  are  suspicious   of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.   This culture has created  what  the  GEM\r\n\r\nstudy  termed  as a 'capital gap', which is  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  funds needed at start-up stage are not  available,\r\n\r\nbut pour in when the entity is already successful.   This\r\n\r\nwill not work.  There must be easier access to a constant\r\n\r\nstream  of  risk  capital, or else, it is a  non-starter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  is time to set up some sort of a  SME  Bank,\r\n\r\nthat a few\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  my  colleagues have spoken about, where entrepreneurs\r\n\r\ncan  have access to seed capital and start-up funds.  And\r\n\r\na  new  set  of  rules  should  apply  to  these  budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  away  from  the typical  collateral-based\r\n\r\nlending.   Government grants need not  only  target  high\r\n\r\nvalue add type of entrepreneurs, but be made available to\r\n\r\na whole variety of businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to propose the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  network of a  series  of  colourful\r\n\r\nentrepreneur hubs to encourage budding entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\neven  the retrenched to venture.  This could be  done  at\r\n\r\ntwo levels.  First, the 'experimental' level and then the\r\n\r\n'serious or committed' level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The experimental level type of entrepreneur hub\r\n\r\ncan take a leaf out of places like London's Covent Garden\r\n\r\nand  New York City's Greenwich Village.  Its emphasis  is\r\n\r\non   low cost and simple set-up, although not necessarily\r\n\r\nonly   in  artifacts  or  souvenir  trades  alone.   This\r\n\r\nencourages  budding entrepreneurs and niche entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nto  market  test their product and creativity,  and  adds\r\n\r\nvibrancy  to  a city.  It could also become the  breeding\r\n\r\nground  and  form a part of the critical mass needed  for\r\n\r\nthe emergence of serious entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The serious or committed level. This can take\r\n\r\nthe  shape  of our One-North project, or the  Southampton\r\n\r\nEnterprise Hub in South East of England.  The pillars  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  hub  are  knowledge  and  institution  networks,\r\n\r\ntrained  persons  and  a  sophisticated  information  and\r\n\r\ncommunication  structure.  In  other  word,  links   with\r\n\r\nacademic  institutions will enable  research  and  market\r\n\r\ninformation,  so that IP innovations can be  brought  out\r\n\r\nof the laboratories.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, can you sum up now, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> And links with the real business\r\n\r\nworld will also give it an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunceasing  flow  of  ideas and people  who  are  actively\r\n\r\nengaged in entrepreneurial activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of both types of entrepreneur hubs,\r\n\r\nwhen   well   managed  and  networked,  will  create   an\r\n\r\n\"entrepreneur   breed  entrepreneur\"  culture.    Perhaps\r\n\r\n'enterprise  hub directors' could also be  introduced  to\r\n\r\nnetwork  both  locally and globally, so that  a  constant\r\n\r\nflow  of  fresh inputs and outputs can be seen  here.   I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister would consider and study this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members have spoken\r\n\r\nabout  the need for financing of SMEs.  I think the issue\r\n\r\nreally  is that, today, we have  two ends of the spectrum\r\n\r\nin  terms  of financing.  One end of the spectrum  is  VC\r\n\r\nfinancing  through  equity, which  I  would  say  is  the\r\n\r\naggressive  end.   And the other end  is  debt  financing\r\n\r\nthrough collaterals, which is the conservative end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can develop a more vibrant financing\r\n\r\nenvironment,  we  will surely attract more  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore and from outside Singapore to locate down\r\n\r\nhere,  as sugar attracts ants.  And I think we have  many\r\n\r\ngaps to plug today.  It will take us some time for us  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  this  vibrant environment, and I  have  given  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  suggestions  to the Minister.   I  will  just\r\n\r\nhighlight  a few, in addition to the small business  bank\r\n\r\nwhich some Members have raised, and the OTC board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very successful with the Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS), and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  we  build on this  scheme  to  enhance  it\r\n\r\nfurther  and to give it a bit more flexibility,  so  that\r\n\r\nthis  can be applied in many other areas, including  non-equipment  financing,  participation  by  non-banks   and\r\n\r\nventure capitalists, and also to give more flexibility to\r\n\r\nfinancing  institutions  so  that  they  will   be   more\r\n\r\nencouraged to use the LEFS to lend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a whole slew of financing modes\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  life  cycle  of  the  company.    The\r\n\r\nfinancing  mode that a company needs may  change  as  the\r\n\r\ncompany changes in its structure.  As ours is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill   an   immature  market,  compared  to   the   more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial economies like the US, Israel and Taiwan,\r\n\r\nwe  will therefore need some help, and this is where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can play an important role in trying  to  help\r\n\r\nfind  the  match of a financing type for  a  company.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  suggest that we set up a Matching Agency  that\r\n\r\ncan  facilitate this role, just as a facilitation agency.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  can  get  this  whole  process  going  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment gets more mature and companies know where  to\r\n\r\nfind  the money, I think the Government can back  off  as\r\n\r\nthe momentum picks up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is also room for agencies like SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  play  a developmental  role  of  providing\r\n\r\nsmaller companies with the right training, mentorship and\r\n\r\naccess  to the right advice on what is the right type  of\r\n\r\nfinancing  available  for  them.   I  think  whilst  many\r\n\r\ncompanies  can do it on their own, there are  still  some\r\n\r\nwho still need some help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also given a suggestion of creating a special\r\n\r\nfund called a buy-out or restructuring fund.  It will  be\r\n\r\nespecially  useful in an environment like this  where  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  encourage mergers, acquisitions and  management\r\n\r\nbuy-outs  of  GLCs.  If there are more  funds  like  this\r\n\r\nestablished  in  Singapore,  I  think  we  can  spur  the\r\n\r\nactivities and create a lot more opportunities like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the issue of credit rating and credit\r\n\r\ninsurance   schemes.   If  these  can  become   permanent\r\n\r\nfeatures  in  Singapore, they will  surely  help  lending\r\n\r\ninstitutions to gain more confidence when they lend money\r\n\r\nparticularly to smaller companies.  And I think  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  have started  but  it  is  not  well\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  and this could be another area  which  SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Government could develop further.   And\r\n\r\nif  these  schemes are developed, traders who  have  been\r\n\r\ncomplaining about their access to financing will find the\r\n\r\nproblem being resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, SMEs will provide the future\r\n\r\nimpetus for economic growth.  The problem is: how to grow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMEs?   How  to assist them?  How to help them  transform\r\n\r\nfrom  SMEs  to become MSCs  -  Major Singapore Companies?\r\n\r\nThis  term  is not coined by me.  It appears in  the  ERC\r\n\r\nReport,  and  therefore, I am just using the  same  term.\r\n\r\nHow to transform SMEs into MSCs, versus the MNCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the starting points is that the\r\n\r\nSMEs  need  a  patron.  Perhaps Mr Raymond  Lim,  besides\r\n\r\nbeing  designated as the Minister of State in  charge  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, could also  call himself  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor SMEs.  He can then be the patron for SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high level, high profile patronage for the SMEs\r\n\r\nwill  help  them  to focus their efforts towards  helping\r\n\r\nthese small companies to grow.  And being the patron,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  will  definitely have all the sorrows  of  the  SMEs\r\n\r\npoured  onto his shoulders, and therefore  he can  better\r\n\r\nunderstand in-depth all the problems of the SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with my colleagues, Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh  and  Miss Penny Low, that unlike MNCs,  which  are\r\n\r\nwell  taken care of by the one-stop agency of EDB,  there\r\n\r\nis  currently no one-stop agency to help SMEs.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest that MTI should designate an agency, like\r\n\r\nSPRING Singapore, to be the one-stop agency to help  SMEs\r\n\r\nlocally, and then IE Singapore can be the one-stop agency\r\n\r\nto  help SMEs to venture overseas.  Sir, for that matter,\r\n\r\nsince  both  SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore  claim  to\r\n\r\nhelp  local SMEs, why not revive the idea of merging  the\r\n\r\ntwo  agencies  into  one,  that means,  combining  SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore and IE Singapore.  Then it will have a new name\r\n\r\ncalled  SPRING-IE Singapore.  I believe that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nbetter  approach which will have a single composite  body\r\n\r\nto help the SMEs, both locally and venturing overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I want to raise is with regard\r\n\r\nto    MTI's   responses   to   several   of   the    good\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  stated in the  ERC  Report,  to  assist\r\n\r\nSMEs.  Some of these worthwhile recommendations are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to develop entrepreneurship programmes at all\r\n\r\neducational levels;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to impose sunset rule on all licences to cut\r\n\r\nred tape.;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to enact a competition law; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to establish a private equity exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, one of the problems of\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs is that there is no single agency to help  them\r\n\r\nto  champion  their cause, to speak up for  them  and  to\r\n\r\nsolve their problems and to resolve red tape.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nmy idea of a single agency for SMEs would be able to help\r\n\r\nto champion the several recommendations of the Government\r\n\r\nin the ERC Report so as to help the SMEs.  In summary,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to propose that Mr Raymond Lim be a patron  of\r\n\r\nSMEs, and a one-stop agency called SPRING-IE Singapore be\r\n\r\nthe single agency for SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I remember\r\n\r\nbeing  involved in 1986 in the Economic Review  Committee\r\n\r\nwhere  a  lot of emphasis was made on the role  of  SMEs,\r\n\r\nbecause we were hit with a recession.  So, workshops  and\r\n\r\ncommittees  were  set up to promote SMEs  and  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nemphasis  was  made  on  the role  of  the  SMEs  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy.   But what I also  remember  is  that\r\n\r\nafter  the  economy recovered, issues about helping  SMEs\r\n\r\nbecame  less prominent.  Basically, amongst the SMEs,  we\r\n\r\nfelt that when the economy recovered, the emphasis on the\r\n\r\nrole of SMEs was forgotten, or less important.  Today, in\r\n\r\nthe  last week of our Budget debate and every day, we are\r\n\r\ntalking  about issues regarding SMEs, the ERC Report  and\r\n\r\nmany  of our parliamentary colleagues have made very good\r\n\r\nsuggestions about how to promote SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that SMEs now employ over 50% of our\r\n\r\nworkforce.   They  contribute  35%  to  our  GDP.    MNCs\r\n\r\ncontribute 45% to our GDP; and GLCs, 16%.  I believe this\r\n\r\nformula  had worked very well for Singapore in the  past.\r\n\r\nBut what I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask is: is there a review of these  ratios  and\r\n\r\ntargets,  in terms of the long-term strategic development\r\n\r\nof SMEs in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs take a very commendable role in investing in\r\n\r\nhigh tech, knowledge industries and taking us a leap into\r\n\r\nthe  future.   MNCs' role cannot be underrated.   We  all\r\n\r\ncongratulate  EDB  on  a job well done.   And  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to attract big MNCs to come to Singapore.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  I would like to ask is:  is there a long-term  plan\r\n\r\nto review the role of SMEs in Singapore, in terms of, for\r\n\r\nexample,  its GDP component?  Are we going  to  allow  or\r\n\r\nencourage  our local enterprises to grow larger,  whereby\r\n\r\nthese   SMEs   or   local  enterprises  will   have   the\r\n\r\ncapabilities, financial resources and size, in  order  to\r\n\r\ncompete effectively in the regional and global markets?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs are mainly Singaporeans. Until the day we see\r\n\r\nGermans and Japanese coming here to set up SMEs,  we  see\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  SMEs are Singaporeans.  I just  came  this\r\n\r\nmorning from the inauguration of the 52nd Council of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and  Industry  and\r\n\r\nthere are 4,000 members.  We have 120 association members\r\n\r\nwith  about  20,000  members of their  own.   So  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  25,000  membership within  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  And these  are\r\n\r\nSingaporean companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the going gets tough, these Singaporean\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  would not stay. As the saying  goes,  when\r\n\r\nthe going gets tough, the tough gets going.  And we still\r\n\r\nintend to make Singapore the headquarters of our business\r\n\r\noperations.   So  what I would like to  propose  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse is that we need to review and promote the image and\r\n\r\nthe role of SMEs.  We do not need a revolution.  Suddenly\r\n\r\novernight,  we  say,  \"It  is  really  cool  to   be   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur.\"   We do not need to do it overnight.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  we  need  to  do  is  to  make  the  image  of   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur to be much more acceptable and higher in the\r\n\r\nSingapore scheme of things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come from a society ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Gan, can you sum up now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem:</b> Yes. In Singapore, I think from\r\n\r\nthe views of SMEs, the mandarins and the scholars are  at\r\n\r\nthe  highest  peak of the social structure,  whereas  the\r\n\r\nmerchants  and  the businessmen are at the  bottom  rank.\r\n\r\nAnd  one of the issues that I would like to bring  up  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  is whether we would, over time, promote  the\r\n\r\nsocial ranking and role of SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, for the\r\n\r\npast three years, I have also been involved in efforts to\r\n\r\npromote  the  IC design activities and support  companies\r\n\r\nand  research  institutes  in  their  efforts  to  design\r\n\r\nelectronic silicon or integrated circuit.  This  industry\r\n\r\nhas  huge  potential and has been growing at a phenomenal\r\n\r\nrate over the years.  The semiconductor industry is about\r\n\r\nUS$300   billion.    For  those  who   are   not   aware,\r\n\r\nsemiconductor chips are pervasive, and they are found  in\r\n\r\ncomputers,  cellular phones, watches,  cars,  pacemakers,\r\n\r\ncoffee  pots, satellites and greeting cards.   In  short,\r\n\r\nthey are everywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to promote entrepreneurship, there is\r\n\r\na  clear need for Singapore to nurture technology  start-ups.   Why?   Just as I speak here in this  House,  other\r\n\r\ncountries like China, Taiwan, Australia, South Korea  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia are very seriously moving into this area.   This\r\n\r\nis  because they know that as they embark on  to  the  IC\r\n\r\nfabrication  industry, there is a need for them  to  grow\r\n\r\nand develop their activities so as to increase the number\r\n\r\nof  local design, products and innovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Shanghai, for example, mainland China's second\r\n\r\nfoundry,   Grace   Semiconductor  Manufacturing   Company\r\n\r\n(GSMC),  is now being built.  GSMC is among the companies\r\n\r\nlooking out to make money, by being in the first wave  of\r\n\r\nadvanced     semiconductor    concerns    to    establish\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  bases  in mainland China.   With  many  of\r\n\r\ntheir  orders coming from foreign design houses and  much\r\n\r\nof  what  they make going overseas, they are  also  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  utmost to ensure the growth of their local  design\r\n\r\nindustry and local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesign  houses  because  they know  that,  eventually,  a\r\n\r\nrising  type  of  local design houses would  eat  up  fab\r\n\r\ncapacity and drive expansion.  This is what our local fab\r\n\r\npride, CSM enjoys, and could not benefit from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries, like China, Taiwan, Australia, South\r\n\r\nKorea and Malaysia, and even Thailand, incubation centres\r\n\r\nwith  the  support of Government are sprouting  out  like\r\n\r\nmushrooms.  More often than not, in these countries,  new\r\n\r\ntechnology   start-ups   are  given   the   support   and\r\n\r\nfacilities,  infrastructure, software  and  hardware  for\r\n\r\nthem  to start their work and focus on what they are best\r\n\r\nat, that is, design and create.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for Singapore to move forward, private\r\n\r\nenterprises must be encouraged, engineered even  for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of growth, if this is indeed the direction that  we\r\n\r\nhave  charted for Singapore.  Are we willing to seriously\r\n\r\nassist  our  start-ups, in every sense of  the  word,  by\r\n\r\nsincerely    providing   infrastructure   and   financial\r\n\r\nassistance?   Supporting them inevitably is part  of  the\r\n\r\nconducive  environment that we need to create.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I  support the call by Members for the formation  of\r\n\r\nrelevant  financial  institutions  to  assist  start-ups.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,   the  changing  of  mindset  is  the   greatest\r\n\r\nchallenge  at hand.  It is time for us to listen  to  the\r\n\r\nindustry players and stakeholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my interaction with the industry professionals\r\n\r\nand also budding start-ups, I often hear them complaining\r\n\r\nof  so  many  schemes that are supposed to  assist  them.\r\n\r\nBut,  in the end, the criteria, requirements and controls\r\n\r\nare  so  cumbersome and tedious that  most  give  up  and\r\n\r\nprefer not to ask for help at all.  It may not be fair to\r\n\r\nsay  this,  but the impression that I get is  that  civil\r\n\r\nservants and Government officers seem to be oblivious  of\r\n\r\nhappenings  in the industry.  Do we need so many  complex\r\n\r\nschemes, so many different names and acronyms?  Would the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider  simplifying  and  streamlining  these\r\n\r\nassistance schemes?  Can we make the application  process\r\n\r\nmore transparent?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very often, for technology start-ups, the entry\r\n\r\nbarrier is high and often difficult to start ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Nordin, can you start summing up\r\n\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Can we not do something to\r\n\r\nlower  these barriers and encourage more young, able  and\r\n\r\ntalented  professionals in this field  to  explore  their\r\n\r\nideas  and  take  the leap of faith to be  the  next  big\r\n\r\ncompanies from Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> To allow the Minister ample time to\r\n\r\nreply,  may  I  request the remaining speakers  for  this\r\n\r\namendment  to  keep their speeches as short as  possible.\r\n\r\nMr Arthur Fong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, in this economic climate, we\r\n\r\nhear  of  many businessmen saying that our Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  sympathetic to helping them tide over the  slowdown.\r\n\r\nI  too initially believe this to be so.  But I have  seen\r\n\r\nmany viable small and medium enterprises being forced out\r\n\r\nof  business  because of the chain  of  debts.   Although\r\n\r\nthese   SMEs  are  viable,  their  obligations  to  their\r\n\r\nemployees and suppliers are often compromised, because of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  debtors who too are holding them up.   But  a\r\n\r\nquick look at the SPRING Singapore's shows - they have  a\r\n\r\nwhole  coterie  of financial assistance schemes  to  help\r\n\r\nSMEs  to  tide  over  the short-term  difficult  cashflow\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an example is the micro loan scheme that helps\r\n\r\nSMEs to overcome their short-term cashflow problems.   It\r\n\r\nallows  the  local companies concerned to  borrow  up  to\r\n\r\n$50,000  at  a  favourable interest rate of 5%  repayable\r\n\r\nover four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear about our intention here. Any\r\n\r\nbusiness  organisation that is not able  to  balance  its\r\n\r\ncash  in the long term has no business to be in business.\r\n\r\nBut  I understand SPRING Singapore is not the only agency\r\n\r\nthat  assists our business.  There are others and,  given\r\n\r\nthe shortness of time, I will address my concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that a company has its application\r\n\r\nfor  a  micro loan rejected by an attendant bank  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that  the company had previously issued  cheques\r\n\r\nthat bounced.  I am afraid this is not the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst or the only case.  It is common knowledge that even\r\n\r\nmany  of the successful entrepreneurs faced all kinds  of\r\n\r\ncashflow problems in their struggling days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to Mr Gan Kim Yong's point on the SME bank,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  it  does  merit some look  at  his  suggestion.\r\n\r\nBecause  I  think the attendant banks, who are  assessing\r\n\r\nthese  loan applications, are assessing them based  on  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  programme  lending and  credit  scoring.   There\r\n\r\nshould  be people who have experience looking at business\r\n\r\nfrom  the  business  perspective  -  from  the  different\r\n\r\nvaluation  model, business order books, management  audit\r\n\r\nand  the  experience of the people running the  business.\r\n\r\nSo,  in this respect, maybe, instead of just going to the\r\n\r\nSME bank, we should have people with these experiences in\r\n\r\nthe  attendant  banks.  Sir, I am afraid  that  the  best\r\n\r\nintentions of our Government may be thwarted by  what  is\r\n\r\nactually happening on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call on the Minister of State in charge of\r\n\r\nEnterpreneurship  to assure the House that  the  original\r\n\r\nspirit  of  whatever assistance schemes that we  have  in\r\n\r\nplace is carried out to their intent on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem:</b> Sir, I follow up with what Mr\r\n\r\nArthur  Fong  has said.  Pro-business schemes  are  many,\r\n\r\nfrom SPRING Singapore, IE Singapore and EDB.  Now we also\r\n\r\nhave  the  EDB  very actively helping SMEs.   But,  often\r\n\r\ntimes, as what we have heard in the House today, most  of\r\n\r\nthese schemes are crafted by civil servants with a lot of\r\n\r\ninputs  from the different sectors, including the private\r\n\r\nsector.   However, the schemes to assist  SMEs  are  much\r\n\r\nmore  difficult to craft than schemes to attract MNCs  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Because  SMEs come  in  all  shapes,  sizes,\r\n\r\ncolours and are in different stages in the organisation's\r\n\r\nlife  cycle  and from different industry sectors,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery difficult to just have one solution for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would like to propose is a lot more\r\n\r\ncustomisation of these schemes to help SMEs.  One of  the\r\n\r\nissues that I would like to raise, which I thought was  a\r\n\r\nbit arbitrary, is the $15 million cut-off point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere  SMEs  whose fixed assets are beyond  that  amount,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  allowed  to  be  on  the  different  loan\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes.  And where did the $15 million  come\r\n\r\nfrom?  It has been there for a long time.  I think it  is\r\n\r\nalso time this cut-off point is reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to customise schemes for SMEs,\r\n\r\nwhat  I  would  like  to  propose is  that  the  relevant\r\n\r\nagencies undertake a much more in-depth research and data\r\n\r\ngathering  about  SMEs,  ie, the structures  of  SMEs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the industries they are in.   We  need  a\r\n\r\ndatabase in order to do much more analysis and diagnosis,\r\n\r\nso  that we would be able to customise the schemes to the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  SMEs,  as well as to review some  of  the  old\r\n\r\nschemes which really do not apply any more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe  most  important  support that we  can  give  to  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  is  one of financing them.   For  the  new\r\n\r\nstart-ups, they need financing.  It is difficult for them\r\n\r\nto  do so if they do not have sufficient capital of their\r\n\r\nown.  If they try to borrow from commercial banks, as  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard, and if they lack the track records and  most\r\n\r\nof the time they do not have sufficient collateral, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, local banks have been the ones who\r\n\r\nhave  been supporting the small accounts, such as  these.\r\n\r\nBut  with  the  merger of six banks  into  three,  it  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  felt that the three banks are now  more  risk-averse.  We are not blaming the banks as they have  their\r\n\r\nown bottomline and their shareholders to look after.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same also holds true for small entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nventuring overseas.  For example, if they go to China, it\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult for them to borrow locally.  If  they\r\n\r\nwant to borrow from Singapore banks, Singapore banks will\r\n\r\ninsist on collaterals in Singapore.  And if there are  no\r\n\r\nSingapore collaterals, there are no loans and no ventures\r\n\r\noverseas.   It is also difficult for them now to  attract\r\n\r\nfunding from private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestors, angel funds and venture capitalists.  With the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn and uncertainties, funds  have  become\r\n\r\nscarce  and,  at  the  same time, private  investors  and\r\n\r\nventure  capitalists  are getting more  conservative  and\r\n\r\nwary.  Alas, angels are also getting to be fewer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not talking about handouts. I agree that\r\n\r\nthe  Government cannot become an ATM where anyone with  a\r\n\r\ncalling card \"entrepreneur\" can come and freely draw from\r\n\r\nthe support.  Entrepreneurs must also compete for limited\r\n\r\nfunds  available.  The rule of survival  of  the  fittest\r\n\r\nshould  also apply.  But the problem of financing genuine\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  with  potential is real.   Many  of  these\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs with good and workable ideas would probably\r\n\r\nbe  stopped in their tracks before they even get started,\r\n\r\nbecause of a lack of funds, and that would be a real loss\r\n\r\nto the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that there is really no easy solution to\r\n\r\nthis problem, but we really need to find a way forward to\r\n\r\nbridge  this  gap  and  to  help  our  entrepreneurs   to\r\n\r\nflourish.  The idea of a SME Bank or a special fund could\r\n\r\nbe a workable solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, wan shi ju bei, zhi qian\r\n\r\ndong  feng, ie, everything is ready, what we need is  the\r\n\r\nEast wind.  I think there are hundreds, if not thousands,\r\n\r\nof entrepreneurs who are prepared to set sail, and I hope\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry and, now, Mr Raymond Lim, can find  the\r\n\r\nEast wind for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Sir, I thank Members for their\r\n\r\nuseful   comments   on  promoting  entrepreneurship   and\r\n\r\ndeveloping the SMEs.  I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that\r\n\r\nthe Government has an important role to play in promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, but I think he and many Members of  the\r\n\r\nHouse would agree with me that, ultimately, whether  they\r\n\r\nsucceed or not really depends on themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of Dr Diana Young, CEO of\r\n\r\nMil-Com  Aerospace Group.  She had to mortgage  her  home\r\n\r\nand persisted even when the going was tough,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil  she  clinched her first deal in  India.   Starting\r\n\r\nwith  six  employees  in  1994,  the  Mil-Com  group   of\r\n\r\ncompanies  now  serves  as  a  one-stop  centre  for  the\r\n\r\naerospace industry, offering value-added services ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  engineering  and airport security technologies,  to\r\n\r\ntraining for engineers and technicians.  As a female in a\r\n\r\nmale-dominated  industry, her achievements  are  all  the\r\n\r\nmore  remarkable.   This  is  the  kind  of  feisty   and\r\n\r\nresilient spirit that marks a true entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should not be hand-holding our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, but neither should it stand  in  the  way.\r\n\r\nNor  should  it  simply be folding up  its  arms  and  do\r\n\r\nnothing.   It  should  and  will  help  by  creating  the\r\n\r\nconditions that will make it possible for those with  the\r\n\r\ndrive, determination and gumption to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has said in his Budget speech that\r\n\r\nwe must ensure that the business environment is friendly,\r\n\r\nnot just to big firms or foreign SMEs, but also the small\r\n\r\nlocal  firms.  Dr Gan just now highlighted the importance\r\n\r\nof  the SMEs for the economy.  I fully agree with both of\r\n\r\nthem.   We will help our SMEs upgrade their capabilities,\r\n\r\nso that they can better compete in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Penny Low's vision of a vibrant enterprise hub is\r\n\r\none  that we share and have been actively nurturing.   It\r\n\r\nis one where large and small companies, local or foreign,\r\n\r\nco-exist, compete, interact and leverage on one another's\r\n\r\nstrengths  to  scale  greater  heights.   There  will  be\r\n\r\nfeedback  between  industry  and  academia,  and  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum   of  capital  ready  to  commercialise   ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must be agnostic on nationality and  size  of\r\n\r\nfirms, because they all contribute to economic growth and\r\n\r\ncreate  jobs for Singaporeans.  So, in answer to Dr  Gan,\r\n\r\nas  to  whether we have a quota in which we  fix  in  our\r\n\r\nminds  a certain percentage should be for SMEs, a certain\r\n\r\npercentage  for GLCs or MNCs, we do not  have.   We  will\r\n\r\npromote the growth of all enterprises.  We would like all\r\n\r\nof them to succeed, because they add to economic activity\r\n\r\nand growth, and jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of the synergistic benefit of such an\r\n\r\nenvironment  is  Encore Technologies, which  brought  its\r\n\r\nSimputer,  or  Simple Computer, to Singapore  to  further\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  launch it in global markets as a  \"made-in-Singapore\" hand-held computer.  Today, from its Singapore\r\n\r\nbase,  Encore  works  with more than  60  big  and  small\r\n\r\ncompanies   in  Singapore  and  the  world   to   develop\r\n\r\napplications for its Simputer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides grooming local companies, we are also\r\n\r\nattracting foreign SMEs to Singapore to build  a  vibrant\r\n\r\nenterprise  sector.   We want them to  use  Singapore  as\r\n\r\ntheir  base  to  innovate, develop products  and  explore\r\n\r\nopportunities in the region and beyond.  We have  already\r\n\r\nmade  some  headway in this area, and Singapore  is  fast\r\n\r\nbecoming a cosmopolitan enterprise hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of foreign incubators increased from 38\r\n\r\nin  2001 to 51 in 2002, including incubators from  India,\r\n\r\nJapan,  Korea and New Zealand.  In particular, the Korean\r\n\r\nIT  promotion  agency  set up its first  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncentre in Singapore, while Japan's Mie prefecture set  up\r\n\r\nits  first  overseas Mie Business and  Innovation  Centre\r\n\r\nhere.   The  13 new incubators that came to Singapore  in\r\n\r\n2002  are  expected to create about 500 jobs and generate\r\n\r\n$55 million in value-added per year.  These foreign start-ups  that come to Singapore include companies such as  SL\r\n\r\nInteractive,  a Korean multi-player online game  company.\r\n\r\nThis company is planning to launch a 3-D online game this\r\n\r\nyear.  It is also developing games for mobile phones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the high-tech incubators and start-ups, we\r\n\r\nare  also  attracting SME centres from around the  world.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the South Sumatra Information House opened\r\n\r\nearlier  this  month, we also expect to welcome  new  SME\r\n\r\ncentres   from  India,  China,  Chile  and   Korea.    In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the Zhejiang Centre will be  the  first-ever\r\n\r\ncentre  of  its kind by China in Southeast Asia  to  help\r\n\r\nChinese  companies venture overseas.  In  September  this\r\n\r\nyear,   Singapore  will  host  the  International   Small\r\n\r\nBusiness Congress, which is internationally known as  the\r\n\r\nSME event of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   year.    CEOs,   entrepreneurs,  bankers,   venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists and policymakers from all over the world will\r\n\r\ncome  here for the Congress.  Japan alone will be sending\r\n\r\n<br><br>100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SME  CEOs to attend.  Such events help to underscore\r\n\r\nour status as an international enterprise hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, is the business environment that we are\r\n\r\ncreating.   All companies, big or small, must be  assumed\r\n\r\nto  have the potential to grow and globalise, and we will\r\n\r\nensure  that there is a level playing field  for  all  to\r\n\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have brought up three important conditions\r\n\r\nthat   we   have   to  get  right  to  create   such   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial economy:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) culture;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) regulatory environment; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will address them in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr John Chen and Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee  have  emphasised, the critical factor is  a  culture\r\n\r\nwhere Singaporeans are quick to seize opportunities, take\r\n\r\nrisks  and  make a difference.  Education is vital  here.\r\n\r\nMr  Leong  asked for an update.  NUS and  NTU  have  both\r\n\r\nintroduced   entrepreneurship   courses   and    exchange\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  their  curricula  in  collaboration  with\r\n\r\nStanford  University  and the University  of  Washington,\r\n\r\nrespectively.   About half of the 49 graduates  from  the\r\n\r\ninaugural  batch of NTU's programme are now embarking  on\r\n\r\nnew start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship programmes are also taking off in\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  Since March last year, some 4,000 students\r\n\r\nfrom over 70 schools have been trained under the BizWorld\r\n\r\nprogramme by more than 500 volunteers, including business\r\n\r\npeople,  public  servants  and  teachers.   We  hope   to\r\n\r\nincrease the number of students trained under BizWorld to\r\n\r\n10,000 by the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently heard about Mr Lin Xiang Qian, a former\r\n\r\nVJC  student,  who is now serving National  Service.   As\r\n\r\nVice President of Esco Micro Pte Ltd, a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany owned by his parents, Xiang Qian spearheaded  the\r\n\r\nproduct   development  and  exports  of  its   bio-safety\r\n\r\ncabinets  division.   Last June, he  became  the  world's\r\n\r\nyoungest  person  to be granted full accreditation  under\r\n\r\nthe  NSF International Biohazard Cabinets Field Certifier\r\n\r\nAccreditation Programme.  I know it is a mouthful, but it\r\n\r\nis  an important thing.  He also brought in sales of $3.5\r\n\r\nmillion for the company last year - all this in the  same\r\n\r\nyear that he sat for his A-Level examinations.  I do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to embarrass him by divulging his results,  but  he\r\n\r\ndid  very well in his A-Levels.  It is stories like these\r\n\r\nthat give us reasons to be optimistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this culture has to spread beyond our students\r\n\r\nto  our adult population.  The Phoenix Award was launched\r\n\r\nin 2000 to recognise entrepreneurs who had persevered and\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  spite  of past failures,  and  to  inspire\r\n\r\nothers  to emulate their fine example.  It is encouraging\r\n\r\nthat  many  past Phoenix Award nominees and  winners,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  other  entrepreneurs, are now  volunteering  as\r\n\r\nmentors  under  the Phoenix Mentorship Programme.   Along\r\n\r\nwith  activities run by other organisations, such as  the\r\n\r\nYoung  Entrepreneurs  Organisation, the  Association  for\r\n\r\nSmall  and  Medium  Enterprises, and  the  Entrepreneur's\r\n\r\nResource  Centre,  such  programmes  provide  a   support\r\n\r\nnetwork for entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change a nation's culture will take time, as\r\n\r\nthese  are societal behaviours that are embedded  in  the\r\n\r\npsyche of the people.  But a certain momentum has set in.\r\n\r\nThere  is  clearly  today a heightened awareness  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry on the need for entrepreneurship.  The debate  in\r\n\r\nthis House bears testimony to this.  What is important is\r\n\r\nthat we actually walk the talk.  By \"we\", I mean not just\r\n\r\nthe   Government  and  civil  servants  but  every   one,\r\n\r\nincluding parents, teachers, community leaders, business,\r\n\r\nworkers and the media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On regulatory environment, I share the concerns of\r\n\r\nMembers about excessive red tape.  They have added to  my\r\n\r\nstore of horror stories that was already quite full after\r\n\r\na year chairing the EISC.  What\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  encouraging is that the Minister for Finance has made\r\n\r\nclear  that the Government is very much seized with  this\r\n\r\nissue.   Besides the Pro-enterprise Panel, there  is  the\r\n\r\nRules Review Panel.  The latter is doing what Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh   suggested,   that   is,   reviewing   rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations.   This is a comprehensive internal  exercise\r\n\r\nwhere  all  public agencies are required to review  their\r\n\r\nrules  by  the end of FY 2004.  They have been  asked  to\r\n\r\nconsult  private  stakeholders as part  of  their  review\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Leong have suggested that\r\n\r\nthere  be  sunset clauses in rules and regulations.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  accepted in spirit this  recommendation,\r\n\r\nwith  a mandatory review of all rules and regulations  by\r\n\r\nall  Ministries every five years.  However, we will  look\r\n\r\ninto  how  stronger discipline can be  instilled  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  in  a  way  that  does  not  lead  to  excessive\r\n\r\nadministrative burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also proposed that every rule\r\n\r\nand  regulation change be accompanied by a study  of  the\r\n\r\ncost   impact  on  businesses.   This  is  a   worthwhile\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  as  it  will raise the  awareness  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants  on regulatory costs.  We will see how  best  it\r\n\r\ncan be implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what Dr John Chen said, I believe that he has\r\n\r\nhit the nail on its head.  It is not just about excessive\r\n\r\nrules,  but how they are administered by public servants.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there will always be rules.  Even in a society\r\n\r\nof  angels, there will be, say, a rule to decide on which\r\n\r\nside  of the road to drive on.  The issue is whether  the\r\n\r\nangel  will be hauled up if he makes a U-turn  on  a  new\r\n\r\nroad  where  the traffic signs are not yet  up.   I  have\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  to  shift  the mindset,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  set the default key at \"Yes\" rather than \"No\"  in\r\n\r\ndealing with business.  We will see how best this can  be\r\n\r\ndone in practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to move away from our top-down attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the  public to one that emphasises teamwork  and\r\n\r\nparticipation.  We are moving in that direction, with the\r\n\r\nERC as the clearest example\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  partnership  in  setting  the  economic  agenda.   As\r\n\r\nalways,  more can be done, as bureaucracies  tend  to  be\r\n\r\nhierarchical and more focused on process rather than  the\r\n\r\ncustomer.  The good news is, as Deputy Prime Minister Lee\r\n\r\nsaid, our civil service is moving in this direction,  and\r\n\r\nmore would be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On finance, several Members, such as Mr Ng Ser\r\n\r\nMiang,   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  and  Ms  Penny  Low,   have\r\n\r\nhighlighted that financing gaps in the market may  hinder\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   I  agree.  The  Government  has  thus\r\n\r\nsought  to  improve  access to  funding  for  enterprises\r\n\r\nthrough   facilitating  or  capitalising  new   financing\r\n\r\navenues,  and  by sharing in the financing  risks.   Last\r\n\r\nSeptember,  for  instance, the Government introduced  the\r\n\r\nLoan  Insurance Scheme, where it defrays part of the cost\r\n\r\nof the insurance premium.  This is to help companies that\r\n\r\nwould otherwise have difficulty in securing funding  from\r\n\r\nVCs and commercial banks.  Since its launch, more than $9\r\n\r\nmillion worth of loans have been approved.  But more will\r\n\r\nbe   done.    MTI   has  accepted,  in   principle,   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the panel headed by Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nto  improve the access to finance for entrepreneurs.   We\r\n\r\nthank him for his work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has highlighted some of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   from   that  panel.    Our   underlying\r\n\r\nphilosophy must be to work with private players  to  plug\r\n\r\nthese  gaps.  What are some of these key recommendations?\r\n\r\nAs  I said, he has highlighted some, but let me take  you\r\n\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) SME Bank. Banks in Singapore are paying more\r\n\r\nattention to SME financing.  This has been helped by  MAS\r\n\r\ngranting Hong Leong Finance an exemption from section  23\r\n\r\nof  the  Finance Companies Act, enabling  it  to  provide\r\n\r\nunsecured  loans  of  up  to  0.5%  of  its  capital   to\r\n\r\ncustomers.  This exemption is important as it facilitates\r\n\r\ntheir  lending  to start-ups that are unable  to  provide\r\n\r\ncollateral.   More  recently, OCBC has also  adopted  the\r\n\r\nlending   methodology  of  Hong  Kong's  SME  Loan   that\r\n\r\nspecialises in cash-flow financing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Private equity exchange. The Second Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, Mr Lim Hng Kiang,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  during  the MOF's Committee of Supply that  parties\r\n\r\nwho  find  it viable will be allowed to operate  one,  if\r\n\r\nthey  meet  MAS' regulatory requirements.   I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  some interested Singapore parties are looking  into\r\n\r\nthis.  EDB and MAS will facilitate, where necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Credit rating bureau. The Association of Banks\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is currently looking into how  best  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Angel matching network. SPRING is actively\r\n\r\nexploring  this with a few private entities  to  see  how\r\n\r\nbest to match the SMEs with angel investors.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Modification to existing schemes. Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh  has  mentioned some of these, eg, Local Enterprise\r\n\r\nFinancing  Scheme  (LEFS)  and  the  Start-up  Enterprise\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Scheme  (SEEDS).   SPRING  is  working  with\r\n\r\nseveral venture capital companies to see how LEFS can  be\r\n\r\nused  for hybrid financing like convertible loans. SEEDS,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  started  to  help innovative  start-ups  with\r\n\r\nequity   funding,   will  now   be   extended   to   non-technopreneurial companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the other issues raised by Members.\r\n\r\nMr  Leong  Horn  Kee has asked for details  on  the  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  that  the  Government is  putting  into  growing\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies and helping them to venture  abroad.\r\n\r\nThe bulk or $399 million will go towards LEFS, the Micro-loan  scheme and the Loan Insurance Scheme.   2,400  SMEs\r\n\r\nare  expected to benefit from these schemes in  FY  2003.\r\n\r\n$42  million  will  be allocated to the Local  Enterprise\r\n\r\nTechnical Assistance Scheme (LETAS) which will help  some\r\n\r\n3,000  SMEs  upgrade  their  business  capabilities   and\r\n\r\nrestructure their operations. The rest is for  SEEDS  and\r\n\r\nIE   Singapore's   activities  to  help   Singapore-based\r\n\r\ncompanies internationalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Mr Arthur Fong and Dr Gan See Khem\r\n\r\nthat our SME assistance schemes are periodically reviewed\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  they stay relevant.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nperformance of LEFS and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  loan terms and conditions are regularly reviewed  by\r\n\r\nthe  LEFS  Credit Committee, which comprises  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  members.  Adjustments are  made  to  the\r\n\r\nscheme, in the light of changing conditions, to meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of SMEs. For example, the conditions were  relaxed\r\n\r\nand the interest rates lowered during the Asian financial\r\n\r\ncrisis at the last recession.  The Micro-loan scheme  was\r\n\r\nalso  started  as  a result of a review to  better  serve\r\n\r\nsmall enterprises.  This explains why LEFS has been  very\r\n\r\npopular   with  the  number  of  successful  applications\r\n\r\ndoubling from 1,586 in 2001 to 3,632 last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also developed new schemes to groom our\r\n\r\ngrowing    enterprises.    For   example,   the   Growing\r\n\r\nEnterprises with Technology Upgrading Initiative (GET-Up)\r\n\r\nwas  launched  last  month.  This scheme  pools  together\r\n\r\nresources  and expertise from A*STAR, EDB, IE and  SPRING\r\n\r\nto  provide  comprehensive assistance to enterpreneurs  - covering  innovations, technology development, capability\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  venturing  overseas.   GET-Up   takes   a\r\n\r\nproactive  approach. Senior officers  from  the  agencies\r\n\r\nvisit  the growing enterprises to understand their  needs\r\n\r\nand offer customised assistance.  They have visited about\r\n\r\n100 companies in the first two months of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new programme that will be implemented in\r\n\r\nApril   is   a   $10  million  Locally-based   Enterprise\r\n\r\nAdvancement  Programme  (LEAP). We  have,  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nprovided  assistance  to MNCs and GLCs  who  have  helped\r\n\r\nupgrade   SMEs.    LEAP  will  be   used   to   encourage\r\n\r\nmultipliers, such as industry associations and incubators\r\n\r\nto   undertake  worthwhile  projects  with  clusters   of\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Our intent is to reach out to a larger  group\r\n\r\nof companies by working with such multipliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that through these various\r\n\r\nfinancial  and upgrading programmes, many companies  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to develop new business models to enhance their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such example is 77th Street, a trend-setter for\r\n\r\nhip  streetwear  in  Singapore  and  Malaysia  which  was\r\n\r\nfeatured in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyesterday's  Straits  Times.   It  has  built   a   loyal\r\n\r\nfollowing  among the young and trendy, particularly  aged\r\n\r\nbetween 14-28.  Founded by Ms Elim Chew, who pounced upon\r\n\r\na  fashionwear  niche  which she saw  emerging   -   77th\r\n\r\nStreet grew from a small retail outlet in Far East  Plaza\r\n\r\nto  16  outlets  and another 5 joint venture  outlets  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong has suggested that we identify a few\r\n\r\nwinners and groom them to be super-entrepreneurs, like Mr\r\n\r\nSim Wong Hoo.  The problem is that the Government has  no\r\n\r\nsuperior knowledge to identify winners. Sim Wong Hoo  was\r\n\r\nnot identified by the Government.  The market did. So the\r\n\r\nmarket  is the best judge of potential winners.  However,\r\n\r\nhe  is right that, given our limited resources, we should\r\n\r\nmaximise them for the greatest impact on economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our starting point should be that companies at\r\n\r\ndifferent stages of growth have different needs.   Start-ups  are different from companies that are ready and able\r\n\r\nto internationalise.  Help will be available to companies\r\n\r\nat  different stages of their growth, but the  extent  of\r\n\r\nhelp   will  be  different.   This  approach  is  to   be\r\n\r\npreferred.   It  makes no assumption of who  the  winners\r\n\r\nwill  be and, hence, excludes no one.  It lets the market\r\n\r\ndecide,  while extending in a calibrated fashion to  help\r\n\r\nthe companies throughout their growth cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have suggested the creation of a one-stop SME agency, including reviving the old idea of\r\n\r\nmerging  IE  Singapore and SPRING Singapore. The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  has  pointed out that SPRING Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\ndesignated SME agency. However, based on their  feedback,\r\n\r\nMTI will see how best to enhance what SPRING is doing  so\r\n\r\nas  to increase the convenience and comprehensiveness  of\r\n\r\nits  service to SMEs and better coordinate with the other\r\n\r\nagencies  like  IE Singapore.  But let us have  realistic\r\n\r\nexpectations here. There are crucial differences  between\r\n\r\nEDB  that targets the MNCs that it wants to bring in, and\r\n\r\nan  SME  agency that caters to about 100,000  firms  with\r\n\r\nvery diverse needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has asked what are our next steps. There\r\n\r\nare three.  First, we will look into implementing the ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations  on  entrepreneurship   as   quickly   as\r\n\r\npossible.  Second, we will take stock  of  the  different\r\n\r\nschemes and the work done by the various agencies to  see\r\n\r\nhow  best  to  position them to promote entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThird, to Mr Leong's question as to whether there will be\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  inputs, the answer is \"Yes\".   Promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship   must  be  done  in  partnership   with\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs as it is an iterative process  where  ideas\r\n\r\nmust  be  validated, some discarded as they may not  work\r\n\r\nout as intended, and new ones adopted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have suggested setting up a statutory board\r\n\r\nto  promote entrepreneurship.  I feel that the last thing\r\n\r\nwe  want  to promote entrepreneurship is to bureaucratise\r\n\r\nthe  process and that is why I think it is apt  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in charge of Entrepreneurship is one without  a\r\n\r\nMinistry.   It gives a lot more flexibility to do  things\r\n\r\nand  not  be  weighed down by entrenched wisdom.    There\r\n\r\nwould,  of  course, be a core resource group  which  will\r\n\r\ncome  from  MTI, but it would include other agencies  and\r\n\r\nprivate sector participation.  Mr Leong Horn Kee asked if\r\n\r\nthere are any outcome indicators to track the success  of\r\n\r\nour  entrepreneurship methods.  We are watching a  number\r\n\r\nof indicators, some of which include the number of start-ups,  the  number of companies that grow  and  eventually\r\n\r\ninternationalise,   and  their   contributions   to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the longer term impact of achieving the\r\n\r\ncultural shifts that I mentioned earlier will have to  be\r\n\r\nmeasured in a more qualitative way.  Ultimately,  I  hope\r\n\r\nto  see  entrepreneurship become a part of our  society's\r\n\r\nDNA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has asked whether or not I should also be\r\n\r\nthe  SME Minister.  Since taking up my appointment as the\r\n\r\nMinister  in charge of Entrepreneurship, there have  been\r\n\r\nnumerous suggestions that I be patron of many things.  If\r\n\r\nyou  read the Forum page, you will see that.  But I  have\r\n\r\ntremendous confidence in my Ministerial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolleagues and the Ministry of Trade and Industry who are\r\n\r\nalready looking after our SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been asked when the position of Minister\r\n\r\nin  charge of Entrepreneurship will no longer be  needed.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the Budget debate, we will know that we have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  when  Singaporeans look to the market,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  the Government, to make their decisions.   That  is\r\n\r\nthe final acid test.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  his very vibrant, animated  and  enriching\r\n\r\ndiscourse   on  the  future  strategies  for   Singapore.\r\n\r\nNotably,  I hope that his idea that Singapore can  become\r\n\r\nthe  London  of  Asia will arouse high  public  interest.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  media will want to launch a  great  public\r\n\r\ndebate  on  this idea.

The formation of the Singapore Business Federation\r\n\r\nhas  led to some disquiet in the business community. Many\r\n\r\nfelt  that  the aim for the business community  to  speak\r\n\r\nwith  one  voice  has  not been achieved.   Some  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community felt that there was little  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Business Federation could do for them and  were\r\n\r\nconfused  by  what seems to be overlapping roles  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Federation  and  other  chambers  of\r\n\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that they could not afford to feast in\r\n\r\nthis economic downturn but,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  main, many are questioning, especially  in  this\r\n\r\npoor   economic  environment,  what  has  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness Federation done to spur business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had a meeting with the GPC Resource Panel\r\n\r\nfor  MTI and they have also expressed similar views.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, many businessmen are wondering, in the light of\r\n\r\nthe  world  expo  to be held in Shanghai,  what  has  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Business  Federation  done  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  businesses are well-represented  there.   What\r\n\r\nleg  work has the Singapore Business Federation  done  to\r\n\r\ngive  Singapore business a leg-up on the competition from\r\n\r\nother countries? Sir, the Singapore Business Federation's\r\n\r\nannual budget for membership fees alone is expected to be\r\n\r\nabout $6 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a moral obligation to take extra measures to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the activities undertaken by the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  Federation  are  in the  interest  of  all  its\r\n\r\nmembers.   We should put in place an apparatus to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Business Federation has fully met  the\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  its  members.  I propose  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up  an  independent  body,   call   it\r\n\r\nombudsman if you like, to assess the performance  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business Federation in promoting business  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  business over a specific timeframe.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State in charge of Entrepreneurship could\r\n\r\ntake this review under his wing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I answer Mr Arthur\r\n\r\nFong's  question with a certain reluctance.   SBF  is  an\r\n\r\nautonomous   federation.   It  is   under   parliamentary\r\n\r\noversight  only  to  the extent that we  have  under  law\r\n\r\nprovided  for compulsory membership.  In order to  buffer\r\n\r\nthe  Federation from us, when we legislated, we  provided\r\n\r\nfor a board of trustees. I am reluctant to be telling SBF\r\n\r\nwhat they should do.  I do not think it is right that  we\r\n\r\nshould  set  up  an  ombudsman or some such  facility  to\r\n\r\noversee  what  the SBF does.  It should be an  autonomous\r\n\r\nindependent federation, looking after the interest of its\r\n\r\nmembers  and operating independently from the  Government\r\n\r\nand, if necessary, criticising us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I would certainly convey to\r\n\r\nthe  SBF  the views raised by Mr Arthur Fong,  but  as  a\r\n\r\npostbox.  I think that is the type of relationship for us\r\n\r\nto establish with the SBF. We took the decision to put it\r\n\r\nunder  legislation  with  great reluctance  because,  for\r\n\r\nyears,  we tried to create an apex body but we could  not\r\n\r\nbreak  through  the  existing chambers  which  have  been\r\n\r\nestablished over time.  So, finally, at their request, we\r\n\r\nmoved  legislation and since it has only been a year,  we\r\n\r\nshould give the SBF some time to find its footing and  to\r\n\r\nestablish a pattern of activities.  I can tell you  this,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am  involved in it: SBF has  expressed  great\r\n\r\ninterest to explain to its members the FTAs which we have\r\n\r\nconcluded and to collect views from its members  on  what\r\n\r\nwe should demand of the FTAs that we are negotiating.  In\r\n\r\nthe  coming  months,  SBF will be carrying  out  a  whole\r\n\r\nseries  of  measures to explain and do work on the  FTAs.\r\n\r\nMTI  has told the SBF that we will support them fully  in\r\n\r\nthese activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Tan Soo Khoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code VN 3100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, Singapore attracted some 7.57\r\n\r\nmillion  visitors, marginally more than the  7.5  million\r\n\r\nfigure  for  the previous year.  However, there  are  two\r\n\r\ndisturbing  trends.   First, tourism receipts  have  been\r\n\r\nestimated to be only $9 billion, a decline of 5% over the\r\n\r\npeak some years ago, and that is a $1 billion loss to our\r\n\r\neconomy.   Second, the average length of stay of visitors\r\n\r\nwas  3.2  days per visitor, and this is a steady  decline\r\n\r\nfrom  the  peak figure of 3.9 days chalked  up  in  1991.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the past few years we have heard a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlot  about  different ways to boost tourism, eg,  Tourism\r\n\r\nMaster Plan, Tourism Blueprint, Tourism Task Force,  etc,\r\n\r\nit  appears to me that we have reached a kind of dead-end\r\n\r\nas  to  what we can actually do to give a boost  to  this\r\n\r\nsector of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the difficulty is similar to what we face in\r\n\r\nother  aspects  of the economy - that we are  faced  with\r\n\r\nimmense competition from other destinations that are  not\r\n\r\njust only cheaper, but are probably more attractive.   In\r\n\r\nthe  three  areas of interest for your average  tourists,\r\n\r\nie,  sightseeing, shopping and dining, other places  have\r\n\r\ncaught  up  with us, and are probably outdoing  us.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge  for  us now is to find niches to differentiate\r\n\r\nourselves  from  others.   We  must  focus  on  a  unique\r\n\r\nidentity   and  offer  something  not  easily   available\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  say, a product or a service, or an experience\r\n\r\nthat  the  tourists  can  only  get  here  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\notherwise why would they come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have made some dubious efforts, like\r\n\r\nthe  redoing  of Chinatown, resulting in what  I  call  a\r\n\r\n\"sanitised  version\"  of  Chinatown.   Many  visitors   I\r\n\r\nbrought  there  are simply not impressed with  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  seen  because they said there are better Chinatowns\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   But  let  us take a look  at  Little  India.\r\n\r\nLuckily,  we  have not tried to remake Little  India  too\r\n\r\nmuch.   It  is so naturally attractive, and that  is  why\r\n\r\nmany   visitors,  including  Singaporeans,  flock  there.\r\n\r\nSometimes you need a little of messiness to make a  place\r\n\r\nattractive.   Maybe sometimes it is best to leave  things\r\n\r\nalone.   So,  I would like to hear from the Minister  how\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Tourism Board is tackling this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area I would like to highlight is the increasing\r\n\r\nnumber  of visitors from China and India.  China  is  now\r\n\r\nour third largest visitor generating market, with 670,000\r\n\r\nvisitors last year, up 35% from the previous year.   They\r\n\r\nspent, on the average, $201 per visitor per day, that  is\r\n\r\nthe  third highest number amongst the spenders.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the  Board to continue  to  step  up  its\r\n\r\npromotion  to the Chinese market with activities  similar\r\n\r\nto  the one that was recently done - the Tourism Carnival\r\n\r\nin Guangzhou.  Sir, I was not able\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  get  figures  of how many days the  Chinese  tourists\r\n\r\nspend  in  Singapore, but I understand that it  could  be\r\n\r\nless  than the average of 3.2 days.  This is because they\r\n\r\nfind  that Singapore is a bit too expensive for them  and\r\n\r\nmany  tour agents are using Singapore as a quick stopover\r\n\r\nbefore whisking them off to nearby destinations.  This is\r\n\r\na  pity.   Hong Kong last year attracted over  4  million\r\n\r\nvisitors  from China.  That is about 34% of  their  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  visitors.  Many of these  are  high  spending\r\n\r\ntourists,  buying  high  value items.   So  it  has  been\r\n\r\nforecasted that in the year 2020 some 100 million Chinese\r\n\r\nwould be packing their bags and travelling abroad.   This\r\n\r\nis a vast market that we have to tap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem facing Chinese tourists is their\r\n\r\ndifficulty of navigating around in Singapore because  the\r\n\r\nsigns  we  put  up  are not in Chinese.   I  recall  that\r\n\r\nsometime  ago  STB  was looking into the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual signboards and preparing more brochures and\r\n\r\nmaps in different languages.  Can I know what progress we\r\n\r\nhave made?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, India is another promising market. Last year\r\n\r\nwe  had  340,000  visitors from India, each  spending  an\r\n\r\naverage  of $278 per day, making them the No. 1  spending\r\n\r\nnationality.  I would like to know what plans we have  to\r\n\r\nincrease the number of visitors from this market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not have much to say on the Singapore\r\n\r\nZoological  Gardens  because events  have  overtaken  us,\r\n\r\nexcept  to  say that many Singaporeans are relieved  that\r\n\r\nthey have backed down on the proposal to change the name.\r\n\r\nThey  wanted to spend something like $100,000  to  change\r\n\r\ntheir  name and $400,000 for the signs.  That is  exactly\r\n\r\nthe  point  I was making last year.  It is not  just  the\r\n\r\nmoney on changing a name.  You spend many more times that\r\n\r\namount just to effect the change.  Last year, I mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  the changes of organisations to names like A*Star,\r\n\r\nSPRING  Singapore,  IE Singapore.   Today  I  still  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  explaining to people  what  happened  to  our\r\n\r\nTrade  Development Board.  When I tell them it is  called\r\n\r\nIE, they look at me with some amazement.  I notice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  all  these organisations which have  changed  their\r\n\r\nnames, and also the zoo, are all under the same Ministry.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that we do not change the name for the  sake  of\r\n\r\nchanging  the  name, because there is an  attraction  and\r\n\r\nvalue to old names.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, for example, names like\r\n\r\nRobinsons, Cold Storage, and as mentioned just now, Khong\r\n\r\nGuan  Biscuits, these are all venerable names with value.\r\n\r\nSo I hope somebody does not wake up one day and take on a\r\n\r\nflight  of  fancy  and  say that since  we  are  remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore,  maybe  we  should  change  our  name  because\r\n\r\nSingapore  sounds so 19th century.  I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill make sure that this does not happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon\r\n\r\nraised  two  important points about the  tourism  sector.\r\n\r\nOne  is  that the total tourism receipts have been  on  a\r\n\r\ndeclining  trend  for  a number of  years  now,  and  the\r\n\r\naverage  number of days that they stay in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nalso come down.  The situation has been made worse by the\r\n\r\nAsian  financial  crisis, the global  economic  downturn,\r\n\r\nSeptember  11, then Bali, and so it is a whole series  of\r\n\r\nknocks which the industry has suffered from.  But, we are\r\n\r\nnot doing badly, and the number of visitors has continued\r\n\r\nto trend upwards to over 7 million tourists, which is not\r\n\r\nbad  for a city-state of 4 million people.  The fact that\r\n\r\nthey  are  staying  fewer  days in  Singapore  is  partly\r\n\r\nbecause we have become a very efficient switch.   So,  if\r\n\r\nyou are doing business here, you are exhibiting here, you\r\n\r\ncarve  up  your  time  finely.  You land,  SIA  flies  in\r\n\r\npunctually, in so many minutes you are in town,  do  your\r\n\r\nbusiness, whatever, stay one night if necessary, if  not,\r\n\r\nyou are off.  So, in that sense, that cannot be helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, there are new opportunities arising principally\r\n\r\nfrom  all  the developments around us, and the growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  middle-classes.  The Chinese are travelling in  huge\r\n\r\nnumbers  and this is just the beginning.  When I  was  in\r\n\r\nXian  two  years  ago, I asked them,  \"How  many  foreign\r\n\r\ntourists?\"   They  said, \"800,000\".  I asked,  \"How  many\r\n\r\nChinese  tourists?\"  They said, \"30 million.\"   All  over\r\n\r\nChina now, internal tourism is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrising spectacularly.  What we are seeing is just an over-spill from what is happening within China itself.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe same thing in India.  So we are working very hard  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the Chinese market.  It has been growing  double\r\n\r\ndigits.   We  expect it to reach 1 million  by  the  year\r\n\r\n2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially they are mostly here on cheap tours. Some\r\n\r\nare  on zero cost tours, which means they sign up for the\r\n\r\ntour,  they pay nothing, but when they come in here  they\r\n\r\nare  brought shopping.  They are milked at each  shopping\r\n\r\ncentre.  They do not see our museums and, before you know\r\n\r\nit,  they are off to Malaysia, Thailand and then back  to\r\n\r\nChina.   They spend.  Many buy gold, not because gold  is\r\n\r\nexpensive  in China, but because they want to bring  back\r\n\r\nsouvenirs.  But that market is fast changing and  we  are\r\n\r\nfinding now more Chinese tourists coming in as individual\r\n\r\ntravellers and they are going for more diverse  products.\r\n\r\nSo  we have got to keep up with the changes and make sure\r\n\r\nthat  we  move with the higher value tourists.  So,  this\r\n\r\nyear, STB will be conducting major publicity campaigns in\r\n\r\nboth India and China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian tourists are here mostly as individual\r\n\r\ntravellers.  They come with family members and relatives,\r\n\r\nyou  can  see them all over Singapore and they stay  here\r\n\r\nmuch  longer.   And, per head, they spend more  than  any\r\n\r\nother  category.  That is partly because they  stay  here\r\n\r\nlonger.   I  am  amazed, whenever  I  go  to  India,  how\r\n\r\nfavourably  they look at us.  And not only as a  shopping\r\n\r\nemporium - yes, all of them have heard of Mustafa  -  but\r\n\r\nit  is  no  longer  just Mustafa now.  So,  we  are  also\r\n\r\nstepping  up  our  tourism efforts  in  India,  including\r\n\r\ninvolving  some  of  their Bollywood stars,  and  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  get Singapore more featured in  some  of  the\r\n\r\nfilms produced in Bombay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are many things that we should do, there\r\n\r\nare  many  opportunities,  and I hope that in the  coming\r\n\r\nyears  we  will see many more Chinese and Indian tourists\r\n\r\ncoming  here  and they will give a strong  boost  to  our\r\n\r\ntourism industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan mentioned that we should consider new and\r\n\r\nmore  interesting  products  because  shopping  is  down.\r\n\r\nShopping may be down generally, but we continue to be the\r\n\r\nNew  York  of  Southeast  Asia, as  far  as  shopping  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.   People  come here for  diversity.   When  we\r\n\r\nspeak  to  the  golfers, they say they can get  different\r\n\r\nrange   of   golf  clubs  in  Singapore.   One  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinister's  wife told me that she shopped  for  her  toys\r\n\r\nalong  Orchard Road.  I said, \"Surely, you  can  get  the\r\n\r\nsame toys in Kuala Lumpur.\"  She said, \"No, you have  got\r\n\r\nmore  range here.\"  So we are finding more such  flagship\r\n\r\nstores relative to the rest of Southeast Asia and this is\r\n\r\nhow we are seeing the development of Orchard Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we try to boost Chinatown. I do not think we\r\n\r\nshould  do  nothing.   We have  cleaned  it  up.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomewhat  sanitised now.  Recently, we opened a  Heritage\r\n\r\nMuseum.  It is not bad  -  old shophouses showing the old\r\n\r\n`coolie keng', and it has received a good response.   The\r\n\r\nother  things  that we are doing may take a while  longer\r\n\r\nbefore we see everything come together.  But, we are  not\r\n\r\nletting up on our efforts on Chinatown.  Little India can\r\n\r\nbe a little cleaner, but we should not over-sanitise it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other products we should consider and we\r\n\r\nare  working on them.  For example, we take Jurong Island\r\n\r\nfor  granted.   But Jurong Island is a remarkable  place.\r\n\r\nIf  you  are  a student who studies chemistry or  organic\r\n\r\nchemistry  in school, it is a fascinating site to  visit.\r\n\r\nRight  now, of course, because of September 11  there  is\r\n\r\ntight  security.  But we are working on tour buses  going\r\n\r\nto  the Exhibition Centre on Jurong Island, and that  may\r\n\r\nbring  in tourists from various countries, and really  it\r\n\r\nis  one  of a few such sites, anywhere in the  world.   I\r\n\r\nhave  been to the site in Pernis, near Rotterdam, and  it\r\n\r\nis  not  half as attractive as Jurong Island.  At  night,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  see the lights, it is magical.  But, I  am  not\r\n\r\npromoting  Jurong Island.  I would let STB do  it.   And,\r\n\r\neven our NEWater plant, I told Lim Swee Say, \"Look, I see\r\n\r\na  tourism opportunity there.  Let them try it and  maybe\r\n\r\nsell some souvenir products - NEWater from Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nmay make some money along the way.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we found that visitors from Mainland China\r\n\r\nwere interested to experience staying in HDB estates.  We\r\n\r\nwill  convert a few blocks of HDB flats for them and make\r\n\r\nsome  money  in  the  process and gain some  reputational\r\n\r\nbenefit  for Singapore along the way.  So there are  many\r\n\r\nthings that we can do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, I visited Orchidville up in\r\n\r\nMandai.   It  is  an orchid farm.  Our orchids  are  high\r\n\r\nquality  orchids.   When they reach the Japanese  market,\r\n\r\nthey  fetch twice the price of orchids from Indonesia  or\r\n\r\nBangkok.   I  asked them why.  They said, \"Well,  because\r\n\r\nthey are all the same length, all have the same number of\r\n\r\npetals,  same number of buds, opened and unopened.\"   And\r\n\r\nit  is  a high quality operation.  The owner, because  he\r\n\r\nwas  facing the pinch from the economic downturn, decided\r\n\r\nto  open  his orchid farm to Japanese tourists.  So  they\r\n\r\ncome, they are happy to cut the orchids.  They do not cut\r\n\r\nthem  well, so he throws in a few of his own sprays, then\r\n\r\nwhen they bring them back to Japan, those that are cut by\r\n\r\nthe tourists they do not perform so well.  Those that  he\r\n\r\nput into the boxes they look better.  So everything looks\r\n\r\nmuch  better, and in the process he makes more money  for\r\n\r\nhimself.   He  has  got  a little coffee-house  there,  a\r\n\r\nrestaurant and, in so doing, he bundles services into his\r\n\r\nproduct and ups the value of his products.  So, to answer\r\n\r\nMr Tan Soo Khoon, there are many things that we can do to\r\n\r\nmake  tourism more lively in Singapore and to  gain  more\r\n\r\neconomic benefit out from it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the zoo, MTI was asked to take over\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the funding of the zoo only from  this\r\n\r\nyear.   I would not like to answer for some of the  ideas\r\n\r\nthat have been floated.  Maybe, next year I would.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Maybe I should remind the Minister\r\n\r\nthat there is a saying that says if you pay peanuts,  you\r\n\r\nget  monkeys.

Workers at all levels\r\n\r\nare  hit,  both blue-collar workers and executives.   The\r\n\r\nway  to address the problem is clearly workers' training.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, I am glad that the DPM announced that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  establish a statutory board  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  to enhance  the  development  and\r\n\r\npromotion  of  continuing  education  and  training   for\r\n\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although our economy is down and unemployment\r\n\r\nis  high,  there  is  never a better  time  to  encourage\r\n\r\nworkers and Singaporeans to go for skills upgrading.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  is  a window of opportunity  that  we  must\r\n\r\nexplore.   We  must use this slack period to enhance  our\r\n\r\ncapability and employability of our workers.   This  way,\r\n\r\nwe will be better prepared when the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last year, the Ministry has stepped up its\r\n\r\nemployment   assistance  programmes  in   various   ways.\r\n\r\nProgrammes   such  as  the  People-for-Jobs   Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme, Work Skills Training Programme and  the  Self-Employment Training Programme were implemented.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister what has the feedback been on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  programmes.  How many workers  were  helped?   And\r\n\r\nwhat more the Ministry plans to do to help retrenched and\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers, particularly for  this  round  where\r\n\r\nboth blue-collar workers and executives are affected?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the Home page of\r\n\r\ntoday's Straits Times really sums it all, as far as  jobs\r\n\r\nare  concerned.  This will be another bad  year  for  the\r\n\r\njobless,  and firm recovery is expected only  next  year.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the issue is really one of  poor  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.   The  economy is not growing  fast  enough,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore fewer jobs are created.  In fact, for every  28\r\n\r\njob openings, there are 100 job seekers.  In other words,\r\n\r\nfor  every  one job, there are four workers chasing  that\r\n\r\none job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is easy for us to identify the reasons for\r\n\r\nthe  poor job growth.  But we have to think of the plight\r\n\r\nof   those  who  remain  unemployed.   As  the  situation\r\n\r\nworsens,  many  will get desperate and  this  will  cause\r\n\r\ninstability.  The signs that the situation will get worse\r\n\r\nare  there.   Out  of a total of 89,900  people  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed,   23,900  or  27%  of  them   are   long-term\r\n\r\nunemployment, meaning that they have been out of work for\r\n\r\nat least six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is cause for concern is that,\r\n\r\ntraditionally,  those  who  lost  their   jobs   in   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector  could find jobs  in  the  services\r\n\r\nsector.  Over the last few years, for instance, for every\r\n\r\nfour workers who were retrenched, only one came from  the\r\n\r\nservices sector.  But last year, almost one out of  every\r\n\r\ntwo  persons  who were retrenched were from the  services\r\n\r\nsector. Even the services sector is not spared.   As  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector retrenches more people, the  profile  of\r\n\r\nthose   who  are  retrenched  has  also  changed.    More\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  managers and executives have  lost  their\r\n\r\njobs  last year.  In fact, it comprises about 42% of  the\r\n\r\ntotal of those who were retrenched.  And what is worrying\r\n\r\nalso is that those who were retrenched take a longer time\r\n\r\nto find jobs, particularly the older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are larger numbers who are being\r\n\r\nretrenched, but the indications are that there  are  less\r\n\r\njobs  being  created.  In fact, the EDB said that  20,900\r\n\r\njobs  will  be created over the next five years.  Out  of\r\n\r\nthese,  18,000 jobs will be created by sectors like  bio-medical  sciences,  chemicals, infocomms  and  the  media\r\n\r\nsectors.  But if we look at the bio-medical cluster,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  they employ only about 7,000 jobs.   So,  jobs\r\n\r\nare  created  but the numbers are smaller and  these  are\r\n\r\nalso higher value added jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the questions that I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  are  these.   What is  the  general  employment\r\n\r\noutlook, where are the jobs being created, and what  kind\r\n\r\nof  jobs are these?  Will there be enough jobs to  absorb\r\n\r\nall the unemployed workers?  What about prospects for the\r\n\r\nolder and semi-skilled workers?  Are there jobs for them?\r\n\r\nWhat is the manpower planning and projection for the next\r\n\r\nthree years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the situation is not getting better - in\r\n\r\nfact,  it sounds pretty grim  -  I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to revisit this issue of quotas  for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   I know, sometimes, if we raise this issue,  it\r\n\r\nis  almost heretical, and I think there will be a lot  of\r\n\r\nunhappy employers.  But I would like to argue a case  for\r\n\r\nus  to  revisit  the  quotas  for  foreign  workers.   My\r\n\r\nargument, basically, is this.  The quotas were set  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  we had high economic growth, low unemployment\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  the situation was much more  different.\r\n\r\nStructural unemployment was not a major issue.  But  now,\r\n\r\nas  the situation worsens, we are expected to have slower\r\n\r\ngrowth.  The long-term unemployment will increase between\r\n\r\n3-5%,  and structural unemployment will be a major  issue\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  lost  their jobs.  There  will  be  jobs\r\n\r\ncreated in Singapore.  Investments will come in but these\r\n\r\nwill  be high-value added and high-skilled jobs.   So,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is necessary that we revisit this issue,  even\r\n\r\nthough  we may not immediately change the quotas,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  there is really a need to revisit and see what  we\r\n\r\nneed to do.  Because it does not really make sense for us\r\n\r\nto continue to have large numbers of foreign workers when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans themselves are unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, at my MPS, a 75-year old lady came to\r\n\r\nsee  me  and  she  asked for a job as a cleaner.   I  was\r\n\r\nrather  surprised because I thought she earned the  right\r\n\r\nto retire at the age of 75.  But she told me that her son\r\n\r\nhad  lost  his job, and as he could not get another  job,\r\n\r\nshe  had  no source of income.  So, I think the situation\r\n\r\nis  getting pretty desperate for some people,  and  I  do\r\n\r\nurge  that  when  we look at statistics and  figures,  we\r\n\r\nremember  there are faces, there are families, there  are\r\n\r\nproblems behind those statistics and figures, and that we\r\n\r\nwill really put in a lot more effort to ensure people get\r\n\r\nwork  and  remain employed.  As it is, my firm belief  is\r\n\r\nthat the greatest dignity that we can give to a person is\r\n\r\na job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I do hope for a response from the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, even as Singapore has to\r\n\r\ngrapple  with  the  challenges of an  uncertain  economic\r\n\r\nlandscape  and rising unemployment, it is also  important\r\n\r\nfor us to focus on the ingredients that will be important\r\n\r\nfor us in the future.  One of the key ingredients is that\r\n\r\nof  training  and skills upgrading.  In this  context,  I\r\n\r\nwelcome   the  formation  of  an  agency  for  continuing\r\n\r\neducation and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make four suggestions towards the\r\n\r\nplanning of the scope of work of this agency and also  to\r\n\r\nmake one request.  The suggestions are that in drawing up\r\n\r\nits  scope  of work, that priority be placed,  first,  on\r\n\r\nways   to  further  promote  the  funding  of  individual\r\n\r\ninitiated training and skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to find better ways to understand how adults\r\n\r\nlearn and, therefore, find better ways to help them learn\r\n\r\nand develop different methodologies for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to find better ways to stimulate the demand\r\n\r\nfor  training,  both from companies and  individuals.   I\r\n\r\nknow  that,  over  the  years, the  number  of  companies\r\n\r\nsending their workers for training, as well as the number\r\n\r\nof  individuals who have taken up training on their  own,\r\n\r\nhave both increased.  However, there is a need to further\r\n\r\npromote the demand.  It is always\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neasier  to put in the money to create the infrastructure,\r\n\r\nto  create  the  training places, but it is  always  more\r\n\r\nchallenging to overcome the different hurdles to get  the\r\n\r\ndemand up.  I think this is an area for closer study  and\r\n\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in the area of job placement, job\r\n\r\ncounselling  as  a  capability is relatively  lacking  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and this is the result of our many  years  of\r\n\r\nmore than full employment.  And it is different from  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  social counselling that family service  centres\r\n\r\ncan  provide.  So, this is a capability that we  have  to\r\n\r\ngrow, and I urge the agency to put this as a priority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My request is in terms of the timeframe for setting\r\n\r\nup  of this agency.  I understand that, currently, we are\r\n\r\nlooking  at 6-9 months from today.  I hope that it  could\r\n\r\nbe speeded up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, as many Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse have noted, taking care of careers these days means\r\n\r\nmanaging   perpetual  motion.   Promotion  of  continuing\r\n\r\neducation  and  training  of  Singapore  workers  as  the\r\n\r\neconomy restructures is a critical move by the Government\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  our workers keep up with  the  changing\r\n\r\nneeds of their jobs as organisations re-shape, shift  and\r\n\r\nflex  themselves to fit our rapidly changing world.   Our\r\n\r\nworkers must understand that this is the only way for the\r\n\r\norganisations  they work in to survive in  this  fiercely\r\n\r\ncompetitive  environment.

I  know\r\n\r\nthat the ITE works closely with Government agencies, such\r\n\r\nas  the EDB, IDA, SPRING Singapore and, more importantly,\r\n\r\nwith  the  advisory council on continuing  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining  -  a tripartite body comprising representatives\r\n\r\nfrom MOM, NTUC, SNEF, SCI and also private organisations,\r\n\r\nto  identify  areas  of  manpower shortages  in  specific\r\n\r\nindustries and also assess the needs and demands for  new\r\n\r\ncertifiable  skills.  Sir, it is therefore  evident  that\r\n\r\nample   opportunities   exist  for   mature   and   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to benefit from CET.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all these tremendous efforts, I still\r\n\r\nhear  frequent  rumblings in this House about  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans grumbling about their inability to find jobs\r\n\r\nafter going for skills upgrading or learning a new skill.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a disconnect here, Sir.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister for Manpower to consider  reviewing\r\n\r\nthe  current CET framework and, particularly,  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat Singaporeans are learning and re-skilling themselves\r\n\r\nin the areas demanded by employers and by the industries.\r\n\r\nFor  unemployed  Singaporeans, a centralised  CET  agency\r\n\r\nshould guide them and match them with skills which better\r\n\r\nsuit  their personality and learning abilities. All these\r\n\r\ncould  perhaps  be undertaken by the new statutory  board\r\n\r\nunder   MOM  which,  I  believe,  is  meant  to   address\r\n\r\nemployment issues and training of workers.  Many millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars  are  being poured into  CET,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nappropriate   thing   to   do  to   overcome   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  but I see the effort as being  ineffective\r\n\r\nif unemployed Singaporeans still cannot get jobs.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to congratulate\r\n\r\nMOM for the setup of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCET  Board  that  will  ensure  continuous  training  and\r\n\r\neducation for employees to enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to Chapter 13 of the recommendations in\r\n\r\nthe ERC Report.  I have six issues which I would like  to\r\n\r\nraise  and  which I hope MOM will take into consideration\r\n\r\nwhen  planning the agency.  Issue 1, is on the  scope  of\r\n\r\ncoverage, as defined in the write-up.  The whole write-up\r\n\r\nrefers to workers, leaving out the entire segment of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce  that  constitutes PMEs.  This segment  of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  is  growing and is anticipated  to  constitute\r\n\r\nabout 60% of the workforce in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the critically important role played\r\n\r\nby   this   workforce   segment   in   our   increasingly\r\n\r\nsophisticated knowledge-based economy, would it not  make\r\n\r\nbetter sense to reflect their importance in the write-up?\r\n\r\nI  would  like to propose that the write-up take  a  more\r\n\r\nglobal tone to reflect the PMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 2 will be on the programmes drawn up for PMEs.\r\n\r\nWhat  types  of programmes will be in place  in  the  new\r\n\r\nagency  that  will be suitable and be made  available  to\r\n\r\nPMEs?   How  will the training needs analysis be  carried\r\n\r\nout  for  in-service employees and economically  inactive\r\n\r\nPMEs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third issue, can MOM clarify the specific\r\n\r\ndifferences between the statutory board on CET  and  CAL?\r\n\r\nTo the public, there appears to be no distinction.  Also,\r\n\r\nhow  would  these two entities relate to SPRING Singapore\r\n\r\nand PSB Corp?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth issue, the Government has often been\r\n\r\ntold  that  it must give space to the small timers  among\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  a chance to grow and flourish and not  compete\r\n\r\nwith  them  unnecessarily.  How would the activities  and\r\n\r\nfunctions  which  the  CET and CAL seek  to  provide,  as\r\n\r\noutlined  in  Chapter  13, impact  the  various  economic\r\n\r\nentities,   presently  providing  similar  services   and\r\n\r\nfunctions?   How can the small consultancy  and  training\r\n\r\nproviders survive with increased competition?   If  there\r\n\r\nare benefits arising from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintervention from MOM, we must take care that  we  manage\r\n\r\nthe  small timers well.  Otherwise, we would be repeating\r\n\r\nthe  experience of the small provision shop and the super\r\n\r\nstores.   Lessons  of  the past can be  applied  in  this\r\n\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On issue 5, the Government has been told far too\r\n\r\noften  that it must shed its nanny image.  Will  not  the\r\n\r\nsetup  of  the CET and CAL, even with the best intentions\r\n\r\nto   facilitate  the  market  and  industry,  signal  the\r\n\r\npaternalistic attitude of the Government which many  fear\r\n\r\nmay be misplaced in this particular area at this time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, with unemployment hovering between 4%\r\n\r\nand  5%,  many Singaporeans have been urged  to  consider\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship and self-employment as an option.   Will\r\n\r\nnot  the  setup of these two entities steal away some  of\r\n\r\ntheir chances?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, continuing\r\n\r\neducation and training is a new name in this new economy.\r\n\r\nIn  the  old  economy,  we call this  lifelong  learning.\r\n\r\nThus,  continuing education and learning  is  not  a  new\r\n\r\nconcept, but the Government's determination is new and it\r\n\r\nis news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement has been talking about this\r\n\r\nconcept  of  continuing education and training  for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  and  lately,  lifelong  learning  has  become   a\r\n\r\nfestival - Lifelong Learning Festival.  In fact, in  many\r\n\r\nof  the  stories we read during our childhood  days,  our\r\n\r\nancestors  were  talking  about  how  to  keep  ourselves\r\n\r\nrelevant to the time and to the organisation, and have an\r\n\r\nadvantage over our competitors or rivals through lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, most Singaporeans, except the\r\n\r\nbo  chap  group,  know the importance  of  CET  and  many\r\n\r\nretrenched workers, including the PMEs, regret very  much\r\n\r\nthat they do not have the relevant skills to take on  the\r\n\r\nnew  jobs  available.   Other workers,  who  fear  to  be\r\n\r\nretrenched, hope that they can reskill themselves as soon\r\n\r\nas  possible.  Thus, the annoucement of the CET statutory\r\n\r\nboard\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis hope to many.  However, I would caution that we should\r\n\r\nbe  pragmatic  and  realistic and set  our  priority  and\r\n\r\ntarget  right.  The main objectives of the CET should  be\r\n\r\nto re-skill Singaporeans for both the new jobs in the New\r\n\r\nEconomy  or  traditional jobs which Singaporeans  in  the\r\n\r\npast  were  doing, but not doing now, and more  and  more\r\n\r\nforeign workers are doing them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, priority should be given to the industries\r\n\r\nwhich  are vulnerable to the New Economy so that  workers\r\n\r\nin these industries, as a group, can learn the new skills\r\n\r\ntogether.   Next  in line should be the companies  facing\r\n\r\nrelocation  possibilities.  We should aim at  individuals\r\n\r\nwho  will be in and out of employment in the New Economy.\r\n\r\nThe  CET  statutory board shall learn  from  our  Nanyang\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  which  caters  to  the  needs  of  the   new\r\n\r\ninvestments  coming to Singapore by working closely  with\r\n\r\nthe  industries.   In  the case of CET,  it  should  work\r\n\r\nclosely with not only the industries which are coming but\r\n\r\nalso  industries going out from Singapore so that we  can\r\n\r\nprepare our workers well in advance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenge to CET board is in fact to come\r\n\r\nout with creative marking strategies to excite workers to\r\n\r\nenrol   themselves  for  this  continuing  learning   and\r\n\r\ntraining.  MOM may want to learn from McDonalds again  on\r\n\r\nhow  it can create the herd mentality that even those who\r\n\r\nclaim  that  they had no time, no money, or the  bo  chap\r\n\r\ngroup, also queued up for the 'Hello Kitty'.  I hope that\r\n\r\nwe have a long queue for 'Hello Teacher'.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to applaud the Government for deciding\r\n\r\nto  establish a Continuing Education and Training agency.\r\n\r\nThis  agency  will  help to further focus  and  intensify\r\n\r\nefforts  to ensure that our workers are well-skilled  and\r\n\r\nremain employable.  I like to share some thoughts on this\r\n\r\nagency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the agency can play a very important role in\r\n\r\nidentifying industries and companies with ready vacancies\r\n\r\nfor  those  who go for training. It must have  a  network\r\n\r\nwith the employers to identify\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are  the job openings in the future so  that  when\r\n\r\nthey  go  for  training, they will come  out  and  become\r\n\r\nemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should put in enough resources into\r\n\r\ntraining   teachers   of  adult  learners   and   develop\r\n\r\nappropriate teaching methodologies.  So the CET  trainers\r\n\r\nshould   also   be  well-trained  in  psychological   and\r\n\r\npedagogical principles for the teaching of adults.   They\r\n\r\nshould be equipped with such skills to enthuse workers to\r\n\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the CET agency should also encourage\r\n\r\ntraining  providers  to  draw  up  curriculum   that   is\r\n\r\nappropriate for adult learners, rather than use the  same\r\n\r\ncurriculum  for  fresh  school leavers.   Otherwise,  the\r\n\r\ntraining would not be meaningful.  I think this programme\r\n\r\nshould be more flexible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should also encourage those existing\r\n\r\ntraining  providers  to  provide  a  greater  choice  and\r\n\r\nflexibility  for adult learners.  For example,  we  could\r\n\r\nhave  e-learning and a similar kind of training  to  suit\r\n\r\nthe convenience  of the would-be learners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I think the CET agency can also play a role\r\n\r\nin  modifying the attitude and behaviour of the  workers.\r\n\r\nWorkers must be trained to have a \"can do\" mindset.  They\r\n\r\nmust be determined, innovative and enterprising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, the agency will have to look into the\r\n\r\nmotivators  and demotivators for continuing education  to\r\n\r\nthrive  amongst  our  people.  One method  would  be  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of a pro-learning environment and  culture  at\r\n\r\nworkplaces.   The  agency  must  also  work  on  how   to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the mindset of  not only the workers  but  the\r\n\r\nemployers as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are so many continuing education\r\n\r\ncourses,  ranging  from  short  courses  to  certficates,\r\n\r\ndiplomas   and  degrees.   But  the  quality   of   these\r\n\r\nprogrammes varies - some are good and some are  obviously\r\n\r\na waste of time and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney.   At the same time, the diplomas obtained  by  the\r\n\r\nstudents  upon  completion of their  course  may  not  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the market.  So, with this  proposed  CET\r\n\r\nagency, we would be able to provide some guidance to  the\r\n\r\nwould-be  learners  so  that they  can  make  enlightened\r\n\r\ndecisions  when  they take up degree or  diploma  courses\r\n\r\noffered  by  the non-Government institutions.   They  can\r\n\r\ndecide whether this degree or diploma would be of use  to\r\n\r\nthem  or not. Otherwise, they will be wasting a few  tens\r\n\r\nof  thousands of dollars and, in the end, the diploma  or\r\n\r\ndegree  is  not recognised by anybody and they could  not\r\n\r\nfind a job with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the new agency should also provide\r\n\r\ncourses   which   can  serve  as  alternatives   to   the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  courses  and  distance-learning   courses\r\n\r\nwhich many of our students are pursuing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this proposed CET agency can be forward-looking\r\n\r\nand  act according to the needs of the market, I am  sure\r\n\r\nit  will go a long way in helping to enhance the standard\r\n\r\nof  training of our learners and to lead our  workers  to\r\n\r\nachieving a better standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, the announcement that a new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board is being formed for continuing education\r\n\r\nand  training  has  rasied a lot of  expectations.   Many\r\n\r\npeople expect the statutory board to fill up all the gaps\r\n\r\nthat  are currently found in our training programmes  and\r\n\r\njob  assistance plans.  I hope the statutory  board  will\r\n\r\nlive   up  to  this  expectation.   It  is  an  important\r\n\r\ndevelopment and we should give it a chance to take  root.\r\n\r\nTo  me,  it  is an important milestone in our efforts  to\r\n\r\ndevelop human capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a key challenge for this statutory board will\r\n\r\nbe  to help people to remain employable.  If jobs are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  guaranteed,  then it is important  that  we  help\r\n\r\npeople  to acquire the means to remain employed.   If  we\r\n\r\nwant  labour  market  flexibility and workers'  mobility,\r\n\r\nthen  we  must  have a system in place  to  help  workers\r\n\r\nacquire  skills, competence and the frame  of  mind  that\r\n\r\nwill prepare them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor change and help them remain continuously employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, adjustment process will be chaotic,\r\n\r\npainful  and will cause social disruption.  The CET  must\r\n\r\nhelp  workers to develop wings so that they can  navigate\r\n\r\nthrough  the  rough wind of adjustments that  is  blowing\r\n\r\nthrough  our  economy.  It must also act as a  contractor\r\n\r\nbetween workers and jobs as displacement will become more\r\n\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the CET is a move in the right\r\n\r\ndirection and will strengthen our social safety net.   As\r\n\r\nI  had  argued  on  the first day of the  debate,  as  we\r\n\r\nexamine  how to make our labour market more flexible,  we\r\n\r\nmust  also  continue to ensure that our  existing  social\r\n\r\nprotection system is adequate and move in tandem with the\r\n\r\nother changes in the labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this new statutory board will provide greater\r\n\r\nfocus  and  coordination  for  worker  training  and  job\r\n\r\nassistance.  Job assistance, for instance, had  developed\r\n\r\nmore  as  an  ad hoc programme as a result of  the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  It is obvious now that we need a  more\r\n\r\npermanent  structure  in view of the changed  environment\r\n\r\nand the problem of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that the courses the people go\r\n\r\nthrough remain relevant and useful.  There is also a need\r\n\r\nto  make sure that those who have undergone training have\r\n\r\njobs.   So there must be a link between training and  job\r\n\r\nplacement, otherwise people will get quite disillusioned.\r\n\r\nFor  this,  employers  must also  play  their  part,  not\r\n\r\nparticipate in programmes, just because they feel obliged\r\n\r\nto, but actually are not too committed to the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received some complaints from retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers who are placed on the People for Jobs Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme, for instance, that employers are reluctant  to\r\n\r\nemploy  them  after the training period  is  over.   Such\r\n\r\nexamples  will discourage people from taking up  training\r\n\r\ncourses and act as a disincentive.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Ministry will continue  to  monitor  the\r\n\r\nsituation closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not repeat the points which have been\r\n\r\nraised  or  mentioned by my colleagues, the other  labour\r\n\r\nMPs.  But I have a few points to make with regard to  the\r\n\r\nwork  of the CET.  First, is the point about drivers.   I\r\n\r\nthink all training programmes need drivers.  So having  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board and parking the training programmes under\r\n\r\nthe  board  itself,  I do not think that  alone  will  be\r\n\r\neffective.   So  I think it is necessary that  the  board\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  have drivers to drive individual  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  similar to the schemes which we already  have\r\n\r\nright now.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would also like to find out what will\r\n\r\nhappen  to  the  various  training  programmes  that  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  run  by  the various non-Government  agencies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  NTUC and the self-help groups.  Will all  these\r\n\r\nnow  come  under the new statutory board?  Perhaps,  this\r\n\r\nmay be a premature question, because the board has yet to\r\n\r\nbe  formed,  but these are some of the issues  the  board\r\n\r\nought to look into when it is formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I want to stress on the need for continued\r\n\r\nstrong  partnership of labour, Government and  employers,\r\n\r\nand  the community on the various areas to be covered  by\r\n\r\nthe CET.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I also feel that there is a need for the\r\n\r\nboard  to  remain focused and to help those who are  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable  and  at risk, such as older and  less-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel, Sir, that there is a need for better\r\n\r\noutreach  programmes, as anecdotal evidence, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the  Malay  community, seems to  suggest  that  those\r\n\r\ncoming  for  training are generally those who are  better\r\n\r\neducated, and also those who have better skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all our efforts, there will always be a\r\n\r\ngroup that will be untrainable, for whatever reasons.   I\r\n\r\nwould like also to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind out what will be the CET's approach to this group of\r\n\r\npeople, how it proposes to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another group of people that I hope the CET\r\n\r\nwill  address will be self-employed Singaporeans  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  access to training funds.  I urge the  CET  to\r\n\r\nlook also at how to allow them to gain access to training\r\n\r\nfunds, as I feel that this number will grow as our ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah Yacob, can you sum up\r\n\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir.

The two words are \"change\" and\r\n\r\n\"fast\".   In this modern society, everything is  changing\r\n\r\nmuch  faster  -  in school, at work, in business  and  in\r\n\r\nlife.   How fast does the Government change in  terms  of\r\n\r\npolicies  and strategies?  How fast do businesses  change\r\n\r\nor  improve  their products and services?   How  fast  do\r\n\r\nworkers  change  in terms of skills and attitudes  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to meet the challenges in the face of fierce global\r\n\r\ncompetition?  How do we respond to such changes in  terms\r\n\r\nof manpower policy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fast-paced society, today's jobs may be gone\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  We have to be fast to plan, respond  and  take\r\n\r\naction.   Sir,  I think it is important that  our  people\r\n\r\nshould  be fast enough to be aware of and understand  the\r\n\r\nchanges in the job market.  I would therefore like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister how does the MOM plan, in terms  of  demand\r\n\r\nand  supply  in the labour market?  How far ahead  do  we\r\n\r\nplan  for, and how often do we review our policies?   The\r\n\r\nreason  I  ask  this is that a few years  ago,  when  the\r\n\r\nJurong   Island  was  set  up,  we  had  a  shortage   of\r\n\r\ntechnicians and engineers for the petrochemical industry.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, the bio-sciences industry is the in-thing.  Do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe have enough qualified workforce to meet the demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of our labour force in the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector dropped from 27.5% in 1992 to  18.2%\r\n\r\nin  2002.  In the same period, the community and personal\r\n\r\nservices  sector percentage rose from 21.5%  in  1992  to\r\n\r\n25.7%  in  2002.  For the financial and business services\r\n\r\nsector, the percentage rose from 10.9% to 17.1%.  It will\r\n\r\nbe  useful  for the public to know what are the  manpower\r\n\r\nneeds in each industry, where are the existing jobs,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  are  the  growing sectors.  Such information  will\r\n\r\nhelp  them  in  making appropriate lifelong learning  and\r\n\r\ncareer decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the newly proposed Continuing Education and\r\n\r\nTraining  (CET) statutory board plan to train our  people\r\n\r\nfor  employment?  Among our retrenched workers, the  most\r\n\r\naffected  groups are production and transport  operators,\r\n\r\ncleaners  and labourers, and professionals, managers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives,    which   represent   34.4%    and    42.5%,\r\n\r\nrespectively.  I would also like to suggest that the  CET\r\n\r\nshould place more emphasis on training these two groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CET statutory board should also adopt a holistic\r\n\r\napproach  in carrying out its training.  It is  not  easy\r\n\r\nfor  a  retrenched person who has worked in a job for  30\r\n\r\nyears  to change to another job immediately.  It takes  a\r\n\r\nlot of courage, mindset change, determination and support\r\n\r\nfrom family, friends and society.  Therefore, one of  the\r\n\r\nimportant areas is career counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area is generic employability skills\r\n\r\ntraining.  I would like to suggest that the CET statutory\r\n\r\nboard   develop   comprehensive  and  flexible   training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  our workers, especially  those  who  are\r\n\r\nchanging jobs from manufacturing to the service industry.\r\n\r\nThis includes basic IT skills, customer service attitudes\r\n\r\nand grooming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is in bringing training closer to the\r\n\r\npeople.   There  are  many ways of  conducting  training.\r\n\r\nBesides the normal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclassroom  training  and training through  Internet,  the\r\n\r\nclasses  can also be conducted at the community  centres,\r\n\r\nlibraries, etc, or training facilities can be set  up  in\r\n\r\nshopping  malls,  such  as Ngee Ann  City,  IMM  and  big\r\n\r\nshopping  centres.  For trainees in the service industry,\r\n\r\nthey  can observe what is good customer service and  what\r\n\r\nis not.  It will be even better if the training providers\r\n\r\ncan  link up with the shops to provide hands-on training.\r\n\r\nThis will make training more interesting and fun.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is encouraging entrepreneurship, there\r\n\r\nis  a  Self-Employment Training (SET) Programme  to  help\r\n\r\nthose  who  wish  to set up business.  MOM,  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce, business and professional associations and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Employers Federation can  set  up  an\r\n\r\n\"Enterprise Circle\" ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, can you sum up, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Yes, I am trying to finish,\r\n\r\nSir.   --- to try to match those who are retrenched  with\r\n\r\nthose who have capital, to create joint ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to urge the Minister to raise\r\n\r\nthe cap for tax relief from $2,500 to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, one in three of the\r\n\r\nunemployed could not find a job for at least six  months.\r\n\r\nThe  danger  is that the longer they are left  without  a\r\n\r\njob,  the  harder  it is for them to get  back  into  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   And we know that the problem is particularly\r\n\r\nacute  for workers above 50.  I note in the latest labour\r\n\r\nmarket report by the Ministry of Manpower that more  than\r\n\r\nhalf  of the retrenched aged 50 and above could not  find\r\n\r\nre-employment within six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending them for more training will not solve the\r\n\r\nproblem.  Some have gone for retraining and still  cannot\r\n\r\nfind jobs and, as Mdm Halimah Yacob has noted, even those\r\n\r\nwho  have  signed up for the People for Jobs  Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme,  some of them also find that  they  could  not\r\n\r\nfind jobs.  If this sentiment is allowed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspread,  a  sense of hopelessness will set  in,  and  the\r\n\r\njobless  will see training as a waste of their  time  and\r\n\r\neffort,  and  they will become increasingly  disenchanted\r\n\r\nwith this Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if there can be a promise or a guarantee of\r\n\r\na  job  at  the end of a training programme, it would  be\r\n\r\nmore  useful.   The  Ministry of  Manpower  has  all  the\r\n\r\ninformation of where the job vacancies are, it knows what\r\n\r\nsort  of  training is needed for these jobs, it  has  the\r\n\r\ninformation on the unemployed looking for jobs, it  knows\r\n\r\nwho  among the jobless have not found jobs for  at  least\r\n\r\nsix  months.  The Ministry of Manpower should give urgent\r\n\r\npriority  to this group.  They are more desperate  for  a\r\n\r\njob and, hence, should have more realistic expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge MOM to tailor a package deal for such\r\n\r\njobless workers, ie, training, with a guarantee of a  job\r\n\r\nat the end of it.  It is not such a radical idea, because\r\n\r\nI  was  surfing the Internet and I found that  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  private companies abroad who offer such a  training\r\n\r\nprogramme.   You sign up for this training programme,  if\r\n\r\nyou do not get a job or if I do not help you to get a job\r\n\r\nwithin  120 days, your money back.  So, I think we  could\r\n\r\nget  the  jobless  to  pay a certain  amount,  go  for  a\r\n\r\ntraining  programme, we help him to find a  job  and,  if\r\n\r\nnot, money back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this, MOM needs to tie up with employers who\r\n\r\nhave  job  vacancies.   Start with that,  and  then  work\r\n\r\ndownwards,  ie, what sort of training is needed  and  who\r\n\r\ncan  be  slotted into these programmes.  I think MOM  can\r\n\r\nalso  start  looking around at companies with  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, and persuade these companies  to  leave\r\n\r\nthese  jobs for Singaporeans instead, and that they  will\r\n\r\ntrain a pool of Singaporeans for these jobs.  Right  now,\r\n\r\nthe standard approach is that you train first and then we\r\n\r\ntry  to place them into jobs later.  To be effective,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  turned the other way around, ie, place  first\r\n\r\nand train later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employers, it will mean cost savings, because\r\n\r\nthey  do not have to put up job advertisements, and  they\r\n\r\nwill have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na pool of workers all trained for the jobs.  For workers,\r\n\r\nit  will  mean  some certainty that, after the  training,\r\n\r\nthey  will  have  jobs  to  look  forward  to.   For  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it will mean reducing the unemployment  rate,\r\n\r\nespecially  structural unemployment,  and  keeping  faith\r\n\r\nwith our jobless people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning and adult education is not new to Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  many years ago, we had the Adult Education  Board,\r\n\r\nie,  Lembaga  Pelajaran Dewasa, and we  are  coming  full\r\n\r\ncircle  mainly because in the good days I remember trying\r\n\r\nto  encourage the older workers to take up retraining and\r\n\r\nthere was this reluctance because the job was secure  and\r\n\r\nthey  found  that  they  preferred  leisure  instead   of\r\n\r\nspending time learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the point is that the Government can only do\r\n\r\nthat  much  if  the  workers  do  not  exercise  personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  The success of training is really in the\r\n\r\nattitude  and  values  of the individuals,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  the individuals must  really  think  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,   that  the  Government   can   provide   the\r\n\r\nfacilities,  but  they must want to  learn  and  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of all the facilities provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On coverage of the target groups, I support Mdm Ho\r\n\r\nGeok  Choo's point that in the knowledge economy,  it  is\r\n\r\nreally  beyond  the skilled workers, ie, the  technicians\r\n\r\nand  even  the middle management personnel who  need  the\r\n\r\ntraining.   My  concern  with  regard  to  such  learning\r\n\r\ninstitutions  provided  by the Continuing  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining statutory board is how do we de-stigmatise these\r\n\r\nlearners wanting to go for training, because we certainly\r\n\r\ndo  not want it to be perceived as an institute for drop-outs, but really to encourage these people that there  is\r\n\r\nsomething valuable that they can benefit from.  Unless we\r\n\r\nmake sure that this is an incentive and is of benefit  to\r\n\r\nthem, people may actually veer away from taking advantage\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is obviously the operations of\r\n\r\nlearning.  The suggestion is that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  would want to outsource and  get  third-party involvement, such as professional bodies, employers\r\n\r\nand  whatever  organisations that  have  an  interest  in\r\n\r\nproviding this facility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is that the Government is in a\r\n\r\ngood  position, because it has all the data,  information\r\n\r\nand the network, and I hope that through the services  of\r\n\r\nthe  CET  statutory board, more employment  opportunities\r\n\r\nwould  be  created and there would be a better  match  of\r\n\r\nindividuals and jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Magad, you have two minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Yes, Sir. We all know that\r\n\r\nmuch  has  been done to send the message to our workforce\r\n\r\non the importance of lifelong learning.  Not only has the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower reinforced this message from time to\r\n\r\ntime,  the NTUC and many employer organisations, such  as\r\n\r\nSNEF and the Singapore Human Resource Institute, and also\r\n\r\nresponsible  employers, have done their part  to  further\r\n\r\npropagate  the  message.  However, I strongly  feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  still  a  segment of our  workers  who  remain\r\n\r\noblivious  to  this message.  We need to work  harder  to\r\n\r\nreach out to this group, if we are intent on reducing the\r\n\r\nimpact of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's world takes no pity on the individual who\r\n\r\ngets lazy about learning.  The choice is to take personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for continuing one's  education  or  risk\r\n\r\nending  up  without the knowledge and  skills  needed  to\r\n\r\nprotect  one's career.  Our workers must know that  \"LLL\"\r\n\r\nis  the only way to remain competitive in the job market.\r\n\r\nThey  must  understand the need to invest  in  their  own\r\n\r\ngrowth, development and self-renewal, just like the way a\r\n\r\ncompany invests in research and development and comes  up\r\n\r\nwith  new and better products or services they can offer.\r\n\r\nTheir  future  employability,  their  appeal  as  a   job\r\n\r\ncandidate  will depend on them having a relentless  drive\r\n\r\nto  update their credentials and keep abreast of what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in their field.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nstepping  up  the  initiatives  to  further  spread   the\r\n\r\nlifelong learning message, and particularly reach out  to\r\n\r\nthe segment which seems to ignore or may somehow have not\r\n\r\nreceived  this  message.  Just like the crime  prevention\r\n\r\nmessage  is  effectively driven home through posters  and\r\n\r\nexhibits  displayed at grassroots functions, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Manpower could perhaps consider a similar approach to\r\n\r\ndrive  home  this message, which is important  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  workforce  keeps up with changing  trends  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  needs,  and  remains  relevant  in  this   fast\r\n\r\nchanging world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
