The     present\r\n\r\nqualifications of electors are laid down in section 5\r\n\r\nof   the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance, part of which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...any person who-\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies\r\n\r\nby   virtue   of  the  provisions  of  the   British\r\n\r\nNationality  Act, 1948, or was born in  any  of  the\r\n\r\nStates or territories now included in the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya o the Colony of Sarawak or the Colony  of\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo or the State of Brunei; and\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) was ordinarily resident in the Colony on the 1st\r\n\r\nday of April in any year; and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) was not less than twenty-one years of age on the\r\n\r\n1st day of July in that year, shall be entitled to\r\n\r\nhave his name entered or retained in a register of\r\n\r\nelectors in that year.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is to attain the status of the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  self-governing territory,  and  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  will  be  a  fully elected  body  when  the\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  elections   under   the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution are held. They are expected to  be  held\r\n\r\nnext  year.  Hon.  Members will recall  that  at  the\r\n\r\nsitting in October this Assembly approved the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Citizenship Ordinance, a charter  by  which\r\n\r\nwe   have  achieved  what  we  longed  for  years - the\r\n\r\ncreation of a status recognisable in all parts of the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  for all those who regard  Singapore  as\r\n\r\ntheir home and the object of their undivided loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are citizens by birth and descent have the\r\n\r\nright to vote. The proposed amendment to section 5 is\r\n\r\nvery  significant. Thousands of our adult  population\r\n\r\nwho,  although  not  born  in  Singapore,  have  been\r\n\r\nresident  here for long periods and have  contributed\r\n\r\nto    the   prosperity   of   Singapore,   and    are\r\n\r\nenthusiastically  becoming  Singapore  citizens   and\r\n\r\ndeclaring  their  allegiance  to  Singapore.  It   is\r\n\r\nimportant   that   the   new  status   of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship should carry with it the right to  assist\r\n\r\nin  the procedure of democratic government, and  this\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to  grant our new citizens  their  first\r\n\r\ndemocratic  right-the right to vote for  election  of\r\n\r\nthe people's representatives to sit in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to\r\n\r\nprovide  that  the right to vote in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  elections shall be granted to  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and to Singapore citizens only, in a  self-governing  Singapore, it is no  longer  desirable  to\r\n\r\noffer  voting  rights to those whose  bodies  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but whose hearts and minds are  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf  the newly won Constitution for self-government is\r\n\r\nto  be  implemented in the spirit  in  which  it  was\r\n\r\nframed, it is essential that the hearts and minds  of\r\n\r\nall   people  participating  in  the  government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be in Singapore itself,  and  that\r\n\r\ntheir outlook and undivided loyalty should be centred\r\n\r\nhere.  Therefore,  voting rights should  be  accorded\r\n\r\nonly to citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (ii) of the amending Bill proposes that the\r\n\r\nrelevant residential date shall be the first  day  of\r\n\r\nFebruary instead of the first day of April.  This  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   in  order  that  the  work  of  preparing\r\n\r\nregisters  in 1958 should be commenced  as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible. Paragraphs (iii) and (iv) are consequential\r\n\r\nto the previous amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 proposes that only persons who are or who\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  or  before the first day  of  February\r\n\r\n1958,  and who are resident in an electoral  division\r\n\r\non  that day, shall have their names included in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  register. The existing subsections (2) to  (4)\r\n\r\nof  section 10 of the Ordinance are deleted in  order\r\n\r\nto   avoid  any  delay  in  the  completion  of   the\r\n\r\nregisters. This simplified procedure is in conformity\r\n\r\nwith that laid down in the Local Government Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the revision of the registers\r\n\r\nin each year following the year 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 repeals the Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

When\r\n\r\nI fought the last general elections, I could not help\r\n\r\nbut  think how stupidly obtuse the draftsman  of  the\r\n\r\nlast Bill was in trying, by hypocritical legislation,\r\n\r\nto  disqualify  those born and bred in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  away for three out of the last  10  years\r\n\r\npreceding  the elections, although he allowed  those,\r\n\r\nwho  were  in  no way connected with Singapore  other\r\n\r\nthan  the fact that they had dwelt here for the  last\r\n\r\nseven out of the last 10 years and made money out  of\r\n\r\nit,   to  contest  such  elections.  And  the  unholy\r\n\r\nspectacle  of  so  many  prominent  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly taking their oaths of allegiance so late  in\r\n\r\nthe  day is, I think, a salutary reminder to them and\r\n\r\nto  the  founder-members of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nnamely,  those born and bred here, that  unless  they\r\n\r\nrise  up  to their responsibilities then they deserve\r\n\r\nto perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that those born and bred here like\r\n\r\nmyself  do not intend to perish. We intend  to  fight\r\n\r\nand  found this healthy and vigorous state  which  we\r\n\r\nhope  one  day  will  be part of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. And I would also like to remind all those who\r\n\r\nare  enthusiastically applying for membership of this\r\n\r\nnation  that it is not just a matter of going through\r\n\r\nthe drill which the Registrar of Citizens assured  me\r\n\r\nwould not take more than eight minutes if efficiently\r\n\r\ndone.  He  demonstrated it to me. I had the privilege\r\n\r\nof  an  actual demonstration of how a team of  clerks\r\n\r\ncould  put  a  person through the mill in  less  than\r\n\r\neight  minutes,  and I shudder to  think  what  would\r\n\r\nhappen   if  those  eight  minutes  were   the   only\r\n\r\nimpression  which remained on the minds  of  the  new\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty not only of the Government but of\r\n\r\nevery  political Party and every political leader  to\r\n\r\nbring  home  the responsibilities and the meaning  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, of  what  has  so  glibly  been  called\r\n\r\n\"undivided loyalty\".

But  I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out one factor in this, Sir, and that is  that\r\n\r\never  since registration came into force,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a terrific and spontaneous response to the call\r\n\r\nto  be registered as citizens, and it was because  of\r\n\r\nthis  spontaneous response that in the  beginning  we\r\n\r\nfound  that  there was an enormous number  of  people\r\n\r\nasking for forms. The distribution of forms was  very\r\n\r\nuneven. Those organisations and Parties which came up\r\n\r\nand  demanded 2,000, 5,000 and 6,000 forms  were  all\r\n\r\ngiven  forms  in the complete faith that  they  would\r\n\r\nfill   up  those  forms  and  help  the  registration\r\n\r\nofficers to register the people as citizens. To  date\r\n\r\nwe  have  issued 320,000 forms and it  is  surprising\r\n\r\nthat  our  forms have gone out of stock. It is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  these  forms are not put into  any  waste-paper\r\n\r\nbasket but all those organisations have been able  to\r\n\r\nfill  them  up  and  keep ready for the  registration\r\n\r\nofficers to come and take the oaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to appeal is this. Sir, that all\r\n\r\nParties and organisations should have a little bit of\r\n\r\npatience  so that the Registrar of Citizens  will  be\r\n\r\nable    to   organise   the   teams   properly    and\r\n\r\nsystematically and without any confusion.

Sirs as you are\r\n\r\naware,  the elections to the new City Council  are  to\r\n\r\ntake place on 21st December, at which time the greater\r\n\r\npart of the Local Government Ordinance, 1957, will  be\r\n\r\nbrought  into operation. It is necessary to  make  the\r\n\r\namendments contained in this amending Bill before  the\r\n\r\nnew  City  Council is established, for  the  following\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the present definition of \"City Council\" in\r\n\r\nsection 3 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1957,  is\r\n\r\ninaccurate  as  the Royal Charter did not  incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council.  This  is  corrected  by  the  new\r\n\r\ndefinition at clause 2 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 7 of the Bill amending section 320\r\n\r\nof  the  Local  Government Ordinance, 1957,  makes  it\r\n\r\npossible to repeal the City Council Elections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions No. 2) Ordinance, 1956,  without\r\n\r\nat  the  same time repealing the Municipal  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe former will have to be repealed in December before\r\n\r\nthe  elections  but  the Municipal Ordinance,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, will not be repealed at the same time  as\r\n\r\nsome of its provisions have not been reproduced in the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Ordinance. The provisions which  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  reproduced will be dealt  with  by  by-laws\r\n\r\nissued  by  the  City  Council as provided  for  under\r\n\r\nSchedule  VI  of  the Local Government Ordinance,  but\r\n\r\nuntil  such  by-laws  are in force  it  is  considered\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  keep  the Municipal Ordinance  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  City (Consequential Provisions)  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1951, in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, doubts have been expressed as to\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister can authorise the Rural Board  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  its  functions after  the  repeal  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance  in view  of  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  16  of  the Local Government Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nprovide  that  the local government of  each  district\r\n\r\nshall  be  the  responsibility of a district  council.\r\n\r\nThis doubt is removed in the amendment to section  321\r\n\r\nof the Local Government Ordinance, set out in clause 8\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill. Also, local authority officers exercise\r\n\r\npowers  under  Ordinances  other  than  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance, as for example the Sale of Food  and  Drugs\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  to remove all doubts it  is  proposed\r\n\r\nthat  power be given to the Minister to authorise  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board  and  the  City Council  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nexercise these powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make\r\n\r\namendments to section 151 and section 169 of the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance. The amendment to section 151  at\r\n\r\nclause  5 of the Bill is to enable the local authority\r\n\r\nto  take action against persons who fix number  plates\r\n\r\nto   unauthorised   huts  thus  misleading   potential\r\n\r\npurchasers as well as officers of the local authority.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment to section 169 at clause 6 of the  Bill\r\n\r\ngives  additional powers to the Court  to  remove  any\r\n\r\nerections  made in altering a building  without  the\r\n\r\nlicence of the local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthority, and also to impose a daily fine of $50  for\r\n\r\nthe  use  of the upper floor of a dwelling  house  for\r\n\r\nother  purposes  without  the  licence  of  the  local\r\n\r\nauthority. Under the existing section 169 there is  no\r\n\r\nprovision for the removal of any unauthorised erection\r\n\r\nor  for imposing a fine on continuance of the offence.\r\n\r\nThe  definition of \"Former City Council\" at  clause  2\r\n\r\nand  in  the amendment at clause 8 of the Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nmake  plain  references to such City  Council  in  the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Ordinance, 1957.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid(Assistant Minister for Education)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Assistant Minister for Education (Inche  Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there may have\r\n\r\nbeen  some excuse for the two other Bills this morning\r\n\r\ngoing  through  on a Certificate of  Urgency,  but  if\r\n\r\nthere is to be a sitting of this House before the 21st\r\n\r\nof  December, which is the day of the elections to the\r\n\r\nnew City Council, I see no reason why this Bill should\r\n\r\nbe  rushed  through  all  its three  stages  today.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  arguments of the Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment, Lands and Housing and his desire to tie up\r\n\r\nall  the  loose  ends to make sure that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nambiguity   of  any  kind  in  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance   where  it  overlaps  the   old   Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  But  I  strongly  deplore  this  habit  of\r\n\r\nputting Bills before this House under Certificates  of\r\n\r\nUrgency  when there is no urgency about  them,  as  we\r\n\r\nwill  meet  at  least  once more before  the  21st  of\r\n\r\nDecember,  and  I therefore object to  the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich this Bill is being rushed through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided and the Clerk proceeded to call\r\n\r\nout the names of hon.

Hart):</b> Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Customs Ordinance which was introduced in\r\n\r\nApril   1956,  consolidated  the  law  of  the  colony\r\n\r\nregarding  dutiable goods and also introduced  certain\r\n\r\nnew  provisions. It was to be expected that  it  would\r\n\r\nrequire certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendments  after it had been in operation  for  some\r\n\r\ntime.  This  Bill seeks to make the amendments  which\r\n\r\nexperience has proved necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Objects and Reasons for the amendments are\r\n\r\nexplained  in considerable detail in the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nNote which appears at the back of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition of\r\n\r\n\"intoxicating  liquor\" in section 3 of  the  original\r\n\r\nOrdinance  so  that it will include  \"fermented  rice\r\n\r\nmash\"  which  is used in the illicit distillation  of\r\n\r\nsamsu. This amendment is necessary in order to enable\r\n\r\nthe Customs Department to bring illicit distillers to\r\n\r\nbook.  Hitherto,  it  has been  difficult  to  obtain\r\n\r\nconviction  in court because the existing  definition\r\n\r\nhas been held not to embrace \"fermented rice mash\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Ordinance permits the Comptroller\r\n\r\nto remit duty in respect of dutiable goods which have\r\n\r\nbeen  lost  or damaged before removal from bond.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  part of the section states that no  remission\r\n\r\nwill be allowed in respect of damage or in respect of\r\n\r\na  claim to pay duty at preferential rates unless the\r\n\r\nclaim is made before the goods are removed from bond.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment  in clause 4 extends  the  section  to\r\n\r\ncover  claims for remission of duty arising from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the Customs officer responsible  may  have\r\n\r\nmisdirected himself in determining the amount of duty\r\n\r\nto  be  paid. Once goods have been removed from bond,\r\n\r\nit  is  difficult to identify them and  to  make  re-calculations of duty payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 20 of the Ordinance stipulates the\r\n\r\nconditions under which dutiable goods may be  removed\r\n\r\nfrom   Customs  control.  Duty  must  be   paid   and\r\n\r\nconditions   governing  deposits  in   a   Government\r\n\r\nlicensed  warehouse must be observed. Any  conditions\r\n\r\nprescribed  by  the  Customs  about  export  must  be\r\n\r\ncomplied  with and so on. The proviso to the  section\r\n\r\nstates however that goods can only be removed from  a\r\n\r\nlicensed warehouse before payment of duty if adequate\r\n\r\nsecurity  has  been lodged in advance.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  that  the application of this section,  as  it\r\n\r\nstands,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould   cause  embarrassment  and  give   cause   for\r\n\r\nconsiderable  dissatisfaction.  Clause  6   therefore\r\n\r\nseeks  to  amend  it  so  as to  give  power  to  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  to allow goods to be removed  from  bond\r\n\r\nwithout  provision  of security if  he  considers  it\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  do so in any particular  case.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  the  powers already  given  to  the\r\n\r\nComptroller under Regulations 15 and 21 are  adequate\r\n\r\nwithout any additional powers under section 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 introduces a new section to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  import  of trade samples. No duty is charged  on\r\n\r\nsuch  samples  but  if they are of  more  than  token\r\n\r\nvalue, a deposit in lieu of duty has to be made. This\r\n\r\nwill be recoverable when the samples are removed from\r\n\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 40 of the Ordinance prescribes that a\r\n\r\nwarehouse  deposit receipt will be issued in  respect\r\n\r\nof  all goods deposited in a Government warehouse and\r\n\r\nfurther  states  that the holder or endorsee  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse  of such a receipt shall be deemed to  be  the\r\n\r\nowner of the goods to which it refers and delivery to\r\n\r\nsuch  holder or endorsee shall be a good  and  lawful\r\n\r\ndelivery: in other words, that the goods will only be\r\n\r\ndelivered  on  production of a deposit receipt.  This\r\n\r\nsection  was  introduced for the first  time  in  the\r\n\r\nCustoms   Ordinance,  having  been  taken  from   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya Customs Ordinance. It  has  not\r\n\r\npreviously  been  incorporated  in  the  law  of  the\r\n\r\ncolony.  It  has  been found to be  impracticable  in\r\n\r\noperation. In many cases, consignments are  split  up\r\n\r\nand sales made while the goods are still in bond.  It\r\n\r\nis  impossible  in  every case for the  purchaser  to\r\n\r\npresent   a   deposit  receipt.   To   overcome   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty,  it is proposed to amend  section  40  to\r\n\r\npermit the use of an authenticated delivery order  in\r\n\r\nlieu of a deposit receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 seeks to amend section 56 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance which permits the sale of beer for \"off the\r\n\r\npremises\"  consumption without a licence between  six\r\n\r\nin the morning and ten at night. Beer is in fact sold\r\n\r\nat all hours of the day and night in Singapore and it\r\n\r\nis quite impossible to stop the practice. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe circumstances, it is desired to amend the law  to\r\n\r\ntake account of the facts of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 also deals with the sale of beer and aims\r\n\r\nat   freeing  licensed  liquor  retailers  from   the\r\n\r\nobligation to keep elaborate records of beer  stocks.\r\n\r\nPractically every sundry goods shop keeps  and  sells\r\n\r\nbeer in much larger total quantity without having  to\r\n\r\nkeep any records at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 90 of the Ordinance lays the burden of\r\n\r\nproof on the defendant in any case arising out of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Ordinance. Clause 16 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nextends  the  scope  of the section  to  cover  cases\r\n\r\narising out of section 13 which empowers the Governor\r\n\r\nin   Council  to  exempt  goods  from  duty  at   his\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 96 of the Ordinance makes all goods liable\r\n\r\nto  seizure under the Ordinance liable to forfeiture.\r\n\r\nGoods for the purpose of this section are defined  as\r\n\r\nincluding  receptacles, packages, vehicles,  aircraft\r\n\r\nand  vessels  not exceeding 200 tons. The  object  of\r\n\r\nclause  17  is  to  exempt large  aircraft  from  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the section in the same way  as  large\r\n\r\nships are exempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 is important. It amends the law relating\r\n\r\nto  the  forfeiture  of goods. At  present,  where  a\r\n\r\nprosecution has been brought for an offence under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  respect of goods and the  Court  finds\r\n\r\nthat an offence has been committed in respect of  the\r\n\r\ngoods,  the Court may order the goods to be forfeited\r\n\r\neven  if no person has been convicted of the offence.\r\n\r\nIt  is however open to the owner of the goods, it  he\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  charged  with an  offence  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance or any regulation made hereunder in respect\r\n\r\nof  the goods, to show that the offence was committed\r\n\r\nwithout  his  knowledge, consent  or  connivance,  or\r\n\r\notherwise that the goods should not be forfeited. The\r\n\r\nCourt  may  then, after examination into the  matter,\r\n\r\nmake  any order it deems fit and may order the return\r\n\r\nof  the goods to the owner. Where no prosecution  has\r\n\r\nbeen brought but goods have been seized under the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the owner may send a notice stating  that\r\n\r\nthe  offence  was  committed without  his  knowledge,\r\n\r\nconsent  or connivance, or otherwise that  the  goods\r\n\r\nshould  not  be forfeited. The Comptroller  may  then\r\n\r\norder the goods to be released but if he decides  not\r\n\r\nto  do  so,  he refers the matter to the  Court.  The\r\n\r\nCourt  will then examine the matter and if the  Court\r\n\r\nis  satisfied  that an offence against the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nhas  been committed in respect of the goods, it  will\r\n\r\norder  the goods to be forfeited but if it is not  so\r\n\r\nsatisfied,  it will order the goods to  be  released.\r\n\r\nThe position is un-satisfactory because the Ordinance\r\n\r\nappears  to  give the owner of goods  a  better  case\r\n\r\nwhere  there has been a prosecution than where  there\r\n\r\nhas been no prosecution. The law in the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is that once the Court is satisfied  that  an\r\n\r\noffence  has been committed against the Ordinance  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  goods, then the  Court  must  order\r\n\r\nforfeiture of the goods. It is proposed to bring  the\r\n\r\nlaw  in  the  Colony into line with the  law  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Clause 18 of the Bill proposes amendments\r\n\r\nto  section  97 of the Customs Ordinance  which  will\r\n\r\nmake  it  mandatory for the Court to order forfeiture\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  proved  that  an  offence  against  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance has been committed in respect of the goods.\r\n\r\nIt  is also provided that things forfeited are to  be\r\n\r\ndelivered  to  Customs  for  disposal.  This  is  the\r\n\r\npresent practice and the clause clarifies this is the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses in the Bill have been explained\r\n\r\nin  the  Explanatory Note and do not require  further\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.

Shanks):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill  be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the amendments proposed in this\r\n\r\nBill is to facilitate the admission and treatment  of\r\n\r\npatients  and to avoid non-essential formalities  and\r\n\r\npublicity  which  often tend to  deter  patients  and\r\n\r\ntheir   relatives  from  seeking  help  from   mental\r\n\r\nhospitals.   Modern   opinion,  expressed   by   such\r\n\r\nauthorities as the World Health Organisation, is that\r\n\r\nin  the past legislation has laid too much importance\r\n\r\non  putting restraint or a check on the mentally  ill\r\n\r\nand   the  doctors  who  look  after  them  and   has\r\n\r\nemphasised  too little the realisation  of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no essential difference  between  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  mental patients and the ordinary  sick.\r\n\r\nThey  are  the same as, arid should be treated  in  a\r\n\r\nmanner   comparable  with,  those  who  suffer   from\r\n\r\ninjuries or other illnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law provides proper safeguards for the\r\n\r\ntreatment  without their consent of persons  who  are\r\n\r\ndangerous but the primary aim should be to make it as\r\n\r\neasy  as  possible  for ordinary mental  patients  to\r\n\r\nreceive  treatment. The need for amending legislation\r\n\r\nis  perhaps  most  clearly seen  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nprocedure for admission to and discharge from  mental\r\n\r\nhospitals. It is proposed by this Bill that admission\r\n\r\nshould  be  made very much easier. In practice,  this\r\n\r\nwill mean that the documentation and formalities will\r\n\r\nbe  cut to a minimum and brought into line with those\r\n\r\nrequired  for  admission to any other  hospital.  The\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  patients will similarly be  made  very\r\n\r\nmuch  easier and, if this Bill is brought into force,\r\n\r\nthe  Medical  Superintendent  will  be  empowered  to\r\n\r\ndischarge any patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, with very few exceptions, patients have\r\n\r\nto  be  examined  as to their normality  by  a  Board\r\n\r\nconsisting   largely  of  laymen.

Such persons are very often  in\r\n\r\nneed of mental care, perhaps more than of punishment,\r\n\r\nand  it  is thought right that the courts and medical\r\n\r\nofficers  in ordinary hospitals should be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  ensuring that these people  can  get\r\n\r\nproper treatment with a very minimum of formality and\r\n\r\nadministrative procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed by the Bill are all, I\r\n\r\nthink, fully explained in the Explanatory Note and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think that hon.

Clause 2 of the Bill,  as  at  present\r\n\r\ndrafted,  would  remove only a reference  to  34.  It\r\n\r\nwould  not  alter  the restrictions  which  apply  to\r\n\r\nsection  32, which require that the order  should  be\r\n\r\nsigned  by  two  registered medical practitioners  of\r\n\r\nwhom  one shall be a medical officer. By clause 3  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill, it is proposed that under section 32, only\r\n\r\nthe  certificate of one medical officer at  a  mental\r\n\r\nhospital  shall  be required and not  two  registered\r\n\r\nmedical practitioners. That fact was overlooked  when\r\n\r\nvarious other alterations were made to the Bill after\r\n\r\nit had been first drafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

That the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  has been able to present its Report  is  a\r\n\r\nsure  indication  that all Members of  the  Committee\r\n\r\nhave  co-operated fully in coming to a happy solution\r\n\r\nto  most of the difficult problems presented by\r\n\r\nthis Bill. In this respect, Sir, I must thank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou, as Chairman of the Select Committee, for helping\r\n\r\nall  of  us to come to the present position.  I  must\r\n\r\nalso  say that the Members of the Opposition  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee have co-operated with the Members on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Benches in making most  constructive\r\n\r\nand  helpful suggestions during the meetings  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some points which were not entirely\r\n\r\nagreeable to all Members of the Committee and I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  an  undertaking to consider them and  make  my\r\n\r\nrecommendations  at this sitting.  In  going  through\r\n\r\nthese  points I have also gone through the Bill quite\r\n\r\nthoroughly and have come to the conclusion  that  the\r\n\r\namendments  contained in my motion are necessary  not\r\n\r\nonly to improve the language of the Bill but also  to\r\n\r\nput  things  right, and generally to  make  the  Bill\r\n\r\nworkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not take more time than is necessary in\r\n\r\nmoving my motion by going into the various amendments\r\n\r\nin  detail. I will deal with these amendments as each\r\n\r\nof  them  comes up and I will explain  the  need  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is able to come to the decisions for\r\n\r\nthe  amendments today because there have been  useful\r\n\r\nsuggestions and criticisms from members of the public\r\n\r\nand   organisations  which  have   either   submitted\r\n\r\nmemoranda   to  the  Select  Committee  or   appeared\r\n\r\npersonally  before  the  Committee.  Education  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter that should concern everybody in this country,\r\n\r\nboth  young and old, and it is only right that people\r\n\r\nshould  have  taken  an  interest  in  the  Bill.  In\r\n\r\nintroducing  this  Bill,  Government  is  laying  the\r\n\r\nfoundation stone for the education of children of all\r\n\r\ncommunities   in   Singapore  without  discrimination\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  The job facing Government  in  educating\r\n\r\nthe  children  of Singapore is enormous,  and  unless\r\n\r\nthere  is  goodwill all-round, all the  efforts  that\r\n\r\nhave been put into this Bill will be in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been criticisms levelled at certain\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers to be given to the  Director  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  I  want to stress that we have  tried  to\r\n\r\nmeet  these criticisms as best we could, but  I  must\r\n\r\nremind  the  House that unless officials who  are  to\r\n\r\nadminister  the law for the good of the country  have\r\n\r\ncertain  powers, we might as well have  no  laws.  We\r\n\r\nmust  accept  in good faith the fact that responsible\r\n\r\nofficers will exercise their powers judiciously,  and\r\n\r\nas  far as my Ministry is concerned, I can assure the\r\n\r\nHouse  that I will see that the powers are not abused\r\n\r\nby  any of my officers. I would like to reiterate the\r\n\r\nassurance I gave to this House at one of the previous\r\n\r\nsittings  of the Assembly that, wherever the Director\r\n\r\nof  Education  has  discretionary  powers  under  the\r\n\r\nEducation   Bill,   I   will   take   the   necessary\r\n\r\nadministrative action in my Ministry to see  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not exercise these powers to the disadvantage of\r\n\r\nanyone,  without  prior  reference  to  my  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary or to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which I wish to touch on,\r\n\r\nand  that  is in regard to clause 24 (e).  There  was\r\n\r\nsome argument as to whether that provision should  be\r\n\r\ntaken out of the Bill, and I also gave an undertaking\r\n\r\nin the Select Committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  reconsider  whether  or not  this  paragraph  (e)\r\n\r\nshould be deleted. Although it is a fact that land is\r\n\r\nhard  to  come by in Singapore, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\ncity area, I feel that the deletion of this paragraph\r\n\r\nwill encourage the management of proposed schools  in\r\n\r\nrural areas, or in places where land is not difficult\r\n\r\nto  come by, to shirk its responsibility in providing\r\n\r\nadequate open air recreation for the pupils. We  must\r\n\r\nalso  plan  for  the day when it may be  possible  to\r\n\r\nprovide  well-built school buildings in  areas  where\r\n\r\nlarge  areas of land are not available. When we reach\r\n\r\nthat  stage, we may wish to consider taking over  the\r\n\r\npupils  from  schools that are unhealthy  because  of\r\n\r\ninadequate or unsatisfactory provision for  open  air\r\n\r\nrecreation. Certain Members fear that this  provision\r\n\r\nmight be made use of rather indiscriminately for  the\r\n\r\ncancellation of existing schools which cannot provide\r\n\r\nadequate or satisfactory open air recreation;  but  I\r\n\r\nmust remind Members that no one will be so mad as  to\r\n\r\ndo  this  at  a  time  when the problem  involved  of\r\n\r\nproviding accommodation for children of school  going\r\n\r\nage  is  already enormous. To cancel existing schools\r\n\r\nat  such  a  juncture will worsen the problem  rather\r\n\r\nthan  improve  it,  but this does not  mean  that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  will not insist on certain improvements  to\r\n\r\nschools which have inadequate or unsatisfactory  open\r\n\r\nair  recreation.  In view of all  the  reasons  given\r\n\r\nabove,  I  have  decided that  paragraph  (e)  should\r\n\r\nremain if my Ministry is to function properly.

Under  the  Interpretation\r\n\r\nOrdinance   it   is  provided  that  the   appointing\r\n\r\nauthority  is  also  the revoking authority,  and  no\r\n\r\nreasons  are necessary. I should also like  to  point\r\n\r\nout  that when the Minister makes an appointment,  he\r\n\r\nis  not required to give reasons. It must be accepted\r\n\r\nin  good faith that responsible persons will exercise\r\n\r\ntheir  powers judiciously, and it is no use requiring\r\n\r\na  person  to  give reasons if he is bent  on  acting\r\n\r\ninjudiciously. However, as I have pointed out,  under\r\n\r\nthe Interpretation Ordinance the appointing authority\r\n\r\nis also the revoking authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  remember correctly, the words \"giving reasons\"\r\n\r\nwere  accepted  by the Minister in Select  Committee.\r\n\r\nNow the reason for not giving reasons when exercising\r\n\r\nthe  powers  under  this clause 5  (5)  seems  to  be\r\n\r\ncontrary  to what he had reasoned out to be right.  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  that  appointments of this nature  to  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Board  are important and the  revocation  of\r\n\r\nappointments is also as important. It may be the  law\r\n\r\nof  the Colony that the appointing authority is  also\r\n\r\nthe  revoking authority, but it will definitely  help\r\n\r\nto  satisfy the public if the Minister agrees to  his\r\n\r\noriginal  idea  of  giving reasons for  revoking  any\r\n\r\nappointment,   as   had   been   requested   by   the\r\n\r\nrepresentors   who   appeared   before   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. Whether it is on the statute book or  not,\r\n\r\nI believe it would be best to explain the reasons for\r\n\r\ntaking  such  an  important  action  as  revoking  an\r\n\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, as I have pointed out, the\r\n\r\nInterpretation  Ordinance states that the  appointing\r\n\r\nauthority  is  also  the revoking  authority  and  it\r\n\r\nappears  then that having the words \"giving  reasons\"\r\n\r\nin  this Bill would actually be ultra vires.

But I should like to voice my non-conviction\r\n\r\nof the necessity for this paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 24 (e) -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nthe area provided for the open air recreation of\r\n\r\npupils is inadequate or unsatisfactory;\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is practically an impossibility in the town.\r\n\r\nBusiness people in town may not find the cost of land\r\n\r\nexcessive, but people living in the rural areas may\r\n\r\nfind it formidable. To provide ideal conditions to\r\n\r\nrun a school in any area which has limited land is, I\r\n\r\nthink, too much to hope for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 24 (g) -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nthe proposed fees are excessive, having regard to the\r\n\r\ncost of maintaining and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconducting the proposed school and the standard of\r\n\r\neducation to be provided;\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>no  one would send their children to a school that is\r\n\r\ndemanding  excessive  fees, but because  they  cannot\r\n\r\nsend  their  children to a school  that  is  charging\r\n\r\nreasonable  fees, that is the reason why  the  pupils\r\n\r\nhave  to  go to schools which are charging  excessive\r\n\r\nfees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 24 (h) -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nthe qualifications and experience of the proposed\r\n\r\nteachers are not adequate to ensure the efficient\r\n\r\nconduct of the proposed school;\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I would say that no sane parents will send their\r\n\r\nchildren to a school with under-qualified teachers\r\n\r\nunless they are forced to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these points indicate that educational\r\n\r\nfacilities in this colony are still inadequate and it\r\n\r\nis up to the Government to try and solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIf  they do not solve it, such conditions will  still\r\n\r\nexist and such schools will still spring up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, more concerned especially when clause\r\n\r\n24  is  going  to be related to clause 25  where  the\r\n\r\nDirector  may,  under  clause  25  (1)  (a),   cancel\r\n\r\nexisting  schools  on all these  grounds.  All  these\r\n\r\nschools  are  serving  a  useful  purpose;  they  are\r\n\r\nhelping  in the education of our children. They  must\r\n\r\nbe  given all the regard and respect because of their\r\n\r\ngood  work, and the powers in clause 24 (a)  and  (e)\r\n\r\nshould  never be exercised under clause 25  (1)  (a),\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will be impossible for schools  to  make\r\n\r\navailable playing fields when there are none. I  want\r\n\r\nan  assurance  from the Minister for  Education  that\r\n\r\nclause  25 (1) (a), which touches on clause 24,  will\r\n\r\nbe  exercised with the greatest of care and  that  no\r\n\r\nexisting school should be punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I cannot help feeling, Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nthat  the hon.

I would remind  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  word  is  \"may\" here - a  permissive  clause\r\n\r\nenabling the Director, in his discretion, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexercise  a  measure  of control over  these  various\r\n\r\naspects  of  school buildings. I  am  sure  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember will agree that we should secure the very best\r\n\r\nwe  can for our students in schools. If we can get  a\r\n\r\ncommittee to provide playing fields, they should have\r\n\r\nthem.  Some  schools do not provide very big  playing\r\n\r\nfields,  others do; but if we can get them to provide\r\n\r\nthem, they should provide them. And so with the other\r\n\r\nthings mentioned in this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member raised the point about paragraph\r\n\r\n(a),  that  \"adequate educational facilities  already\r\n\r\nexist in the area in which it is proposed . . .\". and\r\n\r\nI  think he said that no sane person would attempt to\r\n\r\nprovide   facilities  in  an  area   where   adequate\r\n\r\nfacilities  already were proposed would exist.  Well,\r\n\r\nagain I cannot help remembering the debate which took\r\n\r\nplace  in  another democratic body, the City Council,\r\n\r\nwhen there was already one cinema in an area and  two\r\n\r\nmore  were  proposed, and more time and trouble  were\r\n\r\nspent on those three cinemas than on almost any other\r\n\r\nmatter which has come before the public of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  presumption  is that somebody must,  I  suppose,\r\n\r\nhave  been  insane because they were  all  trying  to\r\n\r\nprovide  facilities where adequate facilities already\r\n\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that his arguments in general are\r\n\r\ninsufficient. The point is that the clause is not  to\r\n\r\nclose  schools, or to be repressive or  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nrestrictive;  the  point is that  the  clause  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  the authorities to put some pressure  on  any\r\n\r\nslack or negligent committee, to make sure that  they\r\n\r\ndo  move forward and give the very best that  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven for our students, who are so important to us in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, in reply to the hon.
