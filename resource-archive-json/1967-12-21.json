Its purpose is to seek\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers for the Minister to grant\r\n\r\nexemptions from the prohibition of female workmen\r\n\r\nworking at night. \"night\" in the context of the\r\n\r\npresent provisions of the law means a period of\r\n\r\nnot less than 11 consecutive hours including the\r\n\r\ninterval between ten o'clock in the evening and\r\n\r\nfive o'clock in the morning or such other interval\r\n\r\nof seven hours as the Minister may by notification\r\n\r\nin the Gazette prescribe for any particular\r\n\r\nindustrial undertaking or branch thereof or kind\r\n\r\nof labour. The restriction on the employment at\r\n\r\nnight of female workmen is in accordance with the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the International Labour\r\n\r\nConvention and was introduced into the Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance in 1955. The situation then existing did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot warrant the employment in Singapore of female\r\n\r\nlabour at night. However, with the increasing\r\n\r\nimpetus of industrialisation in Singapore, certain\r\n\r\nexport-orientated industries find it increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult to meet production targets without\r\n\r\nintroducing a night shift in which female\r\n\r\nemployees may have to be employed in certain kinds\r\n\r\nof labour. The law as it stands, however, will not\r\n\r\npermit the employment of female workers beyond\r\n\r\ntwelve midnight in view of the very restrictive\r\n\r\ninterval period of seven hours contained in the\r\n\r\nlaw. Apart from allowing for the variation of this\r\n\r\nprohibited interval, there is no provision for the\r\n\r\nlifting of the restriction entirely in certain\r\n\r\ncases. The structure of our economy has changed\r\n\r\nand will continue to change more speedily with the\r\n\r\nprogress of industrialisation, and it will be\r\n\r\nnecessary, in the interest of the economy, for\r\n\r\nsome factories, especially those which are export-orientated, to work on a 24-hour shift system\r\n\r\nwhich will involve the employment of female\r\n\r\nworkmen at night in certain kinds of labour. It\r\n\r\nis, therefore, necessary to take account of the\r\n\r\nsituation to ensure that existing legislation does\r\n\r\nnot stifle industrial progress and expansion and\r\n\r\ndeprive the creation of employment opportunities\r\n\r\nto our people. The logic of the situation demands\r\n\r\nthat the present legal restriction on the\r\n\r\nemployment of female workers during a night shift\r\n\r\nshould be relaxed so that certain industries or\r\n\r\nundertakings can introduce a night shift and\r\n\r\nincrease their productive capacity to meet the\r\n\r\ndemands of our export market. What is even more\r\n\r\nimportant to us is that by allowing female workers\r\n\r\nto work in the third shift, we are able not only\r\n\r\nto utilise the expensive equipment and factory\r\n\r\nspace more profitably, but also to create more\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for our workers. A number\r\n\r\nof countries have provided for the relaxation of\r\n\r\nnight work in respect of female employees. These\r\n\r\ncountries include the United Kingdom and Japan. It\r\n\r\nis pertinent to point out that highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries have thought it necessary\r\n\r\nto relax the restriction in the interest of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir economy and, therefore, a relaxation of this\r\n\r\nnature would be of even greater benefit to a\r\n\r\ndeveloping economy such as ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain categories\r\n\r\nof female employees who even now work in shifts\r\n\r\nround the clock, tor example, nurses and airline\r\n\r\nworkers in consonance with the social and economic\r\n\r\ndemands of these vocations. It must also be\r\n\r\nmentioned that our female population today is more\r\n\r\nprogressive and sophisticated than they were\r\n\r\nbefore, and that the well-developed social\r\n\r\nservices in the country serve their needs most\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily, both from the health and security\r\n\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment does not do away with the\r\n\r\nexisting restrictions, but only gives powers to\r\n\r\nthe Minister to grant exemptions where it is\r\n\r\ndesirable in the public interest to do so for the\r\n\r\npurpose of maintaining or increasing the\r\n\r\nefficiency of industry. It will not in any way\r\n\r\naffect the protection that female employees now\r\n\r\nenjoy, because before an exemption is granted\r\n\r\ntheir interest will be very carefully considered\r\n\r\nand in most cases we will consult the union before\r\n\r\nwe agree to exempt. But this is only applicable to\r\n\r\nthose unions which are willing to work with the\r\n\r\nlaw. To the Communist-controlled unions which have\r\n\r\nevery intention to break the law, I say it is a\r\n\r\nwaste of time to consult them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I know it is rather difficult to\r\n\r\nuse certain terms and words.

My\r\n\r\nreason in supporting the proposed amendment Bill\r\n\r\nis that, from my experience as one of the\r\n\r\nsecretaries of the Pioneer Industries Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion, I have found that the absolute prohibition\r\n\r\nagainst the employment of female workers in night\r\n\r\nshifts is not conducive to [he industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain industries, such as the\r\n\r\ntextile industry, where the jobs to be performed\r\n\r\nby workers are of a very delicate nature requiring\r\n\r\ninfinite patience and a light touch. For such kind\r\n\r\nof work, women workers are riiore suitable than\r\n\r\nmale workers. But because of the present absolute\r\n\r\nprohibition against employing women workers on\r\n\r\nnight shifts, employers in such industries have no\r\n\r\nother choice but to employ male workers during the\r\n\r\nnight shifts. As to why night shifts are\r\n\r\nnecessary, the explanation is that because it is\r\n\r\neconomical to utilise a set of equipment\r\n\r\ncontinuously rather than to utilise double the\r\n\r\nequipment half the time only. Also, the exigency\r\n\r\nof business may require factories to operate\r\n\r\ncontinuously for 24 hours a day in order to enable\r\n\r\ndeadlines for deliveries to be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the present session in this House,\r\n\r\nMembers have heard the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nanalyse the economic situation in Singapore and\r\n\r\nemphasise the need for Singapore to develop more\r\n\r\nindustries and to cultivate a bigger export\r\n\r\nmarket. One factor which may attract foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors to Singapore and determine the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of Singapore goods in foreign\r\n\r\nmarkets is productivity of labour. The use of male\r\n\r\nworkers on night shifts in industries where women\r\n\r\nworkers are more suitable is not a circumstance\r\n\r\nwhich is conducive to the promotion of higher\r\n\r\nproductivity of labour. Members of this House may\r\n\r\nthen ask why it is not satisfactory to employ male\r\n\r\nworkers in such industries. One explanation may be\r\n\r\nthat male workers who are employed on\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nsuch night shifts find the work uninteresting and\r\n\r\nuninspiring. Another explanation may be that male\r\n\r\nworkers do not have the necessary patience of the\r\n\r\nfemale workers to do such work. Then again, the\r\n\r\nwage level in such industries may be lower than\r\n\r\nthe wage level in other industries in the Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Complex. I shall be talking more about\r\n\r\nthis wage level later on. But for the present I\r\n\r\nshall confine myself to the explanation why\r\n\r\nemployment of male workers instead of female\r\n\r\nworkers on night shifts in certain industries is\r\n\r\nnot satisfactory. Because of the many reasons\r\n\r\nwhich I have just enumerated, there is a high\r\n\r\nturnover among the male workers who are at present\r\n\r\nemployed in night shifts as a result of the\r\n\r\nabsolute prohibition against female workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members of the House will agree\r\n\r\nwith me that any high turnover of labour force,\r\n\r\nwhether involving male workers or female workers\r\n\r\nin any industries, is not a satisfactory\r\n\r\nsituation. In such industries where women workers\r\n\r\nare more suitable, it must also be appreciated\r\n\r\nthat workers employed in such industries must\r\n\r\nundergo long intensive periods of training. The\r\n\r\nwastage of labour, therefore, can be imagined when\r\n\r\nworkers leave their employment immediately after\r\n\r\nthe end of the period of training or even before\r\n\r\nthe end of the period of training. Because of such\r\n\r\nworkers leaving their employment, new workers have\r\n\r\nto be employed to take their place and this means\r\n\r\nthat new employees must undergo similar long\r\n\r\nintensive periods of training. In such a situation\r\n\r\nit is not difficult to understand that the workers\r\n\r\ncannot attain a higher level of efficiency during\r\n\r\ntheir period of training. And this is the\r\n\r\nsituation in those industries where female workers\r\n\r\nare more suitable but are prohibited from work on\r\n\r\nnight shifts, because of the high turnover of male\r\n\r\nworkers employed on such night shifts. The\r\n\r\nproduction of the factories involved suffers as a\r\n\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in these circumstances that some of the\r\n\r\nemployers who are most affected by the absolute\r\n\r\nprohibition against the employment of women work\r\n\r\ners on night shifts approached me to make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Minister for Labour in\r\n\r\nrespect of section 50 of the Labour Ordinance, so\r\n\r\nthat the absolute prohibition against the use of\r\n\r\nwomen workers on night shifts should be removed.\r\n\r\nI, accordingly, conveyed their views to the\r\n\r\nMinister who, I am happy to say, is also of the\r\n\r\nview that the absolute prohibition is impractical\r\n\r\nand not conducive to the industrial development of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It must be pointed out that the Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance was enacted at a time when Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy was essentially orientated to the export-import trade. There were then not many\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries, and those that existed\r\n\r\ndo not justify the use of women workers on night\r\n\r\nshifts. The present situation is different. At the\r\n\r\nrisk of repeating myself, I must point out that\r\n\r\nthere are now in Singapore many industries where\r\n\r\nwomen workers are more suitable than male workers.\r\n\r\nThis situation will continue in future when more\r\n\r\nindustries are attracted to Singapore, but such\r\n\r\nindustries which require women workers may be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged from coming to Singapore if they find\r\n\r\nthat they cannot employ women workers on night\r\n\r\nshifts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment will remove the absolute\r\n\r\nprohibition against the employment of female\r\n\r\nworkers on night shifts and substitute in its\r\n\r\nplace a qualified prohibition with an enabling\r\n\r\nprovision for the Minister to exempt any industry\r\n\r\nor branch thereof from such prohibition. I think\r\n\r\nthe statutory safeguard against the exploitation\r\n\r\nof women workers by unscrupulous employers is\r\n\r\nadequate. And I am sure the Minister will make an\r\n\r\nexhaustive investigation before granting exemption\r\n\r\nfrom such prohibition to any employer making an\r\n\r\napplication to him in that behalf. I, as an\r\n\r\nofficial of the Pioneer Industries Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion, can assure Members of the House that the\r\n\r\nunion will also see to it that, where women\r\n\r\nworkers are employed on night shifts, all of them\r\n\r\nwill receive the special allowance\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor night-shift premiums in line with those\r\n\r\nprevailing among the other industries in the\r\n\r\nJurong Industrial Complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I wish to make some reference to\r\n\r\nthe surprising remarks of the Member for Delta,\r\n\r\nwho has said that the whole of the Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Complex is one big chaos, presumably including the Pioneer Industries Employees' Union.\r\n\r\nAs to the specific allegation that workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly women workers, are earning a wage of\r\n\r\n$2.50 per day, I wish to point out that these are\r\n\r\nallowances paid during th.e period when the\r\n\r\nworkers are receiving training. Such periods of\r\n\r\ntraining are seldom more than six months, and once\r\n\r\nthey have completed their training, workers receive an immediate increase in wages. I can assure\r\n\r\nthe House that the use of women workers on night\r\n\r\nshifts does not necessarily mean exploitation of\r\n\r\nwomen workers. My union, the Pioneer Industries\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union, in spite of the derogatory\r\n\r\nremarks made about it, has always protected and\r\n\r\npromoted the interests of the workers and will\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so in the Jurong Industrial Complex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if there is any significant number of\r\n\r\nworkers who are not members of the union, it is\r\n\r\nbecause they are still under training or on\r\n\r\nprobation. Such workers may not be able to become\r\n\r\nmembers of the union. This is an accepted\r\n\r\nprinciple in industrial relations in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut if the Member for Delta knows of any specific\r\n\r\ninstance of exploitation in Jurong, I should think\r\n\r\nit is her duty to furnish such particulars to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour, if not to the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I cannot understand the intention of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour in bringing forward this\r\n\r\namendment Bill which precludes women from working\r\n\r\nat night. It is correct that female workers should\r\n\r\nnot be asked to work at night. If there are female\r\n\r\nworkers working in industries, they should work\r\n\r\nduring the day. The place for female workers,\r\n\r\nespecially married female\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers, to work at night is the house, in the\r\n\r\nhouse they can look after their husbands and\r\n\r\nchildren whom they leave during the day. To the\r\n\r\nbest of my knowledge, the wife of the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour is working. I am quite sure he does not\r\n\r\nwish his wife to work at night, leaving him alone\r\n\r\nto tend to the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whilst not allowing female workers\r\n\r\nto work at night, according to section 50\r\n\r\nsubsection (1), the Minister may exempt any\r\n\r\nemployer from asking his female workers to work at\r\n\r\nnight, if he is satisfied with his application\r\n\r\nthat it is in the public interest or to increase\r\n\r\nefficiency of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Labour is of the\r\n\r\nopinion that female workers when working at night\r\n\r\nare more efficient than male workers, but I cannot\r\n\r\nsee how female workers can show extra skill or\r\n\r\nincreased efficiency in this respect. I have also\r\n\r\nheard from the Member for Telok Blangah just now\r\n\r\nthat female workers are more patient than their\r\n\r\nmale counterparts. I would like to cite an example\r\n\r\nin the Singapore Telephone Board. Previously the\r\n\r\ntelephone operators who worked from 7 a.m. to 5\r\n\r\np.m. were female operators, and from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. the switchboards were attended to\r\n\r\nby male operators. But now for 24 hours of the day\r\n\r\nthe trunk call and inquiry services are looked\r\n\r\nafter by female operators. According to the\r\n\r\nemployers, this is to increase the efficiency of\r\n\r\nthe S.T.B. But both the female and male operators\r\n\r\nhave the same kind of work at the switchboard -\r\n\r\nconnect the plug, enquire and pull it out. If this\r\n\r\nis a means to attract callers, then this may be\r\n\r\nthe reason. I cannot, however, see the extra\r\n\r\nefficiency of female operators. I hope this\r\n\r\namendment will increase the efficiency of the\r\n\r\nindustries and I also hope it will not be a source\r\n\r\nof inconvenience to the household. Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\ntrust the Minister, when exercising his\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers to exempt applications from\r\n\r\nemployers, will consider whether they are for a\r\n\r\ngood purpose or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nunderstand the intention of the Labour Minister in\r\n\r\nintroducing this amendment Bill, which is to gear\r\n\r\nour legislation to the industrialisation of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We know that this is a very competitive\r\n\r\nage. In order to progress in our indus\r\n\r\ntrialisation, it is necessary to increase the\r\n\r\nefficiency and productivity of our labour. This is\r\n\r\na good intention from the outset. But it may give\r\n\r\nrise to two problems. Firstly, as the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah has said, the wages of female\r\n\r\nworkers are lower than those paid to male workers.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether there is really some form of\r\n\r\nexploitation, because if low wages are paid to\r\n\r\nfemale workers, then employers will tend to employ\r\n\r\nmore female workers. As a result, there will be\r\n\r\nmore unemployment among the male workers. This is\r\n\r\none point which I wish to bring to the attention\r\n\r\nof the Minister. Mr Speaker, in order to give\r\n\r\nfacilities to and make it convenient for the em\r\n\r\nployers, we must advise them not to exploit the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem arises in cases where\r\n\r\nemployers may have female workers. If night shift\r\n\r\nis compulsory for female workers, then some\r\n\r\ninconvenience will be caused to the household of\r\n\r\nthe female workers concerned. Before any\r\n\r\ncompulsion is exercised on working night shifts,\r\n\r\nthe employers should ask the female workers\r\n\r\nwhether they agree to working night shifts or not.\r\n\r\nIf some female workers are not prepared to work\r\n\r\nnight shifts, I think they should not be asked to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I only wish to touch\r\n\r\non one aspect of this Labour (Amendment) Bill. It\r\n\r\nis the labour policy of the Government to help the\r\n\r\nworkers. This is a progressive policy which is\r\n\r\ndifficult to find in South-east Asian countries.\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to be very proud of it.\r\n\r\nComparatively speaking, our labour policy is\r\n\r\nbetter and more enlightened than that of other\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries in this region. However, in\r\n\r\nmy humble view, if we have a new labour policy,\r\n\r\nthen there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be no distinction between female workers\r\n\r\nand male workers in respect of labour. They are\r\n\r\nworkers all the same. We should not distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween the sexes as far as labour is concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the P.A.P. Government not to\r\n\r\nmake a distinction between the sexes. Of course,\r\n\r\nin anatomy there must be some differences. A male\r\n\r\nis a male. But in so far as the working class is\r\n\r\nconcerned, there should be no distinction between\r\n\r\nfemale and male workers. In my view, there should\r\n\r\nbe equality between workers of the two sexes,\r\n\r\nequal pay for equal work. This is in the manifesto\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. According to this progressive labour\r\n\r\npolicy, if we should come across any female\r\n\r\nworkers receiving lower wages than men, then, as a\r\n\r\nprogressive labour Government, we should not allow\r\n\r\nthis to happen.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I spoke earlier in this House about\r\n\r\nthe poor treatment given to workers in the Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Complex. I was not talking about female\r\n\r\nworkers particularly. I was just passing a general\r\n\r\nremark that the wages paid in the Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Estate are generally poor. We should\r\n\r\nnot sacrifice the interest of labour in order to\r\n\r\ncut down the cost of production. It is on this\r\n\r\npoint that I spoke earlier. We must give some\r\n\r\nthought to the question of whether labour will\r\n\r\nbenefit by this kind of productivity increase. We\r\n\r\nshould not gauge the cost of production in terms\r\n\r\nof labour only. We must not forget that if we cut\r\n\r\ndown the cost of production in terms of labour\r\n\r\nonly, that will give more benefit to the employers\r\n\r\nand the capitalists. It is the business of employ\r\n\r\ners and employees together to shoulder a lowering\r\n\r\nof the cost of production. I think the wages of\r\n\r\nfemale workers are not so attractive as those paid\r\n\r\nto the male workers. I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nLabour Minister is aware of this. In my\r\n\r\nconstituency there are many female workers working\r\n\r\nin the Jurong Industrial Estate. When I saw them,\r\n\r\nthey expressed the same sentiments. Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\ndo not want to bring this matter up myself because\r\n\r\nSingapore has many unions in existence and because\r\n\r\nI do not want to show off. The unions have enough\r\n\r\nstrength to speak\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the workers, it is my hope that the labour\r\n\r\nleaders will make clear their attitude on this\r\n\r\npoint. But as a representative of the people and\r\n\r\nsince such views have been expressed by the voters\r\n\r\nin my constituency, I have to bring them up in\r\n\r\nthis House. A progressive labour policy should\r\n\r\nmake no distinction between the sexes. All workers\r\n\r\nmust be given equal treatment and eoual wages.\r\n\r\nOnly then will there be no chance for the\r\n\r\nemployers to exploit the situation by way of a\r\n\r\ndisparity in the wages of female and male workers.\r\n\r\nIn this way the female workers will not be\r\n\r\nexploited. Mr Speaker, if we allow this situation\r\n\r\nto go on, then the tendency among employers will\r\n\r\nbe to employ more female workers and that will be\r\n\r\nagainst our progressive labour policy. I do not\r\n\r\nthink the labour leaders will allow this to\r\n\r\nhappen, although most of them are of the male sex.\r\n\r\nI do not believe the males will allow the females\r\n\r\nto be exploited in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to night shifts for female workers in\r\n\r\nthis amendment Bill, several Members have spoken\r\n\r\non it. So far as I am personally concerned, the\r\n\r\nmain point will depend on whether there is any\r\n\r\nnecessity or justification for female workers to\r\n\r\nwork at night. There are many countries in Europe\r\n\r\nwhere female workers work at night without causing\r\n\r\nany inconvenience. In so far as security is\r\n\r\nconcerned, if female workers are safeguarded at\r\n\r\nnight, there will not be much trouble. That is my\r\n\r\nview. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour will take heed of the problems I have\r\n\r\noutlined earlier and make some clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Singapore has already\r\n\r\ngot the Women's Charter, and there have been some\r\n\r\namendments introduced in this House to improve it.\r\n\r\nNow we are giving some thought to the labour laws\r\n\r\nin regard to female workers working at night.

This\r\n\r\ngives me encouragement to praise the Government\r\n\r\nall the more. In short, the Labour (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill and the Women's Charter are measures aimed at\r\n\r\nthe emancipation of the female sex. The idea\r\n\r\nbehind the amendment Bill is to give facilities to\r\n\r\nfemale workers in cases where the work is more\r\n\r\nsuitable to them. The question that arises is\r\n\r\nwhether this amendment Bill will have any\r\n\r\nrepercussions. In some cases where the work is not\r\n\r\nso suitable for female workers, will it be the\r\n\r\ntendency for employers to employ more female\r\n\r\nworkers, instead of male workers? Will there be\r\n\r\nany discrimination on their part between the\r\n\r\nsexes? Is it possible to engage either a male\r\n\r\nworker or a female worker? Will there be a\r\n\r\nstronger bias against the males? Supposing you\r\n\r\nwant to engage a secretary, a male or a female can\r\n\r\ndo the job all the same. If you pay equal wages\r\n\r\nfor equal work, then, according to the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, this will give rise to exploitation.\r\n\r\nThere is bound to be a disparity in wages between\r\n\r\nthe two sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will now go to the second point.\r\n\r\nFollowing the passage of the Labour (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill, we can expect more female workers to appear\r\n\r\nin our labour market, particularly in night\r\n\r\nshifts. So the question of security measures\r\n\r\narises. I have some experience with regard to the\r\n\r\nRedhill Industrial Estate. Previously some\r\n\r\nfactories in Redhill refused to engage female work\r\n\r\ners because at that time street lights were not\r\n\r\ninstalled, so that some parts\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Redhill Estate were rather dark. It was,\r\n\r\ntherefore, not convenient for female workers to\r\n\r\nwork at night. In spite of my repeated requests to\r\n\r\ninstall lamp posts, we have not seen any in the\r\n\r\nRedhill Industrial Estate. Because of the darkness\r\n\r\nthere was a sense of insecurity then among the\r\n\r\nfemale workers who were called to do night shifts.\r\n\r\nI hope that following the passage of this Bill,\r\n\r\nappropriate steps will be taken to make working\r\n\r\nconditions more conducive to the security of the\r\n\r\nworkers of both sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what has been said by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour to amend the Ordinance is to meet the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the unemployment situation in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the light of the economic situation.\r\n\r\nIn this context, this Labour (Amendment) Bill is\r\n\r\nsuitable, and I fully agree with it. But after\r\n\r\nhearing the different speeches by the Members for\r\n\r\nDelta and Telok Blangah about workers employed in\r\n\r\nthe pioneer industries in Jurong and other\r\n\r\nindustrial areas, it is not convenient for me here\r\n\r\nto express any more points of view. If our\r\n\r\nGovernment is a pro-labour government which adopts\r\n\r\na very enlightened policy on labour, I think it is\r\n\r\nadvisable to form an investigation committee and\r\n\r\ngo to the Jurong industrial area to investigate\r\n\r\nwhether it is true that the labourers there are\r\n\r\nexploited by the employers, or whether they get\r\n\r\nequal treatment for both sexes. This is my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, I wish to say a few words on this\r\n\r\namendment Bill. It looks as though the employers\r\n\r\nwill benefit by it, because the wages of female\r\n\r\nworkers are less. They will be of the opinion that\r\n\r\nthey may profit more if they employ female\r\n\r\nworkers. The men may take advantage of the\r\n\r\nsituation and send their wives to work at night\r\n\r\nwhile they go off to sleep. If this is the\r\n\r\nattitude of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe men, then women will be working at night in\r\n\r\nall the establishments. Why should we allow them\r\n\r\nto work at night? We should provide security for\r\n\r\nthem and if they go to work after 7 p.m., their\r\n\r\nparents or their husbands should escort them. So\r\n\r\nit is not proper to send women to work at night.\r\n\r\nEven if we have to do so, the employers should pay\r\n\r\nthem the same wages as the men. If we insist on\r\n\r\nthat, we have to see that the employers comply\r\n\r\nwith this request. I do not think this is proper\r\n\r\nfor the country or for the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Ministry says productivity will be\r\n\r\nincreased by the passing of this Bill. But this\r\n\r\naim may result in a decrease in production because\r\n\r\nthe employers may be employing female workers at\r\n\r\nnight and I do not think this will give any\r\n\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

When the P.A.P. came to power\r\n\r\nin 1959, it introduced the Women's Charter Bill.\r\n\r\nNow we have the Labour (Amendment) Bill in front\r\n\r\nof us, enabling women workers to work round the\r\n\r\nclock.

But. I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour whether this amendment Bill\r\n\r\nwill be imposed on waitresses in bars and night\r\n\r\nclubs who work beyond 10 p.m. If this is imposed\r\n\r\non them, it is good because it will be for the\r\n\r\nbenefit of our society at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I\r\n\r\nreally cannot satisfy his curiosity why we should\r\n\r\ncall a female labourer a workman instead of a\r\n\r\nworkwoman. I think this is the word in the\r\n\r\noriginal Labour Ordinance where it is stated that\r\n\r\na workman means a worker whether it is of the\r\n\r\nfemale or male sex. I think this is only for the\r\n\r\nsake of convenience. Maybe the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nhas already answered the question when she said\r\n\r\nthat we must never emphasise the sex when we speak\r\n\r\nof a workman. A worker is a worker whether it is a\r\n\r\nmale worker or a male worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is rather old-fashioned of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan to insist that the female\r\n\r\nworker should be allowed to work only in the day-time and not at night. He is also worried that,\r\n\r\nwith the passage of this Bill, telephone operators\r\n\r\nand workers in other establishments will be\r\n\r\nsubject to this 24-hour work shift. I have said\r\n\r\njust now that this law does not necessarily apply\r\n\r\nto all the establishments. Once this law is\r\n\r\npassed, it will still be necessary for a factory\r\n\r\nor an establishment to apply for the right to work\r\n\r\nfemale workers on a 24-hour shift. It is not\r\n\r\nautomatically the case that they will come in.\r\n\r\nInitially we will only allow factories which are\r\n\r\nexport-orientated to put their female workers on a\r\n\r\n24-hour shift. So the Member need not have any\r\n\r\nworry that operators in the Telephone Board will\r\n\r\nbe put immediately on this 24-hour shift.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah and the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta touched upon the low pay of female workers\r\n\r\nespecially in the factories at Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I never said that the workers\r\n\r\nare very lowly paid. I made a general remark, that\r\n\r\nworkers are paid according to the industry in\r\n\r\nwhich they work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I beg his pardon. But last\r\n\r\nTuesday and also today the Member for Delta says\r\n\r\nthat female workers especially in Jurong are very\r\n\r\nlowly paid. The Member for Bras Basah has\r\n\r\nsuggested that we should set up a commission of\r\n\r\ninquiry to look into this matter. I do not think\r\n\r\nthis is really necessary. It may be a one-sided\r\n\r\naffair because, according to a sample survey\r\n\r\nconducted in July 1966, the monthly average\r\n\r\nearnings of female workers of 18 years and above\r\n\r\nin all factories was\r\n\r\n$100.80, and the highest average monthly earnings\r\n\r\nof $120.90 was recorded in the tobacco, cigarette,\r\n\r\ncigar and other tobacco product industry, whilst\r\n\r\nthe lowest average monthly earnings of $70.50 was\r\n\r\nrecorded in the paper product, including\r\n\r\nstationery and hard boxes, industry. The main\r\n\r\nfactor affecting the differences in the rates of\r\n\r\npay of female workers in various occupations and\r\n\r\nindustries is the skill required in the\r\n\r\nperformance of the job. In other words, the\r\n\r\ngreater the skill, the higher the rate of pay.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly manifested by the figures already\r\n\r\ngiven for the paper product industry in which\r\n\r\nunskilled labour is involved, as against the\r\n\r\nrelatively higher monthly earnings in the tobacco,\r\n\r\ncigarette and cigar industry. In the textile and\r\n\r\ngarment industry, the predominant rates of pay for\r\n\r\nfemale workers, other than those who are under\r\n\r\ntraining or who are partially trained, vary from a\r\n\r\nminimum of $2.70 to $2.90 per day of eight hours\r\n\r\nin such occupations as weavers, spinners, knitters\r\n\r\nand twisters. Whilst in the shirt and garment\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industry, the average wages per day\r\n\r\nrange from $2.58 to $3.24, in occupations such as\r\n\r\ncutters, sewing-machine operators, iron workers,\r\n\r\npacking workers and seamstresses, the average\r\n\r\nwages are up to $5.49 per day. However, during the\r\n\r\nperiod of training which ranges from one month to\r\n\r\nsix months, female workers are paid from $1.50 to\r\n\r\n$2.25 per day according to the trade in which they\r\n\r\nare being trained. After training,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey are generally put on piece rates subject to a\r\n\r\nminimum earning of $2.50 per day, which is the\r\n\r\namount an inefficient worker earns. A worker with\r\n\r\ngreater productivity earns from $4 to $5 per day\r\n\r\nand even up to $8 in the case of some workers in\r\n\r\none particular factory. In other words, the\r\n\r\nearnings are dependent on the skill of the worker,\r\n\r\nand the greater the skill and productivity of the\r\n\r\nworker, the higher the earnings. It is quite\r\n\r\nevident that no factory will pay a worker much\r\n\r\nmore than he or she is worth in terms of\r\n\r\nproduction. If labour costs are artificially\r\n\r\ninflated merely to increase the earnings of the\r\n\r\nworkers even though their productivity is low, no\r\n\r\none is going to open a factory in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nintelligent way to deal with this problem is to\r\n\r\nhelp the workers to improve their skills so that\r\n\r\nthey may earn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre at J urong is\r\n\r\nnow considering the introduction of three\r\n\r\nindustrial training classes for new workers before\r\n\r\nthey get into the factories. The objective of\r\n\r\nthese classes is to acclimatise the workers to a\r\n\r\nworking environment with some rudimentary\r\n\r\nknowledge of the trade into which he or she will\r\n\r\nenter. This will enable them to imbibe more\r\n\r\nquickly the skills required for the jobs they will\r\n\r\nhave to perform. These courses, in the initial\r\n\r\nstages, will be mainly directed at producing\r\n\r\nfemale workers for the textile industry so that,\r\n\r\nwith the skills that they will acquire in a\r\n\r\nshorter period, they will start earning better\r\n\r\nwages earlier. Indeed, trained textile and garment\r\n\r\nfactory workers can easily earn from $4 to $5 per\r\n\r\nday with improved skills and better productivity.\r\n\r\nMembers of the House will agree that these rates\r\n\r\ncompare favourably with the rates given even to\r\n\r\nmale unskilled workers in many cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is also afraid that by\r\n\r\nputting female workers to work at night, it may\r\n\r\naffect their family life. I do not think he need\r\n\r\nworry about this because most of the workers in\r\n\r\nthese factories are between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18 years and 22 years of age, and I do not think\r\n\r\nthat women in this age group have a lot of babies\r\n\r\nto look after at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah is concerned about the\r\n\r\nsecurity of women who have to go home very late\r\n\r\nat night. I think the answer, as he has said, will\r\n\r\nbe to ask for more street lights and to seek\r\n\r\nbetter and more efficient police protection in the\r\n\r\narea. But even at the present moment, without this\r\n\r\nlaw being enforced, female workers still have to\r\n\r\ngo home very late, because they are allowed to\r\n\r\nwork up to 11 or 12 o'clock at night. But, on the\r\n\r\nother hand, if this, law is passed whereby a woman\r\n\r\nis allowed to work the third shift, then, instead\r\n\r\nof going home at 11 or 12 o'clock midnight, she\r\n\r\nmay have to go home very early in the morning, at\r\n\r\n6 o'clock, in which case I do not think we have to\r\n\r\nworry much about the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As a rule, the\r\n\r\nrole of finance\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies as financial intermediaries is limited\r\n\r\nto the mobilisation of domestic savings to finance\r\n\r\nthe purchase of consumer durables. In the absence\r\n\r\nof proper supervision, however, these companies\r\n\r\ncould turn into vehicles for risking household\r\n\r\nsavings on speculative ventures of the directors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two limbs to the definition of\r\n\r\n\"financing business\" given in clause 2 of the Bill\r\n\r\n- (i) borrowing money from the public by\r\n\r\nacceptance of deposits and issuing documents\r\n\r\nacknowledging indebtedness and undertaking to\r\n\r\nrepay the money on call or after an agreed\r\n\r\nmaturity period; and (ii) lending money to the\r\n\r\npublic or to a related company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming into force of this Bill, no\r\n\r\nfinancing business shall be transacted by a\r\n\r\ncompany unless it is a public company and is in\r\n\r\npossession of a licence granted by the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Finance Companies who shall be\r\n\r\nappointed by the Minister. One of the conditions\r\n\r\nfor the issue of a licence is that the paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital of a company shall not be less than\r\n\r\n$500,000. The Bill contains transitional\r\n\r\nprovisions enabling exemption of existing finance\r\n\r\ncompanies from this requirement. It also allows\r\n\r\nthe licensing of unincorporated firms, such as\r\n\r\npawnbrokers who are now engaged in financing\r\n\r\nbusiness, on condition that they incorporate\r\n\r\nthemselves into public companies within three\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finance company is prohibited from engaging in\r\n\r\ntrade or investing more than 25 per cent of its\r\n\r\ncapital and reserves in other undertakings. Nor\r\n\r\ncan it acquire immovable property otherwise than\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of conducting its business.\r\n\r\nUnsecured advances are subject to a maximum of\r\n\r\n$1,000. There is also a prohibition on a finance\r\n\r\ncompany dealing in its own shares. Existing\r\n\r\nfinance companies who have so entered into any of\r\n\r\nthese prohibited transactions are allowed six\r\n\r\nmonths, subject to extension by the Commissioner,\r\n\r\nin which to liquidate such transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every finance company is required to maintain a\r\n\r\nreserve fund. This Bill imposes restrictions on\r\n\r\nthe declaration of dividends to shareholders until\r\n\r\na company builds up its reserve fund equal to its\r\n\r\npaid-up capital. A prescribed percentage of a\r\n\r\nfinance company's deposit liability shall be held\r\n\r\nin liquid assets comprising legal tender, bank\r\n\r\nbalances, money at call, and Treasury bills. Here\r\n\r\nagain, existing finance companies are allowed a\r\n\r\nsix months' period of grace to meet this\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to prescribe maximum rates of interest payable on deposits and chargeable on advances, the maximum amount of advances which may be made to any person or class of persons, the maximum percentage of total assets that a company may hold in particular types of\r\n\r\nadvances, minimum down payments and maximum\r\n\r\nmaturity periods for loans or advances. The\r\n\r\nMinister may also prescribe reserves to be\r\n\r\nmaintained with the Accountant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for periodic inspection by the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of the books and accounts of a\r\n\r\nfinance company. The Commissioner is also\r\n\r\nempowered to obtain such information and data as\r\n\r\nhe may require for the proper discharge of his\r\n\r\nfunctions. If a finance company contravenes any\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill or carries on its business\r\n\r\nin a manner detrimental to the interests of its\r\n\r\ndepositors or becomes insolvent, the Commissioner\r\n\r\nmay revoke its licence. There is also provision\r\n\r\nfor appeal to the Minister on the Commissioner's\r\n\r\ndecision to revoke a licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a winding-up of a company, the\r\n\r\ndepositors shall be deemed to be holders of\r\n\r\ndebentures secured by a floating charge over all\r\n\r\nthe property and undertaking of the company. The\r\n\r\nliquidator of the company is enjoined to inform\r\n\r\nevery debtor of the company and to require him in\r\n\r\nwriting to redeem within three months any property\r\n\r\nhe had deposited with the company as security.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operative societies, banks, and the Post\r\n\r\nOffice Savings Bank are exempted from the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been drafted with the assistance\r\n\r\nof an expert sent by the International Monetary\r\n\r\nFund. It was the intention of the Government to\r\n\r\nsend this Bill to Select Committee so that the\r\n\r\nviews of the public and those whose interests are\r\n\r\ndirectly affected by the Bill may have opportunity\r\n\r\nof expression. Unfortunately, in the last few\r\n\r\nmonths there has been a very rapid increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber of finance companies. This proliferation of\r\n\r\nfinance companies can hardly be looked upon with\r\n\r\nequanimity. Members will recollect that in 1962 it\r\n\r\nwas necessary to legislate for the control of\r\n\r\nmushroom insurance companies. Many of these were\r\n\r\nof dubious character and in the process of\r\n\r\nliquidation, large numbers of innocent persons who\r\n\r\nhad placed their money with these insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies suffered losses. I am not suggesting\r\n\r\nthat all or any of the finance companies now in\r\n\r\noperation are of the same class as the insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies. I know for a fact that a number of\r\n\r\nfinance companies have impeccable backgrounds.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot say this for all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the very rapid growth in the number\r\n\r\nof new companies, it is necessary to pass this\r\n\r\nBill without reference to Select Committee so that\r\n\r\nproper control may be established and that future\r\n\r\nproliferation can be checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of this Bill, I have\r\n\r\nreceived a number of representations from finance\r\n\r\ncompanies and these are being studied. Every\r\n\r\nconsideration will be given to the representations\r\n\r\nand, if necessary, this legislation can be amended\r\n\r\nin an amending Bill. I must say, however, that I\r\n\r\nam not in sympathy with all the representations\r\n\r\nthat I have received. We cannot have finance com\r\n\r\npanies encroaching into territory which properly\r\n\r\nbelongs to banks. It is not an accident that the\r\n\r\ngrowth of finance companies took place at a time\r\n\r\nwhen control and supervision of banks were\r\n\r\ntightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I acknowledge that different\r\n\r\nkinds of finance institutions are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneeded to mobilise our capital resources and that\r\n\r\na proper role must be defined for finance\r\n\r\ncompanies. This Bill is the first attempt at the\r\n\r\ndefinition of such a role. Some companies have\r\n\r\nexpressed alarm that `they would have to liquidate\r\n\r\nsome of their liabilities within six months. I\r\n\r\ngive them an assurance that an extension of this\r\n\r\nperiod will be granted to' finance companies which\r\n\r\nhave genuinely been attempting to liquidate these\r\n\r\nliabilities within the six-month period of grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the establishment of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies in Singapore has recently been\r\n\r\nincreasing at a very speedy pace. They might not\r\n\r\nbe as prolific as the mushroom, but they certainly\r\n\r\nhave become, in total, a very significant and\r\n\r\ninfluential financial institution in our economy.\r\n\r\nTheir influence and dynamism in our economy have\r\n\r\ncaused us no comfort. As representatives of the\r\n\r\nelectorate, we cannot sit back with little care or\r\n\r\ntotal indifference. As influential financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, the finance companies operating i11\r\n\r\nSingapore may be able to contribute significantly\r\n\r\nto the economic well-being of our society if they\r\n\r\nare brought under proper control. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, they may render inflation-investment,\r\n\r\ndisequilibrium and even economic chaos should we\r\n\r\nindifferently allow them to run wild. I positively\r\n\r\nsupport and congratulate our Minister for Finance\r\n\r\non tabling this timely Finance Companies Bill to\r\n\r\nregulate the operation of finance companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a sweeping survey of the island, we\r\n\r\ndiscover the following types of business\r\n\r\norganisations operating as finance companies.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there are the so-called hire\r\n\r\npurchase companies which deal with sales of motor\r\n\r\nvehicles, sewing machines, television and radio\r\n\r\nsets and other durable goods in instalments. They\r\n\r\ncall themselves hire purchase companies when, in\r\n\r\nfact, they\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare conducting sales of goods in instalments. The\r\n\r\ndistinction between hire purchase and sales in\r\n\r\ninstalments is this. On hire purchase terms, the\r\n\r\ngoods are delivered to the buyer after he has made\r\n\r\na down payment, but the ownership of the goods\r\n\r\nremains with the seller, while the buyer enjoys\r\n\r\nthe use of the goods as well as the option to buy\r\n\r\nwhile making the monthly instalments. On sales in\r\n\r\ninstalments, the goods are delivered to the buyer\r\n\r\nwho is supposed to buy the goods without an\r\n\r\noption; thus the ownership of the goods goes to\r\n\r\nthe buyer immediately. Against this legal\r\n\r\nconception of hire purchase and sales in\r\n\r\ninstalments, we understand that hire purchase\r\n\r\ncompanies finance the sales in instalments on hire-purchase agreement, giving the buyer no option to\r\n\r\nbuy, but the ownership of the goods remains with\r\n\r\nthe finance companies unless and until the final\r\n\r\npayment is made. In other words, the buyer has to\r\n\r\nforego the option to buy and yet he holds no title\r\n\r\nto the goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hire-purchase companies of this kind are\r\n\r\nbeing set up with very little paid-up capital.\r\n\r\nThey normally act as agents for big finance houses\r\n\r\nto conduct hire-purchase transactions. Though they\r\n\r\ndeal in the borrowing and lending of money, they\r\n\r\noperate under the Hire Purchase Ordinance and are\r\n\r\nnot in any way regulated or restricted by the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have pawnshops all over the island\r\n\r\nborrowing and lending money. The bulk of their\r\n\r\nbusiness is to lend money on acceptance of durable\r\n\r\narticles, though title deeds are also acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe sources of funds for their operations are\r\n\r\ntheir own paid-up capital, operating profits,\r\n\r\ndeposits from the public, and money received for\r\n\r\ncustody. Many cases of deposits of money received\r\n\r\nfor custody are accepted on a gentlemen's\r\n\r\nagreement and business trust, with or without\r\n\r\ndocumentary evidence acknowledging their receipt;\r\n\r\nand there are not a few cases where the so-called\r\n\r\ngentlemen's agreement and business trust are\r\n\r\nrendered valueless as they are not enforceable \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin a court of law or even in equity. As\r\n\r\nwe have as yet no legislation or a statutory\r\n\r\nprescribed rate of interest payable by pawnshops\r\n\r\nto the depositors of money, the consideration\r\n\r\nallowed for the deposit of monies with the pawn\r\n\r\nshops remains a subject for bargaining. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we require very little imagination\r\n\r\nto visualise a simpleminded member of the public,\r\n\r\nwith a sum of money and without any investment\r\n\r\nopportunities, going to a pawnshop and bargaining\r\n\r\nwith a highly business-minded pawnshop proprietor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the business-front organisation of\r\n\r\nthe banks, i.e., the finance companies wholly\r\n\r\nowned by the banks. Openly these finance houses\r\n\r\nare set up to conduct business transactions which\r\n\r\nthe banks are prohibited from doing. For instance,\r\n\r\nthe Banking Ordinance controls the payment of\r\n\r\nrates of interest by banks to depositors for fixed-term savings, but the finance houses are at\r\n\r\nliberty in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot afford to deny the\r\n\r\nimportance of moneylenders licensed or unlicensed,\r\n\r\nin the money market. Licensed moneylenders, on\r\n\r\nobtaining a licence, automatically come under the\r\n\r\nrestrictions and regulations laid down in the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders Ordinance. Unlicensed moneylenders,\r\n\r\nthough not legally recognised, or to be more\r\n\r\ncorrect, they are operating illegally, certainly\r\n\r\nhave some business influence in business circles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not the least are the finance companies\r\n\r\nincorporated under the Companies Ordinance. They\r\n\r\nform the major arm in financing business. They\r\n\r\ndeal in heavy borrowing and lending, yet they may\r\n\r\nor may not come under the restrictions laid down\r\n\r\nin the Moneylenders Ordinance, depending on\r\n\r\nexemption provided in the Ordinance being granted.\r\n\r\nOn exemption being granted, these finance\r\n\r\ncompanies have a free hand in financing\r\n\r\nactivities. They are apt to charge the borrowers\r\n\r\nexorbitant interest rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having described the aforesaid\r\n\r\ncategories of financial institutions, my\r\n\r\nuncertainty, which I hope can\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe clarified, is this. Is the Finance Companies\r\n\r\nAct, 1967, as introduced by the Hon, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, to be adopted for regulating and\r\n\r\ncontrolling all categories of finance\r\n\r\norganisations, firms, houses and companies? Sub-clause (1) of clause 3 provides that no financing\r\n\r\nbusiness shall be transacted in Singapore except\r\n\r\nby a company that is in possession of a valid\r\n\r\nlicence granted by the Commissioner for Finance\r\n\r\nCompanies, and \"financing business\" as interpreted\r\n\r\nin clause 2 means the business of borrowing money\r\n\r\nand lending money. Am I to understand that a\r\n\r\nlicence is essential for all types of financing\r\n\r\nbusiness organisations irrespective of whether\r\n\r\nthey are under the regulations and restrictions of\r\n\r\nother Ordinances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in our society where public\r\n\r\neconomic planning and private enterprises are\r\n\r\noperating hand in hand, certain projects are\r\n\r\noperating under statutory bodies as monopoly under\r\n\r\ntakings and as an encouragement to commercial and\r\n\r\nindustrial activities. In the absence of national\r\n\r\nfinance organisations, financial institutions\r\n\r\noperated by private entrepreneurs become the baby\r\n\r\nto be taken care of by legislation. From the\r\n\r\neconomic point of view, the financial institutions\r\n\r\nin Singapore are playing a supplementary as well\r\n\r\nas a complementary role to the banks as evidenced\r\n\r\nby the fact that most banks establish finance\r\n\r\nhouses of their own. A banking corporation in any\r\n\r\ncountry, even in totalitarian States, is a vital\r\n\r\nfinancial institution. The banking corporations in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as elsewhere, owing to certain\r\n\r\nlimitations, statutory, economic or otherwise,\r\n\r\nhave not been able to serve the economy to the\r\n\r\nbest of their ability and because of this, finance\r\n\r\ncompanies have come into the picture. One of the\r\n\r\nfinancial activities which the finance companies\r\n\r\nundertake to supplement those of the banks is the\r\n\r\ntapping of the financial resources at large and\r\n\r\ncollectively channel them into fruitful investment\r\n\r\nand development projects. Another financial\r\n\r\nactivity undertaken by finance companies to\r\n\r\nsupplement those of the banks is to providc loan\r\n\r\nfacilities, it is very well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown that practically all banks in Singapore are\r\n\r\nreluctant to provide long-term loans and even\r\n\r\ntheir short-term credit facilities are available\r\n\r\nonly to selected clients and with the provision of\r\n\r\nsecurity. In the light of these wants and demands,\r\n\r\nfinance companies come in to make available hire-purchase financing, house and property mortgage\r\n\r\nloans to individuals, machinery and equipment\r\n\r\nloans to industries, and general unsecured loan\r\n\r\nfacilities. In summary, finance companies provide\r\n\r\nservices and conduct financing activities which\r\n\r\nare not available from banks and these\r\n\r\nsupplementary activities help in accelerating the\r\n\r\neconomic growth of the State.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, knowing the significant role\r\n\r\nthe finance companies are playing in the economy,\r\n\r\nwe recognise without any reservation the urgency\r\n\r\nof a Bill to regulate and control the operations\r\n\r\nof finance companies as financial institutions,\r\n\r\nlest they run wild and give rise to inflation,\r\n\r\nbusiness disorder and economic destruction. In\r\n\r\naddition to recognising the need of a Finance Com\r\n\r\npanies Bill, I wish to reiterate my appreciation\r\n\r\nof our Minister for Finance in introducing the\r\n\r\nFinance Companies Bill. But while we recognise the\r\n\r\nneed for such a Bill to be introduced to protect\r\n\r\nthe interests of depositors and the general public\r\n\r\nagainst unscrupulous finance institutions, there\r\n\r\nis also the need to review some of the clauses and\r\n\r\ncertain provisions included in the Bill for the\r\n\r\nimplementation and administration of the Bill. I\r\n\r\nknow that the object of the Finance Companies Bill\r\n\r\nis to safeguard the depositors and the general\r\n\r\npublic against any malpractices by some of the\r\n\r\nunscrupulous finance houses. I also know that\r\n\r\nimpractical restrictive control will curtail\r\n\r\nbusiness activities or even make the finance\r\n\r\ninstitutions extinct. The possible adverse effects\r\n\r\nwill no doubt bring home serious negative\r\n\r\nconsequences to the State. While supporting the\r\n\r\nFinance Companies Bill in imposing control on the\r\n\r\noperations of finance companies and welcoming the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Bill, I wish, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, at this juncture to make\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nsome constructive criticisms of some of the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill. Firstly, clause 20 limits\r\n\r\nthe investment of finance companies to the extent\r\n\r\nof 25 per cent of the paid-up capital. The purpose\r\n\r\nof including this restrictive clause in the Bill\r\n\r\nis presumably to prevent finance companies from\r\n\r\nengaging in risky investment and investing in\r\n\r\nunsound propositions. It may be necessary to\r\n\r\nensure the sound investment policy of each finance\r\n\r\ncompany, but a flat percentage may not be a good\r\n\r\nyardstick in ensuring a sound investment\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the provision prohibiting\r\n\r\nfinance companies from granting loan facilities of\r\n\r\nan unsecured nature of more than $1,000. Without\r\n\r\nthe support of any statistical information, I can\r\n\r\nsafely maintain that $1,000 is too insignificant,\r\n\r\nand to take that amount as the ceiling is very\r\n\r\ninadequate. Bearing in mind the business volume\r\n\r\nand the turnover of the unsecured loan facilities\r\n\r\ngranted and executed by finance companies, I have\r\n\r\nno doubt that the ceiling of $1,000 warrants\r\n\r\nreconsideration. As far as I know, Sir, there are\r\n\r\nfinance companies who grant unsecured loan\r\n\r\nfacilities to borrowers to as much as $10,000 to\r\n\r\n$20,000. The turnover of unsecured loan facilities\r\n\r\nto within $1,000 does not constitute much of a\r\n\r\ntotal. I will pause just a while to ascertain the\r\n\r\nimplications of unsecured loans. Do we, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, consider a loan granted to a\r\n\r\nborrower who has a guarantor willing to undertake\r\n\r\nto indemnify the repayment as an unsecured loan?\r\n\r\nIf the Bill considers loan facilities granted with\r\n\r\nsome personal guarantee are unsecured loans, then\r\n\r\nI maintain that the $1,000 ceiling warrants recon\r\n\r\nsideration. If the Bill considers that as a\r\n\r\nsecured loan, I shall withdraw my observation in\r\n\r\nrespect of this restrictive\r\n\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should be very grateful if\r\n\r\nthe Hon, the Minister for Finance would kindly\r\n\r\nassist in clearing up my uncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to give my full\r\n\r\nsupport to the Finance Companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill as introduced by the Hon. Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have something\r\n\r\nto say on this amendment Bill. Certain points\r\n\r\ntherein should be brought up for discussion. This\r\n\r\nBill will not actually promote economic activity\r\n\r\nand increase the liquidity of finances in the\r\n\r\ncountry to the fullest extent. We know that the\r\n\r\ncapital of these finance companies is obtained by\r\n\r\nway of deposits from the general public. These\r\n\r\nfinance companies are quite different from\r\n\r\nordinary banks. Since our own people invest in\r\n\r\nfinance companies, the Government should look\r\n\r\nafter them. The depositors are mainly middlemen\r\n\r\nand other small traders. Finance companies are not\r\n\r\nlike banks which are controlled by big\r\n\r\ncapitalists. Finance companies carry on operations\r\n\r\nwhich banks do not like to undertake. For\r\n\r\ninstance, they provide loans to the ordinary\r\n\r\npeople to buy cars or houses, or to set up small\r\n\r\nfamily or cottage industries. The ordinary people\r\n\r\ncan get such loans from these finance companies\r\n\r\nwhich they cannot get from the banks. I feel that\r\n\r\nfinance companies have a great role to play in the\r\n\r\naccumulation of capital and a very important place\r\n\r\nin our economy. This Bill touches upon something\r\n\r\nthat is of great importance to the general public\r\n\r\nas well as to the finance companies. I do not\r\n\r\noppose its introduction. This Bill regulates\r\n\r\nfinancing in our economy and protects the\r\n\r\ndepositors. The Government will have to exercise\r\n\r\nsome measure of control over these finance\r\n\r\ncompanies. But because of their close relationship\r\n\r\nwith the population, especially our small\r\n\r\nmerchants, I feel that if we control these finance\r\n\r\ncompanies too much or too strictly, then it may\r\n\r\ncause some undesirable consequences. These finance\r\n\r\ncompanies have a very close relationship with our\r\n\r\nsmall merchants, industrialists and ordinary\r\n\r\npeople. The Government should not discriminate\r\n\r\nagainst them or single them out for special\r\n\r\ntreatment because they have some contribution \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto make to our economy. Yet there is a\r\n\r\nprovision in the Bill that a finance company\r\n\r\nshould have $500,000 paid-up capital and also a\r\n\r\ncertain percentage of liquid assets. In fact, the\r\n\r\ncapital invested in some of these finance\r\n\r\ncompanies exceeds the minimum amount imposed on\r\n\r\nthe banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a regulation that if a\r\n\r\nforeigner invests $350,000 in local industries,\r\n\r\nthen he can bring his family to Singapore and they\r\n\r\ncan even become citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This may appear to some people as some sort of\r\n\r\nfavouritism and therefore we have to look into\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision for the post of Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor Finance Companies to look after the operations\r\n\r\nand accounts of finance companies. Will this\r\n\r\nenhance the confidence of our people in finance\r\n\r\ncompanies? This legislation is aimed at\r\n\r\nsafeguarding the interest of the depositors. We\r\n\r\nshould look after the interest of all the people.\r\n\r\nWe should base our viewpoint on the benefit which\r\n\r\nthese finance companies can bring to our economy.\r\n\r\nWe should bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the Bill is for the protection or the security of depositors, but he has not looked into the consequences. I am worried about the consequences that may befall finance companies as a result of the passage of this Bill. I am also rather worried about the consequences it\r\n\r\nwill have on our economy, a great part of which is\r\n\r\nmotivated and stimulated by finance companies\r\n\r\nthrough deposits by the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that finance companies\r\n\r\nshould not undertake certain transactions, and\r\n\r\nunsecured loans should not be more than $1,000.\r\n\r\nCertain transactions which are not allowed under\r\n\r\nclauses 19, 20 and 21 and so on, will have to be\r\n\r\nliquidated within six months. If finance companies\r\n\r\nhad entered into such transactions and if they\r\n\r\nhave to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliquidate them within six months, then they will\r\n\r\nhave to auction their assets and business. They\r\n\r\nhave to close shop as a result of this. And what\r\n\r\nbenefit will it give to the depositors if such\r\n\r\nconsequences take place? Also the staff of these\r\n\r\nfinance companies will be joining the camp of the\r\n\r\nunemployed. In fact, people find it more\r\n\r\nprofitable to have immovable property in their pos\r\n\r\nsession. For instance, a finance company can buy\r\n\r\nover a whole building for its operations and for\r\n\r\nletting Out to other businesses. Money accruing\r\n\r\nfrom rents would be sufficient to meet expenditure\r\n\r\non running costs, etc., besides leaving a profit.\r\n\r\nThe finance companies can pay the 36 per cent\r\n\r\nproperty tax and 40 per cent income tax. In\r\n\r\naddition to paying these taxes, they can also make\r\n\r\na profit. So there will be no loss to anybody.\r\n\r\nWithout the profit finance companies can secure\r\n\r\nfrom this sort of operation, how can they pay\r\n\r\ninterest to the depositors? If they are required\r\n\r\nto auction all their immovable property, then this\r\n\r\nmay shake our economy. As a result, some family\r\n\r\nand cottage industries may suffer, because they\r\n\r\ncannot get loans easily from big banks. So they\r\n\r\nhave to look to finance companies for unsecured\r\n\r\nloans. The finance companies are the only\r\n\r\nproviders of loans to them. According to the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill, finance companies are\r\n\r\nprohibited from providing unsecured loans of more\r\n\r\nthan $1,000. This being the case, the small\r\n\r\nindustries will suffer. And if finance companies\r\n\r\ncomply with these provisions, there will be\r\n\r\nliquidation within a certain period and the small\r\n\r\nindustries will again suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the provision of unsecured\r\n\r\nloans which should not exceed $1,000. If this\r\n\r\nprovision is to be complied with and other than\r\n\r\nthe liquid\r\n\r\nassets the finance companies have, I feel there is\r\n\r\nno security for the depositors because the finance\r\n\r\ncompanies can also give large amounts of loans on\r\n\r\nother things. There is also a provision stipul\r\n\r\nating that the loans given out should not be more\r\n\r\nthan a certahi percentage of its paid-up capital.\r\n\r\nI should say some finance companies may find it\r\n\r\ndifficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto carry on with their business because of this\r\n\r\nrestriction. Small industries will also suffer. If\r\n\r\nthe Government's intention is to look after the\r\n\r\ninterest of the depositors, then I would suggest\r\n\r\namending clause 16 of the Bill which provides\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a finance company has accepted\r\n\r\nmoney from any person as a deposit the company\r\n\r\nshall within two months after the acceptance of\r\n\r\nthe money issue to that person a document which\r\n\r\nacknowledges or evidences or constitutes an\r\n\r\nacknowledgment of the indebtedness of the company\r\n\r\nin respect of that deposit.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now if the finance company does not issue a\r\n\r\nreceipt on the spot on receipt of the sum of\r\n\r\nmoney, it can put the money away without issuing a\r\n\r\nreceipt or any document to show that it has\r\n\r\nalready received that sum of money deposited. Then\r\n\r\nwhere is the security that is talked of which the\r\n\r\ndepositor can have? If the finance company has a\r\n\r\nlatitude of two months, then it may, perhaps on\r\n\r\nthe last day of the second month, issue a receipt\r\n\r\nof acknowledgment and the depositor will lose two\r\n\r\nmonths' interest on the amount of money deposited.\r\n\r\nIf such a thing happens, it will be a loss to the\r\n\r\ndepositor because he has lost two months' interest\r\n\r\non that amount of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are other Members who want to\r\n\r\nspeak on this Bill. So I would not like to say too\r\n\r\nmuch. I feel generally that the Minister should\r\n\r\nnot be too insistent. He should be more flexible.\r\n\r\nHe should send the Bill to a Select Committee and\r\n\r\nhear representations from the people concerned and\r\n\r\namend the Bill if necessary so as to make it\r\n\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe expressed purpose of this Bill is to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe interest of members of the public who deposit\r\n\r\nfunds with finance companies. In moving the Second\r\n\r\nReading of the Bill, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ntried to make out a case for his new law. As in\r\n\r\nany trade or business, there are good companies\r\n\r\nand bad ones, good traders and bad ones, There may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe a finance company formed by persons who require\r\n\r\nmoney for their own business. They are unable to\r\n\r\nobtain finance from banks or other sources of\r\n\r\nloans and so they form a finance company to raise\r\n\r\ncapi.tal for their own business. There may be\r\n\r\nothers where the intention of the directors is to\r\n\r\ncollect as much money as possible from the public\r\n\r\non the promise of very high interest, and then do\r\n\r\na bunk. Finance companies which are formed on this\r\n\r\nbasis or which are run on these lines are a menace\r\n\r\nand the public must be protected from them. But\r\n\r\nthe question I ask is, are these .the only types\r\n\r\nof finance companies? The answer must be \"No\". We\r\n\r\nhave not heard of any finance company in Singapore\r\n\r\nfailing. There are many finance companies\r\n\r\noperating in Singapore. Most are honest and\r\n\r\nprovide a very useful service to the investing\r\n\r\npublic who do not have enough money to buy\r\n\r\nproperty. Also to those who do not understand\r\n\r\nshares, they give a slightly higher rate of\r\n\r\ninterest than the bank gives. There are many\r\n\r\nborrowers who cannot obtain loans from banks. They\r\n\r\nsay that banks only lend money to people who have\r\n\r\na lot of money and want to double what they have.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the small trader or the young\r\n\r\nprofessional man who is just starting out in his\r\n\r\ncareer to obtain any starting capital from banks.\r\n\r\nIn other countries, banks are not so old-fashioned\r\n\r\nas Singapore banks. The small trader and the young\r\n\r\nprofessional man in Singapore must turn to finance\r\n\r\ncompanies. The explanatory statemen.t of the Bill\r\n\r\nsays that it is proper that finance companies\r\n\r\nshould wherever possible be assimilated with\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must this be done? Finance companies are\r\n\r\nvery different from banks. If we pass this new\r\n\r\nlaw, we may have no finance companies but numerous\r\n\r\nbanks in a few years' time. Where then is the\r\n\r\nsmall trader or young professional man to go if he\r\n\r\ncannot give security to obtain a loan of more than\r\n\r\n$1,000? If the main reason for introducing this\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw is to control the bad finance company, is\r\n\r\nthere no risk that we will kill the good finance\r\n\r\ncompany as well? There is a serious danger that\r\n\r\nthis will be the result because there is little\r\n\r\nthat is certain in a section of this Bill. A lot\r\n\r\nof discretion is given. I am not a lawyer. From my\r\n\r\nlittle understanding of this Bill, the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Ftnance Companies is going to be\r\n\r\nmade a very powerful man. He may even have more\r\n\r\npowers than other civil servants except the\r\n\r\nBanking Commissioner. Everything is left to his\r\n\r\ndiscretion. Under clause 5, he can grant a licence\r\n\r\nwith or without conditions. He may refuse a\r\n\r\nlicence. No rules are laid down, though he must\r\n\r\nact with the approval of the Minister. He need not\r\n\r\ngive reasons. There is no appeal from him. Having\r\n\r\ngiven the licence, he may at any time vary or\r\n\r\nrevoke the conditions or impose additional\r\n\r\nconditions. This is in clause 5 (4). Sub-clause (4) says nothing about the Minister's approval.\r\n\r\nAgain, no rules are laid down to say when the Com\r\n\r\nmissioner can vary or revoke conditions. All that\r\n\r\nthe sub-clause says is that he can do so at any\r\n\r\ntime. Furthermore, there is no appeal; no notice\r\n\r\nis required. A provision like this makes the Com\r\n\r\nmissioner a very powerful man indeed! Clause 7\r\n\r\nalso gives him such powers. So does clause 8, but\r\n\r\nhere in sub-clause (4) there is a right of appeal\r\n\r\nto the Minister. But under clause 28 (3) , the Com\r\n\r\nmissioner must act in accordance with the\r\n\r\nMinister's directions. I am not worried about the\r\n\r\npresent Minister, but who knows what kind of a man\r\n\r\nour future Minister may be? There is no appeal\r\n\r\nunder clause 9. Clause 10 gives a finance company\r\n\r\na chance to present a case to the Commissioner\r\n\r\nbefore its licence is revoked. Why cannot this\r\n\r\nalso be done in clauses 7, 8 and 9? So far I have\r\n\r\nreferred to the Commissioner's wide powers over\r\n\r\nthe issue and cancellation of licences and\r\n\r\nconditions. He has similar wide powers over the\r\n\r\nregulation of business. By clause 15, he can ask\r\n\r\nfor all information and data as he reasonably\r\n\r\nrequires. There is no limit - only the\r\n\r\nCommissioner's ideas of what is reasonable! He is\r\n\r\ngiven power to determine the minimum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount of liquid assets. This is in clause 24. By\r\n\r\nclause 26, he can order corrective action. What\r\n\r\ndoes \"corrective action\" mean? He can tell the\r\n\r\nfinance companies to stop business. He can also\r\n\r\ntell them how to run their business, and if they\r\n\r\nsuffer a loss, clause 30 frees him and the\r\n\r\nGovernment from responsibility unless he is guilty\r\n\r\nof fraud. He is given wide powers but no financial\r\n\r\nresponsibility. This is very dangerous. Is there a\r\n\r\nfinancial wizard in the civil service who can tell\r\n\r\ncompeting finance companies how to run their\r\n\r\nbusiness properly? If a company fails, the\r\n\r\ndirectors will naturally tell the public, \"The\r\n\r\ncompany has failed because the Commissioner gave\r\n\r\nwrong directions.\" They may be wrong, but the\r\n\r\npublic may blame the Government. Does the\r\n\r\nGovernment want the blame? My fear is about the\r\n\r\nCommissioner's powers. If such powers are given to\r\n\r\none civil servant, other civil servants may want\r\n\r\nsimilar powers, because their work will be made\r\n\r\neasier. The Director of Public Works will be\r\n\r\n`tempted to ask for such powers over the\r\n\r\ncontractors and engineers; the Chief Architect\r\n\r\nwill want powers over the architects; the Attorney-General will want powers over the lawyers; and the\r\n\r\nDirector of Medical Services will want powers over\r\n\r\nthe doctors. If all these civil servants can work\r\n\r\nwell without similar powers, why should we give\r\n\r\nthem to the Commissioner? I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nexplain the necessity for this unrestricted wide\r\n\r\npower. I also hope he will tell us whether any\r\n\r\nother country has a law like this and whether\r\n\r\nofficers in charge of finance companies in other\r\n\r\ncountries have similar power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the general intention behind the Bill.\r\n\r\nI would like the Minister to give clarification on\r\n\r\nthe matters I have raised and to inform the House\r\n\r\nwhy the intention cannot be carried out without\r\n\r\ngiving such wide powers to the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nFinance Companies. Furthermore, would it not be\r\n\r\nbetter if the Bill were sent to Select Committee\r\n\r\nbecause it is quite complicated? I do not believe\r\n\r\nthere is an urgency to push it through for Third\r\n\r\nReading today. I am sure that if it is referred to\r\n\r\nSelect\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee, we can have not only the views of\r\n\r\nfinance companies but also the views of banks,\r\n\r\ndepositors and borrowers. There might be a\r\n\r\nproliferation in the establishment of new finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, but if we pass the Bill quickly\r\n\r\nwithout careful examination, it will carry a lot\r\n\r\nof dangerous provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is satisfying to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has realised the need to control\r\n\r\nfinance companies in the interest of members of\r\n\r\nthe public. We have seen many finance companies\r\n\r\nand institutions advertise attractive terms and\r\n\r\nconditions which they claim to be in the best\r\n\r\ninterest of the general public, but can they deny\r\n\r\nthe fact that ultimately it is they themselves\r\n\r\nwhich stand to gain more than the general public?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, taking into consideration the fact\r\n\r\nthat the finance companies do have a genuine\r\n\r\ninterest in enhancing the financial and economic\r\n\r\ninterest of the public in particular and the\r\n\r\nState in general, it is the duty of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to protect the public from any swindl\r\n\r\ning by some finance companies. For instance,\r\n\r\nbefore getting a loan on the pledge of a motor-car or an article, some companies do charge\r\n\r\n\"football money\" which i's illegal and which will\r\n\r\nnever come out in the accounts. I am not saying\r\n\r\nthat all finance companies charge \"football\r\n\r\nmoney\", but some companies do charge it. By not\r\n\r\nshowing this income in their accounts, they do\r\n\r\nnot pay income tax. The borrowers, in addition to\r\n\r\npaying the illegal interest, have also to pay\r\n\r\nmore than what the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw allows. Will the Government do something to\r\n\r\nstop this illegal practice?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to bring up is that\r\n\r\nfinance companies charge 10 or 12 per cent\r\n\r\ninterest on secured loans on hire purchase. This\r\n\r\ninterest is calculated on the original sum lent\r\n\r\nand is not calculated on the amounts due after\r\n\r\npayment of instalments. So this so-called ten per\r\n\r\ncent interest actually works out to more than 18\r\n\r\nor 19 per cent. We have laws to see that\r\n\r\nmortgagors do not charge more than 12 per cent on\r\n\r\nsecured loans, but in the case of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, the interest charged is actually more\r\n\r\nthan the interest legally allowed. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance will look into this problem\r\n\r\nand standardise the interest charged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to raise is with regard to\r\n\r\n\"chit fund\" which is publicly known as \"tontine\".\r\n\r\nThere are a dozen chit fund companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore which run chit funds and they deal in\r\n\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars. They are not\r\n\r\ndoing business on the accumulated capital hoarded\r\n\r\nby them but on funds collected from the public. 1\r\n\r\ndo not know whether, under the present Bill\r\n\r\nbefore this House, these chit funds can be\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the Government. Recently, I heard\r\n\r\nthat some of these companies are unable to repay\r\n\r\nto the depositors the amounts deposited by them\r\n\r\nafter an agreed maturity period. People who have\r\n\r\nbeen convicted of criminal breach of trust and\r\n\r\npeople of not a reputable character are known to\r\n\r\nbe managing such business. I appeal to the\r\n\r\nGovernment to bring these chit fund operators\r\n\r\nunder some form of Government control by way of\r\n\r\nlegislation so that the public can be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction\r\n\r\nof this Bill aims at strict control of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies and the operation thereof. It also aims\r\n\r\nat the protection of depositors who invest money\r\n\r\nin them. Therefore, the intention is good in\r\n\r\nprinciple, and I believe it is the aim of the\r\n\r\nBill to get rid of those finance companies which\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nnot properly run or not bona fide. But the\r\n\r\noperation of this Bill may also affect those\r\n\r\ncompanies which are bona fide. So, Mr Speaker, we\r\n\r\nmust accept the fact that a well-organised and\r\n\r\nproperly operated finance company is of benefit\r\n\r\nto small traders and wage earners in Singapore. In\r\n\r\nshort, to the small man, finance companies which\r\n\r\nare bona fide are good because they provide easy\r\n\r\nand convenient financial aid. But we agree that\r\n\r\nthose which are not so good, of course, should be\r\n\r\ndealt with. So before this Bill is passed in this\r\n\r\nHouse or implemented in future, we should go a\r\n\r\nstep further and study this Bill more carefully to\r\n\r\nsee whether certain clauses in it are over-restrictive, thereby stifling the proper operation\r\n\r\nof bona fide finance companies. We must see that\r\n\r\nsuch bona fide companies are not adversely\r\n\r\naffected by the operation of the law. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, if operation of finance companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore contributes to the prosperity of our\r\n\r\ncountry, then they should be encouraged and not\r\n\r\nrestricted adversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if this Bill is passed hurriedly\r\n\r\nwithout any overall careful consideration of the\r\n\r\nvarious repercussions and consequences, then it\r\n\r\nwill cause some confusion in our society, parti\r\n\r\ncularly to those who are now depositors. Ef such\r\n\r\ndepositors lose their confidence in the finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, then some sensitivity will be caused\r\n\r\nand a lot of depositors will queue up outside the\r\n\r\nfinance companies to withdraw the `money they have\r\n\r\ndeposited. This will give rise to very serious\r\n\r\nrepercussions and dangerous consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully endorse the views expressed\r\n\r\nby the Member for Ulu Pandan when he suggested\r\n\r\nthat this Bill should be referred to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee for further careful consideration. In\r\n\r\nthis way, representatives of finance companies and\r\n\r\nmembers of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of\r\n\r\nCommerce and other interested parties, including\r\n\r\nmembers of the public, will be given a chance to\r\n\r\nexpress their views on this Bill. At the same\r\n\r\ntime, we can avoid the misunderstanding on the\r\n\r\npart of finance companies in Singapore who may\r\n\r\nallege\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat this Bill is introduced in order to assist\r\n\r\nforeign capital at the expense of local capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, generally speaking, we all know\r\n\r\nthat the role played by finance companies is\r\n\r\nsimilar to that played by banks in Singapore.\r\n\r\nMainly their business is to collect deposits from\r\n\r\nthe people and give out loans at some interest. So\r\n\r\nin this way they are the same as banks. And their\r\n\r\nexistence need not necessarily pose a threat to or\r\n\r\ncompete with the banks in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to quote the editorial of\r\n\r\nthe Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 19th of December. This\r\n\r\neditorial made certain suggestions in regard to\r\n\r\nthe present Bill. It says that banks play a very\r\n\r\nimportant role in the accumulation of capital, but\r\n\r\nthe role that they play has not reached the ideal\r\n\r\nstage. The standard of living in Hong Kong may not\r\n\r\nbe as high as Singapore, but, on the average, the\r\n\r\npopulation in Hong Kong have about $2,100\r\n\r\ndeposited per capita in the banks. This is higher\r\n\r\nthan the average deposit in Singapore per capita,\r\n\r\nwhich is only $650. So the average deposit per\r\n\r\ncapita in Hong Kong is about three times that of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, if finance companies can assist\r\n\r\nin looking for liquid assets or idle capital, then\r\n\r\nthe accumulation of capital brought about by the\r\n\r\nfinance companies will be of great benefit to the\r\n\r\nindustrial development of Singapore, particularly\r\n\r\nin the field of investment. So it is clear that\r\n\r\nthere is scope for expansion of the business of\r\n\r\nfinance companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial also dealt with three points. The\r\n\r\nfirst point is that this Bill is actually a\r\n\r\nduplication of the Banking\r\n\r\nOrdinance, but it is more restrictive\r\n\r\nthan the Banking Ordinance. So because of this\r\n\r\nBill, the position of finance companies in future\r\n\r\nwill not be as good as that of the banks, and\r\n\r\ndifficulties will arise which may stifle the\r\n\r\nflourishing business of finance companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This may give rise to very serious\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point brought up in this editorial is\r\n\r\nthat the future activities and businesses of\r\n\r\nfinance companies under strict control will not\r\n\r\nfunction so well, and this is the negative aspect\r\n\r\nof this Bill. As a matter of fact, it may be good\r\n\r\nto protect the interests of the whole of society,\r\n\r\nbut in protecting the interests of the society,\r\n\r\nparticularly the depositors, we should also see\r\n\r\nthat the restrictive law does not interfere with\r\n\r\nthe role played by the finance companies in\r\n\r\nnational development. And so they should be given\r\n\r\nthe same protection as insurance companies are\r\n\r\ngiven in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point brought up in the editorial is\r\n\r\nthat the regulation of the operations of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies in loans and mortgages and other aspects\r\n\r\nis too restrictive. It suggests that if banks are\r\n\r\nallowed to give loans on hire purchases and\r\n\r\nmortgages, why cannot finance companies be given\r\n\r\nthe same facilities? If insurance companies are\r\n\r\ntreated as banks, why cannot finance companies be\r\n\r\nsimilarly treated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the existence of finance companies\r\n\r\nis more or less complementary to the operation of\r\n\r\nbanks in Singapore. I would like to show in what\r\n\r\nway this is true. Many small traders,\r\n\r\nindustrialists, or small manufacturers are unable\r\n\r\nto get financial assistance from banks, but they\r\n\r\ncan get it from finance companies. This is one\r\n\r\ninstance of industrial or commercial activities by\r\n\r\nfinance companies, and in this way they make a\r\n\r\ngreat contribution to our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital of a finance company shall not be less\r\n\r\nthan $500,000. But clause 17 (1) (c) provides that\r\n\r\nany unsecured loans should not exceed $1,000. So\r\n\r\nif a company has a capital of $500,000, its\r\n\r\nunsecured loan is to be limited by this clause to\r\n\r\n$1,000 or less. This is inconvenient to the\r\n\r\noperations of the finance company, and I feel that\r\n\r\nthis clause should be reconsidered. We must see\r\n\r\nwhether the financial position of the individual\r\n\r\nfinance company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarrants such a blanket restriction. In other\r\n\r\nwords, we must have some discretion in respect of\r\n\r\nrestriction of loans according to the paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital and the position of the individual finance\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if a finance company is big, bigger\r\n\r\nthan the others, then I think it can increase the\r\n\r\nloan granted. In order to meet the very high\r\n\r\noverhead expenses, some finance companies may\r\n\r\nraise \"football money\" or the rate of interest in\r\n\r\nrespect of loans given out, and because their\r\n\r\nscope of activities is narrowed down, their\r\n\r\nturnover becomes smaller. So their profits may not\r\n\r\nbe able to meet the overhead expenses. Because of\r\n\r\nthis, some of the finance companies may have to\r\n\r\nretrench their' staff and some may have to close\r\n\r\ndown, thereby giving rise to more unemployment and\r\n\r\naggravating our present unemployment situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, clause 21 of the Bill' says that no\r\n\r\nfinance companies shall purchase or acquire any\r\n\r\nimmovable property. We must understand that when\r\n\r\nfinance companies receive deposits, from the\r\n\r\npublic, they pay interest. Therefore they must do\r\n\r\nsome business by way of loans given out at higher\r\n\r\ninterest rates. If there is a provision that no\r\n\r\nfinance company shall purchase or acquire\r\n\r\nimmovable property, then how do we expect them to\r\n\r\ncontinue with their operations? Generally speak\r\n\r\ning, banks can make use of money in current\r\n\r\naccounts without interest. This position which is\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the banks is not enjoyed by the finance\r\n\r\ncompanies. In fact, banks also levy service\r\n\r\ncharges to meet their overheads, even in respect\r\n\r\nof current accounts. On the other hand, finance\r\n\r\ncompanies do not enjoy such facilities. So if they\r\n\r\nare to be more restrictively controlled than\r\n\r\nbanks, then in order to meet their overhead\r\n\r\nexpenses and to maintain their level of profit,\r\n\r\nthey will meet with great difficulties. In fact,\r\n\r\nthey may not even make a profit at all under these\r\n\r\nstringent restrictions. The idea of this Bill, of\r\n\r\ncourse, is to protect the interest of the public,\r\n\r\nand the strict control of finance companies is\r\n\r\ngood only to this extent. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore this Bill is read a Third time, it is my\r\n\r\nhumble view, a view shared by the Member for\r\n\r\nTampines and the Member for Ulu Pandan, that it\r\n\r\nshould be referred to a Select Committee for\r\n\r\nreconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Finance Companies Bill whose object\r\n\r\nis to license and control finance companies and to\r\n\r\ngovern matters connected therewith. Since the\r\n\r\npurpose of this Bill has been made very clear and\r\n\r\nspecific, therefore, bona fide finance company\r\n\r\nhouses should have no cause for any undue apprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although clause 22 of the Bill provides that\r\n\r\nwithin six months of the date of its coming into\r\n\r\noperation finance companies are required to\r\n\r\nliquidate all transactions prohibited by the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill, nevertheless, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, earlier on the Finance Minister has already\r\n\r\nstated that consequent on the passage of this\r\n\r\nBill, if and when genuine grievances arise, he is\r\n\r\nprepared to consider sympathetically their\r\n\r\nrespective difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the Bill is the\r\n\r\nrestriction placed on the powers of the directors\r\n\r\nand other officers of a finance company to deal\r\n\r\nwith the money deposited with the finance company.\r\n\r\nThis is very important, Mr Speaker, Sir, because\r\n\r\nmany members of the public are induced to place\r\n\r\ntheir savings in a finance company by the\r\n\r\nattractive interest rates offered by the company\r\n\r\non such deposits. Up to now, there is no specific\r\n\r\nOrdinance to ensure that a finance company takes\r\n\r\nas good care of such deposits as any honest\r\n\r\nbusinessman will take care of his property. In\r\n\r\nthat sense, the Government should be congratulated\r\n\r\non initiating such a Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\nconcern is this. As a socialist by conviction, I\r\n\r\nfeel that the the larger interests of the\r\n\r\ncommunity in stead of a microscopic few should be\r\n\r\ngiven first regard. Sir, another concern is this.\r\n\r\nAs a trade unionist, I feel that if the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance can give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis sympathetic consideration to genuine\r\n\r\ngrievances, there is no fear at all for bona fide\r\n\r\nfinance company houses having to resort to\r\n\r\nretrench employees as a result of the passage of\r\n\r\nthis Bill. And if this end can be achieved, I will\r\n\r\npropose to the Minister for Finance that the\r\n\r\nday of the coming into operation of this proposed\r\n\r\nAct is not made retrospective but is to take\r\n\r\neffect in the near future. Hence there is no need\r\n\r\nto refer this Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the touchstone test of this Bill is\r\n\r\nnot so much whether it can control finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, but whether it can control them without\r\n\r\nkilling them. With the present-day economic\r\n\r\narrangements of our society and of any advanced\r\n\r\nsociety, there is no dispute that finance\r\n\r\ncompanies do play an important part in our\r\n\r\neconomic life. Gone are the days when a person\r\n\r\nwants something, he saves for it. Today he pays a\r\n\r\nsmall down-payment. Sometimes he does not even\r\n\r\nhave to do that, and he enjoys the use of the\r\n\r\narticle he wants and pays for it in instalments.\r\n\r\nConsumer credit is now the rule rather than the\r\n\r\nexception. Under such circumstances, finance\r\n\r\ncompanies are something we cannot do without. And\r\n\r\nyet for a long time many people have felt that\r\n\r\nthey should be abolished. Sir, this is because\r\n\r\nfinance companies readily lend themselves to abuse\r\n\r\nby unscrupulous people. One of the causes of\r\n\r\napprehension over the profusion of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies over the past few years is that by their\r\n\r\nvery profusion they are forced by competition to\r\n\r\npay such high interest rates that they can only\r\n\r\nhope to pay them by resorting to speculative\r\n\r\nventures. A large number of finance companies are\r\n\r\nknown to be speculating, and at times even wildly,\r\n\r\nin properties and in the stock market. If a person\r\n\r\nspeculates with his own money, that is his own\r\n\r\nfuneral if he fails. But when a finance company\r\n\r\nplays around with depositors' money, then clearly\r\n\r\nit is the duty of the State to ensure that such\r\n\r\nthings cease. The present Bill before the House\r\n\r\ndoes provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe means to restrict the number of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 provide the Commissioner not\r\n\r\nonly with the powers to shape the structure of\r\n\r\nfinance companies, but also to limit them. I\r\n\r\npersonally would have preferred to see the figure\r\n\r\nof $500,000 in clause 6 doubled. But I do not wish\r\n\r\nto press this point as I am confident that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not hesitate to raise it should it\r\n\r\nbecome necessary to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause of apprehension over finance\r\n\r\ncompanies is that few of them provide adequately\r\n\r\nfor bad and doubtful debts. This is so because\r\n\r\noperators of finance companies prefer to lose\r\n\r\nother people's money rather than their own. And so\r\n\r\nthey distribute as much of their profits as\r\n\r\npossible and allow their depositors to carry the\r\n\r\nrisk of bad and doubtful debts. Clause 12 will, I\r\n\r\nfeel, go a long way to safeguarding the depositors\r\n\r\nand, in addition, to providing a built-in growth\r\n\r\nfactor for the finance companies to grow to a\r\n\r\nreasonable size. Of course, this clause will have\r\n\r\nthe disadvantage of inducing minimum initial\r\n\r\ncapitalisation even when funds are available. It\r\n\r\nis conceivable that funds which otherwise would be\r\n\r\ncapitalised would be rearranged as loans. However,\r\n\r\nas such an arrangement will be countered by the\r\n\r\nliquidity ratio required by the Commissioner, I\r\n\r\nfeel that a correct balance has been struck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 requires that every finance company\r\n\r\nshall exhibit its balance-sheet and the list of\r\n\r\nits directors at its principal and branch offices,\r\n\r\nif any. The company is also required to publish\r\n\r\nits balance-sheet in at least each of the four\r\n\r\nlocal daily newspapers in the four official\r\n\r\nlanguages. There is no requirement to publish the\r\n\r\nlist of directors. A better requirement, I feel,\r\n\r\nis to have the publication in the leading instead\r\n\r\nof any daily newspaper in the four language\r\n\r\nstreams. I further suggest that the list o\r\n\r\ndirectors should also be published. My suggestion\r\n\r\nto have publication in leading newspapers is to\r\n\r\nensure that some finance companies do not select\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle-read newspapers for publication of their\r\n\r\nbalance-sheet and widely-read newspapers for\r\n\r\nadvertisements calling for deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20, as it stands, can, I feel, be by-passed quite easily. The clause only requires that\r\n\r\na finance company shall not hold share capital or\r\n\r\nhave a direct interest in any financial, com\r\n\r\nmercial, agricultural, industrial or other\r\n\r\nundertaking, exceeding a quarter of its paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital and published reserves. This clause does\r\n\r\nnot, in my view, prevent a finance company\r\n\r\nindirectly committing funds exceeding a quarter of\r\n\r\nits capital and reserves. I should like to see the\r\n\r\nclause rewritten to include a restriction on\r\n\r\ndirect and indirect participation exceeding a\r\n\r\nquarter of the capital and reserves. The proviso\r\n\r\nthat excess share holdings acquired in the course\r\n\r\nof debt-realising should not be allowed, appears\r\n\r\nnot to be necessary. Indeed, the very existence of\r\n\r\nthis proviso indicates the weakness of the clause\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 and 26 put teeth into the provision\r\n\r\nfor supervision. As such, the penalty provided\r\n\r\nunder sub-clause (4) of clause 25 of $250 is\r\n\r\nrather low. Normally one would expect that no\r\n\r\nfinance company would refuse to show its books and\r\n\r\ndata to an officer appointed by the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe occasion when it will do so will be rare but\r\n\r\nvery important from the point of security of the\r\n\r\ndepositors. I would suggest a heavier penalty be\r\n\r\nprovided. Mr Speaker, Sir, with these comments, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the Finance\r\n\r\nCompanies Bill. Why I support it is that in the\r\n\r\npast the law has loopholes. For example, not long\r\n\r\nago there was an assurance company owned by a\r\n\r\nforeign investor. He earned a lot of money.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the people thought that he was from a\r\n\r\nfinancially strong country. Therefore, many people\r\n\r\nbought policies from him and he earned a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney. He requested the Government to allow him to\r\n\r\nremit his money back to his country. After\r\n\r\ninvestigations, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment found that he had no capital invested.\r\n\r\nWhy is it easy to do business without capital? It\r\n\r\nis because we have loopholes in our law.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must revise and amend our law in\r\n\r\norder to deal with speculators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know there are many finance companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore. There are as many finance companies as\r\n\r\nthere are coffee-shops. Therefore, we should con\r\n\r\ntrol them. We must take care and look into the\r\n\r\nmatter. We know that the capital of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies varies. Some have large capital and\r\n\r\nothers have less. But the business done exceeds\r\n\r\nthe capital. Where is the security granted to the\r\n\r\ndepositors? One day if the money is swallowed up\r\n\r\nby the company, who is to repay the depositors? Is\r\n\r\nit the Government? Therefore, I fully support the\r\n\r\nBill introduced by the Finance Minister. However,\r\n\r\nwe should refer it to a Select Committee in order\r\n\r\nto study it in greater detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, I do not in any way oppose the introduction\r\n\r\nof the Finance Companies Bill which is now tabled\r\n\r\nin this House for Second Reading. However, I wish\r\n\r\nto offer my brief observations. First, I do agree\r\n\r\nthat there is a need for the passing of laws to\r\n\r\ncontrol finance companies in the best interest of\r\n\r\nthe public at large. The main purpose of this Bill\r\n\r\nis to safeguard the interest of would-be\r\n\r\ndepositors who are mostly the working-class in our\r\n\r\nRepublic. This is a correct move and in line with\r\n\r\nthe policy of our Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the provisions in this Bill are far\r\n\r\ntoo rigid. They are designed not only to control\r\n\r\nand restrict the establishment of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, but also to regulate the scope of their\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to offer some suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe control must be gradual and not too rigid.\r\n\r\nSir, the provisions contained in clauses 17 to 22\r\n\r\nare far too stiff and restrictive. The result will\r\n\r\nbe that the small trading houses will have to\r\n\r\nclose down and the interest of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic may be jeopardised and unemployment will\r\n\r\nalso result. The control and licensing of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies would create an impression that finance\r\n\r\ncompanies in general have been fiddling with\r\n\r\npublic money. I agree that there may be a few\r\n\r\ndishonest and unscrupulous ones, and so there goes\r\n\r\nthe saying - a rotten egg in a basket of good eggs\r\n\r\nhas made the entire basketful rotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this Bill, the Commissioner seems\r\n\r\nto have wide powers. The prescribing of the\r\n\r\nmaximum rates of interest - and they are going to\r\n\r\nbe ceiling rates - should be treated as a guide\r\n\r\nrather than an order, as some companies may not be\r\n\r\nable to pay such rates. As a matter of fact, it is\r\n\r\npurely in the public interest to have an equitable\r\n\r\ndistribution of profits. Unlike service, the\r\n\r\npayment of interest varies according to the sums\r\n\r\ndeposited. For example, if $10 million has been\r\n\r\nutilised and if it has resulted in profits of,\r\n\r\nsay, $1 million, then the management of the\r\n\r\nfinance company will be able to pass on part of\r\n\r\nthe profits to the depositors according to the\r\n\r\namounts they have deposited. Surely any finance\r\n\r\ncompany which can afford to pay such bonuses\r\n\r\nshould deserve the support of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the finance companies in our Republic\r\n\r\ndo play an important role in our economy. This\r\n\r\nbeing the case, the Government should encourage\r\n\r\nthe existence of such companies rather than push\r\n\r\nthem over the cliff, so to say, because of the\r\n\r\nextremely restrictive measures in this Bill. To\r\n\r\nme, some of the measures are even stricter than\r\n\r\nthose in the Banking Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point is that at the present moment the\r\n\r\nfinance companies are carrying on a very wide\r\n\r\nrange of business ii our trading society. If too\r\n\r\nmany restrictions are to be imposed, the end\r\n\r\nresult will be that a few finance companies will\r\n\r\nexist and this will, in turn, contradict the\r\n\r\npolicy of our Government to encourage industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth, as a lot of small traders and small\r\n\r\nfactories are depending on loans from finance\r\n\r\ncompanies to carry out their expansion programmes.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to my sixth point. As the\r\n\r\npresent position stands, finance companies have\r\n\r\nactually participated in the development carried\r\n\r\nout by the private sector, i.e., housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment for the higher income group, for which\r\n\r\nthere is at the moment no government\r\n\r\nparticipation. In this particular field, a lot of\r\n\r\nprivate funds are involved and the depositors will\r\n\r\nthen in turn enjoy the benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to urge the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nto refer this Bill to a Select Committee for views\r\n\r\nfrom all sections of the public. I see no urgent\r\n\r\nneed to rush through this Bill today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, this Finance\r\n\r\nCompanies Bill has my full support. It is to\r\n\r\ncontrol the activities of finance companies and to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interest of the public. The proposal\r\n\r\nthat this Bill should be sent to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee is a means of delaying its passage. My\r\n\r\nview is that it should be taken through all stages\r\n\r\nand passed into law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the advent of finance companies\r\n\r\nseems to be quite a recent one. They have sprung\r\n\r\nup like mushrooms. At a glance, they may be\r\n\r\nclassified into three categories :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Finance companies which are subsidiaries of\r\n\r\nbanks;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Small-time finance companies which lend\r\n\r\nmoney in respect of sales or hire purchase\r\n\r\nof cars, taxis and even to kelong owners,\r\n\r\nfishermen and farmers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Large finance companies which operate\r\n\r\nindependently in the field of investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that banks operate their Own\r\n\r\nfinance companies appears to stress the need for\r\n\r\nsuch institutions. It also to a certain extent\r\n\r\nreflects the inadequacy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the services provided by the banks themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, finance companies do serve the needs\r\n\r\nof certain sections of our population. One may\r\n\r\nplace them somewhere between banks and the\r\n\r\nchettiars or moneylenders. For those who have\r\n\r\naccess to banking facilities and who are reluctant\r\n\r\nto use the facilities provided by the chettiars or\r\n\r\nmoneylenders, finance companies will be in a\r\n\r\nposition to offer the necessary assistance in\r\n\r\ntheir financial problems. The increasing number of\r\n\r\nfinance companies operating in the Republic does\r\n\r\npoint to the necessity of legislating certain controls over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Bill itself, my colleagues and I are\r\n\r\nconcerned about the ceiling of $1,000 for loans of\r\n\r\nan unsecured nature. This will definitely affect\r\n\r\nthe small traders, farmers and kelong owners I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will reconsider relaxing a\r\n\r\nlittle on these $1,000 unsecured loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if finance companies are to be allowed to\r\n\r\ncontinue their operations in the Republic, they\r\n\r\nshould be placed under some control in order to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interest of small depositors, but\r\n\r\nthey should be allowed reasonable scope for\r\n\r\nconducting their business to ensure that there is\r\n\r\nenough profit for discharging their obligations. I\r\n\r\nam sure that the Bill, in spite of its\r\n\r\nrestrictions, gives genuine finance companies, not\r\n\r\nthe mushroom type, enough scope to do business and\r\n\r\nmake some profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, originally I thought that after the Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill, it would be referred to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee to enable the affected parties to\r\n\r\nhave an opportunity to voice their opinion.; or\r\n\r\nmake their recommendations. Sir, I would further\r\n\r\nadd that it would appear, at first sight, unfair\r\n\r\non the part of the Government to pass a Bill of\r\n\r\nsuch a nature without listening to the views of\r\n\r\nthe public. I could not understand the urgency for\r\n\r\nthis Bill going through its Third Reading today,\r\n\r\nbut having heard the explanation of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, I am satisfied and convinced that the\r\n\r\nearlier the Bill becomes law, the better it will\r\n\r\nbe for the have-nots.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I doubt whether other countries have similar\r\n\r\nlegislation, but unique circumstances must be met with legislation. After all,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P, is the People's Action Party, not just\r\n\r\nin name only. If we are to protect the small\r\n\r\ntraders, fishermen and farmers from being swindled\r\n\r\nby unscrupulous operators of finance companies, the\r\n\r\nprotection given by this Bill is very necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill without reservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's intention\r\n\r\nof bringing in legislation to regulate finance\r\n\r\ncompanies was first announced in last year's Budget\r\n\r\ndebate. It has taken a full year for the Bill to\r\n\r\ncome before Parliament. It is, of course, better\r\n\r\nlate than never. It is very necessary that\r\n\r\nlegislation be introduced to control what my\r\n\r\ncolleague calls the mushrooming of finance\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to protect small\r\n\r\ninvestors. That is what a socialist government like\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P, should and must do. It is ironical,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that some of my colleagues in this House\r\n\r\nwho are good socialists should have forgotten the\r\n\r\nsmall man and have taken up the cudgels on behalf\r\n\r\nof finance companies. I think the reason for this\r\n\r\nis that my colleagues are labouring under the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of what a finance company is. In\r\n\r\nthis connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed\r\n\r\nto read the definition of \"finance company\" in\r\n\r\nclause 2 of the Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"finance company\" means any company licensed\r\n\r\nunder this Act, to carry on financing business,\r\n\r\nand all branches and offices in Singapore of\r\n\r\nsuch a company shall be deemed to be one finance\r\n\r\ncompany for the purposes of this Act;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We must now go further down and read what the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"financing business\" is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"financing business\" means the business of -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) borrowing money from the public, by acceptance\r\n\r\nof deposits and issuing certificates or other documents acknowledging or evidencing indebtedness to\r\n\r\nthe public and undertaking to repay the money on\r\n\r\ncall or after an agreed maturity\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod, which period shall be not\r\n\r\nless than one month of the original\r\n\r\nacceptance of any deposit; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) lending money to the public or to a company\r\n\r\ndeemed to be related to the finance company\r\n\r\nby virtue of section 6 of the Companies Act,\r\n\r\n1967 (hereinafter in this Act referred to as\r\n\r\nthe \"related company\") on the basis that the\r\n\r\npublic or the related company undertakes to\r\n\r\nrepay the money, whether\r\n\r\nwithin an agreed period of time or\r\n\r\nnot, or by instalments;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear from\r\n\r\nthis that a finance company is a company that\r\n\r\nborrows money from the public and lends money to\r\n\r\nthe public: that is, a company that makes use of\r\n\r\nthe public's money by borrowing and lending and in\r\n\r\nthe process makes a profit. If it does not borrow\r\n\r\nmoney from the public, it is not a finance company.\r\n\r\nSo in order to fit in with the definition, it must\r\n\r\nborrow money from the public and lend money to the\r\n\r\npublic. When a company borrows money from the\r\n\r\npublic and makes use of that borrowed money to make\r\n\r\na profit, it must accept a certain degree of\r\n\r\ncontrol. If, however, it makes use of its own money\r\n\r\nand does not borrow money from the public, it does\r\n\r\nnot come within the definition and it can do what\r\n\r\nit likes. It can establish a limited company and\r\n\r\nthrow away its money by taking unnecessary risks\r\n\r\nand nobody will complain, much less the Government.\r\n\r\nBut finance companies are not making use of their\r\n\r\nown money; they are making use of the public's\r\n\r\nmoney. The Government has a responsibility to the\r\n\r\npublic and must see that the small investors are\r\n\r\nnot - to use a common phrase done in. Therefore, if\r\n\r\nfinance companies want to make use of the public's\r\n\r\nmoney, they must accept certain responsibilities\r\n\r\nand must equally accept a certain degree of\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without exception, all finance companies are, as\r\n\r\nfar as I understand, limited companies. In law, if\r\n\r\na limited company fails, who is responsible?\r\n\r\nNobody. The shareholders or contributors of the\r\n\r\ncompany are only responsible to the extent of the\r\n\r\nunpaid portion of the shares which they hold and\r\n\r\ngenerally these shareholdings are very small and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnormally they are fully paid up. So when a finance\r\n\r\ncompany, which is normally a limited company,\r\n\r\nfails, who is responsible? Nobody. The\r\n\r\nshareholders have fully paid up their shares. They\r\n\r\nwill say, \"It is just too bad. The company has run\r\n\r\nunnecessary risks and it has failed.\" You can only\r\n\r\nget hold of their common seal. The directors are\r\n\r\nnot responsible, unless, of course, they can be\r\n\r\nprosecuted under the Companies Ordinance for\r\n\r\nfraud, and it is always very difficult to prove\r\n\r\nfraud. Even if you succeed in the prosecution and\r\n\r\nsend them to gaol, what does it benefit the poor\r\n\r\ninvestor? It is small consolation and cold comfort\r\n\r\nto a small investor who has lost his life savings\r\n\r\nto see the director of a finance company sent to\r\n\r\ngaol. In this connection, I must point out that\r\n\r\neven finance companies which are subsidiaries of\r\n\r\nreputed banks stand in the same legal position.\r\n\r\nThey may be subsidiary companies but they are\r\n\r\nseparate legal entities. If a subsidiary company\r\n\r\nfails, the parent company, which is a bank, is\r\n\r\nunder no legal obligation to come to its aid. In\r\n\r\nthis connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I may\r\n\r\nbe allowed to quote a passage from the Minutes of\r\n\r\nEvidence taken before the Select Committee on the\r\n\r\nCompanies Bill. I refer to the Report of the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee on the Companies Bill [Parl. 11\r\n\r\nof 1967]. I quote from column 37 at page B 19 of\r\n\r\nthe Minutes of Evidence. As you know, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I was on this Committee and this is what I\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...Surely a wholly-owned subsidiary - a finance\r\n\r\ncompany - would also be a limited company. The\r\n\r\nbank is legally in the clear. Although, according\r\n\r\nto what you say [meaning what the witness says],\r\n\r\nthere is moral responsibility, surely moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility is just not good enough. We want\r\n\r\nlegal responsibility for the protection of the\r\n\r\ndepositors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And in the Select Committee you, Sir, as Chairman,\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I think Mr Tang's point is simply this.\r\n\r\nYou make use of a bank's good name in your\r\n\r\nadvertisements to get deposits for that bank's\r\n\r\nwholly-owned subsidiary finance company. You\r\n\r\nutilise the bank's good name without any legal\r\n\r\nliability on the part of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbank. Let us say today you have the Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nBank Ltd. It owns a subsidiary finance company\r\n\r\ncalled the Pasir Panjang Finance Ltd. You see irs\r\n\r\nthe papers advertisements by the Pasir Panjang Finance Ltd.\r\n\r\nstating that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of\r\n\r\nthe Pasir Panjang Bank Ltd. So there full\r\n\r\nadvantage is taken of the bank's, good name and\r\n\r\nthat may well be the only reason why the public\r\n\r\ndeposits with that finance company, rather than\r\n\r\nwith an index pendent finance company. But, at the\r\n\r\nsame time, the bank is not in any way legally liable\r\n\r\nshould its finance company fail. A bank may have\r\n\r\nthe advantage of that finance company without any\r\n\r\nof the attendant disadvantages. That is the point,\r\n\r\nis it not, Mr Tang?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And I replied, \"That is right.\" The witness then\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, although there is no legal.\r\n\r\nliability on the part of the bank, the moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility here, however, is very grave.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>You went on to say, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I think we accept that. But Mr Tang's\r\n\r\npoint of view is that, if a finance company that\r\n\r\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank, fails, it\r\n\r\nwill be poor consolation to the depositors who\r\n\r\nhave lost money even if that, finance company has\r\n\r\nhad the bank's moral.\r\n\r\nbacking.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And that is exactly the position with regard to a\r\n\r\nfinance company which is wholly owned by a bank. I\r\n\r\nthink it was very well put, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen you said that it was cold comfort to the\r\n\r\ndepositors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are strictly controlled because they also\r\n\r\nmake use of the public's & money for re-lending and\r\n\r\nin the process make a profit. In the same way, the\r\n\r\nfinance companies do that on a smaller scale. If\r\n\r\nbanks are controlled, why should not finance\r\n\r\ncompanies also accept some control?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think most of the\r\n\r\ncomplaints of my colleagues about this. Bill centre on clauses 19, 20 and 21. These are\r\n\r\nrestrictions on the type of business that a\r\n\r\nfinance company can enter into. I think these\r\n\r\ncomplaints arise from a misunderstanding of the\r\n\r\nfunctions of a finance company. If a company\r\n\r\nprofesses its business to be that of lending money\r\n\r\nto the public, and borrowing and using the money\r\n\r\nfor relending, why should it be allowed  carry on\r\n\r\nall sorts of trade, especially import and export,\r\n\r\nwhich, unless you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nare in that line, is a very risky sort of\r\n\r\nbusiness? Again, why should a finance company be\r\n\r\nallowed to hold more than 25 per cent of its\r\n\r\nequity capital in the shares of any of the under\r\n\r\ntakings listed under clause 20 of the Bill? Clause\r\n\r\n21 does not prevent a finance company from holding\r\n\r\nimmovable property as long as such property is\r\n\r\nheld as security and not as assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another complaint is that finance\r\n\r\ncompanies are required to keep a certain liquidity\r\n\r\nratio. Again, I see no reason why this should not\r\n\r\nbe done. If banks have to hold a minimum liquidity\r\n\r\nratio, I see no reason why finance companies\r\n\r\nshould be an exception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two minor complaints that I can\r\n\r\nvoice. One of these complaints, which I made in\r\n\r\nthe Budget debate, is the need to introduce legis\r\n\r\nlation to control hire purchase, which is the\r\n\r\nother side of the finance company's business. The\r\n\r\nother minor complaint is the unhappy drafting of\r\n\r\nsome of the clauses of the Bill, especially clause\r\n\r\n17. But as far as the main aim of the Bill in\r\n\r\ncontrolling finance companies for the proper\r\n\r\nprotection of the small investor is concerned, I\r\n\r\nam in hearty agreement with the Government, and I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill unreservedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang was quoting from the proceedings of the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee on the current Companies Bill in\r\n\r\nwhich the topic discussed was finance companies\r\n\r\nwhich are subsidiary companies of banks, and it\r\n\r\nwas regretted that banks had only a moral\r\n\r\nobligation and not a legal obligation to support\r\n\r\nthe finance company, so that the finance company\r\n\r\ncould use a bank's name and in that way attract\r\n\r\ndeposits. Here, Sir, in today's Straits Times\r\n\r\nthere is an advertisement, presumably inserted by\r\n\r\none of the big local banks, which disclaims all\r\n\r\nconnection with a finance company with a similar\r\n\r\nname.

So I am\r\n\r\nafraid I cannot agree with the proposal from Mem\r\n\r\nbers to refer this Bill to Select Committee, as\r\n\r\nthere is urgent need to see that control is\r\n\r\ninstituted forthwith over finance companies. In so\r\n\r\nsaying, may I repeat again that I do not regard\r\n\r\nall finance companies as of a doubtful character?\r\n\r\nI have stated in my speech on the Second Reading\r\n\r\nthat they do perform a useful role in society and\r\n\r\nthat we should try to allow them to fulfil this\r\n\r\nuseful role. The Member for Have-lock and the\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang have so clearly and so\r\n\r\nforcefully put the case for control of finance com\r\n\r\npanies that there is very little for me to say,\r\n\r\nwithout repeating what they have already said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do wish to refer to the points made by the\r\n\r\nMember for Havelock. He said that we should not\r\n\r\ntry to control how people should lend their own\r\n\r\nfunds. That is not the case. We are trying to\r\n\r\ncontrol the means by which people lend other\r\n\r\npeople's funds. It is all right if you speculate\r\n\r\nand make money; or if you speculate and go\r\n\r\nbankrupt. No one is going to stop you one way or\r\n\r\nthe other. But we must make sure that you do not\r\n\r\nendanger other people's money, and that when you\r\n\r\nborrow money from the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic, you invest it wisely and securely, and\r\n\r\nthat abuses of various kinds whereby directors of\r\n\r\ncompanies can make use of other people's money to\r\n\r\nget rich, must stop. This is the cardinal\r\n\r\nprinciple underlying this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of the Bill have said that it will bear\r\n\r\nvery harshly on finance companies and many of them\r\n\r\nmay close down. On the one hand, they say that\r\n\r\nthese companies are essential to the economy and\r\n\r\nthat they are being well run. In fact, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan claims that in many cases their\r\n\r\nliquid position is even better than that of the\r\n\r\nbanks. If that is so, what have they got to fear\r\n\r\nfrom this control?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have stressed the need to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe interests of small borrowers who are traders\r\n\r\nor small industrialists and have to go to finance\r\n\r\ncompanies for finance. I can give an assurance\r\n\r\nthat we will do everything to safeguard the\r\n\r\ninterest of small borrowers from finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, be they small traders, fishermen, or\r\n\r\nsmall industrialists. What we want to prevent is\r\n\r\nthe wrong or inappropriate investment of other\r\n\r\npeople's money either in non-liquid or in\r\n\r\nspeculative ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines says that the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Finance Companies is a powerful\r\n\r\nman. Of course, he is a powerful man. He needs the\r\n\r\npower to control finance companies. How are you\r\n\r\ngoing to ensure that adequate control is exercised\r\n\r\nover these people if the Commissioner does not\r\n\r\nhave these powers? But what the Member for\r\n\r\nTampines has not said is that these powers are\r\n\r\nunnecessary. He says that civil servants cannot\r\n\r\ntell finance companies how to make a profit. I\r\n\r\nagree with him. But we can tell finance companies\r\n\r\nhow their assets can be secured so that when their\r\n\r\ndepositors want their money back, it can be\r\n\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines also asks:\r\n\r\ndo other countries have similar powers in their\r\n\r\nlegislation? The answer is: in other countries\r\n\r\nfinance companies are not allowed to be\r\n\r\nestablished. You have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto establish a properly-run bank, which is subject\r\n\r\nto all the controls which a central bank\r\n\r\nexercises over people who take in deposits and\r\n\r\nlend out deposits. It is only here, due to a\r\n\r\nlacuna in the law, that these finance companies\r\n\r\nhave been allowed to be established. We cannot get\r\n\r\nthem under the Moneylenders' Ordinance. We cannot\r\n\r\nget them under the Banking Ordinance. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit is necessary to introduce new legislation to\r\n\r\ncontrol them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has not made any new\r\n\r\npoints. I think he has repeated the points made by\r\n\r\nprevious speakers, and I think the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock and the Member for Choa Chu Kang have\r\n\r\nadequately answered all his points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point raised - that there is fear\r\n\r\nthat there will be unemployment as a result of\r\n\r\nGovernment control of finance companies. Why\r\n\r\nshould there be unemployment? Unless, of course,\r\n\r\nsome of these finance companies are found to be\r\n\r\nunsound, then they have to close down. If that is\r\n\r\nthe case, it is better that they close down early\r\n\r\nso that fewer depositors lose their money than\r\n\r\nthat more people are stung.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten, I think, has made\r\n\r\nsome valid points. He says that we must ensure\r\n\r\nthat the small businessmen who go to finance com\r\n\r\npanies for credit are not endangered. I have\r\n\r\nalready given this assurance. Then he mentions\r\n\r\nhousing investments and says that many finance\r\n\r\ncompanies invest in housing projects, and that\r\n\r\nthis practice is disallowed in the Bill. Precisely\r\n\r\nso - you cannot take other people's money and\r\n\r\ninvest it in long-term projects, money which the\r\n\r\nlender is entitled to have back, it is difFerent\r\n\r\nif you use your own money. If a group wants to\r\n\r\ninvest in housing so that there can be better and\r\n\r\nmore houses, the proper way is to use its own\r\n\r\nmoney to float a company and invite public sub\r\n\r\nscriptions for shares and use the capital to build\r\n\r\nthe houses. You cannot use short-term deposits in\r\n\r\nbuilding houses.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsecured loans have been limited to $1,000, and many Members, both critics\r\n\r\nand supporters, think that this may be too\r\n\r\nsmall. I am prepared to look into it. But at\r\n\r\npresent you cannot say to what\r\n\r\nextent the finance companies are, in fact,\r\n\r\nhelping the small traders or small manufacturers.\r\n\r\nWe just know nothing about the way these finance\r\n\r\ncompanies operate.

These com\r\n\r\npanies refused to give any returns, so we just do\r\n\r\nnot know what they are doing, and how they are\r\n\r\ninvesting their assets. Once this Bill becomes\r\n\r\nlaw, it is my intention to call upon all these\r\n\r\ncompanies to furnish me with the fullest details\r\n\r\nof how they have been investing their money. If\r\n\r\nit so turns out that a small trader or small\r\n\r\nmanufacturer will suffer considerably by the\r\n\r\nlimitation of unsecured loans -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - then I am prepared to\r\n\r\nreconsider the matter.

My only complaint is that\r\n\r\nthe clause is not happily drafted, it is rather\r\n\r\nvague. Clause 17 (1) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No finance company shall ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) accept any deposit which is repayable on\r\n\r\ndemand by cheque, draft or order;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I do not quite know what this means, if it is the\r\n\r\nintention of the paragraph that deposit accounts\r\n\r\nin finance companies should not be drawn on by the\r\n\r\ndepositor by the use of cheque, draft or order, it\r\n\r\nshould be expressly stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paragraph (c) .

It is unnecessary to have\r\n\r\nthe first paragraph which expressly defines a firm\r\n\r\nin which a director of a finance company is\r\n\r\ninterested, etc. These are my complaints about the\r\n\r\ndrafting.

Hence, anyone who deposits money with a\r\n\r\nfinance company cannot get it back, as it were, on\r\n\r\ndemand by writing out a cheque, as one does with a\r\n\r\nbank account. You deposit money in a bank which\r\n\r\nissues you with a cheque book, and by writing out\r\n\r\na demand note by cheque, draft or order, you can\r\n\r\nimmediately draw on that account. This is the\r\n\r\nobject of clause 17 (1) (a) . I myself cannot see\r\n\r\nhow it can be drafted in a better way. It does not\r\n\r\nprevent finance companies from returning money by\r\n\r\ncheque, draft or order. One deposits money not for\r\n\r\nimmediate return but for return after three\r\n\r\nmonths, six months or a year, when it can be done\r\n\r\nby cheque, draft or order. What clause 17 (1) (a)\r\n\r\nseeks to prevent is a deposit followed by an\r\n\r\nimmediate demand for payment by the depositor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as clause 17 (1) (c) is concerned, I\r\n\r\nneed not add more to what the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas said.

A tontine operator\r\n\r\ndoes not strictly borrow or lend. What he does is\r\n\r\nto invite people to subscribe to a certain fund\r\n\r\nand then it is more of a debt. I say $20, you say\r\n\r\n$21, someone else says $22, and the highest bidder\r\n\r\ngets the money for the month, after which he has\r\n\r\nto return a fixed sum. It is a group of people\r\n\r\ngetting together, putting in a certain sum a\r\n\r\nmonth, and every month someone takes it away. All\r\n\r\nthe operator does is to get his little commission.\r\n\r\nSo, strictly speaking, he is not borrowing and\r\n\r\nthen lending out. They are all perhaps borrowing\r\n\r\nand lending to one another. I doubt whether they\r\n\r\nwould be caught by the Act. I may be wrong but, in\r\n\r\nthe final analysis, it is for the courts to\r\n\r\ndecide, and if we are wrong here, we can always\r\n\r\namend our laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to say a few words on tontine\r\n\r\norganisations. These organisations originated out\r\n\r\nof some moral responsibility for friendly mutual\r\n\r\naid. For instance, if I am short of $2,000 for\r\n\r\nbusiness, I gather a few friends together and form\r\n\r\na tontine organisation.

So\r\n\r\nthere should be a law to control tontine\r\n\r\norganisations. Originally, the purpose of tontine\r\n\r\norganisations was very good. It was for mutual\r\n\r\nassistance. But now it is different. Nowadays the\r\n\r\nmorals of the people are quite different from what\r\n\r\nthey were in ancient times.

In any event, I\r\n\r\nthink there is a case that at some future session\r\n\r\nof Parliament, measures should be introduced in\r\n\r\nParliament to control tontine operators and\r\n\r\nregulate this kind of business, because tontines\r\n\r\nalso satisfy certain social and economic needs in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I think a study is being made by the\r\n\r\nFaculty of Law of the University of Singapore and\r\n\r\nperhaps we will have the time to go into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Sir, I am a bit disturbed by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National Development's reply\r\n\r\nthat he cannot do anything about this \"chit\" fund.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I am not asking him to look into illegal\r\n\r\ntontine organisations, but these are companies\r\n\r\nwhich are registered under the Companies Ordinance\r\n\r\nor some other law, and they seem to operate in a\r\n\r\nway which is not in the interest of the public.\r\n\r\nThe public subscribe to these \"chit\" funds. Say\r\n\r\nthe tontine is for $20 a month. They subscribe to\r\n\r\nthe tontine. They put their savings into these com\r\n\r\npanies. Finally, after paying for 10 or 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths, these people are informed by the operator\r\n\r\nthat he is not going to pay back their deposits.\r\n\r\nThis is something which the Government should look\r\n\r\ninto, in order to safeguard the interest of such\r\n\r\npeople. If there is no law at present to control\r\n\r\ntontine organisations, then the Minister should\r\n\r\nintroduce legislation or amend the law to control\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I always thought that\r\n\r\ntontine operators were small-time people,\r\n\r\ndomestic servants and such types. This is the\r\n\r\nfirst time I hear that they have formed a limited\r\n\r\ncompany. If, in fact, they have formed a limited\r\n\r\ncompany, then they will fall under section 38 of\r\n\r\nthe Companies Ordinance provided, of course, the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Panjang is not correct in saying\r\n\r\nthat these activities are illegal in law. Assuming\r\n\r\nthat they are legal and they are registered, then\r\n\r\nthey will come under section 38. Subsection (7) of\r\n\r\nsection 38 gives the Minister authority by\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette to specify terms and\r\n\r\nconditions subject to which subsection (6) of this\r\n\r\nsection shall have effect. In other words, the\r\n\r\nactivities and terms upon which these transactions\r\n\r\nare conducted can be regulated by the Minister; in\r\n\r\nthis case, the Minister for Law. So the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park need not despair. Of course, all this\r\n\r\nis on the assumption that these activities are\r\n\r\nlegal. If they are illegal, then such companies\r\n\r\ncannot be registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 29 to 45 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Until now, imports and exports to and\r\n\r\nfrom West Malaysia do not require Singapore per\r\n\r\nmits or Singapore documentation. The proposed\r\n\r\ndocumentation is to enable us to compile our own\r\n\r\nstatistics of trade with West Malaysia. Such trade\r\n\r\nstatistics are now compiled and supplied by the\r\n\r\nStatistics Department at Kuala Lurnpur.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of our trade with West Malaysia is\r\n\r\nalso made necessary by the export incentive scheme\r\n\r\nwhich is to be effective next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the amended Rules, importers and exporters\r\n\r\nwill be required to submit documents to cover\r\n\r\ngoods imported from or exported to West Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIn the case of imports by road or rail, the\r\n\r\ndocument required will be submitted to the Customs\r\n\r\nand will merely be an additional copy of the\r\n\r\nexport permit which the exporter in West Malaysia\r\n\r\nsubmits to Malaysian Customs. For exports to West\r\n\r\nMalaysia by road or rail, the document required\r\n\r\nwill be a copy of the Malaysian Customs import\r\n\r\npermit. In case of imports or exports by sea or\r\n\r\nair, the trader will submit one copy of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Inward Declaration or Outward\r\n\r\nDeclaration to the shipping or airline agent.
