Similarly, among  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  Sir, we also believe that there  are  good\r\n\r\nand bad unions.

But, Sir, in trying to  uproot\r\n\r\nthe bad unions, it may happen inadvertently that  a\r\n\r\nfew  good ones are also uprooted and therefore,  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of justice, it is desirable that these\r\n\r\naggrieved  trade unions, if they so desire,  should\r\n\r\nhave  a chance to appeal against decisions made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister - I stress again, inadvertently perhaps\r\n\r\nor without the full knowledge of the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the Minister himself will be\r\n\r\nthe  first  to  admit that being human  he  is  not\r\n\r\ninfallible, and therefore the request is that there\r\n\r\nbe a means provided so that instead of the decision\r\n\r\nbeing final, the aggrieved trade union, which still\r\n\r\nbelieves that it should be allowed to exist, should\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to make its appeal to a court  of  law.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not believe that this is the view of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment:  but  one  of  the  Members   did   say\r\n\r\nyesterday  that,  by  means of this  Bill,  certain\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  which  support an  opposition  party\r\n\r\nmight   have   their  registrations  cancelled   or\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  I  hope,  Sir, this  is  not  the  real\r\n\r\nintention of Government, because if that is so then\r\n\r\nI  think the main purpose is lost and people  would\r\n\r\nbe  thinking  along lines of politics  rather  than\r\n\r\nalong lines of what is just for the different trade\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like at least to read out from the\r\n\r\nbooklet  issued  by  the  People's  Action   Party,\r\n\r\nentitled  \"The  Tasks  Ahead\",  Part  2,  page  25,\r\n\r\nparagraph 3, the following:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But at the same time we must all remember that\r\n\r\nif  we  seek  industrial justice with a  vengeance,\r\n\r\nthere  will be no industrial peace.

Sir, there is sometimes\r\n\r\nthe tendency, in a capitalist regime, for employers\r\n\r\nto  have  their way all the time. But the  pendulum\r\n\r\nhas  swung  away from that; there is the danger  of\r\n\r\nthe    pendulum    swinging   to    the    opposite\r\n\r\nextreme - where, the trade unionists feel  that  they\r\n\r\nare the bosses, and the employers are the employed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the strengthening of the  trade  unions\r\n\r\nmust  not  be to gain the just rights of the  trade\r\n\r\nunionists  and  also to be the new  boss  over  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  Now, that, Sir, would be  bad  for  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  As  we  know, many of the employers  have\r\n\r\nalready  transferred part of their capital  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and we read in the papers recently that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  is having a boom  because  of  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  that the economy and the  stability  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  have inspired in  some  investors.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  desire  that part of that capital  should\r\n\r\ncome  back,  and  we can only see  that  happen  by\r\n\r\ngiving investors the assurance that whereas  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of the Government  to  protect  the\r\n\r\nrights of the workers, it is not their intention to\r\n\r\nintimidate  the bosses. I feel, Sir, that  in  that\r\n\r\nlight, we may be able then to produce conditions in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to enable the prosperity of the  country\r\n\r\nto  be  shared  all round among the  workers.  Sir,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  these qualifications, we  support  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  fully support the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill.  I believe  that  everyone  will\r\n\r\nagree with me on this. Society is always improving,\r\n\r\nespecially  now  that we have come to  this  stage.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the things that were done before are not\r\n\r\nsuitable  for the present society. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has pointed out that in 1941  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Ordinance was introduced. This is just  like\r\n\r\na  car  of  more  than ten years  old.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nsuitable for present use at all. Therefore, we have\r\n\r\nto improve it. In these few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears, the old Ordinance has produced many\r\n\r\ntragedies, and we hope that these tragedies will\r\n\r\nnot recur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About capital, we have to make amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, some Members mentioned a secret\r\n\r\nballot.  That is not the basic remedy. Principally,\r\n\r\nthe object of amending this Ordinance is to improve\r\n\r\nthe situation. This Ordinance is of old age, and  I\r\n\r\nwonder  why the previous Government had not altered\r\n\r\nor  amended  it. They had allowed the formation  of\r\n\r\nsplinter and yellow trade unions for the purpose of\r\n\r\nlooking   after  their  colleagues.  The   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment had not properly amended this Ordinance.\r\n\r\nBut today we are supported by the people and we are\r\n\r\nresponsible  to  them to amend the  errors  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Yesterday, the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\npointed out that the Ordinance should be in  accord\r\n\r\nwith the British Trade Union Act. I would point out\r\n\r\nthat  in  any  country  when  they  are  going   to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  Bill,  they  have  to  consider   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  prevailing in the  society  in  that\r\n\r\ncountry.  For  this  reason,  we  must  amend  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance in the proper way. And then it will  suit\r\n\r\nthe  people.  If the Members opposite were  not  so\r\n\r\nobstinate, they would not be so lonely as they  are\r\n\r\nnow. This is a lesson to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Cairnhill pointed out\r\n\r\nthat he agreed in principle with the amending Bill,\r\n\r\nbut he did not agree with clause 5. I feel that  is\r\n\r\nnot right. At present what we want to look after is\r\n\r\nour  nation. For this reason we must work  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  our country and do everything properly.\r\n\r\nOur  friends opposite us have continually said they\r\n\r\nare not opposing us, but actually they are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said are facts. We have to do things\r\n\r\nin  a  very practical way, for the welfare  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry and for the future. Only in this way can we\r\n\r\nachieve a merger with the Federation of Malaya, and\r\n\r\nalso maintain good relations between the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the people of Malaya. This is my  own\r\n\r\nopinion, and I fully support this amending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  Bill which is before the House  now  is\r\n\r\nlong overdue, and the sooner it is implemented, the\r\n\r\nhappier it would be for the workers and trade union\r\n\r\nleaders  in Singapore. The existence of yellow  and\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions  is  not only detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\ninterests of workers, but it is also detrimental to\r\n\r\nthe interests of the country. This Bill is designed\r\n\r\nto   correct  past  mistakes  and  to  assist   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  trade  union  movement   in   this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has progressed politically, and it is\r\n\r\nonly  proper  that the trade union movement  should\r\n\r\nalso  progress  with it. In the past,  trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders  have always been warned to keep away  from\r\n\r\npolitics.  But  genuine trade union  leaders,  from\r\n\r\ntheir  own experience, know that sometime or  other\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  seek the support of politicians  to\r\n\r\nachieve  results. Those leaders who do not  believe\r\n\r\nthat  politics  is  part of trade unionism  usually\r\n\r\nperish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the role of the union leaders was\r\n\r\nconfined to protecting and improving the welfare of\r\n\r\nits  members.  But  with the  attainment  of  self-government in Singapore, union leaders have a  more\r\n\r\nimportant role to play. They not only have to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the interests of its members, but they  also\r\n\r\nhave to look after the interests of the country  as\r\n\r\na whole. It has been said and feared that this Bill\r\n\r\nmay  be used to close rival organisations which  do\r\n\r\nnot   share  the  same  political  beliefs  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  These fears are completely  groundless\r\n\r\nbecause the members can still join existing unions,\r\n\r\nand if their leaders can muster sufficient support,\r\n\r\nthey  will  eventually take over the leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  unions. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I can say that\r\n\r\nthe  sooner  this Bill is implemented, the  quicker\r\n\r\ncan   the  workers  and  trade  union  leaders   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  look  forward to a period  of  hope  and\r\n\r\npromises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we have already heard my  colleagues\r\n\r\ndiscuss the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade Unions (Amendment) Bill. All of us know  that\r\n\r\nin  a  country, the most important people  are  the\r\n\r\nlabourers  and  workers. We have many  workers  and\r\n\r\nlabourers  to develop the country. Therefore,  they\r\n\r\ncan form strong and powerful trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I heard the Member for Cairnhill say\r\n\r\nthat  when the Ordinance was introduced in 1941  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it was under a colonial regime and under\r\n\r\na   colonial  Government.  They  were  not   paying\r\n\r\nattention   to   democracy.  But   we   must   have\r\n\r\nconsolidation and have a strong Government. We  can\r\n\r\nsee  that if only a few people form a trade  union - like  a  shop  with  only  ten  or  more  than  ten\r\n\r\npeople - how  can they represent the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers?  In  this case, that union  cannot  really\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  welfare of the workers.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthese  few  people  can have connections  with  the\r\n\r\nemployers and achieve their own ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are before us. Under the Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution, the old Government formed many yellow\r\n\r\nunions.  Yesterday our Minister for Labour and  Law\r\n\r\nsaid  that  strikes had occurred in the past.  They\r\n\r\nformed  many  unions during that period,  and  many\r\n\r\nopportunists  and  politicians made  use  of  these\r\n\r\nunions to further their own interest. They used  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  and weaken the strength of the employees.\r\n\r\nYou  can see an example of the Hock Lee bus strike.\r\n\r\nThis shows that they had close connections with the\r\n\r\ncolonial Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before the P.A.P. Government came into power, our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,\r\n\r\nhad  said  that  when we came into power  we  would\r\n\r\namend  this Ordinance. For the welfare and interest\r\n\r\nof  our workers, we have to do it. Under the Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution, the former Government had connections\r\n\r\nwith  the colonial Government. Therefore,  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, if we follow the developments\r\n\r\nof  the trade union movement in Singapore, we will,\r\n\r\nwithout  hesitation,  come  to  the  conclusion  of\r\n\r\nunanimous support for this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating this Bill for the second day. In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I  see  that although  some  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers have expressed support for the Bill,  there\r\n\r\nare  others whose support is conditional.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  are  fully conscious that they are forced  to\r\n\r\nsupport  this  Bill for the reason  that  they  are\r\n\r\nfully  aware  that, if they choose  to  ignore  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the labour movement, then  after  the\r\n\r\nnext  five years they will find that they will have\r\n\r\nto  vacate this Assembly. This neglect on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the  past Government in not looking  after  the\r\n\r\ninterest and welfare of the labour movement can  be\r\n\r\nseen  in  the fact that they now represent  only  a\r\n\r\nminority in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say this to the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nwho  has  stated that he is not an  expert  on  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement, although he has shown that  he  is\r\n\r\nquite  an  expert on the labour law in  England.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  point  out to him that Singapore  is  not\r\n\r\nEngland. The way the workers in Singapore  live  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  same as that of the workers  in  England.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   there  is  no  necessity  to   compare\r\n\r\nSingapore with England. What is good in England may\r\n\r\nnot  be  necessarily be good in  Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible that what is good in Singapore may not  be\r\n\r\ngood   in  England.  This  fact  should  have   the\r\n\r\nattention  of  Members. We  are  heading  for  full\r\n\r\nindependence,  and  we  must  be  ready   to   take\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and stand on our own feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands has advised\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Law to exercise care so\r\n\r\nthat  the  labour movement will not be involved  in\r\n\r\npolitics.  I  wonder, because, if one  follows  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement or political developments closely,\r\n\r\nI think the one cannot be separated from the other.\r\n\r\nI think the labour movement must be closely related\r\n\r\nto political developments because, if any action by\r\n\r\nthe  labour movement fails, then they will have  no\r\n\r\nalternative   but   to  fight   through   political\r\n\r\nchannels. On top of that, we should realise that 90\r\n\r\nper  cent of the people of Singapore today comprise\r\n\r\nthe  working  class  who  are  fighting  for  their\r\n\r\ndestiny and for a common aim and interest; that is,\r\n\r\nfor the establishment of social justice based\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non common interest. The working class must struggle\r\n\r\ntogether. If their struggle fails, then it is clear\r\n\r\nthat    they    must   fight   through    political\r\n\r\norganisations because the labour movement which has\r\n\r\nbeen  suppressed  by  the employers  will  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on a democratic Government who can  protect\r\n\r\nand  safeguard  their rights. This  is  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement's  connection with politics.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is represented by the capitalist  class,\r\n\r\nthen  they  cannot  look  after  or  maintain   the\r\n\r\ninterest of the working class as a whole.  This  is\r\n\r\nproved   by  what  has  happened  to  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remember the instance quoted by the Member for\r\n\r\nthe  Southern Islands, that the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law  should  be  careful in implementing  this\r\n\r\nBill.    The   Member   has   advised   that    the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of  this  Bill   should   not   be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by political motives. But I think  this\r\n\r\nwill  not happen because we have received a mandate\r\n\r\nfrom the people, and we will uphold that mandate as\r\n\r\na basis for the struggle of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Malay union in the Harbour Board\r\n\r\nwhich  was mentioned by the Member for the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands,  I  wish to explain that if  in  a  labour\r\n\r\nmovement there exist a Malay trade union, an Indian\r\n\r\ntrade  union and a Chinese trade union, and so  on,\r\n\r\nthen  Singapore will be faced with a split  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement,  and  it  is  obvious  that   the\r\n\r\nemployers  will  exploit the  situation  to  create\r\n\r\ndissension amongst the various races. For instance,\r\n\r\nif the Chinese workers are on strike, the employers\r\n\r\nwill  make  use of the Malays, and vice versa.  The\r\n\r\nMalay trade union in the Harbour Board, I know,  is\r\n\r\nnot representative of the Malay workers there. That\r\n\r\nunion can be said to represent only tens of workers\r\n\r\nout of hundreds of Malay workers who are members of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association. From\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  view  of the labour  movement,  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of splinter or yellow  unions  which\r\n\r\nare  nurtured by employers will consequently result\r\n\r\nin  the labour struggle in Singapore facing a  dark\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I very much regret the fears expressed by the\r\n\r\nOpposition   Members  in  this  Assembly   at   the\r\n\r\npossibility that this Ministry will in future  wipe\r\n\r\nout  the small or yellow trade unions. It seems  as\r\n\r\nthough  such unions have connections with those  in\r\n\r\nthis  House who have expressed fears. As the  Malay\r\n\r\nproverb, literally translated, says, if it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  of the padi that is ripening, the  weaver-bird  will not bother to build its nest on  a  low-hanging  branch.  I am not accusing  directly,  but\r\n\r\npossibly  the  sentiments expressed could  be  said\r\n\r\nclearly to show that there is a connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is just to look after the development of a\r\n\r\nhealthy  trade  union movement,  then  we  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation in passing this Bill and moving  towards\r\n\r\na  more  just  society  on this  island.  With  the\r\n\r\npassing of this Bill, we hope that the trade unions\r\n\r\nand  the  labour  movement on  the  whole  will  be\r\n\r\nheading towards a healthy state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, yesterday my colleagues took quite a long time\r\n\r\nto  elaborate  with facts and figures how  splinter\r\n\r\nand yellow unions were formed, how they are used to\r\n\r\nfrustrate  the  workers'  movement,  and  how  this\r\n\r\naffects  the workers' interests. We know that  this\r\n\r\nshould  have happened under the previous Government\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was  a  government  representing   the\r\n\r\ncolonial and vested interests. It did not  like  to\r\n\r\nsee  a  strong trade union movement in the country.\r\n\r\nIn  order to protect the colonial vested interests,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  not  only had  to  preserve  those\r\n\r\noppressive  rules and laws, but also indirectly  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in activities detrimental to the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that era has passed and we have now come into a new one. To achieve the object which we\r\n\r\nenunciated during our election campaign - to maintain\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice - we must see that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  must  be in a strong bargaining  position,\r\n\r\notherwise   they  will  always  be  oppressed   and\r\n\r\nexploited by the employers. Therefore, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nsince the previous Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  infected  the  trade union movement  with  the\r\n\r\ncancer  of  yellow unionism, it is up to  this  new\r\n\r\nGovernment to wipe out the disease, otherwise,  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement will be killed by it. In order\r\n\r\nto  achieve that object, the Government has decided\r\n\r\nto amend the present Trade Unions Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Opposition knows very well that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no ground for opposing us, and the  more\r\n\r\nthey talk against this movement, the more will they\r\n\r\nexpose  themselves. They agree in principle to  the\r\n\r\namending of the Ordinance but object to one  clause\r\n\r\nwhich says that appeals shall be dealt with by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Mr  Speaker,  when  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance  introduced the Finance Bill or  the  Audit\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Opposition  immediately  jumped  up  to\r\n\r\noppose  the powers sought to be given to an elected\r\n\r\nMinister. We know that the Members opposite were in\r\n\r\nthe  past used to bestowing powers on colonial  and\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers but now they  hate  to  bestow\r\n\r\npowers on an elected government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than on the powers for the Minister, the\r\n\r\nOpposition  cannot criticise us - it  has  no  valid\r\n\r\ncriticism to make on the amending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have - listened to\r\n\r\nthe  representations against clause 5 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nand  I  must  say,  Mr Speaker,  I  am  completely\r\n\r\nunmoved. This clause provides that the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  on an appeal under  section  16  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance is to be final and not to be called  into\r\n\r\nquestion  in  any  court. I have already  told  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that it will be the object of this  Bill  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  number  of unions to  more  reasonable\r\n\r\nproportions,  bearing in mind that at  the  present\r\n\r\ntime there are less than 30 per cent of the working\r\n\r\npopulation  organised in unions and  there  are  as\r\n\r\nmany  as  226 unions to cater for this  very  small\r\n\r\nproportion of the total working population. It will\r\n\r\nbe  necessary,  therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  for  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar to use his discretion extensively if some\r\n\r\norder is to be brought out of the present chaos. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  already said that the new power of cancelling\r\n\r\nthe  registration of yellow or splinter  unions  is\r\n\r\none  that  can  only be properly  exercised  by  an\r\n\r\nexecutive body. And I repeat the statement which  I\r\n\r\nmade earlier - that the machinery of the court is, in\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the Government, quite unsuitable  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  such matters, which hinge  so  much  on\r\n\r\nquestions of policy and executive discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if order is to come out of the\r\n\r\npresent chaos, it is necessary, I would say  vital,\r\n\r\nthat  we  should have the means to deal  adequately\r\n\r\nwith  the present situation. It is, therefore,  our\r\n\r\npurpose in proposing the amendments to clause 17 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance to shut out appeals which are  bound\r\n\r\nto be of a \"wanton and niggardly\" character, to use\r\n\r\nthe words of the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to point out here that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not  proposed  any  amendment   to\r\n\r\nsubsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section 15  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  which lay down the procedure  which\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar is to follow when deciding to cancel\r\n\r\nor  withdraw the registration of a union.  We  have\r\n\r\nleft  these  provisions  of  section  15  untouched\r\n\r\nbecause   we   want   the  procedure   of   notice,\r\n\r\nopportunity to show cause and adequate inquiry,  to\r\n\r\nbe  followed before the Registrar makes up his mind\r\n\r\none way or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stated - in his speech at Geylang Serai - that the cancellation of registration\r\n\r\nof  yellow unions and splinter unions will only  be\r\n\r\nmade  after  due  investigation  to  establish  the\r\n\r\ntruth,  or after secret ballot has shown  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority of workers support or oppose, as the  case\r\n\r\nmay  be, a union in their sector of employment. And\r\n\r\nthis  assurance  has  also been  written  into  the\r\n\r\nchapter  on  trade  unions in the  P.A.P.'s  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  entitled, \"The Tasks Ahead\",  which  has\r\n\r\nbecome the bible for the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nexpressed  great  surprise that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nattempting  to shut out appeals to the  High  Court\r\n\r\nwhen the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  union enactment in the United Kingdom, which\r\n\r\nforms   the  model  for  our  local  Trade   Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance, provided for such appeals. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to remind the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark, and I think he needs constant reminding about\r\n\r\nthis, that conditions in the United Kingdom are not\r\n\r\nthe  conditions we find here. There is a very  much\r\n\r\nlarger   proportion   of  the  working   population\r\n\r\norganised in trade unions in the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nthere is not to be found there the multiplicity  of\r\n\r\ntiny  unions  that  we find in Singapore,  so  that\r\n\r\nprecedents   in   the  United   Kingdom   are   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily good precedents for local conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already pointed out that\r\n\r\nI  have  been advised that the form of words  which\r\n\r\nare used in our proposed amendment to section 17 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  does not preclude recourse  to  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court in certiorari proceedings. Quite  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  right of appeal which may be  denied  by\r\n\r\nstatute  or by an Ordinance, I am advised that  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court has, in its prerogative jurisdiction, an\r\n\r\ninherent right to supervise and review the acts  of\r\n\r\npersons  and  of subordinate bodies which  exercise\r\n\r\nquasi  judicial functions. Where it  can  be  shown\r\n\r\nthat  a person or subordinate authority has refused\r\n\r\nto  exercise  or  has  improperly  exercised  these\r\n\r\nfunctions  under circumstances which  amount  to  a\r\n\r\ndenial  of natural justice, recourse can always  be\r\n\r\nhad to the High Court in certiorari proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have already pointed out just now, it is not the intention of the Government to\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the existing procedural  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance  leading to  the  withdrawal  or\r\n\r\ncancellation  of  the registration  of  unions,  as\r\n\r\nthese   provisions  clearly  provide  for  adequate\r\n\r\nnotice,  for an opportunity to show cause  and  for\r\n\r\nthe  holding of art inquiry before an order can  be\r\n\r\nmade  by the Registrar. To shut out the prerogative\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the High Court in such matters,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be shown, I am advised, that the acts of  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  or  that of the Minister on  appeal  are\r\n\r\npurely ministerial in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the present\r\n\r\nprocedural  provisions  of section  15,  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  left  untouched,  it   would   be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  argue such a case  before  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.

Does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that  the Registrar may commit a  mistake  in\r\n\r\nregistering  a  trade union when  its  objects  are\r\n\r\nunlawful, or has he the power to register  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  when  the  objects are apparent  to  him  as\r\n\r\nunlawful?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the words used in\r\n\r\nthe proposed section 10 (b) read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that the objects, rules and constitution of the\r\n\r\nunion   do  not  conflict  with  any   of   such\r\n\r\nprovisions and are not unlawful;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  proviso  in  section 10 of  the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that if any one of the objects of such\r\n\r\ntrade  union is unlawful, the registration  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union shall be void.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one case, there is a conflict with the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance and, in the other case,\r\n\r\nwith the objects of the union itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon.

On  1st  October  this  year,  the  $25\r\n\r\nmillion  Straits Settlements 1940 3% War Loan  will\r\n\r\nbe  due for redemption. There is ample provision in\r\n\r\nthe  Sinking Fund for this loan to repay the  whole\r\n\r\nof it. But it is thought advantageous to be able to\r\n\r\nmake an offer to owners of the stock for conversion\r\n\r\nto a loan which will be floated at about this time.\r\n\r\nThe  terms of such a loan are being worked out, and\r\n\r\nif  this Bill is approved, it will be announced  in\r\n\r\nthe course of the next few weeks. The amount of the\r\n\r\nloan intended to be floated will, however, only  be\r\n\r\npart of the $100 million. The sanction given by the\r\n\r\nBill,  however, will enable the Treasury from  time\r\n\r\nto  time to take account of the financial resources\r\n\r\nlikely to be available for loan floatation, and  to\r\n\r\nraise  loans  whenever local market conditions  are\r\n\r\nfavourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the Bill follows closely legislation\r\n\r\nwhich  is  in force in the Federation,  with  minor\r\n\r\nmodifications to suit the conditions in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  substance of the Bill is in Part  II  thereof.\r\n\r\nClause  3  enables  loans to be  raised  which,  by\r\n\r\nclause  4,  will  be charged upon the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund.

Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nbecause we promulgated this Constitution, it is our\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  therefore, to protect  and  uphold\r\n\r\nit.   If  we  from  U.M.N.O. do  not  defend  this\r\n\r\nConstitution  which  we ourselves  promulgated,  it\r\n\r\nmeans that we have gone against it and also against\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. Likewise, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party. If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. refuses  to  uphold  or  defend   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  which  the P.A.P. itself  helped  to\r\n\r\npromulgate  with  us, it means  that  it  has  gone\r\n\r\nagainst   the   Constitution,  and,   consequently,\r\n\r\nagainst the interest of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem before us today concerns the position\r\n\r\nof  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara as contained in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  Singapore. As  we  know,  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  must  be\r\n\r\nnominated by the Queen from among persons  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or in the Federation of Malaya,  and  he\r\n\r\nmust  be above politics. The Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\ncan be said to exercise no function other than that\r\n\r\nof  clemency,  as contained in the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Part II, Article No. 9 (i) and (ii). The\r\n\r\nfunctions  given to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  are\r\n\r\nmentioned in Government Gazette Supplement  No.  32\r\n\r\ndated  10th April, 1959, Chapter 2, subsection  (a)\r\n\r\n(ii),  which  also stated that the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  has  full  powers  for  clemency  and   the\r\n\r\ngranting  of  appeals.  This  clearly  shows,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara can take a\r\n\r\ndecision   himself  on  the  question  of  granting\r\n\r\npardons to people who have been sentenced, and that\r\n\r\nhe  can seek advice from anybody else he wishes to.\r\n\r\nBut  the most important thing is that the Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara  himself  can  take  a   decision.\r\n\r\nTherefore  that decision should be the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara himself  and  not  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Cabinet or the decision  of  any\r\n\r\nother Minister. The Cabinet cannot put presure upon\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  to  take  a  decision\r\n\r\nconcerning the question of granting a pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.M.N.O. of Singapore, Mr Speaker, is not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  what  has  occurred  because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has, in our opinion, gone out of its way\r\n\r\nand  acted  beyond  the powers of the  Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich will result in unfair government. Any conduct\r\n\r\noutside the scope of the Constitution is dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe  danger is not only to the Government but  also\r\n\r\nto all the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is a\r\n\r\nforeigner, and his mistake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  an  example to the future Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  one who will be appointed from  among  the\r\n\r\npeople of this country. U.M.N.O. does not want this\r\n\r\nmistake  to  be repeated again in future.  In  this\r\n\r\nmatter  we do not know whether or not the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara deliberately collaborated with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In\r\n\r\n1950,  a  riot  occurred. This was  the  result  of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction   with  the  judgment   which   was\r\n\r\nconsidered by the people of Singapore to be not  in\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  of justice and fair play. Five  people\r\n\r\nwere sentenced to death. U.M.N.O. at that time came\r\n\r\nforward  to  defend  these five persons,  with  the\r\n\r\nresult  that  the death sentences were commuted  to\r\n\r\nlife   sentences.  In  1956,  U.M.N.O. again  came\r\n\r\nforward  and  appealed to the  then  Governor,  Sir\r\n\r\nRobert  Black,  to reduce the sentences.  This  was\r\n\r\nsuccessful. In this connection, I am pleased to say\r\n\r\nthat at that time, as head of U.M.N.O., I played  a\r\n\r\nleading  role  in the whole affair. Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  up  to today the five people referred  to\r\n\r\njust  now  have served their sentences  for  almost\r\n\r\nnine  years. Therefore, with the birth of  the  new\r\n\r\nnation  of  Singapore, with a new  outlook,  a  new\r\n\r\natmosphere  and with promise and hopes - all  new  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore - U.M.N.O. has  taken  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to appeal to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nfor  the  balance  of  the sentence  period  to  be\r\n\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 5th of June, 1959, U.M.N.O. wrote a letter\r\n\r\nto the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

But, unfortunately, suddenly on  the\r\n\r\n8th  of  July this year, U.M.N.O. received a letter\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry of Labour and Law, signed by  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General and addressed to Inche Abdul\r\n\r\nHamid Allwie. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am directed by the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nto  refer  to your letter Ref.

It  appears that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  had  arrogated  to  himself   the\r\n\r\nfunctions and powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it would appear that the  Minister  had\r\n\r\ncommitted an act which was in contravention of  and\r\n\r\nagainst   the   spirit  of  the   Constitution   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   U.M.N.O.'s  letter   of   appeal   was\r\n\r\naddressed  to  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for  his\r\n\r\nconsideration  and decision; but according  to  the\r\n\r\nletter from the State Advocate-General (or from the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself), it shows that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law had considered U.M.N.O.'s appeal and\r\n\r\nthat  he  himself had taken the decision to  reject\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.'s  appeal. As explained in his letter,  he\r\n\r\nwas unable to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to\r\n\r\ngrant  a pardon to the five prisoners mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthe  letter.  So  the conduct of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law is one example of an act  which  is\r\n\r\noutside  the  scope  of the Constitution.  We  from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.,  Mr Speaker, oppose it strongly  because\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. does not want to collaborate with  and  be\r\n\r\nan   accomplice   in  such  conduct   towards   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  Singapore  and  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on the 30th July, there was a statement\r\n\r\nissued  in  the Straits Times made in English.  The\r\n\r\nstatement came from the Ministry of Labour and Law.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Labour and Law said that  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  make  any kind of decision, that the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara himself had taken the decision,  and\r\n\r\nthat   the  decision  was  relayed  to  the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned   through  his  Ministry.  The   Minister\r\n\r\nfurther  stated that the letter of appeal was  sent\r\n\r\nto  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara; that the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  had asked for the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet; the Cabinet had advised him in the matter;\r\n\r\nand the Yang di-Pertuan Negara had decided that the\r\n\r\ngrant  of  appeal  could  not  be  considered.  The\r\n\r\ndecision of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara was  relayed\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Ministry of Labour and  Law,  because\r\n\r\nthis   Ministry  is  responsible  in  matters  that\r\n\r\nconcern laws, and is under the instructions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law. Therefore, the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General had communicated the  decision  to\r\n\r\nthe person concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the statement from the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law. In his statement there  were  two\r\n\r\npoints which are misleading. One, that the Minister\r\n\r\nstated  that he had not taken the decision himself.\r\n\r\nThe decision was made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nand this decision was conveyed through the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and  Law. Now, Mr Speaker,  which  is\r\n\r\ntrue? Is it the letter from the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law,  or  is it the statement  issued  in  the\r\n\r\nPress?  This  we  do  not know.  According  to  the\r\n\r\nletter,  it  is clear here that it is the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwhich  considered the appeal and that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nitself  was  unable to advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the Press it is stated that the decision\r\n\r\nwas  taken by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Secondly,\r\n\r\nthe   newspapers  quoted  the  statement  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour and Law to the effect that  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara had asked for  advice  from\r\n\r\nthe Cabinet and the Cabinet had advised the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara. But in the letter of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law, it states that the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour himself considered U.M.N.O.'s appeal and the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself had advised the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  But  in the newspapers, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  stated  that the person who considered  the\r\n\r\nmatter  and who advised the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nwas the Cabinet. Therefore, which is correct? Is it\r\n\r\nthe  letter  or is it the statement issued  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Law? This is  a  question\r\n\r\nthat  needs  to be answered. It further shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  statement of the Minister quoted in the  Press\r\n\r\nand the letter from the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\ncontradicted  each other. If the statement  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  is  correct,  then  the  letter  is\r\n\r\nincorrect. If the letter is correct, then  it  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Labour and Law  has  proved\r\n\r\nthat he had arrogated to himself the powers of  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara. And  if  this  letter  is\r\n\r\ncorrect and the statement is therefore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong,  then it means that the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand   Law   had  issued  a  statement   which   was\r\n\r\nirresponsible and false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, on this matter there are\r\n\r\nmany questions which we and U.M.N.O. would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Government. Did the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nask  for  the  advice of the Cabinet? That  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst  question. The second question  is:  Did  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  convey their advice to the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara?  The  third question is: Did the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara convey his decision to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and  Law in reply to the  letter  from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.? The fourth question is, and this is  most\r\n\r\nimportant:  Why did the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  not\r\n\r\nreply direct to U.M.N.O., as he had done so on  the\r\n\r\n5th of June, 1959? The fifth question is: Why is it\r\n\r\nthat the Minister for Labour and Law, in his letter\r\n\r\naddressed  to U.M.N.O., failed to mention  that  he\r\n\r\nhad  received instructions from the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara?  On  the  other hand,  it  was  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  who  conveyed  to  U.M.N.O. the\r\n\r\ndecision  of the Ministry of Labour and Law,  as  I\r\n\r\nexplained just now. The sixth question is: Was  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of  the  Minister for Labour  and  Law,  as\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  letter  to  U.M.N.O.,  in  fact\r\n\r\nconveyed   to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara?   And\r\n\r\nfinally,  question number seven: Did the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  himself  make  the  decision,   as\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  statement of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  in the Straits Times? Was it the result  of\r\n\r\nthe advice of the Cabinet, or from the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.M.N.O. is of the opinion that this question of\r\n\r\nappeal  had  failed  to  receive  proper  and  just\r\n\r\nconsideration  from the Government  in  power,  and\r\n\r\nthat in this matter the powers and responsibilities\r\n\r\nof  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara had been polluted by\r\n\r\nthe political party in power in Singapore. The Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara of the Government  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas created a precedent which is against the spirit\r\n\r\nand principle of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I appeal to all the Members of the Assembly, in the interest of the Constitution of\r\n\r\nthe  State  of  Singapore  and  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee  that  the people's ambition of fair  play  and\r\n\r\njustice  is achieved.

For that reason, U.M.N.O. has  thought\r\n\r\nover this matter and appealed to the Government  in\r\n\r\npower to rectify the mistakes which have been  made\r\n\r\nby  a  certain group and the confusion  which  they\r\n\r\nhave  caused.  I  said  earlier  that  this  matter\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  release of the  prisoners  on  whose\r\n\r\nbehalf  U.M.N.O. made an appeal to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to grant a pardon in the hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  wound which was caused in 1950 will be  healed\r\n\r\nnow that Singapore is a self-governing State with a\r\n\r\nConstitution  which  has the  support  of  all  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But  as  the  Malay saying  goes:  if  the\r\n\r\nprisoners are suffering, it does not mean that  the\r\n\r\nwounds have been healed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hate interrupting this debate, but\r\n\r\nI must keep the debate in the proper channel, and I\r\n\r\nmust  ask the hon.

I will speak directly\r\n\r\non  the motion brought by U.M.N.O. for a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry  to  be appointed for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nascertaining the circumstances of the case  and  to\r\n\r\ngive  its  opinion as to which side  is  right  and\r\n\r\nwhich is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been explained earlier by my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  exchange  of  correspondence  originated  with\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.'s  letter dated 5th June, 1959,  addressed\r\n\r\nto   the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  On  6th  June,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. received a letter from the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  stating that the matter of appeal addressed\r\n\r\nto  him  was under consideration. On the 8th  July,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. received a letter from the State Advocate-General  stating that he had been directed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law to reply to U.M.N.O.'s\r\n\r\nletter dated 5th June, 1959, addressed to the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara,  and  was  to  state  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Labour  and  Law  had  given   full\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  it  but regretted  that  he  was\r\n\r\nunable  to  advise  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to\r\n\r\ngrant any further clemency to the Muslim prisoners.\r\n\r\nWith  regard to the letter from the State Advocate-General, it is most confusing as explained just now\r\n\r\nwhether the Yang di-Pertuan Negara himself  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law gave the  decision  to\r\n\r\nreject U.M.N.O.'s appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. Mr Speaker, as I emphasised at the\r\n\r\nbeginning of my speech, the Government should  take\r\n\r\na  serious view of this matter so as to allay fears\r\n\r\nand misunderstanding and the loss of confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe public in the Government today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, on 5th June, 1959, the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the  Emergency  Committee   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   U.M.N.O. addressed   a   petition   in\r\n\r\nEnglish - it  is  not their official language - to  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara asking for clemency and  for\r\n\r\nthe  immediate release of certain Muslim  prisoners\r\n\r\nnow  in Changi Gaol who were sentenced to death and\r\n\r\nreprieved  in  connection with the Nadra  riots  in\r\n\r\nDecember, 1950.

Under   section  9  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, the power to\r\n\r\nremit any sentence is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  I  would refer to section 9, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhich states:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara, as occasion shall\r\n\r\narise,  may,  in  Her Majesty's  name  and  on  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's behalf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) remit the whole or any part of any such\r\n\r\nsentence  or  of  any penalty  or  forfeiture\r\n\r\notherwise due to Her Majesty:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That    is    provided   for   in   the   Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)  Order  in  Council.  That  is   the\r\n\r\nprovision of the Order in Council which the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Geylang Serai referred to just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the exercise of the powers\r\n\r\nconferred  on  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  by  the\r\n\r\nOrder   in  Council  is  regulated  by  the   Royal\r\n\r\nInstructions.  The  Member for  Geylang  Serai  has\r\n\r\nnever  known this. I will now enlighten  him  about\r\n\r\nthese  Instructions. Mr Speaker, clause 2  (a)  of\r\n\r\nthese  Instructions  provides  that  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara shall consult with the Cabinet (or a\r\n\r\nMinister acting under the general authority of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet) in the exercise of all powers, authorities\r\n\r\nand  functions  conferred on him by  or  under  the\r\n\r\nOrder  or  by or under any other law for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing  in force in Singapore other than any  power,\r\n\r\nauthority  or  function  which  is  expressed   (in\r\n\r\nwhatever  terms) to be exercisable by  him  in  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Royal Instructions, Mr Speaker, go on\r\n\r\nto say, in clause 2, sub-clause (d), that even in a\r\n\r\ncase where the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has any power\r\n\r\nto  be exercised by him in his discretion, he  must\r\n\r\nact   in   accordance   with   any   constitutional\r\n\r\nconvention  applicable  to  the  exercise  of   any\r\n\r\nsimilar  power, authority or function by the  Queen\r\n\r\nin the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of these provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Royal Instructions is that the exercise  of\r\n\r\nthe powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in respect\r\n\r\nof  the  remission of sentences under the Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)   Order   in   Council,   even    if\r\n\r\nexercisable at his discretion, must be exercised in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  the  constitutional   convention\r\n\r\napplicable  to the exercise of a similar  power  by\r\n\r\nthe  Queen  in  the United Kingdom. In  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, the convention is that a pardon leading to\r\n\r\nthe  remission of sentence is granted by the  Queen\r\n\r\nonly  when such a remission is approved by the Home\r\n\r\nSecretary. My authority for so saying, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  the book on \"The Home Office\" in the  new\r\n\r\nWhitehall  series which was written  by  Sir  Frank\r\n\r\nNewton, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for  the\r\n\r\nHome Department. I refer, Mr Speaker, Sir, to page\r\n\r\n114  of  this  book. In Chapter 11,  entitled  \"The\r\n\r\nRoyal Prerogative of Mercy\", it is stated that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  prerogative of mercy is exercised  in  England\r\n\r\nand Wales on the advice of the Home Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly defined, it is the prerogative of\r\n\r\nrelieving  an  offender  of  all  or  some  of  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of the conviction in, or a sentence or\r\n\r\npenalty  imposed  by,  the  Criminal  Courts.   The\r\n\r\nprerogative may be exercised by the grant  of  free\r\n\r\npardons,  conditional pardons and  remissions.  The\r\n\r\nnote  on remissions states that a remission reduces\r\n\r\nthe   amount  of  a  sentence  or  penalty  without\r\n\r\nchanging  its  character, as  when  a  sentence  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment is reduced from twelve months to eight\r\n\r\nmonths or a fine of \ufffd6 is reduced by half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of the petition of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O., the question of the remission of sentence\r\n\r\nwas referred by H.E. the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Home Affairs, which in turn passed\r\n\r\nthe matter on for consideration to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  which  is  concerned  with  legal\r\n\r\nmatters relating to petitions for the remission  of\r\n\r\nsentences. The petition was then submitted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law to the Cabinet, and the\r\n\r\nCabinet  was  asked to consider  the  petition  and\r\n\r\nadvise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara whether or not to\r\n\r\naccede  to  the  appeal for clemency.  The  Cabinet\r\n\r\ndecided  to advise H.E. the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nthat no clemency should be shown to the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the authority of the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara to disclose that, on the 6th\r\n\r\nof July, I officially informed him that the Cabinet\r\n\r\nhad  considered the petitions of the  President  of\r\n\r\nthe Emergency Committee of U.M.N.O., Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of the Malay Seamen's Union, and had\r\n\r\ndecided to advise him that there was no reason  for\r\n\r\nshowing clemency to these Muslim prisoners as  they\r\n\r\nwere  convicted on criminal charges and their cases\r\n\r\nwere  unlike  those of the political detainees  who\r\n\r\nwere recently released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also attached draft letters which were to be\r\n\r\nsent by His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nsecretary   to  the  President  of  the   Emergency\r\n\r\nCommittee of U.M.N.O. and the Secretary of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay Seamen's Union, informing them of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's decision - that the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  had decided to act in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nadvice which he had received from the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 7th of July I received\r\n\r\nthe following minute from His Excellency:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Minister,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, please, I think it would\r\n\r\nbe more in accordance with the new Constitution for\r\n\r\nthe  reply to go from your Ministry, written by the\r\n\r\ndirection   of   the   Minister,   informing    the\r\n\r\npetitioners  that  the  Minister  has  given   full\r\n\r\nconsideration  to their request but regrets  he  is\r\n\r\nunable to advise His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara to grant any further clemency. This would be\r\n\r\nin line with U.K. practice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On  the  8th  of July, the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\nwrote the following letter to the President of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Committee of U.M.N.O.:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I  am directed by the Minister for Labour and  Law\r\n\r\nto  refer to your letter, ref: P.E.N./ 1/59,  dated\r\n\r\n5th  June,  1959, addressed to the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  and to state that the Minister  has  given\r\n\r\nfull consideration to your request but regrets that\r\n\r\nhe  is  unable to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nto   grant  any  further  clemency  to  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nprisoners referred to in your letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     (Sd.) State Advocate-General.\"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>It will be seen, therefore, that the reply was sent\r\n\r\nin  this  form at the express wish of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara himself after he had considered  the\r\n\r\npetition and had decided to act in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe advice of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I pointed out earlier, the\r\n\r\npower  to remit a sentence is a discretionary power\r\n\r\nvested  in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara by the  Order\r\n\r\nin  Council, and not in the Cabinet. In  exercising\r\n\r\nthis power by the Royal Instructions, the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  must  act in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nconvention  applicable in such cases in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom. In this case, he acted in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe   convention   applicable  to   petitions   for\r\n\r\nremission  of sentences in the United  Kingdom  and\r\n\r\ntook  the  advice of the Cabinet not  to  show  any\r\n\r\nclemency. The petitioners were so informed  in  the\r\n\r\nmanner suggested by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhimself. There was no question, therefore,  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law arrogating to  himself\r\n\r\nthe  functions  of  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  in\r\n\r\nregard to these petitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 30th of July a report\r\n\r\nappeared in the Straits Times stating that  at  the\r\n\r\nPress  conference  at U.M.N.O. headquarters,  Inche\r\n\r\nAbdul  Hamid  released  a  letter  from  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General, and the text of  this  letter  is\r\n\r\nreproduced in this report. I will read it, Sir:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"I am directed by the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw  to refer to your letter dated June 5 addressed\r\n\r\nto the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and to state that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has given it his full consideration,  but\r\n\r\nregrets  that  he  is unable to grant  any  further\r\n\r\nclemency to the Muslim prisoners.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That, Mr Speaker, is a complete fabrication of the\r\n\r\ntruth. The letter that was written, reads as\r\n\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am directed by the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nto  refer to your letter addressed to the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara and to state that the Minister  has\r\n\r\ngiven  full  consideration  to  your  request   but\r\n\r\nregrets  that he is unable to advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to grant any further clemency to the\r\n\r\nMuslim prisoners referred to in your letter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is not the letter which Inche Abdul Hamid said\r\n\r\nhe received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a point made in the\r\n\r\nmotion  standing in the name of Inche  Abdul  Hamid\r\n\r\nthat the Minister has made misleading statements to\r\n\r\nthe  Press in connection with the rejection of  the\r\n\r\npetition.

It reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Byrne said tonight he had never at any time\r\n\r\nmade the decision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That statement is quite correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It  was a decision of the Cabinet. It was made  by\r\n\r\nthe   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  himself   and   was\r\n\r\ntransmitted  to  the person concerned  through  his\r\n\r\nMinistry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Order in Council, the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to remit a sentence or not to  remit  a\r\n\r\nsentence  is vested clearly in the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  by  law  and not in the  Cabinet.  So  that\r\n\r\nstatement is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He explained: \"The petition was sent to the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara,  who  sought  advice  from  the\r\n\r\nCabinet.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"The Cabinet gave him certain advice with regard\r\n\r\nto  this matter and he decided that there should be\r\n\r\nno pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His decision then came to the Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law as we deal with legal matters, and on  the\r\n\r\ninstruction  of  the Minister, the State  Advocate-General  communicated the decision  to  the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is also correct, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He said he had checked with law officers and\r\n\r\nthey confirmed that what the Ministry had done  was\r\n\r\n\"in    accordance    with   normal   constitutional\r\n\r\npractice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"It is complete nonsense to suggest that the\r\n\r\ndecision  came  from  the Minister.  The  power  is\r\n\r\nclearly vested in the person of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  himself  and not in a Minister  or  in  the\r\n\r\nCabinet.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is correct, and there is nothing misleading in\r\n\r\nthe statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last point I would make is\r\n\r\nto  show the difference between practice under  the\r\n\r\nold  constitution with which the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  is  familiar, that is, the Singapore  Colony\r\n\r\nOrder  in  Council, 1955. Now,  in  that  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  power of remitting  a  sentence  was\r\n\r\nvested   in   the  Governor.  Under   the   present\r\n\r\nConstitution,  it is vested in the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara. In the old Constitution, the Governor could\r\n\r\nconsult  the Council of Ministers if he wished  to.\r\n\r\nIf  he  did not wish to, he need not consult  them.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  he consulted the Council of Ministers,  he\r\n\r\ncould disregard the advice given by them. Under the\r\n\r\npresent  Constitution, the  power  of  remitting  a\r\n\r\nsentence is still vested in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncounterpart of the Governor, that is, the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara; and under the present Constitution\r\n\r\nhe must consult the Cabinet on all matters, even in\r\n\r\nmatters  which are left to be decided in  his  sole\r\n\r\ndiscretion. That is the position. So that today the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara would have to  consult  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  on petitions and requests of remission  of\r\n\r\nsentences.  So  that,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nsubmit  that as far as the Government is concerned,\r\n\r\nit has not done anything which can be considered to\r\n\r\nbe unconstitutional. I would say that as far as the\r\n\r\ncharge relates to my conduct in this matter, I  can\r\n\r\nassure    this    House   that   I    have    acted\r\n\r\nconstitutionally, and I have not at any  time  made\r\n\r\nmisleading  statements  to  the  Press  about  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the Government's\r\n\r\nalleged misuse of the Constitution or that  it  has\r\n\r\ngone  against  the Constitution, as stated  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai, I feel that this is  not\r\n\r\nso,  because the Member for Geylang Serai certainly\r\n\r\nknows  the  Constitution very well,  and  also  the\r\n\r\npowers  and functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nin  a self-governing Singapore, as contained in the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council; and also\r\n\r\nbecause  he  was  one  of  the  Members  who   were\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  and who were signatories  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution   which   granted   Singapore    self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen and a representative of the people\r\n\r\nof  this country, it is my responsibility to say  a\r\n\r\nfew words - in the form of explanatory notes - to those\r\n\r\npeople who have been misled. It is essential for me\r\n\r\nto  emphasise here again, Mr Speaker, that I  rise\r\n\r\nto  speak not merely because of sentiment. Not only\r\n\r\ndo  I  oppose  the Opposition Members, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  representatives  who  have  moved  this\r\n\r\nmotion, but I also oppose the motion from the point\r\n\r\nof  view of our stand and discipline as far as they\r\n\r\nconcern the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I most certainly feel sorry for the Member for Geylang Serai who did not, in the first\r\n\r\ninstance,  make  a  thorough investigation  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion  which he has moved, to see whether  it  was\r\n\r\nmerely motivated by sentiment or for the purpose of\r\n\r\nwinning the support of the Muslim people, because I\r\n\r\nam  of the opinion that he and his colleagues might\r\n\r\nhave  the  impression that they are heroes  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  community without, however, thinking of  the\r\n\r\nconsequences that would result therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if certain U.M.N.O. leaders outside, for instance, the pro tem Chairman of the U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nEmergency Committee, Inche Abdul Hamid Bin  Allwie,\r\n\r\ndo    not   understand   the   substance   or   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation, or the definition of the  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)  Order  in  Council  concerning  the\r\n\r\npowers  and functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nor  the  powers of the Cabinet in the march towards\r\n\r\nself-government, I feel confident that they will be\r\n\r\ntaught  and guided by the Member for Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nhimself because, as I said just now, the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  knows better the  contents  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution   of  Singapore.  Unfortunately,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, what we had hoped for did not materialise.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the Member for Geylang Serai has seen fit\r\n\r\nto  mislead and confuse the issue which is  already\r\n\r\nconfused and very dreadful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen and a representative of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, I wish to see the unity of all races\r\n\r\nregardless  of religion, race, skin, etc, in  this\r\n\r\nisland  so that they can live in peace and harmony.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  the  Muslim people  particularly  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will not be misled, or blindly succumb to\r\n\r\nthe  propaganda  which is being spread  by  certain\r\n\r\nleaders who I can say are irresponsible leaders.  I\r\n\r\nfeel,  Mr Speaker, that there is no necessity  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law to dwell at length\r\n\r\non  the functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  or\r\n\r\nthe  powers  of  the  Cabinet, because  the  Member\r\n\r\nresponsible  is  with us, although  the  other  two\r\n\r\nMembers are in the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  I feel that the Member concerned will be in  a\r\n\r\nposition to advise his two other colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have heard just now from the Minister, the\r\n\r\nMinister  said that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  had\r\n\r\nreceived on 5th June, 1959, a petition in the  form\r\n\r\nof  a  letter  from the pro tem  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.   Emergency  Committee  in   the   English\r\n\r\nlanguage. The letter was read in translation, and I\r\n\r\nfeel  no comment on this is needed. But what I  can\r\n\r\nsay here is that the reply which was transmitted to\r\n\r\nthe  pro  tem  Chairman via  the  State  Advocate-General was completely distorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Speaker, the Member has no need\r\n\r\nto  move this motion. The Yang di-Pertuan Negara is\r\n\r\nthe  Head of State in Singapore. All State  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  are transmitted to him, before they  can  be\r\n\r\ndisposed of, must be discussed by the Cabinet,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet does not comprise one person,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen   suggested  in  the  motion  to   appoint   a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry to look into the conduct  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  But the Cabinet  consists  of  nine\r\n\r\nMinisters,    and   these   nine   Ministers    are\r\n\r\nresponsible - not  merely one Minister.  On  the  9th\r\n\r\nJune, the Minister received a letter from the Malay\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Union, and on the 6th July the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  was informed by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law that the letter was routed first  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs, then to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law, and finally to the Cabinet, and\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It is necessary that we\r\n\r\nhere  should study carefully the position  so  that\r\n\r\nthis  misunderstanding which has  arisen  will  not\r\n\r\noccur  again in the future. In my opinion,  such  a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  is  very  dangerous,  because  if\r\n\r\nmatters  get out of control, there will be communal\r\n\r\nconflict  or  riots,  as had occurred  in  December\r\n\r\n1950,  during  which  18 people  were  killed,  130\r\n\r\npeople  were  wounded,  72  cars  were  burnt,  and\r\n\r\nhundreds more cars were damaged. That was the  work\r\n\r\nof a handful of people but it resulted in bloodshed\r\n\r\nand the loss of hundreds of lives in Singapore.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time the people who were responsible for  all\r\n\r\nthis  disappeared.  Those  who  suffered  were  the\r\n\r\nordinary people. I hope this matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  recur  as by the time it  was  over  the\r\n\r\ninstigators  would already have fled to  Ceylon  or\r\n\r\nsome other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is important to me and to my colleagues on this side of the House, and I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  to  Tunku Abdul Rahman,  and  Dato  Abdul\r\n\r\nRazak too, for the sake of unity. However, I do not\r\n\r\nwish  to  go  further into this matter because  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the unity of the various races  is  of\r\n\r\nthe utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to revert to the motion. On the whole, I do not see where the Constitution has been\r\n\r\nmisused.  I  fail  to  see  the  reasons  for   the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Commission to investigate into the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  a  Minister of  this  Government.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why I say that I cannot understand is  that\r\n\r\nthe questions asked by the Member for Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nhave  been  replied to by the Minister for  Labour,\r\n\r\nand    it   is   clear   that   his   conduct   was\r\n\r\nconstitutional. My view on this matter is that this\r\n\r\nmotion was deliberately moved in order to challenge\r\n\r\nthe powers of the Government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I allowed the hon. Member to\r\n\r\ncontinue when he was becoming irrelevant.  But  now\r\n\r\nhe  is imputing improper motives to the Member  who\r\n\r\nmoved  the  motion,  and  that  of  course  is  not\r\n\r\npermitted under our Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I said earlier,\r\n\r\nwe have facts which show the role of the Cabinet in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  exchange of letters  sent  to  the\r\n\r\nChairman. The facts are true. But what is not  true\r\n\r\nis  the  means  of  disseminating  the  replies  to\r\n\r\nnewspaper reporters and to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  reason,  Mr Speaker, is that there  are  many\r\n\r\nsentences which were omitted merely to mislead  the\r\n\r\npublic,  particularly  the people  of  the  Islamic\r\n\r\nfaith,  because  this matter is one  in  which  the\r\n\r\nprisoners involved are serving sentence as a result\r\n\r\nof  religious feelings. I hope that the Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai, the mover of this motion, can in the\r\n\r\nfuture  be  on  the look-out so as to refrain  from\r\n\r\ncasting  aspersions.  We must  be  careful  in  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  our every-day affairs so as  to  avert\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding which is bound to occur and  which\r\n\r\nwill result in chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know how many Members will\r\n\r\nspeak.

It  is the normal process of  democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment. Why then the call for the setting up of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Commission?

The  official  U.M.N.O. policy   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  is to stamp out - excuse me, Sir - communal\r\n\r\nfeelings at whatever cost.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the motion which\r\n\r\nwas  moved by U.M.N.O. through its Members in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly today, I sincerely and honestly deny  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  an  ulterior motive which  will  lead  to\r\n\r\ncommunal  strife.  However, the  Government  should\r\n\r\ninvestigate  more  deeply  into  the  circumstances\r\n\r\nwhich  have  resulted  in the  motion  being  moved\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this motion is not carefully studied, I do not\r\n\r\ndeny  that  the  accusations levelled  against  us,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  U.M.N.O., of creating  racial  strife\r\n\r\nwould appear to be so. But frankly and sincerely  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  those  who  have  instructed  us  as\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. members,  who are guided  by  resolutions\r\n\r\nadopted by our organisation, will pursue the motion\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  acceptable to  the  Government  or\r\n\r\notherwise.  I  cannot accept the allegations  which\r\n\r\nhave been hurled by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  against my colleague,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai. They alleged that it was his  desire\r\n\r\nto  create  something which we  do  not  desire  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Whatever the P.A.P., the Government  in\r\n\r\npower,  may say, whether we directly wish to create\r\n\r\nsomething  which we do not wish to see,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish to speak about the feelings of the ra'ayat.  I\r\n\r\ndo not wish to create such an atmosphere because we\r\n\r\nknow  the hardships and difficulties of building  a\r\n\r\ncommunity. How can we destroy that community?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we do not have any ulterior motive. I personally support what has been said by one of\r\n\r\nthe  Members concerning the policy of U.M.N.O. not\r\n\r\nonly  in Malaya but also in Singapore - a policy  of\r\n\r\ncreating  harmony between the races. As members  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. in this Assembly, we are compelled to  act\r\n\r\non  the  instructions of our organisation. We  will\r\n\r\nnot hesitate to receive any clarification given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker,  we  in\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. are   still   in  doubt,   because   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  is not clear and explicit  concerning\r\n\r\nthe   articles   contained  in  the   exchange   of\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  received  by  U.M.N.O.   In   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, U.M.N.O. has to mention its doubt so\r\n\r\nthat  the  spirit  of  the  Constitution  which  we\r\n\r\ntogether support can be implemented without leaving\r\n\r\nbehind  the  basis  of  the Constitution  which  we\r\n\r\nsupport today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, we Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  are willing to accept the accusations  and\r\n\r\nallegations  hurled  against  us  in   good   grace\r\n\r\nbecause,  as I have explained clearly, the struggle\r\n\r\nis to help build a society; it is not our intention\r\n\r\nto  disrupt  it. Therefore, if the opinion  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is that U.M.N.O. has moved this  motion\r\n\r\nwith an improper motive because-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I think this is the main and fundamental\r\n\r\nissue.  The Member for Geylang Serai did not accuse\r\n\r\nbut  indirectly  stated that we  must  rectify  the\r\n\r\nmistakes  concerning the Constitution and  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. did not wish to uphold the Constitution\r\n\r\nit  was going against the Constitution. If this  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  allegation,  I  consider  it  then  as  an\r\n\r\naccusation, but I do not wish to dwell on  this  at\r\n\r\nlength. Charges and counter-charges will not end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Yang-.di-Pertuan Negara was\r\n\r\nexplicitly clarified by the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw  at  length. Regarding the reply  sent  by  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General to the protem  Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency  Committee of Singapore's  U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nthe  position was also explained in detail. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  all the doubts in the minds of the Opposition\r\n\r\nshould  be  cleared.  The  Opposition  related  the\r\n\r\nhistory of the Singapore riots which were connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  motion moved today. The Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands stated that he did  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nreopen  the  wound of 1950, and that  he  hoped  it\r\n\r\nwould be healed. But I am surprised that indirectly\r\n\r\nthe Opposition have brought out a sharp knife. This\r\n\r\nwill  only  serve to confuse the people. This  will\r\n\r\nonly  lead  to a new wound; it will not remove  the\r\n\r\nold scar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, fortunately, the persons connected with the motion are in the wrong, otherwise we will\r\n\r\nbe discussing the rights of the Malays. If we study\r\n\r\ncarefully  the  speech of the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan,  which was supported by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nthe   Southern  Islands,  the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  stated that he had moved the  motion  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of Singapore's U.M.N.O., and the Member  for\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands said that he was compelled  to\r\n\r\nsupport the motion to comply with instructions from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  This clearly shows that this  motion  was\r\n\r\ndeliberately moved whilst the mover of  the  motion\r\n\r\nhimself was undecided as to whether to move  it  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Kampong Kembangan stated that U.M.N.O.'s representatives in this\r\n\r\nHouse  did  not  bring up this motion  to  stir  up\r\n\r\ncommunal feelings. On our side, we do not, in fact,\r\n\r\naccuse them of stirring up communal feelings but we\r\n\r\nwould    like   to   say   this   to   them.    Any\r\n\r\nmisinterpretation of the facts outside  this  House\r\n\r\nto  say  that this matter concerns the religion  of\r\n\r\nIslam, a Holy War of struggle, and so on, is  going\r\n\r\nto  cause us great concern. Therefore, this  matter\r\n\r\nshould not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotracted. If it is true that the Opposition  side\r\n\r\nwishes   to   seek   a  policy  based   on   mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between  the  Government   and   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  then  is there any necessity  to  move\r\n\r\nsuch a motion which is based on doubts or based  on\r\n\r\nwhat  they  term  \"the contents of the  letter  not\r\n\r\nbeing  explicit\"? Even a child can answer this.  If\r\n\r\nthey do not understand it, why do they not write  a\r\n\r\nletter  to  the State Advocate-General?  The  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  is  not working  for  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalone but he is also working for all the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  will  be able  to  explain  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning the powers and functions of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  Send  a  letter  first  and  make\r\n\r\nenquiries  before moving a motion.  But  here  with\r\n\r\nletters  \"the contents of which were not  explicit\"\r\n\r\nas  a  basis, a motion had been tabled and  then  a\r\n\r\nstatement was issued to the Press which appeared in\r\n\r\nbold  headlines. Mr Speaker, as a Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly and as a citizen of this country, in touch\r\n\r\nwith  all races on this island, I have been flooded\r\n\r\nwith  enquiries consequent upon the Press statement\r\n\r\nand   on  the  motion  which  was  tabled  by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and  which we are  debating  today.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we do not expect the Opposition  to  light\r\n\r\nthe fire but we know that it is dangerous to strike\r\n\r\na  light in a hot situation when there is dry  wood\r\n\r\nand oil around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government, in\r\n\r\nall  sincerity and honesty, I hope that motions  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature  will  not  be moved  in  future.  The\r\n\r\nOpposition  say that this motion is  not  based  on\r\n\r\ncommunal  issues or sentiments. The  fact  is  that\r\n\r\nthis  matter could have been resolved if  enquiries\r\n\r\nhad  been  made  to  the  proper  authorities.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I say there are two ways for an adult  to\r\n\r\ncry. One way is to wail with an appealing voice and\r\n\r\nthe  shedding of tears. The other way of crying  is\r\n\r\nto  cry  silently \"in the heart\".  I  think  crying\r\n\r\nsilently  in the heart is crying in the true  sense\r\n\r\nof  the  word.  But,  the  shedding  of  \"crocodile\r\n\r\ntears\",  shall we say, is merely designed  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of enlisting the moral support of  others.\r\n\r\nIf a child cries when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe loses his father, he will really loudly wail but\r\n\r\nat  the  same time he will also be thinking whether\r\n\r\nor not he will inherit his father's property. So  I\r\n\r\nfeel  this  motion, if studied carefully  and  with\r\n\r\nproper perspective, is based on uncertainty or lack\r\n\r\nof  understanding, as is obvious from the  speeches\r\n\r\nmade by the three Members of the Opposition. In the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  I feel today's sitting  has  wasted\r\n\r\nmuch  of  its time in discussing a matter which  is\r\n\r\nbased on doubts or lack of understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I welcome the speeches made by the Opposition to the effect that they are not based on\r\n\r\ncommunal  feelings or carried away  by  emotion.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the speeches as heard by all Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  will not only be heard in  this  Chamber\r\n\r\nbut also be put into practice outside this House so\r\n\r\nthat  the  unity  of the people of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole will be maintained in a good spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I oppose this motion vigorously because, in my opinion, apart from it\r\n\r\nbeing  based  on doubts as I said just  now  or  on\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  or lack of understanding,  if  we\r\n\r\nappoint a Commission to be presided over by a  High\r\n\r\nCourt  Judge  to  look  into  the  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  the  staff of the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  it  will take months; whereas in  fact  the\r\n\r\nmotion   is  only  based  on  doubts.  We,   as   a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary Government, want to progress-we  want\r\n\r\nto  work  more and talk less. We have  wasted  much\r\n\r\ntime  unnecessarily. Therefore, I think this motion\r\n\r\nis  inappropriate if we truly want justice. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  as I said just now, the  Malay  maxim\r\n\r\nsays: if it is not because of the ripening padi the\r\n\r\nweaver-bird  will  not bother to  nest  in  a  low-hanging branch. Therefore, to cut my speech  short,\r\n\r\nmy  stand  is that I oppose it vigorously.  On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  the arguments or the explanations  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion  did not come from me but from the  speeches\r\n\r\nof  the  three  Members who have  stated  that  the\r\n\r\nreplies  received  from  the  Advocate-General  are\r\n\r\nvague. Therefore, my opinion is that we should  not\r\n\r\nwaste  our  precious  time in discussing  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich is only based on doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, there have been two sittings of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  on  each occasion  the  Members  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai, Kampong Kembangan and the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  have  had the honour of  introducing  the\r\n\r\nonly motions to come from the Opposition. Strangely\r\n\r\nenough,  both  of  these motions  have  had  to  be\r\n\r\nprefaced  by  the  remark that  there  was  nothing\r\n\r\ncommunal about them; that on the contrary they were\r\n\r\nmotivated  by  the  object of  ensuring  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment   observe   the   provisions   of    the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  I  am told, Sir,  that  professional\r\n\r\nanti-Semites always profess that they  number  Jews\r\n\r\namong  their best friends and then proceed to  give\r\n\r\nexpression  to the anti-Semetic ideology.  Sir,  on\r\n\r\nthe  face  of it, the motion now before  the  House\r\n\r\nappears to be concerned only with the finer  points\r\n\r\nof  constitutional theory and practice. If that had\r\n\r\nbeen  the only concern, this matter would have been\r\n\r\nhappily  resolved by the Member for  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\ntaking his two bewildered colleagues quietly  to  a\r\n\r\nroom   and   explaining  the  real   constitutional\r\n\r\nposition. And I have every reason to believe,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Geylang Serai knows the correct\r\n\r\nanswer  to  the  constitutional  problems,  to  the\r\n\r\nquestions raised in this motion, since he was among\r\n\r\nthose  who went to London to help forge the present\r\n\r\nConstitution. I would hate to think, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member was party to something he did not quite\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Since he knew what  he  endorsed,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai must be aware that  there\r\n\r\nis  nothing unconstitutional in any Minister or the\r\n\r\nGovernment advising the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  not\r\n\r\nto  grant clemency to those sentenced in connection\r\n\r\nwith the riots in December 1950.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a constitutional expert myself, but I\r\n\r\nhad  no  difficulty in following the argument  that\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara even in regard  to  the\r\n\r\nRoyal prerogative of mercy acts in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  advice tendered by the Minister concerned;  in\r\n\r\nthis particular case, the advice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  given  by the Cabinet as a whole. I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure,  Sir, that the Member for Geylang Serai could\r\n\r\nhave  explained all this to his colleagues  outside\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber, perhaps in an atmosphere not  tinged\r\n\r\nwith high emotion. In fact, it should have been his\r\n\r\nduty  to  do  so, because his colleagues  were  not\r\n\r\nprivileged   like   him  to  participate   in   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional deliberations in London. Instead  he\r\n\r\nhas  allowed  them  to harbour the  most  fantastic\r\n\r\nnotions about the Constitution. At least, right  up\r\n\r\nto  the  present  moment, he has  allowed  them  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  the  belief that the  Government  has\r\n\r\narrogated powers that are rightly those of the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, I came here feeling that\r\n\r\nperhaps the Member for Geylang Serai had some finer\r\n\r\npoints  of the Constitution which he was  going  to\r\n\r\nexpound - to  confound, and to confuse  our  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and  Law. But, Sir, listening  to  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  from  the  Members opposite,  I  got  the\r\n\r\ndistinct  impression  that they  were  not  at  all\r\n\r\nparticularly   concerned  with  the   niceties   of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  law. Certainly the speeches  stated\r\n\r\nno   grave  doubts  as  to  any  breaches  of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution. All that the Member for Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nsaid  was that there were two letters, one of which\r\n\r\nwas  sent by the Minister for Labour and Law to him\r\n\r\nand  another which appeared in the papers, and that\r\n\r\nhe  found  great  difficulty in  reconciling  them.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this he now wants to  go  through  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of setting up a Commission to be  presided\r\n\r\nover  by  a  High Court Judge to decide on  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  issue - an issue which arose  simply  because\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Geylang Serai has made unnecessary\r\n\r\ndifficulties   for  himself  by   trying   not   to\r\n\r\nunderstand this very simple problem. In  fact,  one\r\n\r\nof the things about this motion is its curious wording. One of the terms of the Commission is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to report as to whether there has been\r\n\r\nunconstitutional conduct on the part of any and, if\r\n\r\nso, which Minister of Government...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>At least this implies that the mover of this motion\r\n\r\nis  only  interested  in ascertaining  whether  one\r\n\r\nparticular Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  guilty  of  a breach  of  constitutional\r\n\r\npractice.  Sir,  I  have been  wondering  why  this\r\n\r\nmotion  singles out one Minister of the Government,\r\n\r\ninstead of charging the Cabinet as a whole, or  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  a  whole, of  having  breached  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Those of us who have  followed  very\r\n\r\nclosely  the  controversy which led to this  motion\r\n\r\nwill  probably not be in doubt as to which Minister\r\n\r\nis  meant, which Minister is to be made the villain\r\n\r\nof the piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the only Minister who has had anything to\r\n\r\nsay  on the matter was the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw. In fact, statements in the Press have been  so\r\n\r\ncouched  as  to  concentrate  the  attacks  on  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law even when his  critics\r\n\r\nknew that whatever advice the Minister gave was the\r\n\r\ncollective  decision  of the Cabinet.  The  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  of  30th  July - it was quite clear  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law was going to  be  made\r\n\r\nthe  scapegoat. The heading reads - \"U.M.N.O. lashes\r\n\r\nat  Byrne - took Goode's Powers\". The report goes  on\r\n\r\nto say:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The pro tem chairman of Singapore U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nInche  Abdul  Hamid Bin Allwie, today claimed  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law, Mr K. M.  Byrne,\r\n\r\nhad `arrogated to himself some of the authority  of\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it necessary to single out one Minister\r\n\r\ninstead  of condemning the Government as  a  whole?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the movers of this motion, since they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  instructed to introduce this motion, are  not\r\n\r\naware of the association of ideas that could result\r\n\r\nfrom  such a motion. As you know, Sir, the  subject\r\n\r\nmatter  of  the  motion relates to  certain  Muslim\r\n\r\nprisoners who were convicted as a result  of  their\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  the riots of December  1950.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  the  whole affair was associated  with\r\n\r\nmembers of the Eurasian community. And now the same\r\n\r\ntactic  of  fixing the blame for  this  on  another\r\n\r\nEurasian  would certainly have serious consequences\r\n\r\nwhich  perhaps  the  Members who  have  moved  this\r\n\r\nmotion do not quite realise. And therefore, I would\r\n\r\nsay to the Members opposite that even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  they profess that any motion that they bring to\r\n\r\nthis  House has no communal or racial connotations,\r\n\r\nthey  must realise that people outside are  not  as\r\n\r\npolitically  sophisticated as they are,  and  might\r\n\r\nmake  other inferences from a motion of this  kind.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said earlier in my opening remarks, the  two\r\n\r\nmotions  that  have been brought  up  so  far  have\r\n\r\nrequired  prefatory remarks by the Members opposite\r\n\r\nthat  these  motions  have no  racial  or  communal\r\n\r\nconnotations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the constitutional position has been\r\n\r\nquite clearly stated by the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw.  I  am quite sure that the Member for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  if  he is genuinely interested  in  seeking\r\n\r\nclarification of the constitutional aspects of  the\r\n\r\nmatter,  should now be quite satisfied  that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been no breach of the Constitution; that there\r\n\r\nhas been no attempt to arrogate powers that rightly\r\n\r\nbelong to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. But if he  is\r\n\r\nnot  persuaded that there has been no breach of the\r\n\r\nConstitution, then I am afraid, Sir, since we  have\r\n\r\nanother  four years and ten months to go,  that  we\r\n\r\nshall  receive  other motions  which  will  require\r\n\r\nprefatory  remarks  by the Members  opposite,  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing communal about motions they  are\r\n\r\ngoing, to introduce, and that they are moving  them\r\n\r\nwith the highest of motives, probably motives which\r\n\r\nare  commendable, but which we, on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse,  will  continue to expose and  criticise  as\r\n\r\nbeing communal in character; and if they persist in\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of practice for another four years  and\r\n\r\nten  months, then we may land in precisely the kind\r\n\r\nof  political atmosphere and tragedy that  overtook\r\n\r\nmany other countries in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I was incredulous when  I  received\r\n\r\nnotice  of this motion which stands in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Geylang Serai, and others.

But  I  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  believe that he could have  appended\r\n\r\nhis  signature  to  the  Report  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitutional Talks in London in March 1957, which\r\n\r\nwas phrased in ordinary simple English. It was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  specific purpose of making it  impossible\r\n\r\nfor  anybody subsequently to deny that he  intended\r\n\r\nto  mean what he did sign. Let me read this to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai - paragraph 17, subparagraph\r\n\r\n(iv) of that Report of 1957, regarding the Head  of\r\n\r\nState, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Exercise of Responsibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara should be governed by Royal\r\n\r\nInstructions   which,  in  conjunction   with   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the Constitution Order  in  Council,\r\n\r\nwould  oblige the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to act  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the advice of his Ministers (except\r\n\r\ninsofar  as  is  otherwise  provided  for  in  this\r\n\r\nReport), save that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara would\r\n\r\nexercise   the   degree   of  personal   discretion\r\n\r\nordinarily reposed in the Queen's representative in\r\n\r\na fully independent member of the Commonwealth e.g.\r\n\r\nin relation to such constitutional functions as the\r\n\r\nappointment  and dismissal of a Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\ndissolution of the Legislative Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be more clear. The former Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   signed  it.  The  former  Deputy   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  signed it. In his own time - the first  and\r\n\r\nlast   they  ever  held  office  in  Singapore - they\r\n\r\ngazetted the Royal Instructions. They published  it\r\n\r\non  the 10th April, 1959. They expired on the - I  am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  on  which particular day the resignation\r\n\r\nwas put in, as required by constitutional form. But\r\n\r\nat  the time when it was published, this was  their\r\n\r\nReport.  The 10th of April - in the lifetime  of  the\r\n\r\nLim  Yew Hock regime - they issued Royal Instructions\r\n\r\nsetting  out  in  legalese  the  simple  words   of\r\n\r\nparagraph  17  (iv)  of the Report  of  the  London\r\n\r\nConstitutional Talks. Nothing could be more clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is also more clear - clear beyond a\r\n\r\nvestige of any doubt - is the purpose with which this\r\n\r\nmotion  has  been tabled. If the Member  was  moved\r\n\r\npurely by the desire to uphold the righteousness of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution and the rights of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, let me point out the simple  remedy\r\n\r\nthat  he has got. Take an action in the High Court,\r\n\r\nand get whichever Minister he believes to be acting\r\n\r\nultra  vires the Constitution properly dealt  with.\r\n\r\nHe  knows that. He went to London and, according to\r\n\r\nwhat he told his constituency, he consulted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlawyers before he signed this Report. I was glad he\r\n\r\nsaid   that,  because  then  he  absolved  me  from\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for anything which otherwise  might\r\n\r\nrest  on  my  shoulders as the only lawyer  in  the\r\n\r\ndelegation. What does he seek to do in this motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of a solicitous enquiry as to the\r\n\r\npropriety of ministerial action and the conduct  of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  and  members  of  his\r\n\r\nstaff,  he  added in the operative  words  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...appeal of U.M.N.O. for the release of\r\n\r\nMuslim  prisoners sentenced in connection with  the\r\n\r\nriots of December 1950...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is really the meat of the motion. If\r\n\r\none   cannot  sustain  political  leadership   with\r\n\r\npolitical sagacity, then at least one should try to\r\n\r\nget   mob   support  on  the  basis   of   communal\r\n\r\nprejudices,   religious  automatic  reflexes,   and\r\n\r\nperhaps, a Commission of Inquiry. This, despite all\r\n\r\nthe ruination that was brought upon him as a result\r\n\r\ntwo  Commissions of Inquiry - one bullet  ricochetted\r\n\r\nfrom Chew Swee Kee to one Kartini binte Haji Mulok,\r\n\r\nand the other-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must stop all these\r\n\r\nirrelevancies. I think the Prime Minister ought not\r\n\r\nto be guilty of irrelevancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with great\r\n\r\nrespect, far from being irrelevant, I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Member for Geylang Serai that  there\r\n\r\nare  three alternative courses open to us  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of  the  House. I do not know how  this  will\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the decorum with which you  require\r\n\r\nus  to  conduct debates in this House, or with  the\r\n\r\nrules   as  laid  down  in  the  Standing   Orders.\r\n\r\nDepending  upon the contingencies, we  could  amend\r\n\r\nthis motion, for instance, to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this Assembly calls upon the Government to\r\n\r\nappoint a Commission, to be presided over by a High\r\n\r\nCourt   Judge,  with  powers  to  call   upon   any\r\n\r\nMinister....\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is a very strange thing. Sir, the last\r\n\r\ntime  we had a Commission of Inquiry over the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, we subpoenaed a Minister. And just  before\r\n\r\nhe  was  to appear - there was an argument whether  a\r\n\r\nMinister could or could not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  subpoenaed - the  Inquiry  came  to  a  premature\r\n\r\nadjournment. We could change that to \"call upon any\r\n\r\nMinister  or ex-Ministers and Members of the  staff\r\n\r\nof  the  Governor to give evidence\".  Or  we  could\r\n\r\ncause  such a Commission to be appointed,  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of ascertaining the circumstances in which\r\n\r\neither   an  ex-Minister  or  a  present   Minister\r\n\r\ncommitted  perjury  in  a  particular  High   Court\r\n\r\nmotion.  We  could turn this Commission of  Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto   a  Commission  to  inquire  into  much  more\r\n\r\nfruitful  and much more dubious affairs  that  took\r\n\r\nplace   in  the  management  of  the  business   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  this country.  As  far  as  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, this motion is a piece of impertinence-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am very sorry to have to\r\n\r\npull  up the Prime Minister who should give a  lead\r\n\r\nhimself  on being parliamentary.

The Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour   and  Law  stated - and  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  also  said - that I did not  know  what  was\r\n\r\ncontained in the Constitution and what had occurred\r\n\r\nin  London  when  I went with the Merdeka  mission.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  should explain, Mr Speaker, that  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  I  have explained as explicitly as possible\r\n\r\nthat the Yang di-Pertuan Negara can take the advice\r\n\r\nof  anyone, whether it be from the Cabinet or  from\r\n\r\nthe Minister. This is contained in the Constitution\r\n\r\nand   was  also  minuted  in  London,  and  we  had\r\n\r\nconfirmed  the  minutes. Therefore,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara can make his own decision on matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to the granting of pardons after  receipt\r\n\r\nof  advice from the Cabinet. I do not deny this. As\r\n\r\nI    have    explained   earlier,   that    is    a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  on the part of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is why the letter from the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and Law did not state that the  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  received instructions from the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara to convey his decision in full?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Press statement, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  said  that  the  statement   from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. printed in the newspaper stated that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself had regretted that he was  unable\r\n\r\nto  grant  further clemency in respect of the  five\r\n\r\nMuslim  prisoners still under detention. Concerning\r\n\r\nthe  U.M.  N.O. statement in the Straits  Times,  I\r\n\r\nwould explain that it was issued by the Chairman of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.,  Singapore,  at a Press  conference.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately the Straits Times only mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law had regretted that\r\n\r\nhe was unable to accept the petition from U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nwhereas the Chinese newspaper, the Sin Chew Jit Poh\r\n\r\nitself gave a clear and explicit explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nstated  that we from U.M.N.O. had moved two motions\r\n\r\nsince   coming   into   this  new   Assembly,   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately, he stated that on each occasion when\r\n\r\nwe  moved a motion we had prefaced our speeches  by\r\n\r\nsaying   that   our   motions   had   no   communal\r\n\r\nconnotations. The reason why we from U.M.N.O. were\r\n\r\nobliged  to  do that is because since we  are  from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. we are always accused by other Parties who\r\n\r\nallege  that  we  are a communal  party,  that  our\r\n\r\nattitudes are always communal, and that our aim  is\r\n\r\nmerely  to create racial strife. For these  reasons\r\n\r\nwe,  from  U.M.N.O., are compelled to  preface  our\r\n\r\nmotions in such terms; but not because we feel that\r\n\r\nwe are a communal organisation, because U.M.N.O. is\r\n\r\nnot   a   communal   party  but   is   a   national\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, although we have received\r\n\r\nthreats   from   the  Government  side - threats   or\r\n\r\nphraseology  which, in my opinion,  should  not  be\r\n\r\nused here and which are irrelevant - I feel sure that\r\n\r\nwith the motion before us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin this House, we can together, both the Government\r\n\r\nand  the Opposition, safeguard the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 3; Noes, 39;\r\n\r\nAbstentions, 4; Absent, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n           Ayes.
