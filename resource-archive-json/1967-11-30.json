Eight  years\r\n\r\nago,  on  the  3rd  of  December,  1959,  he   was\r\n\r\nappointed  by the British Sovereign to the  office\r\n\r\nof  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara under  the  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, for a  term\r\n\r\nof   four  years.  He  took  over  from  the  last\r\n\r\nGovernor,  Sir  William Goode,  who  was  for  six\r\n\r\nmonths  the  first Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  Inche\r\n\r\nYusof  was,  then, the personal representative  of\r\n\r\nthe  British Queen. His term of office as Yang di-Pertuan  Negara of self-governing Singapore  would\r\n\r\nhave expired on the 2nd of December, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the 16th September, 1963, two and a\r\n\r\nhalf  months  before the expiration of  his  first\r\n\r\nterm  of  office, Singapore became  a  constituent\r\n\r\nState  of  the  new  Federation  of  Malaysia.  By\r\n\r\nArticle 95 (1) of the Constitution of the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   his  appointment  under  the   former\r\n\r\nConstitution was extended by one day.  And  so  it\r\n\r\nwas that on the 4th of December, 1963, the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong of the Federation of  Malaysia,  on\r\n\r\nthe  advice  of  the  Singapore State  Government,\r\n\r\nappointed  Tun  Yusof bin Ishak  to  be  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara of the State of Singapore, pursuant\r\n\r\nto  clause (1) of Article 1 of the Constitution of\r\n\r\nthe State of Singapore, for a term of four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the Separation Agreement on the 7th of\r\n\r\nAugust, 1965, which came into operation on the 9th\r\n\r\nof  August,  1965, and the subsequent Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Independence Act (No. 9 of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1965) and the Constitution (Amendment) Act (No.  8\r\n\r\nof  1965) passed in December 1965, Inche Yusof bin\r\n\r\nIshak  became, retrospective as from  the  9th  of\r\n\r\nAugust,  1965, the first President of the Republic\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His present appointment, according to these\r\n\r\ntransitory provisions, ends on the 3rd of December - in three days' time. Today under Article 1 of the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of Singapore, I am inviting  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House to elect Inche Yusof bin Ishak  for\r\n\r\nhis  third term as Head of State and President  of\r\n\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast constitutional changes in the last eight\r\n\r\nand a half years since the 3rd of June. 1959, when\r\n\r\nwe  first  took  office, reflected  the  momentous\r\n\r\nchanges  that were taking place in and around  us.\r\n\r\nIn  1959  he represented Queen Elizabeth II.  Then\r\n\r\nfrom  1963  to 1965, for less than two  years,  he\r\n\r\nrepresented  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Agong.  Now  he\r\n\r\nsimply   represents  us,  the  citizens   of   the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yusof and his wife, Puan Noor Aishah, have\r\n\r\ngraced   the  Istana  for  eight  years.  He   has\r\n\r\ndischarged his constitutional duties with devotion\r\n\r\nand dignity and has won the respect and confidence\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  With his wife,  they  have  been\r\n\r\npatrons  of  Singapore society, the arts,  sports,\r\n\r\nthe  numerous charities of our expanding  society.\r\n\r\nThe  burden of these duties was undertaken by them\r\n\r\nwith  natural  grace. Eight years  ago  Puan  Noor\r\n\r\nAishah  did not speak any English. Now she  speaks\r\n\r\nit  easily. The willingness to learn, the keenness\r\n\r\nof Singapore and her people - a striving, thrusting\r\n\r\nsociety - are personified in the President and  his\r\n\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it comes so naturally that one finds it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to recall what it was eight  years  ago - the  stiffness and diffidence they must have  had\r\n\r\nto overcome to fulfil their constitutional, social\r\n\r\nand  ceremonial duties that now come easily. As  a\r\n\r\nconsequence, Singapore has benefitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have every confidence, Sir, in commending him\r\n\r\nto  this  House  for  a third term  that  he  will\r\n\r\nexecute  the  duties of his high office  with  the\r\n\r\nsame  dignity, willingness, and cheerfulness  with\r\n\r\nwhich he first undertook them eight years ago. And\r\n\r\nthere  is the added aplomb, the savoir faire which\r\n\r\neight years as Head of State, informed on all  the\r\n\r\nmatters and the crucial issues which have affected\r\n\r\nour  lives and fortunes, have given him. Nor would\r\n\r\nI be accused of flattery if I were to suggest that\r\n\r\nit  would not be easy to find another citizen  and\r\n\r\nhis  wife to carry out their duties with the  same\r\n\r\npoise and graciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, through all the vicissitudes of\r\n\r\nfate  and  fortune of the last eight  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears  - and the House will remember how  grim  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  were from crisis  to  crisis  - with\r\n\r\nnotable exceptions, the majority of P.A.P, members\r\n\r\nheld  together as a tightly-knit and stout-hearted\r\n\r\nteam,  so  enabling my colleagues and me to  steer\r\n\r\nour  way  forward  and  to  ride  the  stormy  and\r\n\r\nturbulent seas of change and revolution in  South-east Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be immodest if I were to compare the\r\n\r\nRepublic   of   Singapore  and   the   President's\r\n\r\nGovernment to a sturdy ship and its toughened  and\r\n\r\nsomewhat  weather-beaten crew. Together they  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  completed many voyages through  calm\r\n\r\nand  troubled waters in fair and foul weather. And\r\n\r\nSingapore takes it for granted that this crew will\r\n\r\nsteer  their  ship  into the seas  of  the  future\r\n\r\nconfident that it will weather any storm  that  it\r\n\r\nmay encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I would not be thought too jocular if\r\n\r\nI  were to compare, by way of broad analogy, quite\r\n\r\na   number   of  my  colleagues,  the  President's\r\n\r\nMinisters, to professional Chinese chess  players.\r\n\r\nWe  can  still see them in \"Ta Po\", or \"big city\",\r\n\r\nor  the  South  Bridge Road  area.  They  offer  a\r\n\r\ncontender  three-to-one  odds  on  any  one  of  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of over half a dozen set chess positions.\r\n\r\nThe  contender  can  choose to play  either  side,\r\n\r\nblack  or  white. Very seldom does  any  contender\r\n\r\nmake the experienced hand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlose  on his stakes. It is not altogether in  jest\r\n\r\nthat I heard it said of some of my colleagues that\r\n\r\nthey could easily turn chess professionals if they\r\n\r\nchose to give up their portfolios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are very few fundamentally new moves\r\n\r\nby  colonialists, Communists or communalists which\r\n\r\nwe  have not in turn encountered and checkmated in\r\n\r\nthe   past.   Every   ploy,  each   feint,   every\r\n\r\ndistraction,  either for internal or international\r\n\r\nconsumption,  we  have watched, studied,  parried,\r\n\r\nand  been ready to counter the real blow which was\r\n\r\nto be delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time we must all be constantly\r\n\r\nalive to the dangers of being the same persons too\r\n\r\nlong  in the same office. We are all creatures  of\r\n\r\nhabit,  and the creative and imaginative parts  in\r\n\r\nthe  human being are stifled by the repetition  of\r\n\r\nthe same thought or speech patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, as a government, we shall be\r\n\r\njudged  not  just by our own performance,  but  by\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have provided for continuity  in  the\r\n\r\nquality and the verve of political leadership  for\r\n\r\nour  society.  It  was said of a much-loved  Asian\r\n\r\nprime minister that he was so long in office  that\r\n\r\nwhen  he  died,  it was as if a  banyan  tree  had\r\n\r\nfallen  and  no young sapling, ready to  take  its\r\n\r\nplace, was growing under or around him - so complete\r\n\r\nwas  his dominance and that of his generation over\r\n\r\ntheir whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Younger talent there is and always will be. And\r\n\r\nwe   must  pass  on  to  that  young  talent   the\r\n\r\nknowledge,  the  know-how, the  tried  and  proven\r\n\r\nmethods  of  good government. Only  then  can  new\r\n\r\nability, dedication and sincerity of purpose  find\r\n\r\nexpression   and  relevance  in  the   necessarily\r\n\r\ndifferent  mood  of  a younger generation.  Whilst\r\n\r\nperhaps  for  the present, Singapore  may  not  do\r\n\r\nbetter for itself by electing some other team, the\r\n\r\nsame  need  not  be said for the middle  '70s  and\r\n\r\nbeyond. For it will be a very different world. And\r\n\r\nit may require a different style to carry off with\r\n\r\ngood  grace  and  sustained strength  a  different\r\n\r\nposture and a revised and up-to-date  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nset  of  political, economic  and  social\r\n\r\npolicies   which   the  continued   survival   and\r\n\r\nincreasing prosperity of our multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nmay require of its leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whilst we congratulate ourselves on the\r\n\r\nrelative  certainty and stability with  which  our\r\n\r\naffairs are being managed, let us always have  our\r\n\r\neye  further  over the horizon - towards  that  day\r\n\r\nwhen  another team of good men and women will take\r\n\r\nour  places.  It is amongst these  young  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen of disciplined talent and ability, with  the\r\n\r\nfreshness,  enthusiasm  and  idealism  with  which\r\n\r\nevery  new  generation brings to its task  - people\r\n\r\nnow  in  their `20s and early `30s - that  we  must\r\n\r\nseek  the possible leaders of a robust and  rugged\r\n\r\ngeneration. It is not in the nature of things,  in\r\n\r\nan  open  competitive society  such  as  ours,  to\r\n\r\nnominate  one's heirs and successors.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nwithin  our  capacity to ensure that  long  before\r\n\r\nthat time comes, there is available a whole cohort\r\n\r\nof  younger  people  who have  been  equipped  and\r\n\r\nsteeled for the tasks of political leadership.  To\r\n\r\nthem we should pass on the valuable experiences of\r\n\r\nthe  last  two decades, the esoteric knowledge  of\r\n\r\nmen  and the affairs of men, the insight which  we\r\n\r\nhave  gained in this strange corner of Asia  - whom\r\n\r\nand  what  to  trust, and what are just  words  of\r\n\r\nkindness  and comfort, the civilities of form  and\r\n\r\nprotocol, with little or no content. In so far  as\r\n\r\nit  is humanly possible, we must ensure that there\r\n\r\nwill be enough trained ability for a team that can\r\n\r\ngive  Singapore  that pride in  achievement  which\r\n\r\nability,  dedication and sincerity, combined  with\r\n\r\niron will, can give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with these sobering\r\n\r\nthoughts of our wider responsibilities that I  ask\r\n\r\nhon.

Heads of State\r\n\r\ncome   into   being  in  many  ways  in  different\r\n\r\ncountries.   In  some  countries,  an   individual\r\n\r\nproclaims  himself a President  and  nobody  dares\r\n\r\ncontest  this  claim unless he has  a  bigger  and\r\n\r\nstronger army behind him. In other countries,  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of  a Head of State may be made solely  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of hereditary caste or race or religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, the Head of State is chosen by\r\n\r\ndemocratic  procedures and according to democratic\r\n\r\nprinciples.  The President, who  is  our  Head  of\r\n\r\nState,  is  chosen  by  the people  through  their\r\n\r\nelected  representatives in Parliament.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  he  is a popularly elected President.  The\r\n\r\nprinciples  governing  our  choice  are  that  any\r\n\r\ncitizen of Singapore, whether of high birth or  of\r\n\r\nhumble  origins,  can  be  elected  to  this  high\r\n\r\noffice. Further, in making our choice, we are  not\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  his religion or his  race.  He  is\r\n\r\nelected  solely  on the basis of  his  merit,  his\r\n\r\ncharacter, his devotion to duty and the esteem  in\r\n\r\nwhich he is held by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how we in Singapore choose our President\r\n\r\nand  this is how it should be in our multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural, democratic society.  A  President,\r\n\r\nas  Head  of  State,  is more than  a  symbol.  He\r\n\r\nshould,  both  in  his public  and  private  life,\r\n\r\nreflect  the values and virtues which our  society\r\n\r\ncherishes.  He should be dignified and modest.  He\r\n\r\nshould  not do things in private or in  public  of\r\n\r\nwhich we would be ashamed because, as the Head  of\r\n\r\nState, he symbolises Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, this Parliament is being called upon to\r\n\r\nelect  Inche Yusof bin Ishak as President  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  The  fact that this is the  third  time\r\n\r\nthat  Inche Yusof is being nominated for this high\r\n\r\noffice  is  testimony of his fitness to fill  this\r\n\r\nresponsible  office. He has  been  in  office  for\r\n\r\neight  years.  They were extremely  difficult  and\r\n\r\ndecisive eight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  involving  many delicate and  controversial\r\n\r\nissues.  A less cairn and less perceptive Head  of\r\n\r\nState could have tarnished an office which has  to\r\n\r\nstand above the dust and din of party and partisan\r\n\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yusof has managed to preserve his office from the taint of partisanship. He has always remained the Head of the nation as a whole - not the representative of any particular community, race, class or religion. As the constitutional Head, he has performed his functions strictly in\r\n\r\naccord   with  the  letter  and  spirit   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though as a Malay I am gratified that a member of\r\n\r\nmy community is being nominated for the third time\r\n\r\nto   be  the  Head  of  our  Republic,  it  would,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, be unfair to Inche Yusof and even to\r\n\r\nmy  community to say that he has been nominated to\r\n\r\nthis  office simply because he is a Malay. I  find\r\n\r\ngreater  pride  in  the  fact  that  he  is  being\r\n\r\nnominated for no other reason than that we believe\r\n\r\nhim  to  be the Singaporean with all the qualities\r\n\r\nnecessary to hold this responsible office.  It  is\r\n\r\nhis  qualities as a man and a citizen of Singapore\r\n\r\nand nothing else which recommend him for this high\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, that this Parliament and the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should choose him as Head of State  for\r\n\r\nthe third time is also testimony to the unwavering\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  outlook of our  Parliament  and  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion by the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister for the election of Inche Yusof bin\r\n\r\nIshak  as  the  President of our  Republic.  As  a\r\n\r\nrelatively  new Member of Parliament, I  have  not\r\n\r\nhad  the privilege of knowing Inche Yusof as  well\r\n\r\nas  some  of  my other colleagues here. Therefore,\r\n\r\nlike  many  hundreds of thousands of  citizens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I must judge Inche Yusof's nomination\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the office of President largely by his public\r\n\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not propose to give a detailed\r\n\r\nbiography  of  Inche Yusof, but I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nselect some details to highlight one point -  that\r\n\r\nthe  President of a country should in his own life\r\n\r\nand  character reflect the history and  spirit  of\r\n\r\nthe people of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like most of us in Singapore - whether\r\n\r\nChinese,  Indian  or  Malay  - Inche  Yusof  is  of\r\n\r\nimmigrant  stock.  He  is  a  Malay  of   Sumatran\r\n\r\ndescent.  On the paternal side, he can  trace  his\r\n\r\nancestral stock to Minangkabau and on the maternal\r\n\r\nside  to Langkat. Inche Yusof himself was born  in\r\n\r\nPerak.  He  began  his  studies  in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nfinished  them  in Singapore where he  passed  his\r\n\r\nCambridge  School  Certificate  examination   with\r\n\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, Inche Yusof's story is not unlike that\r\n\r\nof  the  vast  majority of us  whose  fathers  and\r\n\r\nforefathers  emigrated  from  other  countries  to\r\n\r\nsettle  in  Singapore and make it their  permanent\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, like many of us, Incite Yusof comes\r\n\r\nfrom  a  humble  family. His father  was  a  civil\r\n\r\nservant who brought up his children in the  modest\r\n\r\ncircumstances  that most of us know.  A  President\r\n\r\nwith  these humble origins can therefore know  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  lives  and problems  of  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another aspect of his life which\r\n\r\naccords   with  the  spirit  which  built   modern\r\n\r\nSingapore and which will sustain Singapore in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Inche  Yusof relied not on  patronage  or\r\n\r\nprivileges of birth to build a respected place for\r\n\r\nhimself  in society. While in school, he  was  the\r\n\r\nfirst  student to he commissioned by the  Governor\r\n\r\nas a Second Lieutenant in the School Cadet Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving school, he ventured into Malay\r\n\r\njournalism at a time when Malay journalism was not\r\n\r\nnecessarily a sure road to wealth and success.  In\r\n\r\n1938,  he  established  (he  Utusan  Melayu  Press\r\n\r\nLimited  which he built up into the now well-known\r\n\r\nUtusan Melayu. He was its first managing editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Inche Yusof's life is not unlike that\r\n\r\nof  thousands  of other enterprising  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  succeeded because they dared to venture  into\r\n\r\nfields  which  the  more timid  and  unimaginative\r\n\r\ndared not go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yusof was not merely a pioneer in the field of Malay journalism. He held many distinguished public appointments long before he was made the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara. From 1948 to 1950, he was on the Film Appeal Committee. He has served on the Natural Reserves Committee and on the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission. He has also  served  as\r\n\r\nChairman of the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when in December 1959 Inche Yusof was\r\n\r\nappointed  as  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  it   was\r\n\r\nbecause he had amply demonstrated that he had  the\r\n\r\nqualities  and character necessary  to  hold  this\r\n\r\nresponsible   office.  If  he  has,  since   then,\r\n\r\ndischarged  his duties with dignity and  devotion,\r\n\r\nit  is  because he has brought to his  office  the\r\n\r\nspirit and character that built modern Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial society like ours, progress and\r\n\r\nprosperity  will be assured so long as  we  judge,\r\n\r\nhonour and reward its citizens purely on the basis\r\n\r\nof  merit,  character and contributions that  they\r\n\r\nmake  to  the welfare of society. We must  welcome\r\n\r\nand use talent from whatever linguistic, racial or\r\n\r\nreligious  groups it may come. We must not  stifle\r\n\r\nit or shut it out because it expresses itself in a\r\n\r\ndifferent  language  or is of  a  particular  skin\r\n\r\ncolour.  Talent  is  a  very precious  and  scarce\r\n\r\nquality,  and  a  society which shuts  it  out  on\r\n\r\nracial,  linguistic  or  religious  grounds   must\r\n\r\neventually  disintegrate  and  perish  under   the\r\n\r\nweight of fumbling mediocrities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in supporting the election of Inche Yusof bin\r\n\r\nIshak as Singapore's President for a further  term\r\n\r\nof  four years, I am supporting a Singaporean  who\r\n\r\nhas   demonstrated  that  he  has   the   relevant\r\n\r\nqualities to hold this high office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I would like to join my other colleagues  in\r\n\r\nsupporting the motion standing in the name of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. As the Prime Minister said,  this\r\n\r\nis  the  third time that Inche Yusof bin Ishak  is\r\n\r\nbeing  nominated as Head of State.  On  the  first\r\n\r\noccasion, he was appointed by the British Queen as\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara of an internally self-governing Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second occasion, he was appointed by the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Agong when  Singapore  became  a\r\n\r\nState within the Federation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now on the third occasion, his election as\r\n\r\nPresident  is to be effected by the Parliament  of\r\n\r\nan independent Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very strong reasons why Inche Yusof,\r\n\r\nwho  has served as Head of State for eight  years,\r\n\r\nshould  once again be nominated to hold this  high\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that a President and Head of\r\n\r\nState is merely a symbolical figure expected to do\r\n\r\nno  more  than  perform dreary ceremonial  chores.\r\n\r\nThis   may   be  so  in  terms  of  constitutional\r\n\r\nabstractions,  but  in the eyes  of  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople    who   do   not   understand    political\r\n\r\nabstractions, the Head of State is something  more\r\n\r\nthan a legal abstraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the State personified. The State cannot\r\n\r\nopen  a sports meet or a charity bazaar. But  when\r\n\r\nthe  President or his wife does these things,  the\r\n\r\nabstract concept of State is grasped in terms that\r\n\r\npeople can understand. The President and his  lady\r\n\r\nmake the State comprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, the character and personality of\r\n\r\nthe  President  and his wife are as  important  as\r\n\r\ntheir   ability  to  perform  ceremonial   rituals\r\n\r\ncorrectly.  Anybody  can  be  taught  to   perform\r\n\r\nceremonies of State and we should, on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   criterion,   have  no  difficulty   finding\r\n\r\ncandidates to fill this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people are not impressed simply because a\r\n\r\nPresident  has managed to cut a tape  properly  at\r\n\r\nsome opening ceremony. What is important is how he\r\n\r\ntalks  and  conducts himself with the  people  who\r\n\r\nhave invited him. Just as important is what people\r\n\r\nthink  of both his private and public life.  In  a\r\n\r\nway,  the  Head  of  State is what  every  citizen\r\n\r\nbelieves a model citizen should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his eight years in office, Inche Yusof and\r\n\r\nhis wife Puan Noor Aishah have managed to surround\r\n\r\nthe  office of the Head of State with  an  air  of\r\n\r\ndignity and simplicity. Inche Yusof, in so far  as\r\n\r\nhe  has  personified the State  for  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople,  has  enhanced the popular  image  of  the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat what some of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have said about Inche Yusof and of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why it is appropriate he should be elected\r\n\r\nas President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to mention two points. The\r\n\r\nfirst  relates  to  his refusal  to  surround  his\r\n\r\noffice  with flamboyance and pomposity.  A  lesser\r\n\r\nman  would have transformed himself into a larger-than-life  President. But Inche Yusof has  managed\r\n\r\nto  make the President no more than Citizen No.  1 - an  ordinary  citizen faithfully discharging  the\r\n\r\nduties he has been entrusted with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of this is his choice of residence. He\r\n\r\ncould  have chosen to stay in the palatial  Istana\r\n\r\nNegara.   However,  right  from  the   start,   he\r\n\r\nrequested that he be allowed to stay in  a  modest\r\n\r\nbungalow in the Istana grounds. The Istana  Negara\r\n\r\nhe  uses  only  to receive and house distinguished\r\n\r\nvisitors. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  small  point, but  it  does  show  his\r\n\r\napproach  to  the office he holds. He invests  the\r\n\r\noffice  of President with the necessary ceremonial\r\n\r\npomp, but not his person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to mention is that\r\n\r\nin  our multi-racial society where people are  all\r\n\r\ntoo ready to see communal favouritism, Inche Yusof\r\n\r\nhas  succeeded in making people accept him as  the\r\n\r\nsymbol  of  all  communities, races  and  classes.\r\n\r\nThough he is by accident of birth a Malay, nobody,\r\n\r\nas  far as I know, thinks of him as Malay Head  of\r\n\r\nState. He has been accepted by all communities  as\r\n\r\nSingapore's  President  or \"Our  President\".  This\r\n\r\nagain is due to his ingrained indifference to  the\r\n\r\nracial  and  religious origins of the  peoples  he\r\n\r\ncomes  into contact with. This is a very essential\r\n\r\nquality in our multi-racial society, especially at\r\n\r\nthis particular juncture of its history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, among other reasons, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nsupport the motion by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article\r\n\r\n1  of  the Constitution of Singapore, elects Inche\r\n\r\nYusof  bin  Ishak as President of the Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  a further term of  four  years  to\r\n\r\ncommence  immediately  after  the  expiry  of  his\r\n\r\npresent term of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn to\r\n\r\nTuesday,  5th  December,  1967.\"  -[Dr  Toh  Chin\r\n\r\nChye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twelve minutes past Three o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Tuesday. 5th December,1967.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
