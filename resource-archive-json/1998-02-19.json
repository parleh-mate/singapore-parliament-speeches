Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Indonesia's economic prospects remain\r\n\r\ncloudy.  According to official Indonesian estimates, the  number\r\n\r\nof  unemployed  may rise to more than 8 million  in  1998.   The\r\n\r\ndrastic fall in the rupiah has pushed up the prices of food  and\r\n\r\nbasic necessities, making them unaffordable to many Indonesians.\r\n\r\nThis  has  triggered riots in towns in Java and  other  islands.\r\n\r\nProvision shops have been destroyed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian government has taken many steps to stabilise\r\n\r\nthe situation.  It committed itself in January to implementing a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  IMF  programme.   It  has  organised   Indonesian\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  discuss with lenders how to resolve  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  debt  problems, which the companies would  otherwise  be\r\n\r\nunable  to  repay.  Unfortunately, confidence has not  returned,\r\n\r\nand the exchange rate has not recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is now considering implementing a currency board\r\n\r\nsystem  in the hope that it will stabilise the rupiah.  The  IMF\r\n\r\nand  the World Bank have advised Indonesia that it does not  yet\r\n\r\nhave the preconditions to do so.  The markets are waiting to see\r\n\r\nwhat Indonesia will decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMF, the World Bank, and many countries, including the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  Japan and Australia, have been  discussing  how\r\n\r\nthey  can  help  Indonesia  along  its  difficult  path  towards\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery, and alleviate the hardship and  social  pain\r\n\r\nthe crisis is causing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will continue to help Indonesia within the limits\r\n\r\nof  our ability.  We are working with Indonesia's friends in the\r\n\r\nregion  and  worldwide.  Our US$5 billion loan arrangement  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  still stands.  The loan is structured  as  a  back-up\r\n\r\ncredit, to supplement the IMF programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also helped to work out a guarantee scheme for\r\n\r\nIndonesian  imports.   The  currency  crisis  in  Indonesia  has\r\n\r\nsubstantially increased the risks of financing Indonesian trade.\r\n\r\nMajor  foreign banks will no longer provide trade financing  for\r\n\r\nIndonesian   firms.   It  has  become  almost   impossible   for\r\n\r\nIndonesian firms to import essential goods, or raw materials and\r\n\r\ncomponents for their export industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed guarantee facility is to give confidence to\r\n\r\nforeign  banks to accept letters of credit of Indonesian  banks.\r\n\r\nUnder the scheme, central banks from a number of countries  will\r\n\r\njointly counter-guarantee the guarantees made by Bank Indonesia,\r\n\r\nwhich  is Indonesia's Central Bank, on letters of credit  opened\r\n\r\nby  trade  financing  banks.  The participating  countries  will\r\n\r\ncover only sovereign risk, and not commercial risk.  It will  be\r\n\r\na  scheme  to assure the foreign banks that Bank Indonesia  will\r\n\r\nhonour its own guarantees.  All corporate risks will continue to\r\n\r\nbe  the  responsibility  of the foreign banks  themselves.   The\r\n\r\nscheme will operate for at most two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will pledge up to US$2 billion towards the guarantee\r\n\r\nfacility.  This amount will come from its existing commitment of\r\n\r\nUS$5  billion  for  the  second tier  IMF  credit  facility  for\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   No  additional funds need  to  be  committed.   Our\r\n\r\nexposure under the counter-guarantee will be proportional to our\r\n\r\ncontribution to the facility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still in discussions on the scheme with several\r\n\r\ncountries.   It will proceed only if enough countries  agree  to\r\n\r\nparticipate,  including the major G-7 countries.   The  IMF  and\r\n\r\nWorld Bank have to support the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-lateral trade guarantee scheme is not related to\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  proposal to use regional currencies  to  finance\r\n\r\nregional  trade.  The former, the trade guarantee scheme,  is  a\r\n\r\nshort-term  measure  to  overcome the unwillingness  of  foreign\r\n\r\nbanks  to  finance  trade  with  Indonesia.   The  latter,   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian proposal, attempts to address the longer-term issue of\r\n\r\nlimiting the exposure of trade to currency fluctuations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events in Indonesia will have a profound impact on the\r\n\r\nentire region.  They have been extensively reported and analysed\r\n\r\nin  the media.  Ministers have made many speeches explaining the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  its  significance for  Singapore.   Members  who\r\n\r\nfollow   the  media  reports  will  have  a  good  overview   of\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   When  Members  raise  specific  questions,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will provide the House with the information it has.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, in view  of\r\n\r\nIMF's  opposition to Indonesia's plan for a currency  board  and\r\n\r\nthreats  of  withdrawal of IMF funding should Indonesia  proceed\r\n\r\nwith the plan, would the Singapore Government similarly withdraw\r\n\r\nor  what  would  be  its position on the US$5  billion  stand-by\r\n\r\ncredit to Indonesia?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the US$5 billion\r\n\r\nstand-by  credit is a second line credit.  As has been explained\r\n\r\nin  this House by Dr Hu, it stands behind the IMF commitment and\r\n\r\nis conditional on Indonesia following an IMF programme.  It will\r\n\r\nonly  be  drawn down, first, if Bank Indonesia exhausts its  own\r\n\r\nreserves  and,  second, if Indonesia then draws  upon  the  IMF-provided  line of credit, which is about US$20 billion,  and  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  still insufficient, then we are really third in  line.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  conditional on the IMF programme and  therefore  the\r\n\r\nsituation envisaged by the Member is unlikely to arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nsovereign  guarantee  of Indonesian exports  is  a  last  resort\r\n\r\nguarantee.  How is this limited only to sovereign risks?   Maybe\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister will like to explain a little more  on\r\n\r\nhow  this is limited to sovereign risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The scheme is like this. If an\r\n\r\nIndonesian  company  wants to import something,  raw  materials,\r\n\r\nfood, it goes to an Indonesian bank and gets a letter of credit.\r\n\r\nNormally,  that would be sufficient for it to do business.   But\r\n\r\nunder  present  circumstances, many foreign banks are  uncertain\r\n\r\nabout the credit status of Indonesian banks and will not accept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  letter  of  credit.   So they take  this  letter  to  Bank\r\n\r\nIndonesia, the Indonesian Central Bank, and get the Central Bank\r\n\r\nto  reconfirm it.  That means the Central Bank will  answer  for\r\n\r\nthe letter of credit.  Under normal circumstances, that would be\r\n\r\nsufficient.  Because it is Bank Indonesia guaranteeing it and if\r\n\r\nBank  Indonesia says, \"No.  I can't pay\", then it  is  sovereign\r\n\r\nrisk if the country is in default, which is a very grave matter.\r\n\r\nBut  under  present  circumstances, even with  Bank  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nendorsement,  foreign banks are still reluctant  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nletter of credit and therefore the trade cannot flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is for this trade financing scheme to counter-guarantee the Indonesian Central Bank's guarantee so that if\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian Central Bank is unable to cover, then only  will\r\n\r\nit fall back on the other central banks.   In other words, it is\r\n\r\na  back-up  line.   But  it  has not proceeded.   As  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has said, it is still a concept because the  countries\r\n\r\nwho  might participate are waiting to see if Indonesia  proceeds\r\n\r\nwith  the  currency  board and whether there  will  still  be  a\r\n\r\ncentral bank to counter-guarantee the credits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> May I ask the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to confirm whether there has actually been a draw\r\n\r\ndown  as  yet on the US$5 billion.  If not, what is the schedule\r\n\r\nthat he expects it to happen?  Also, would there be pressure  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government, in case this US$5 billion is fully drawn  down,\r\n\r\nthat   they   need  to  consider  further  financing   for   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The US$5 billion has not been drawn\r\n\r\ndown  at  all.  The arrangement is that when Indonesia needs  to\r\n\r\ncall  on  the  loan, they will give us notice and draw  down  in\r\n\r\nreasonable  tranches, but they have not yet  done  so.   So  the\r\n\r\nsecond question on what happens if it runs out is hypothetical.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  ask  the Deputy Prime Minister to elaborate, in the light  of\r\n\r\nthe uncertainty about the economic crisis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia and the uncertainty related to the mechanism  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  applied, including the question of the currency  board\r\n\r\nand  IMF  package,  whether  there is  continuing  dialogue  and\r\n\r\nconsultation  between the Indonesian authorities  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nand,  if not, whether there is a need for a machinery to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  proper  understanding  between  our  offer  and\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We are in close contact with the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  government.

But  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment  has many preoccupations and the trade  guarantee  is\r\n\r\nonly one of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nDeputy   Prime  Minister  not  just  one  question,  but   three\r\n\r\nquestions.  First of all, I am not quite clear as to whether  he\r\n\r\nhas  stated  what is the Singapore Government's  stand  on  this\r\n\r\nproposal  to  set up a currency board.  What is the Government's\r\n\r\nview on it?  Does it support the proposal or does it oppose such\r\n\r\na set-up of a currency board?  May we know from the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister about that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, as I have understood it, this\r\n\r\nguarantee  is  to  be given by the central banks  of  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   In  Singapore, who would  that  be  in  giving  the\r\n\r\nguarantee?   Would  public funds be tied  up  in  any  guarantee\r\n\r\ngiven?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, has any decision been taken, if other countries\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  this  scheme, for  Singapore  to  give  such  a\r\n\r\nguarantee?    I  know  there  is  a  Question  on  whether   the\r\n\r\nPresident's approval will be sought.  May I know whether  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention  to  seek the approval of Parliament  before  any\r\n\r\nguarantee is given?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of\r\n\r\nwhether Indonesia should or should not have a currency board  is\r\n\r\none which is for the Indonesian government to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What are the Singapore Government's views?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We do not go round telling other\r\n\r\npeople how to run their country.  We are busy enough running our\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stated that there are certain\r\n\r\npreconditions which a currency board requires in order to have a\r\n\r\ngood  chance  of  success.   These have  been  reported  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.   You  must have adequate reserves,  there  must  be\r\n\r\nconfidence, your interest rates should not be too high  and  you\r\n\r\nmust  have  a strong banking system.  It is the state  of  these\r\n\r\npreconditions  which I think has caused the  IMF  to  have  some\r\n\r\nreservations  as to whether this is the right time  to  proceed.\r\n\r\nBut finally, these are sovereign judgments which the governments\r\n\r\nhave to make, and in this case, the government of Indonesia  has\r\n\r\nto make.  So we will have to wait and see what they decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the guarantee by the central bank, in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nMonetary Authority of Singapore is de facto the central bank and\r\n\r\nif  we  participate, the guarantee will be given by the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will these be public funds? Yes, of course, the Government\r\n\r\nhas no private funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we go to the President?

If not, the scheme will be unable\r\n\r\nto  proceed.   If  the  scheme can proceed and  other  countries\r\n\r\nagree,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  since  we  have  suggested it, I  think  there  is  a  good\r\n\r\nlikelihood that we will participate as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, there have been efforts by\r\n\r\na  private  sector led consortium to restructure debts  owed  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  banks by Indonesian companies.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister what is the progress and  status  of\r\n\r\nthis  and whether it is timely for the Singapore Government  and\r\n\r\nother governments in the region to play a more facilitating role\r\n\r\nto help solve this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> A private consortium to restructure\r\n\r\ndebts is a private consortium.  So it is up to them to work  out\r\n\r\nan  arrangement which is acceptable to both the lenders and  the\r\n\r\nborrowers  in order to turn over the debts and share the  burden\r\n\r\nof  any losses.  I do not know what the latest status is.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think they have resolved the problem yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government's role in this is limited, we hope the\r\n\r\ncountries whose institutions have lent large amounts of money to\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  like  Japan,  or  the  countries  which  have  major\r\n\r\ninfluence  on  the international financial system like  America,\r\n\r\nwill  exercise  their influence over their  bankers  to  play  a\r\n\r\nconstructive  role  and to get together to solve  this  problem,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  running  for the exit all  at  the  same  time  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  all  panicking  and getting  nothing  back.   We  can\r\n\r\nencourage them to do it, but it is for them to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that it is not easy for a debtor/creditor forum\r\n\r\nto  succeed in the case of Indonesia compared to Korea.  Because\r\n\r\nin  the case of Korea, a lot of the money are debts to the banks\r\n\r\nand  the  banks are relatively few and it is easy for the Korean\r\n\r\ngovernment to know who they are dealing with and which are sound\r\n\r\nand  which  are not sound, and where they can step in  and  give\r\n\r\nassurances.   In the case of Indonesia, a lot of the  debts  are\r\n\r\nnon-bank debts and here the range is much greater and there is a\r\n\r\nsevere  moral hazard if the Indonesian government  comes  in  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  this  is  a private company.   It  borrows  money.\r\n\r\nEvents have turned out adversely and the government will bail it\r\n\r\nout.\"   The Indonesian government has said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it will not do this and this makes it harder, and there are\r\n\r\nso many more parties.  So I do not foresee a quick resolution to\r\n\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsays  that Singapore does not tell other governments how to  run\r\n\r\ntheir  own  business.   I  hope that it  is  followed  by  other\r\n\r\nMinisters  as well.  But leaving that aside, I do not understand\r\n\r\nwhy  if  Singapore  is  going to help  Indonesia,  what  is  the\r\n\r\nsensitivity  or  the  reluctance to state Singapore's  views  on\r\n\r\nsomething  that Indonesia is planning to do?  It is not  telling\r\n\r\nthem how to run their country, but to give them our advice.  May\r\n\r\nwe know what Singapore's advice is?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Deputy Prime Minister says if it is the law,\r\n\r\nwe  will  come to Parliament.  May I ask him: what is  the  law?\r\n\r\nBecause we had an opinion from the Attorney-General when I asked\r\n\r\na question about the loan.

Their\r\n\r\nexposure  to  Indonesia was $5.4 billion or 2.3% of their  total\r\n\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total classified loans of the six local banking groups\r\n\r\nto  these five countries amounted to 5.7% which is $2 billion of\r\n\r\ntheir  loans  to these countries.  This figure is  based  on  an\r\n\r\nassessment by the banks' auditors in mid-January, taking account\r\n\r\nof  developments  up  to  that date.   It  is  higher  than  the\r\n\r\npreliminary  estimate  of  3.2%  which  was   $1.2  billion  for\r\n\r\nNovember  1997,  which  I provided in my previous  parliamentary\r\n\r\nanswer,  and it follows the comprehensive and updated review  of\r\n\r\nthe banks' portfolios by the auditors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total classified loans for the local banks, including\r\n\r\nboth  local  and overseas loans, were 2.6% of their  total  loan\r\n\r\nportfolios.  My previous figure was 2%.   As a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npercentage  of  their  total  global  assets,  this  was   2.3%.\r\n\r\nPerviously,  it  was  1.7%.  These figures  remain  well  within\r\n\r\ncomfortable limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks, in consultation with the MAS, have decided\r\n\r\nto  set  aside substantial provisions to cater to the  potential\r\n\r\nrisks  arising  from  their exposure to the regional  economies.\r\n\r\nThey   have  each  made  full  specific  provisions  for   their\r\n\r\nclassified  loans,  with  the  actual  provisions  depending  on\r\n\r\nwhether  the  loans are classified as sub-standard, doubtful  or\r\n\r\nbad.  They provide 10% for unsecured sub-standard loans, 50% for\r\n\r\ndoubtful  loans and 100% for bad loans.  In addition, the  banks\r\n\r\nhave  also  made general provisions on the performing  loans  in\r\n\r\ntheir  regional portfolios, over and above their normal  general\r\n\r\nprovisions.   These  exceptional general  provisions  are  of  a\r\n\r\nprecautionary nature, and may not eventually be used.  They will\r\n\r\nprovide a buffer against a possible further deterioration in the\r\n\r\nquality of their regional loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, the six banking groups will set aside $1.6\r\n\r\nbillion  from  their  1997 earnings in  regional,  specific  and\r\n\r\ngeneral provisions.  If we include provisions for regional loans\r\n\r\nthat  they  had set aside in earlier years, they will  have  set\r\n\r\naside $2 billion.  Most of this, which is $1.8 billion, consists\r\n\r\nof  provisions on loans to non-bank customers in the region,  or\r\n\r\nabout  8%  of such loans.  The provisions vary from  country  to\r\n\r\ncountry,  depending on the risks assessed by the banks  in  each\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these exceptional provisions for regional\r\n\r\nrisk,  the  six  local banking groups will report  significantly\r\n\r\nlower  earnings  in 1997 compared to 1996.  In aggregate,  their\r\n\r\nearnings  will  decline by about 30%, although some  banks  will\r\n\r\ndecline  by  more  than  others,  depending  on  their  regional\r\n\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all six banks are financially sound. They have\r\n\r\nstrong  capital positions, exceeding 12% of their  risk-weighted\r\n\r\nassets,  higher than most banks in other countries.   They  also\r\n\r\nsit   on  substantial  reserves.   These  comprise  the  general\r\n\r\nprovisions they have accumulated in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevious  years  as well as substantial assets valued  at  cost,\r\n\r\nwhich remain well below current market values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS is satisfied with the provisions that the local\r\n\r\nbanks  are  setting  aside in 1997 as part  of  prudent  banking\r\n\r\npractice.   By  recognising the potential  problems  early,  the\r\n\r\nbanks   will   be  well  prepared  to  cope  with  any   further\r\n\r\neventualities in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked about foreign financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  Foreign banks book their loans to the  region  in\r\n\r\nvarious  branches, not only in Singapore.  Their global exposure\r\n\r\nto  the  regional countries, as disclosed by their head offices,\r\n\r\nis more relevant than the exposure of their Singapore operations\r\n\r\nalone.

The  Committee  on  Singapore's  Competitiveness,\r\n\r\nchaired  by  Mr  Lee Yock Suan, has gathered feedback  from  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen on how they have been affected.  The impact has been\r\n\r\nmixed,  depending  on the company's customers  and  whether  its\r\n\r\ncosts  and  revenues  are  denominated in  regional  currencies,\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  or  US  dollar.  Those  with  export  markets\r\n\r\noutside the region have not been too badly affected.  But  those\r\n\r\nwho export to the region for local consumption have been hit  by\r\n\r\nthe weaker demand and the problem of debt collection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tightening of bank credit is inevitable at a time of\r\n\r\nuncertainty.   However, the MAS' figures show that overall  bank\r\n\r\nlending  to non-bank entities is still growing, not contracting.\r\n\r\nLoans  to  non-bank customers continued to increase,  from  $133\r\n\r\nbillion as at June 1997 to $139 billion as at September 1997  to\r\n\r\n$143  billion as at December 1997, although there have been some\r\n\r\nsigns  that new loans are decreasing now.  Interbank rates  have\r\n\r\nalso  been  declining in recent weeks, indicating an  easing  of\r\n\r\nliquidity.  After hitting a high of 14% in January, the  3-month\r\n\r\ninterbank rate is now back down to 6_%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that companies are concerned not just about the\r\n\r\ninterest  rate,  but also that banks may be pulling  back  loans\r\n\r\naltogether.    It  is  difficult  and  inappropriate   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  intervene in such cases.  These  are  commercial\r\n\r\nlending decisions, which the banks themselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to  take, because the banks, and not the Government,  will\r\n\r\nbear the consequences of the decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Yock Suan addressed this issue in his speech on\r\n\r\nChinese  New  Year's  Day at the Singapore  Chinese  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry.  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One issue which companies have highlighted to us is the\r\n\r\ntightening  of bank credit as a result of the currency  turmoil.\r\n\r\nThere  have been some calls for the Government to help companies\r\n\r\ntide over this credit squeeze.  We are examining how to help the\r\n\r\neconomy and companies through this difficult period.  There  are\r\n\r\nschemes  in  place such as the Local Enterprise Finance  Scheme,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Government joins the banks to extend credit to small\r\n\r\nand  medium  local  enterprises, and  share  the  credit  risks.\r\n\r\nCommercial  lending decisions by banks, both local and  foreign,\r\n\r\nmust  continue  to  be based on the banks' assessment  of  their\r\n\r\nrelationship and credit risks.  Banks will naturally take a long\r\n\r\nterm view of their customer relationships.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what the Government can do is to enhance the Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS).  We are studying this and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry will be explaining this later in\r\n\r\nhis  reply  to Mr Tay Beng Chuan, if we have time to  reach  the\r\n\r\nQuestion today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take the regional economic slowdown in our stride.\r\n\r\nThe   Government   will   continue   to   invest   in   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  to  build  up  our capabilities  and  productive\r\n\r\ncapacity.   Companies  too should use this opportunity  to  trim\r\n\r\ncosts,  restructure and upgrade productivity, so that  when  the\r\n\r\nregion  recovers and becomes more competitive, they will not  be\r\n\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime  Minister that  in  the  event  of  a  severe\r\n\r\nliquidity crunch for companies, especially the smaller ones  and\r\n\r\nthose which do not qualify under the various assistance schemes,\r\n\r\nwould the Government be prepared to deviate from its usual  non-interference   philosophy   and  persuade  banks   to   consider\r\n\r\nrestructuring  or rolling over some of the short  term  domestic\r\n\r\nloans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Firstly, on a macro point of view, the\r\n\r\ntightness  or  the  looseness of the monetary policy  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndetermined by whether or not we want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto help particular companies.  That is an overall parameter.  If\r\n\r\nyou  loosen the monetary policy, it impacts your exchange  rate.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot say you want your exchange rate to move one way  and\r\n\r\nyour monetary policy to move the other way.  Many countries have\r\n\r\ngot  into  trouble trying to do that.  So the tightness  of  the\r\n\r\nmonetary policy depends on market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for leaning on banks, on individual cases, even in\r\n\r\ndifficult  circumstances, I think this is not wise.   The  banks\r\n\r\nhave  to  judge the risks because they have to bear  the  risks.\r\n\r\nThey  know  the  customers, they know  the  history,  they  have\r\n\r\ncriteria which are good borrowers, which are doubtful borrowers,\r\n\r\nwhich  loans are good, which loans are doubtful, which are  sub-standard, which are loss.  What does the Government know,  which\r\n\r\nthe  bank does not, for us to be able to tell the bank, \"No, you\r\n\r\ndo  this.\"  Are we saying, \"You are wrong, this is a good  loan,\r\n\r\nmake it.\"  Or are we saying, \"You are right.  This is a doubtful\r\n\r\nloan,  but  make it anyway.\"  I think both put us in difficulty.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  we say it is a good loan, you may hit,  but  if  it\r\n\r\nturns  out not to be a good loan, MAS will be the first  one  on\r\n\r\ntheir back asking them to make provisions for the bad loan.   If\r\n\r\nwe  tell them that it is not very good, you make it anyway,  the\r\n\r\nbanks  too  have bottom lines to safeguard and have shareholders\r\n\r\nto  answer to.  And as I have explained, their profits are going\r\n\r\nto   be   down   30%  this  year.   Banks  are  not   charitable\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks and foreign banks will probably take different\r\n\r\nattitudes towards their relationships.  For some foreign  banks,\r\n\r\nit  is  known that they come in very quickly when the market  is\r\n\r\nup,  and there is good business to be done.  But when the market\r\n\r\nis  down  and  conditions look grimmer, they pull back,  perhaps\r\n\r\nbecause of orders from the head office.  But I do not think  all\r\n\r\nforeign  banks  are like that.  But it has been said  that  some\r\n\r\nare.  Assuming that it is so, everybody knows this, it is not  a\r\n\r\nnew  phenomenon,  it  has happened, we  have  been  through  the\r\n\r\nbusiness cycle of up and down every so many years, the last time\r\n\r\nin  1985,  anybody, who after knowing this, goes to a bank  like\r\n\r\nthat, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  a  favourable rate during good times, then  when  there  is\r\n\r\ndifficulty, he comes running back to a more tolerant  lender  to\r\n\r\nsay, \"No, I have just been chopped,  please help me.\"  These are\r\n\r\ncalculations which you have to make.  I believe that  the  banks\r\n\r\nwhich  have longer term stakes in the region, both foreign banks\r\n\r\nand  of  course the local banks, will take longer term views  of\r\n\r\ntheir relationship with their borrowers.  If you cut people  off\r\n\r\nlike that, you will gain a reputation which will not help you to\r\n\r\nget customers in the next upturn.  So they have to decide, and I\r\n\r\nthink that they will decide with a  longer term point of view in\r\n\r\nmind,  and if with that longer term point of view, they  decide,\r\n\r\n\"No,  this is not a loan which they can make\", I think  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  abide by their decision. We are not in a  position  to\r\n\r\nsecond guess that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have told the banks this. I have told the Government\r\n\r\nofficials  and  department  this.   We  will  help  within   our\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  We have the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme.   We\r\n\r\nare looking to see how we can perhaps adjust the terms and widen\r\n\r\nthe  eligibility conditions.  That is feasible.  But if you tell\r\n\r\nme,  \"I  am  a  very deserving case, and a very big  sob  story,\r\n\r\nplease  help\", I will first ask, \"I will introduce  you  to  the\r\n\r\nbank.  Come,  let us have a heart-to-heart talk.\"  If  it  works\r\n\r\nout, that is good.

If  and  when  we\r\n\r\nlearn  the  details  of such a proposal, we  will  evaluate  its\r\n\r\nbenefits and costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the first question is whether the Singapore dollar\r\n\r\nhas the pre-requisites for being used in this way.  Dr Augustine\r\n\r\nTan  published  a  lucid article in the Straits  Times  on  12th\r\n\r\nFebruary  1998,  in  which  he set out  quite  clearly  what  is\r\n\r\nrequired for a currency to play this role.  First, the  size  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  matters.  Second, there has to  be  a  substantial\r\n\r\namount  of the currency in international circulation.   On  both\r\n\r\ncounts,  the  Singapore  dollar does not  qualify.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nwithout  reason  that  the US dollar is  the  most  widely  used\r\n\r\ncurrency in international trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary reason the Singapore dollar has not become\r\n\r\ninternationalised is that there is no market demand for it.  Our\r\n\r\npolicy  against the extension of credit in Singapore dollars  to\r\n\r\nnon-residents   could   not  by  itself   have   prevented   the\r\n\r\ninternationalisation  of the Singapore dollar  in  the  face  of\r\n\r\nmarket demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic rationale for not encouraging the\r\n\r\ninternationalisation of the Singapore dollar remains valid.   If\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  dollar is widely held and used  internationally,\r\n\r\nour  influence over the exchange rate would diminish, making the\r\n\r\ncurrency  more vulnerable in a speculative attack,  even  though\r\n\r\nour  sound fundamentals make it unlikely that such attacks  will\r\n\r\neventually  succeed.   As a small and open  economy,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, within this framework, we are reviewing some of the\r\n\r\nspecific restrictions on the use of the Singapore dollar, with a\r\n\r\nview to making adjustments that can help to further develop  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector, particularly in the area of capital  markets.\r\n\r\nIn each case, we need to weigh the incremental risks to monetary\r\n\r\nand  exchange rate management against the potential benefits  of\r\n\r\nfurther liberalisation.  MAS is currently studying this issue as\r\n\r\npart  of  its  review of policies affecting the  development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a financial centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS OF SUB-COMMITTEE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ON BANKING AND FINANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Assessment)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  what  is his initial assessment on the recommendations\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Sub-Committee on Banking and Finance and  whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  plans  by  the Government to open  up  the  domestic\r\n\r\nbanking sector to competition as part of the overall strategy to\r\n\r\nstrengthen Singapore's financial sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government responded\r\n\r\nyesterday  to  the report by the Sub-Committee  on  Finance  and\r\n\r\nBanking.

In this regard, the Board can take into account factors\r\n\r\nsuch  as the sale price, relationship between buyer and majority\r\n\r\nowners,  and  distribution of the sale proceeds.  If  necessary,\r\n\r\nthe  Board  can  call for an independent valuation  report.

So if  you  put  the\r\n\r\nage  as  10 years, does he not think that it is a bit too early?\r\n\r\nBecause many of the developments below 10 years old are still in\r\n\r\nvery  good  condition.  Does he not think that maybe  20  to  30\r\n\r\nyears  would  be a much better age, before they are  subject  to\r\n\r\nthis law?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, essentially, the decision\r\n\r\nnow  is  left  to the owners.  Of course, partly it  is  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest, if older developments are  rejuvenated,  and\r\n\r\nenhanced plot ratios are realised.  But if the owners decide  in\r\n\r\na development that is less than 10 years old, they must get 90%.\r\n\r\nIf they decide to come together for community living, and after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall,   strata   title  living  is  community  living,   and   if\r\n\r\ncircumstances change, and a significant majority, 90% agree that\r\n\r\nthey  should  all sell to a developer who will then develop  the\r\n\r\nproperty, then I think we should make it possible for them to do\r\n\r\nso.  So we have taken age as this criterion: below 10 years,  10\r\n\r\nyears and above, because we feel that, as rightly pointed out by\r\n\r\nMr  Lew, for older developments you may have more owners who are\r\n\r\ninterested in selling.  If we peg the percentage for these older\r\n\r\ndevelopments too high and if it is not attained, then  a  larger\r\n\r\ngroup of owners' interest will be thwarted.  That is why we have\r\n\r\ndecided  that age will be the criterion and 10 years will  be  a\r\n\r\nreasonable time-frame for this distinction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State how many sales have been aborted  because  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  small minority?

So  the\r\n\r\ncurrent law really is a situation where there is tyranny of  the\r\n\r\nminority and for whatever reason, if one or two owners hold out,\r\n\r\nthen  the  rest of the owners' wishes to redevelop the  property\r\n\r\ncannot be realised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister of State, of these so-called instances which people have heard of, what are the\r\n\r\nreasons  which  the  property owners,  minority  interest,  have\r\n\r\nrefused to sell for commercial reasons?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think the reasons for\r\n\r\nholding out are very variable.  Some could be because of  price,\r\n\r\nsome could be because they have recently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrenovated their flats, and therefore they feel they should get a\r\n\r\nhigher  price.   Some might have bought the flat more  recently,\r\n\r\ncompared to the others who bought a long time ago, and therefore\r\n\r\nfeel  that,  based on the formula of distributing the  proceeds,\r\n\r\nthey ought to get a higher price.  Some may just want to live in\r\n\r\nthat  area for a longer time.  Some who are retirees may be very\r\n\r\nused to living in the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach is that we want to provide a mechanism so that\r\n\r\nthese concerns can be addressed.  But the way to address it,  at\r\n\r\nleast  the  best way that we feel we should take as an approach,\r\n\r\nis that the Strata Titles Board will look at objective criteria.\r\n\r\nBasically it will look at factors such as the sale price and the\r\n\r\nrelationship of the parties.  I think that is important  because\r\n\r\nwe  want  to prevent collusion and therefore ganging up  by  the\r\n\r\nmajority  on  the  minority  who may  be  in  cahoots  with  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper,  and also this question of distribution of  proceeds.\r\n\r\nThese  factors  will be taken into consideration by  the  Strata\r\n\r\nTitles  Board in deciding whether or not to intervene.

Section 3 of the present Act declares all Sundays and\r\n\r\npublic holidays as dies non, an old Latin expression meaning non-days  in law.  The present Act is substantially the same as  the\r\n\r\nHolidays  Ordinance  1876.   The  modern  application  of   this\r\n\r\nantiquated concept is unclear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legal effect of the present Act should be put\r\n\r\nbeyond  doubt.  The Government must be able to function  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes.   Hence,  official acts done even on a Sunday  or  public\r\n\r\nholiday  ought to be valid.  Our civil service is  committed  to\r\n\r\ngreater responsiveness to the needs of the public.  This will be\r\n\r\nfrustrated if, in law, no official acts can be validly done on a\r\n\r\nSunday  or  public  holiday,  even  if  public  departments  are\r\n\r\nprepared to open on these days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is constitutionally a secular state. To most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  today,  Sundays and public holidays  are  days  in\r\n\r\nwhich they can rest and relax without being compelled to work if\r\n\r\nthey  do  not want to.  They should not be days in which  people\r\n\r\nare  prevented by law from working or from entering into legally\r\n\r\nbinding  transactions if they want to.  Many  local  businesses,\r\n\r\nespecially   those  in  the  tourist  and  food   and   beverage\r\n\r\nindustries,  require  their offices and  shops  to  be  open  on\r\n\r\nSundays and public holidays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill therefore repeals the Holidays Act and re-enacts the law governing public holidays but without declaring\r\n\r\nSundays  and  public holidays as dies non.  The new law  instead\r\n\r\nmakes  clear  that  nothing done on a Sunday or  public  holiday\r\n\r\nshall be invalid by reason only that it is done on such a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Previous official acts and contracts</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any doubts and provide certainty, a validating\r\n\r\nprovision makes clear that past official acts and contracts done\r\n\r\non a Sunday or public holiday are not invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employer-employee arrangements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new law will not affect the provisions of the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act relating to shift work and rest days of  workers.\r\n\r\nEmployers and employees will still be free to agree to  holidays\r\n\r\nin  substitution of any public holiday declared  under  the  new\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also makes consequential amendments to a few\r\n\r\nother  written  laws  (namely, the Bills of  Exchange  Act,  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure Code, the Parliamentary Elections  Act,  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Elections Act, the Subordinate Courts Act  and  the\r\n\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature Act) to bring the provisions in line\r\n\r\nwith  the  new law and remove provisions made redundant  by  the\r\n\r\nchange.  In particular, amendments to the Subordinate Courts Act\r\n\r\nand the Supreme Court of Judicature Act will establish a uniform\r\n\r\nlegislative  scheme allowing the conduct of court  and  Registry\r\n\r\nbusiness on Sundays and public holidays when urgent matters have\r\n\r\nto  be  dealt with or the Chief Justice or Senior District Judge\r\n\r\nso directs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that this Bill will remove\r\n\r\nan anachronism in our law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only got a question\r\n\r\nnow  for  the  Minister  of State.

But what I wish to know\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister of State is: will this Bill affect the present\r\n\r\nprovisions as to the filing of documents in court and  the  time\r\n\r\nprescribed  under  these rules?  As the Minister  of  State  may\r\n\r\nprobably  be  aware that, under the rules, where the  number  of\r\n\r\ndays  is below a certain number, then the dies non do not count.\r\n\r\nMay I know whether it is intended to do away with all that now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have a question\r\n\r\nfirst.  It would appear that with this Bill, Sunday is no longer\r\n\r\na  sacred  day, ie, just like any other day.  What about  people\r\n\r\nwho  continue  their  building  construction  on  Sundays  in  a\r\n\r\nresidential neighbourhood?  This can be very disturbing  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  around there.  Is there any provision to prevent  people\r\n\r\nfrom   continuing  in  the  construction  of  their  houses   in\r\n\r\nresidential areas on Sundays?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my party recently suggested that an additional day be\r\n\r\nobserved as a public holiday to remind Singaporeans that we  are\r\n\r\na  multi-cultural society.  A multi-cultural society means  that\r\n\r\nwe   are   a  multi-racial,  multi-lingual  and  multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety.  Racial harmony is important in Singapore.  Yet, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  public  holiday  to remind  Singaporeans  of  this\r\n\r\nimportant  aspect  in our way of life.  We should  have  such  a\r\n\r\npublic  holiday.  This new public holiday could be called Multi-racial  Day  or Multi-cultural Day.  I think Multi-cultural  Day\r\n\r\nwould be a suitable name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can afford to have an additional day for a public\r\n\r\nholiday.   At the moment, we have 11 days set aside as statutory\r\n\r\npublic  holidays.  Should we have one more, the number of public\r\n\r\nholidays would be 12 a year.  This is not too many when compared\r\n\r\nto the public holidays of other countries.  I have looked up the\r\n\r\nnumber  of public holidays of 18 countries.  Australia  has  the\r\n\r\nlowest  number  of public holidays, at eight days  a  year,  and\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea  has the highest, at 20 days a year.   The  average\r\n\r\nnumber of public holidays per year of those 18 countries  is  13\r\n\r\ndays.  Should we increase the number of public holidays to 12  a\r\n\r\nyear, we would still have less number of public holidays a  year\r\n\r\nthan  the  average  number  of  public  holidays  in  those   18\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this suggestion is taken up, the additional public\r\n\r\nholiday  should be fixed in a month in the latter  half  of  the\r\n\r\nyear, because almost all our present public holidays are bunched\r\n\r\nup  in the first half of the year.  There are no public holidays\r\n\r\nin  the months of July, September, or November.  We could fix  a\r\n\r\nnew public holiday in one of those months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would give this proposal his\r\n\r\nserious  consideration and amend the Bill to  include  a  Multi-cultural Day as a public holiday.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me reply to Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.   I have checked this matter with the  courts.   The\r\n\r\nBill  will not change the current practice of the courts,  which\r\n\r\nwill remain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the suggestion by Mr Chiam to have\r\n\r\nanother  holiday  in Singapore.  I think all  of  us  want  more\r\n\r\nholidays.   But  the  point is whether we  ought  to  have  more\r\n\r\nholidays.  The specific suggestion he gives is to have a  Multi-cultural  or Multi-racial Day.  But really the point  is  multi-culturalism and racialism as concepts should be practised  every\r\n\r\nday  of the year by all Singaporeans, and not to have a day when\r\n\r\nwe  say,  \"Let  us  be reminded that we should  practise  racial\r\n\r\ntolerance or appreciation of each other's culture.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of course is, in Singapore, over time, even\r\n\r\nfor  different festivals, whether it is Lunar New Year  or  Hari\r\n\r\nRaya or even Deepavali, Singaporeans of all races now visit  one\r\n\r\nanother,  greet  one another and, in that sense,  reinforce  the\r\n\r\nconcepts  that  Mr  Chiam,  and I think  rightly  so,  says  are\r\n\r\nimportant.   And indeed, if you want to look at  one  day  which\r\n\r\nwould draw all Singaporeans together, that must be National  Day\r\n\r\nwhich reminds us that we are one people, one nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have looked through all the\r\n\r\nholidays  and  you  will notice that most of  the  holidays  are\r\n\r\nreligious-biased, or in terms of National Day, it  is  specially\r\n\r\nset aside for patriotism, especially for the country.  We do not\r\n\r\nhave  any  one  day  which is for the people  themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nreminded that we are multi-cultural.  I think this is important.\r\n\r\nIn  Japan, they have got its Cultural Day.  The reason why  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  have  a Cultural Day is to emphasise that  culture  is\r\n\r\nimportant in the country.  I think the Minister, instead of just\r\n\r\nbrushing it off, should give his serious consideration.  I  hope\r\n\r\nhe will say that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

But in any case, I  think\r\n\r\nthe last time this matter was brought up, Members also suggested\r\n\r\nother holidays, such as a Women's Day.  So where do you draw the\r\n\r\nline?   If  you  want non-religious festivals also  to  be  made\r\n\r\npublic holidays, of course besides National Day which is now the\r\n\r\none  event that straddles all religions and festivities, I think\r\n\r\nwe  should  be  careful.  We can practise it.  I think  that  is\r\n\r\nimportant.  But to have a public holiday to remind us  about  so\r\n\r\nmany  things in Singapore, such as a Save Water Day, I think  we\r\n\r\nshould be careful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going into the provisions which are fairly\r\n\r\ncomplicated and technical in some respects, let me state at  the\r\n\r\noutset  that  the  protection  and enforcement  of  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  rights, including copyright, will become  increasingly\r\n\r\nimportant  as the Singapore economy matures.  With  advances  in\r\n\r\ninformation  technology, the global economy  is  rapidly  moving\r\n\r\nfrom   an   industrial-based   to  a  knowledge-based   society.\r\n\r\nIntellectual  capital, not merely physical assets  or  financial\r\n\r\ncapital, will be the key factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore responds to this, developing a strong and\r\n\r\neffective  system  for protecting intellectual  property  rights\r\n\r\nbecomes  more important.  Where a company's value is based  less\r\n\r\non  its  factories, plant and equipment but more  on  ideas  and\r\n\r\ntechnical innovations,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective  protection of its intellectual property  will  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly central to its strategic plans and operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Singapore stays ahead of the competition for\r\n\r\nhigh-value,  knowledge-intensive industries, a  good  system  of\r\n\r\nprotection  for  intellectual  property  rights  is   not   only\r\n\r\ndesirable  but  in  fact necessary.  Knowledge-based  industries\r\n\r\nwill  be  attracted to invest in Singapore if they are confident\r\n\r\nthat  their  intellectual  property  will  be  given  sufficient\r\n\r\nprotection here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good IPR infrastructure is also important to the success\r\n\r\nof  our  own home-grown knowledge-based industries.  We have  to\r\n\r\nbear in mind that increasingly it will be our inventors who will\r\n\r\nwant  patent protection and our artists, writers, etc, who  will\r\n\r\nwant copyright protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to an independent survey by PERC (Political &\r\n\r\nEconomic  Risk Consultancy) in October last year, Singapore  has\r\n\r\nthe  best intellectual property rights protection in Asia.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment, however, recognises that technological advances  and\r\n\r\nchanging  circumstances continually challenge us  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nand improve our IPR regime, and we are committed to doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will amend the Copyright Act to improve the\r\n\r\nlevel  of protection for copyright in Singapore and to implement\r\n\r\nSingapore's  obligations  under the World  Trade  Organisation's\r\n\r\nAgreement  on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property  or\r\n\r\nwhat is known as the TRIPS Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under TRIPS, all WTO members, except the least developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  shall  establish  common  standards  of  protection,\r\n\r\nremedies  and enforcement for all areas of intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights  by  the  end  of  next year.   Singapore  has,  however,\r\n\r\ncommitted   itself  in  APEC  to  bring  the  time   frame   for\r\n\r\nimplementation forward to the end of this year, one  year  ahead\r\n\r\nof schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government inter-Ministry committee has been reviewing\r\n\r\nour  legislation on intellectual property rights to give  effect\r\n\r\nto our obligations under TRIPS.

Work  on  other  legislation  in   trade   marks,\r\n\r\nindustrial designs and integrated circuits is also under way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Bill, we have also taken the opportunity to\r\n\r\nmake  changes, firstly, to enable us to accede to the 1971 Berne\r\n\r\nConvention  for  the Protection of Literary and Artistic  Works;\r\n\r\nand,  secondly, to enhance the enforcement mechanism  under  the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>TRIPS Agreement Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first deal with the provisions relating to the\r\n\r\nTRIPS  Agreement.   These can be broadly classified  as  changes\r\n\r\nwhich relate to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) rental rights;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) ephemeral copies of recordings and works;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) performers' rights\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) remedies; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) border enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take up rental rights, the TRIPS Agreement requires that\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  computer programmes and sound  recordings,  a\r\n\r\ncopyright  owner's rights shall include the right  to  rent  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes and recordings.  This is reflected in clauses 3 and 4\r\n\r\nof  the Bill which introduce a new section 25A and amend section\r\n\r\n26  of the existing Act, as well as clause 17 which repeals  and\r\n\r\nre-enacts section 82.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as for ephemeral copies of recordings and works, the\r\n\r\ndefences  of reproducing literary, dramatic, musical or artistic\r\n\r\nworks  or sound recording for the purposes of broadcasting  have\r\n\r\nbeen  narrowed  by the introduction of restrictions  so  that  a\r\n\r\nbroadcasting organisation may only keep copies made for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose  of  its  broadcast, in general, for  a  period  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   This is achieved by clauses 7, 15 and 19  which  amend\r\n\r\nsections 43, 68 and 107 of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for performers' rights, clause 35 of the Bill inserts a\r\n\r\nnew  Part XII of the Act which confers upon performers  of  life\r\n\r\nperformances of drama, musical and literary works, dances,  etc,\r\n\r\nnew  rights  in  relation  to these  live  performances.   These\r\n\r\ninclude   the   right  to  prevent  unauthorised  direct   sound\r\n\r\nrecordings, the reproduction of such recordings, live broadcasts\r\n\r\nand communication to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedies for infringement of copyright set out in the\r\n\r\nexisting   Act   are   generally   comprehensive.     But    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of TRIPS has required us to expand  them  in  one\r\n\r\narea.  Under clause 22, new sections 120 and 120A are introduced\r\n\r\npursuant to which the Court may order, upon an application by  a\r\n\r\ncopyright  owner,  that infringing copies of works  and  devices\r\n\r\nused to make infringing copies be delivered up and destroyed  or\r\n\r\nforfeited to the owner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant amendment relates to border enforcement\r\n\r\nmeasures  to prevent infringing intellectual property  materials\r\n\r\nfrom entering Singapore.  Clause 25 of the Bill gives effect  to\r\n\r\nour  obligation to put in place a border enforcement  system  by\r\n\r\nintroducing new sections 140A through 140R on border enforcement\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 140B(1) enables a copyright owner who suspects that\r\n\r\nany  shipment of pirated goods is coming to Singapore to  notify\r\n\r\nthe  Director-General  of  the Customs  and  Excise  Department.\r\n\r\nSubject  to  certain safeguards, the Department  may  seize  the\r\n\r\ngoods when they enter Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of provisions relating to the protection of\r\n\r\ntest data under the TRIPS  Agreement will also entail amendments\r\n\r\nto  two other Acts, namely, the Medicines Act, which I will take\r\n\r\nlater,  and the Control of Plants Act, the amendments  to  which\r\n\r\nwill be tabled in this House shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Berne Convention Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the amendments which are related to the\r\n\r\nBerne Convention.  This Convention predates the TRIPS Agreement.\r\n\r\nMany  of  its  provisions  in fact  are  covered  by  the  TRIPS\r\n\r\nAgreement, and  Singapore is not presently a party to the  Berne\r\n\r\nConvention but we intend to accede to it once this amending Bill\r\n\r\nhas come into force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceding to that Convention will require us to permit\r\n\r\nlibraries  to  allow  the  copying of works  only  if  they  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  these  works  cannot  be  obtained   within   a\r\n\r\nreasonable time at ordinary commercial prices.  This is provided\r\n\r\nfor  in  clause  9  of  the Bill which repeals  and  substitutes\r\n\r\nsection 45(5) of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments to the Scope of Copyright and Defences</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quickly touch on other amendments on the scope of\r\n\r\nthe copyright as well as defences, first, the deletion by clause\r\n\r\n5  of  section 35(5) of the Act will bring us in line  with  the\r\n\r\nUnited   States,  the  United  Kingdom,  other  European   Union\r\n\r\ncountries, Hong Kong and Australia, which do not bar the use  of\r\n\r\ncopyright materials for commercial research.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, various new defences are to be introduced where\r\n\r\nthe copying of copyright materials is:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to assist the intellectually handicapped;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for examination purposes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) carried out by educational institutions by non-reprographic materials; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) for a course of instruction in the making of films and\r\n\r\nsoundtracks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes are effected by clauses 10 to 13, 20 and\r\n\r\n21  which  insert new sections 50A, 52A, 54A, 115A and 115B  and\r\n\r\nalso amend section 116.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 6 introduces various amendments to section\r\n\r\n39 which lift the restriction on the making of back-up copies of\r\n\r\na  computer programme.  This change brings us in line  with  the\r\n\r\nposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  United  Kingdom and reflects in fact  current  industry\r\n\r\npractice, which is not to impose such a prohibition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, section 74 of the Act, which deals with the\r\n\r\noverlap in protection under industrial design and copyright laws\r\n\r\nis  amended  by  clause 16.  The relevant period  of  protection\r\n\r\nstated in that section is increased from the present 15 years to\r\n\r\n25 years, which is in line with the increase in the maximum term\r\n\r\nof  protection  for a registered design under the UK  Registered\r\n\r\nDesigns Act to 25 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Changes to the Enforcement Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may touch on the provisions relating to enforcement,\r\n\r\nthe main amendments are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 23 which repeals and substitutes section 134 so\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  case  of  proceedings  for  the  enforcement   of\r\n\r\ncopyright,  there is now a rebuttable presumption that  what  is\r\n\r\nstated  on the label of a sound recording is sufficient evidence\r\n\r\nof  the facts stated regarding ownership of the copyright in the\r\n\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 24(e) amends section 136(4) to widen the\r\n\r\noffence  of  possession  of  equipment  to  make  pirated  sound\r\n\r\nrecordings or audio-visual productions to include the possession\r\n\r\nof equipment designed to make pirated copies of all works; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clause 24(g) deletes and substitutes section 136(9)\r\n\r\nand  introduces new sub-paragraphs (10) to (12) to regulate  the\r\n\r\nseizure  of articles and documents pursuant to a search warrant.\r\n\r\nIn  the  existing  Act, the execution of  a  search  warrant  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to only the pirated items themselves and the implements\r\n\r\nused  for piracy.  The new section 136(9) will extend the  scope\r\n\r\nof  search  warrants issued under the Act to cover all  articles\r\n\r\nand  documents  which are evidence of copyright offences.   This\r\n\r\nwill  enable  a more effective investigation and prosecution  of\r\n\r\ncopyright offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that some of these changes are the result\r\n\r\nof  feedback  received from various intellectual property bodies\r\n\r\nrepresenting copyright owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes, of course, are not the last word on\r\n\r\ncopyright  amendments or copyright enforcement.  The  Government\r\n\r\nremains  committed to considering and exploring further  avenues\r\n\r\nto  deal  effectively with copyright piracy in cooperation  with\r\n\r\ncopyright owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say that the honourable Chief Justice in his\r\n\r\njudgment  in the Summit case made various observations,  amongst\r\n\r\nother  things, on the possible need for safeguards where  search\r\n\r\nwarrants are obtained at the initiative of copyright owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His observations are currently being studied. They have an\r\n\r\nimpact,  not  just  on  the Copyright Act  but   also  on  other\r\n\r\nlegislation and therefore any necessary amendments will be taken\r\n\r\nup  subsequently  in  the  context of a  broader  review,  among\r\n\r\nothers, of legislation like the Criminal Procedure Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nintellectual   property  rights  now  play  a  major   role   in\r\n\r\ninternational  trade.   Copyright is an important  component  of\r\n\r\nmany  of the world's major industries: publishing, music, films,\r\n\r\ndatabases, broadcasting, telecommunications, computers  and  the\r\n\r\nmedia.   Singapore  must  be  seen  to  have  \"state-of-the-art\"\r\n\r\ncopyright laws, to help encourage such industries to invest,  or\r\n\r\ncontinue to invest, in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Copyright Act 1988 modernised Singapore's copyright\r\n\r\nlaw to deal, amongst other matters, with the evils of piracy and\r\n\r\ncounterfeiting: of records, films, books and music.  Rights were\r\n\r\nstrengthened and methods of enforcement were improved.  The 1988\r\n\r\nAct  was  widely admired and held up as an example of  what  new\r\n\r\ncopyright laws should contain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, much has happened. The economic importance of\r\n\r\ncopyright  has  become even more pronounced; in  spite  of  some\r\n\r\neffective  action  being taken to deal  with  piracy,  it  still\r\n\r\nremains a problem; technological developments which are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransforming  our way of life - the global information  society,\r\n\r\nInternet,  multimedia,  are  throwing  further  strains  on  the\r\n\r\ncopyright system, and the problems which they give rise to  have\r\n\r\nto be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty).   It  is  stated that one  of  the  reasons  for  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill is the need to comply with  the  TRIPS\r\n\r\nAgreement.    Singapore,  as  a  member  of  the   World   Trade\r\n\r\nOrganisation  (WTO)  with the status of an \"advanced  developing\r\n\r\ncountry\",  has to comply with the TRIPS Agreement  by  the  year\r\n\r\n2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIPS, of course, deals with all areas of intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty.    There  is  a  need  to  amend  or   introduce   new\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  legislation in other  areas,  eg,  trade\r\n\r\nmarks,  industrial designs, integrated circuits,  disclosure  of\r\n\r\nconfidential  information, and so on.  Can  any  information  be\r\n\r\nprovided by the Minister as to when all these other measures are\r\n\r\ngoing to be introduced and whether they will be enacted in time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of performers has traditionally been weak.\r\n\r\nTheir   rights  have  often  been  severely  limited  as   other\r\n\r\nrightholders   have  tended  to  oppose  the  strengthening   of\r\n\r\nperformers' rights, both because they reduce their own share  of\r\n\r\nroyalties  and also because of the practical difficulties  which\r\n\r\ncould  arise  if  so  many people involved in  productions  have\r\n\r\nrights  to  them.  Successful performers with strong  bargaining\r\n\r\npower   can   sometimes  satisfactorily  safeguard   their   own\r\n\r\ninterests, at least, by contract.  Lesser performers have little\r\n\r\nnegotiating strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIPS actually does not confer strong rights on performers.\r\n\r\nNeither  does  Singapore in the current Bill.  But  it  must  be\r\n\r\nnoted  that  today  the  situation is  changing.   Both  from  a\r\n\r\ncultural and an economic point of view, recognition of rights of\r\n\r\nperformers is developing, eg. the European Directive  on  Rental\r\n\r\nand  Related  Rights confers much stronger rights on performers,\r\n\r\nseeking to equate them with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowners   of  authors'  works;  and  the  WIPO  Performance   and\r\n\r\nPhonograms  Treaty of 1996 also provides internationally  strong\r\n\r\nrights for performers (certainly for phonograms, but not yet for\r\n\r\naudio-visual works).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that Singapore should go beyond that,\r\n\r\nand to show its concern for the encouragement of culture and the\r\n\r\narts, it should provide similar stronger rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Singapore Bill does not address some of the\r\n\r\npractical issues arising from the conferment of such rights. For\r\n\r\nexample, the relationship between performers, producers of films\r\n\r\nand  broadcasters.  Should there, for example,  be  presumptions\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of easier use and exploitation of works,  that\r\n\r\nsuch  rights are transferred in the absence of agreement to  the\r\n\r\ncontrary;  in which event, should performers be guaranteed  some\r\n\r\nform  of  reasonable remuneration?  These matters have all  been\r\n\r\naddressed  in  Europe.  I hope that they  can  be  addressed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's information society, the compilation of data and\r\n\r\nmaterial,  especially  for use in computers  and  networks,  has\r\n\r\ntaken  on exponential proportions.  Arguably, the protection  of\r\n\r\ncompilations under Singapore copyright law (as was the  case  in\r\n\r\nthe  UK  until  the  implementation  of  the  European  Database\r\n\r\nDirective)  does protect data and material itself.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nclear  whether this present state of the law is consistent  with\r\n\r\nTRIPS.   It seems that there is a case for incorporating Article\r\n\r\n10.2 into Singapore's legislation so that a Singapore court  can\r\n\r\nensure in an appropriate case that more general TRIPS' principle\r\n\r\nprevails.  The Article states, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine\r\n\r\nreadable  or  other form, which by reason of  the  selection  or\r\n\r\narrangement of their contents constitute intellectual  creations\r\n\r\nshall  be  protected as such.  Such protection, which shall  not\r\n\r\nextend to the data or material itself shall be without prejudice\r\n\r\nto any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producers of databases are particularly interested in this\r\n\r\narea, and there have been many developments in recent times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  try  to  produce laws which give appropriate  protection  to\r\n\r\ndatabases.   For example, a new European Database Directive  has\r\n\r\nrecently been implemented throughout Europe, whereby in addition\r\n\r\nto the fairly limited copyright protection for some databases, a\r\n\r\nnew  sui  generis  right has been created.  A  proposal  for  an\r\n\r\ninternational Database Treaty was made in 1996, and  the  matter\r\n\r\nis   still  under  discussion  although  it  is  proving   quite\r\n\r\ncontroversial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister to consider what is\r\n\r\nSingapore's approach to such databases and whether it  would  be\r\n\r\nappropriate to introduce a new sui generis right similar to  the\r\n\r\nEuropean model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the remedies and enforcement. One of the most\r\n\r\nimportant  features of TRIPS is the detailed code  dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe enforcement of intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although at one time, Singapore's enforcement laws were\r\n\r\nthought  to be strong, and Singapore has taken action to  create\r\n\r\nadditional  enforcement  machinery,  rightholders'  associations\r\n\r\n(eg, the software manufacturers) still maintain that more should\r\n\r\nbe  done  by  the  Government and its agencies  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nenforcement receives a higher profile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas, there is also a similar perception that more\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  done in Singapore to show that the Government  is\r\n\r\napplying  time  and resources to these matters.  Steps  must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  ensure that, with appropriate safeguards,  civil  and\r\n\r\ncriminal  raids to obtain evidence are available to  assist  the\r\n\r\nlegal process.  Without questioning the merits of the case,  the\r\n\r\nSummit  decision  may  have given the  wrong  signals  to  those\r\n\r\nengaged in piracy and counterfeiting, and it is to be hoped that\r\n\r\nthe  measures  in  the Bill will be sufficient to  correct  that\r\n\r\nperception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to ensure that there is a fair balance\r\n\r\nin any Copyright Bill between the interests of holders of rights\r\n\r\nin  \"cutting edge\" software and the interests of competitors who\r\n\r\nwant  to  design and market non-infringing competing  programmes\r\n\r\nwhich interface or are inter-operable with the basic programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal's decision in Creative Technology v.\r\n\r\nAztech established that currently Singapore's copyright law does\r\n\r\nnot  permit most kinds of reverse engineering.  Companies cannot\r\n\r\ndecompile programmes to establish how they were put together and\r\n\r\narmed   with   that  knowledge  to  develop  new  inter-operable\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   Whether  competitors should  be  able  to  reverse\r\n\r\nengineer and, if so, to what extent, is a very difficult  matter\r\n\r\nto resolve.  It seems clear, however, that most countries in the\r\n\r\nworld  are  trying  to draw a line between those  two  differing\r\n\r\ncomputer industry groups so that those who own the copyright  in\r\n\r\nthe  leading  programmes  can maintain  their  strong  copyright\r\n\r\nprotection   over   their  software,   but   that   in   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances  others may decompile because there  is  a  public\r\n\r\ninterest in doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, use is made of the \"fair use\"\r\n\r\ndefence,  whereby courts are required to weigh up, on the  facts\r\n\r\nof  every  case,  whether  the defendants  could  justify  their\r\n\r\nactivities.  In Singapore, with the current amendment to section\r\n\r\n35(5),  I  am pleased to see that the Copyright Bill brings  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of Singapore very close to that of the United States.  This\r\n\r\nis  especially welcome and should receive warm support from  the\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just say that the TRIPS Agreement was\r\n\r\ndrafted  in  the early 1990s, the full impact of the information\r\n\r\nsuperhighways  was  not  yet  fully  appreciated.   Accordingly,\r\n\r\nlittle was done in TRIPS to ensure that the copyright law  deals\r\n\r\nwith many of the new problems to which they give rise to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the WIPO Copyright Treaty of December 1996\r\n\r\nseeks  to  do.   It is a Treaty which sets out  new  rights  for\r\n\r\nauthors and others to ensure that they can control the copyright\r\n\r\ninterests of works winging their way around the world in digital\r\n\r\nform one way or the other.  There are also measures designed  to\r\n\r\nprotect  those  who  are seeking to use technological  means  to\r\n\r\ndabble with anti-copying devices.  For example, selling unlawful\r\n\r\ndecoders,  or interfering with copyright management information.\r\n\r\nThese are matters of the utmost importance.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropean  Union  has already introduced proposals  to  implement\r\n\r\nthis  particular  Treaty.  I hope that the Minister  will  study\r\n\r\nsuch measures and to introduce them in due course in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank Assoc.\r\n\r\nProf. Chin Tet Yung for his useful observations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take up some of the points that he\r\n\r\nmentioned.  He has asked about the time-table for TRIPS.  I have\r\n\r\npointed  out that the work on implementing legislation in  other\r\n\r\nareas,  such  as  trade  marks, industrial  designs,  integrated\r\n\r\ncircuits,  etc.  is  actually in progress.   We  have  committed\r\n\r\nourselves to bring our legislation in conformity with  TRIPS  by\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  this  year,  which is actually  a  year  ahead  of\r\n\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for performers' protection, the stronger regime for\r\n\r\nperformers  which he has in mind is actually pursuant  to  other\r\n\r\ntreaties,  such  as  the  1996 WIPO Performance  and  Phonograms\r\n\r\nTreaty  which came into effect after TRIPS.  Let me  assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  need to extend these additional rights will  also  be\r\n\r\nreviewed and, if necessary, changes will be made to the  Act  at\r\n\r\nthe appropriate time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted what he said about databases and compilations\r\n\r\nand  the  need  to comply with Article 10.2 of  TRIPS.   But  my\r\n\r\nunderstanding  is  that  databases and compilations  as  of  now\r\n\r\nalready enjoy protection under the existing Act.  I would  refer\r\n\r\nhim  to  the  definition  of \"literary  work\"  in  the  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation  of  the  Copyright  Act.   I  believe  our  Act  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  in  compliance with Article  10.2  of  TRIPS.   After\r\n\r\nTRIPS,  he  is right that there were proposals made  by  certain\r\n\r\nmember states of the World Intellectual Property Organisation to\r\n\r\nextend protection for databases and compilations under a special\r\n\r\nregime  or what he referred to as sui generis regime.  That  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  rapid developments in information technology.   The\r\n\r\nproposals  for  that, I believe, were tabled in  the  1996  WIPO\r\n\r\nDiplomatic  Conference.  But these proposals are still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  discussion  and therefore the relevant Government  bodies\r\n\r\nwill  monitor the developments and decide how we should  act  on\r\n\r\nthese trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted what he said about remedies and enforcement\r\n\r\nand  especially his concern that the Summit case may have  given\r\n\r\nthe wrong signals to those engaged in piracy and counterfeiting.\r\n\r\nLet  me  therefore take this opportunity to reiterate  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  is not to condone commission  of  criminal\r\n\r\noffences.    Because  tackling  copyright  piracy   requires   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  approach which involves  the  enactment  of  good\r\n\r\nlaws,   which  we  are  attempting  to  do  in  this   exercise,\r\n\r\nenforcement  of stiff penalties and cooperation of the  industry\r\n\r\nas  well  as  constant review of the entire gamut  of  laws  and\r\n\r\nenforcement.   In  the  case  of enforcement,  the  Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty  Rights Warrant Unit set up under the CID in  1995,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  conducted  over 500 IPR raids in 1997  and  on  copyright\r\n\r\nalone, there was an increase of 104% of raids compared to  1996.\r\n\r\nIn  terms  of the number of fiats issued authorising prosecution\r\n\r\nby  copyright  owners, this went up from 64 in 1996  to  218  in\r\n\r\n1997, more than 240% increase.  Only last month, a 5\ufffd-hour  raid\r\n\r\non five retail outlets in Sim Lim Square was conducted.  Several\r\n\r\nsuspects  were arrested with more than 3,700 CD-ROMs  containing\r\n\r\npirated  business  and games software and  270  VCDs  containing\r\n\r\npirated films were seized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our courts also have consistently meted out fairly stiff\r\n\r\nand  long  term imprisonment for intellectual property offences.\r\n\r\nI  think  he would have read this morning, for example,  that  a\r\n\r\nproprietor  of  a  shop at Sim Lim Square was sentenced  to  two\r\n\r\nyears'  imprisonment after being caught repeatedly  for  selling\r\n\r\npirated CD-ROMs.  I hope the message will be loud and clear that\r\n\r\nwe  are  not soft on copyright piracy.  We are, however, mindful\r\n\r\nof  the  need  to  respond effectively to  continually  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances, and we will do so.  Of course, the public have to\r\n\r\nplay  their  part also.  Because the supplier of  pirated  goods\r\n\r\nexists  only  because there is a demand for the  pirated  goods.\r\n\r\nThe public must therefore respect the rights of those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho have put in efforts in creating computer software, artistic,\r\n\r\nmusical,  literary or other copyright works and  refuse  to  buy\r\n\r\npirated items.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he asked me about further amendments to copyright\r\n\r\nlaws,  and  he is right.  As I said in my speech, the amendments\r\n\r\ntoday will not necessarily be the last word on the subject.   We\r\n\r\nhave to evolve our copyright legislation as we take into account\r\n\r\ninformation  changes.   As for the 1996  WIPO  treaty,  it  does\r\n\r\nintroduce various new rights relating to advances in information\r\n\r\ntechnology,  especially for activities in  cyberspace  which  he\r\n\r\nreferred  to.  Let me assure him that the Government is  looking\r\n\r\ninto these trends at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Prof. S.

Thus,  we  are\r\n\r\nstrictest with free-to-air TV channels, but we allow more leeway\r\n\r\nfor  subscription  services such as cable TV.   With  films,  we\r\n\r\ndifferentiate between G, PG, NC-16 and R(A).  For films shown to\r\n\r\nmembers of film societies, we are more relaxed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the print medium, we make a distinction between\r\n\r\npictorials  and the written word.  We are stricter with  graphic\r\n\r\npublications  meant for children such as comics  depicting  sex.\r\n\r\nWe  are  least  concerned with the printed text because  reading\r\n\r\nthem  requires  a certain level of education and  concentration.\r\n\r\nSome  books  meant  for adults are required  to  be  wrapped  in\r\n\r\nplastic or cellophane in the book shops, so that children cannot\r\n\r\nbrowse them lightly.  This principle of differentiation was also\r\n\r\nadopted by the Censorship Review Committee in 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Obscene publications</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our main target continues to be those who\r\n\r\nseek  profit from distributing obscene publications.  Currently,\r\n\r\ntraffickers of obscene publications are referred to  the  Police\r\n\r\nfor action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  taken under the Penal Code.  There are no provisions  to\r\n\r\ndeal with such cases under the existing UPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5 of the proposed amendments, those caught\r\n\r\ntrafficking    in   obscene   publications,   by   distributing,\r\n\r\nexhibiting,   producing   or  having   such   publications   for\r\n\r\ndistribution,  can  be prosecuted under the UPA.   The  proposed\r\n\r\npenalty will be a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or a jail term  of\r\n\r\nup to two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 spells out what we mean by \"obscenity\":\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A publication is obscene if its effect or . the effect of\r\n\r\nany  one of its parts or items is, if taken as a whole, such  as\r\n\r\nto tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely . to read,\r\n\r\nsee or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Objectionable Publications</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also included in the amendments the definition of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  objectionable.   While some publications  may  not  be\r\n\r\nblatantly  pornographic  or controversial,  they  may  still  be\r\n\r\nobjectionable in the way they promote promiscuous lifestyles  or\r\n\r\nglorify criminal activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current legislation, other than confiscation, no\r\n\r\nfurther  action  can  be taken against vendors  who  persist  in\r\n\r\nselling objectionable publications.  The proposed amendment will\r\n\r\nplug  this  present  loophole so that vendors  of  objectionable\r\n\r\npublications can be prosecuted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the proposed amendments allows for penalties\r\n\r\nagainst  such  distributors.   For distributing,  possessing  or\r\n\r\nreproducing objectionable publications, the penalty would  be  a\r\n\r\nfine up to $5,000 and/or a jail term for one year.  This maximum\r\n\r\nfine is half that for obscene publications.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prohibited Publications</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to ban publications such as Playboy and\r\n\r\nPenthouse.   We will increase the maximum fine for the  sale  of\r\n\r\nsuch  banned  publications  from $2,000  to  $10,000.   For  the\r\n\r\npossession of a banned publication, the maximum fine will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraised  from $1,000 to $2,000.  No change is recommended in  the\r\n\r\njail terms as they are already a sufficient deterrent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always exercised the power to ban or gazette\r\n\r\npublications sparingly.  This policy will continue.  We  are  in\r\n\r\nfact  degazetting publications which, over time, are  no  longer\r\n\r\nobjectionable  on  moral, religious or  communal  grounds.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Journal of Contemporary Asia and the Selected Works\r\n\r\nof Mao Tse-tung have been recently degazetted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to review its\r\n\r\ncensorship  rules  from  time to time to ensure  that  standards\r\n\r\napplied  to  publications and videos are in tune  with  changing\r\n\r\nsocial mores in Singapore and changes in the world around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  support  the Bill.  I am pleased to note that in this  Bill,\r\n\r\nattention  is  being  drawn  to the implications  of  rapid  and\r\n\r\nwidespread dissemination of undesirable publications, aided by a\r\n\r\nnew  medium, such as CD-ROMS, which are also easy to  duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe  revised  definition of publications, in my  mind,  is  long\r\n\r\noverdue in the light of the changing nature in which obscene and\r\n\r\nobjectionable material is distributed and exhibited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new provisions for obscene publications in this\r\n\r\nBill  which  have  been previously absent  would  now  give  our\r\n\r\nenforcement   agencies  ground  to  rein  in  on   distributors,\r\n\r\nexhibitors and publishers of such materials and I appreciate the\r\n\r\ntough stand that this Bill places on visual images as the impact\r\n\r\nof  visual  images, as the Minister has just said, is  far  more\r\n\r\ndirect and damaging than the written word.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also serves to address the anomaly whereby\r\n\r\noffending vendors who sell objectionable publications would have\r\n\r\ntheir  publications confiscated but suffer no further penalties.\r\n\r\nIt is timely that penalties are now introduced and that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   vendors  have  to  be  directly  accountable  for  their\r\n\r\nparticipation in the distribution and sale of such objectionable\r\n\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of the measures in this Bill, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  seek clarifications from the  Minister  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  items.   The first question is: is this  Bill,  in  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the Minister, a retrogressive step towards  greater\r\n\r\ncensorship  of  publications, or is it a  step  forward  in  our\r\n\r\neffort  to  promote  a  reading  society  and  to  promote   the\r\n\r\npublishing industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask this question because I am concerned that a\r\n\r\nretrogressive  step  towards  censorship  would  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ndirection  and  the development of the literary  and  performing\r\n\r\narts,  an  area which we are consciously promoting in line  with\r\n\r\nour  national objective to build a more gracious society.  Would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  therefore update the House  on  the  Government's\r\n\r\nlatest thinking or policy towards censorship in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 13 of the Bill leaves it to the expert judgment\r\n\r\nof  any personnel authorised under the Bill to determine whether\r\n\r\nor not any publication is objectionable.  I understand that this\r\n\r\nperson or so-called controller will act from time to time  under\r\n\r\nthe direction of the Minister.  May I therefore ask the Minister\r\n\r\nif he could tell the House what are the basic parameters guiding\r\n\r\nthe  actions of such officers and whether or not such parameters\r\n\r\nshould indeed be stipulated in this legislation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an area of clarification is also sought on the status\r\n\r\nof  Internet  Service  Providers.   The  widened  definition  of\r\n\r\npublications includes information stored by the use of computers\r\n\r\nor  other  electronic device.  Despite the  existence  of  proxy\r\n\r\nservices, ISP cannot fully police all such undesirable web pages\r\n\r\nand  prevent  access to such material, whether it  is  audio  or\r\n\r\nvisual,  available through the Internet.  Therefore, my question\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  is whether, with the passing  of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\noperationally,   the  Bill  will  impose   an   overly   onerous\r\n\r\nperformance  obligation  on the part  of  the  Internet  Service\r\n\r\nProviders.  Would the Minister please clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am pleased to note that within this\r\n\r\nprovision of the Bill which is the new section 16, the  Minister\r\n\r\nis  able  to grant exemption to allow, for example, institutions\r\n\r\nof   higher  learning  to  have  access  to  such  objectionable\r\n\r\nmaterials for research purposes.  I think it is good.   However,\r\n\r\nfor the reassurance of this House that such discretionary powers\r\n\r\nare  not  unilaterally  exercised,  could  the  Minister  please\r\n\r\nelaborate  the  guiding  principles underlying  any  ground  for\r\n\r\nexemptions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport this Bill as placed before this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tough stand that the Government has taken with\r\n\r\nregard to obscene or undesirable publications on grounds of sex,\r\n\r\nviolence,  crime  or drugs is appropriate and deserves  support.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I  would  say that in view of the rapid  and  complex\r\n\r\ntechnological  developments in areas of periodical publications,\r\n\r\nmedia printing, there is a constant need to be more vigilant  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the current legislation be kept relevant  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  standards of morality, decency and propriety are preserved.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard,  Sir, I support the proposal to  increase  the\r\n\r\npenalties for such offences as stated in the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new definition of what is objectionable, taking into\r\n\r\naccount new technologies in sound recording and reproductions of\r\n\r\npictures,  photographs from computers, would be considered  very\r\n\r\nappropriate  and  timely.   However, Sir,  while  the  Bill  has\r\n\r\nprovided  for comprehensive guidelines to determine  whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  a  publication is considered objectionable, it would indeed\r\n\r\nbe   extremely  difficult  in  practice  to  determine  what  is\r\n\r\nobjectionable.   It  is sometimes difficult  to  determine  what\r\n\r\nconstitutes  torture, sexual and violent abuses and exploitation\r\n\r\nof  nudity,  let alone having to relate this with considerations\r\n\r\nfor  the  literary, artistic, social, cultural, educational  and\r\n\r\nscientific   merit   before  deciding   whether   a   particular\r\n\r\npublication  is  indeed objectionable.   In  fact,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nacknowledged, under the new section 2B, subsection (3), that the\r\n\r\nquestion whether or not a publication is objectionable is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  for  expert judgment.  It is for this same reason,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is in my view extremely difficult for any one  person,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Chief Controller or delegated public officers,  to\r\n\r\nexercise judgment over such a difficult matter and so decide  or\r\n\r\ninterpret the moral tone of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Sir, I would suggest that a more civic\r\n\r\nparticipation involving a cross-section of our civil society  be\r\n\r\nformed  under the supervision of the Chief Controller  to  guide\r\n\r\nthe Chief Controller in the interpretation and classification of\r\n\r\nsuch  publications  and to facilitate the  smooth  transmission,\r\n\r\nbroadcast,  circulation and exhibition of this  publication  for\r\n\r\ncommercial considerations and yet in no way compromise our  high\r\n\r\nstandards of morality, decency and propriety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more practical note, Sir, it would be difficult for\r\n\r\nany one person or corporation to determine what is objectionable\r\n\r\nand  what  is  not.  It may take expert judgment to  decide  how\r\n\r\nwould  any person or corporation find it easier to make  such  a\r\n\r\ndecision.  A person would have to make a very difficult decision\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not to seek exemption or to determine that  he  has\r\n\r\nwith  him  a publication that can be classified undesirable  and\r\n\r\nmay  in  fact find himself convicted simply because of error  of\r\n\r\njudgment.   Such a fear, Sir, would lead to the Chief Controller\r\n\r\nbeing  inundated  with  publications  that  would  require   his\r\n\r\napproval.   This could have detrimental commercial consequences.\r\n\r\nI  seek  the  Minister's clarification and  assurance  that  the\r\n\r\nmechanism to ensure the speedy and efficient processing of  such\r\n\r\npublications is available.  We should also have mechanisms where\r\n\r\nthe  decisions  and objections to the Chief Controller  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  be  published and made readily available  to  the\r\n\r\npublic giving reasons for the objections for ease of reference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the new section 16, subsection (2), I wish\r\n\r\nto  seek clarification from the Minister on the proposed fees to\r\n\r\nbe  imposed  for  seeking exemption for publications  which  are\r\n\r\nprohibited.   In  view  of  the  low  cost  of  these  products,\r\n\r\nespecially  as a result of recent technology, such fees  may  be\r\n\r\nout of proportion to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncost of the product.  Further, a period of three months for such\r\n\r\npublications and materials to be held in custody may be too long\r\n\r\nas the product could have become obsolete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I think this is a good Bill and wish to\r\n\r\nstate my support for the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for giving\r\n\r\nme this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Undesirable Publications Act goes back to 1938\r\n\r\nwhen the colonial government first introduced it for the obvious\r\n\r\npurpose   of  controlling  political  literature.   Things   had\r\n\r\nchanged.  In 1967, the Act was repealed and re-enacted.  Now, we\r\n\r\nhave further amendments to the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most civilised societies do not like to have\r\n\r\ncensorship either on moral or political grounds.  But we are not\r\n\r\nliving in an ideal society.  I think some degree of control  has\r\n\r\nto  be  exercised  by  the  society  over  the  individual.   On\r\n\r\nprinciple, I agree with the amendments and I support  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I have some reservations and queries and I would  like\r\n\r\nthe Minister to give them his due consideration and I am sure he\r\n\r\nwill do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are an open society. We are in the age of\r\n\r\ninformation  technology, satellite and cable  television.   Most\r\n\r\nhomes   have   access  to  Internet.   We  are   now   receiving\r\n\r\npublications   from   India,   China,   Thailand,    Bangladesh,\r\n\r\nPhilippines, besides the traditional sources.  Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable that publications from these countries should not have\r\n\r\nanything that will undermine the social fabric of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, an Indian publication which was sold in\r\n\r\nSingapore  had a very undesirable photograph, though  it  was  a\r\n\r\nbeautiful   photograph,   in  the  middle   of   the   magazine.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Sir, I am pleased to note that this publication has\r\n\r\nnot  reappeared  in  Singapore.  I do not  know  whether  it  is\r\n\r\neffective  supervision by the Ministry  or  whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary will of the distributor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have moved a long way from the days of yellow\r\n\r\nculture  of  1959 when some publications had to  be  prohibited.\r\n\r\nTimes have changed.  We must allow publications that will enrich\r\n\r\nour literary and artistic life.  And I congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  allowing this provision in the Bill.  This will ensure that\r\n\r\nthe scholars are not denied these works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a fundamental question which I would like to address\r\n\r\nto the Minister.  This is regarding the new section 2B(1)(b).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a publication would be objectionable if it describes,\r\n\r\ndepicts  or  otherwise deals with matters of  race  or  religion\r\n\r\nwhich is likely to cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or\r\n\r\nhostility.   I  beg  the Minister to think of one  further  area\r\n\r\nwhich  should be included, besides race and religion.   Language\r\n\r\nis  a very sensitive issue.  Feelings of enmity and ill-will may\r\n\r\nresult  if  a  publication  makes offensive  comments  on  one's\r\n\r\nlanguage  or  makes criticism in such a way that it will  create\r\n\r\nill-will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a multi-lingual country. As a\r\n\r\nresult of political stability, the language fanatics are not  in\r\n\r\na  position  to  inflame feelings.  But not too  long  ago,  the\r\n\r\ncommunalists were propagating supremacy of their language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to go back to the\r\n\r\nearly  days  of  our  Republic.  At the  Opening  of  the  First\r\n\r\nParliament  on 8th December 1965, His Excellency  the  Yang  Di-Pertuan Negara reminded the House and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are people in Singapore who, even after a few months\r\n\r\nof  separation, still talked raucously, albeit foolishly,  about\r\n\r\nthe implementation of one language - the national language -  in\r\n\r\nteaching  at  all levels including the university.   If  such  a\r\n\r\npolicy  was  unwise when we were part of the wider framework  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  now in the context of Singapore, the lunacy  of  such\r\n\r\nstatement should have been manifest to all.  Yet they are  being\r\n\r\nmade and considerable publicity in the Jawi press.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nWe  no longer have the Jawi press or extreme Malay leaders.   It\r\n\r\nis to the credit of the Malay leadership and the people that the\r\n\r\nview of the sixties has been abandoned for the good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language extremism is not the monopoly of any one\r\n\r\ngroup.   There  are  chauvinists in  every  group,  but  we  can\r\n\r\nminimize the danger.  One small spark and the House is on  fire.\r\n\r\nLet us have some fire prevention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that we do not have communal clashes must not\r\n\r\nleave  us  to  believe everything is fine.  From time  to  time,\r\n\r\nchauvinists  rear their ugly heads.  We must  try  to  curb  the\r\n\r\nexuberance  of  chauvinists.  Language is a very emotive  issue.\r\n\r\nPeople are prepared to die for it.  Some do die in the hope that\r\n\r\nthey will become martyrs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can learn from the experience of other countries where\r\n\r\nlanguage  groups clash.  The end result is chaos  and  disorder.\r\n\r\nThese  countries often experience riots.  We too  had  our  fair\r\n\r\nshare of riots and curfews.  I think there is a loophole in  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Let us cover it now to prevent a floodgate.  We have  not\r\n\r\nseen  for sometime the language issue being openly debated,  but\r\n\r\nit can reappear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pride ourselves as pragmatic people practising\r\n\r\nprevention  and  looking  beyond the horizon.   We  enacted  the\r\n\r\nMaintenance  of Religious Harmony Act.  The law has  a  salutary\r\n\r\neffect.   The  fanatics  and  fundamentalists  have  adopted   a\r\n\r\nmoderate  line.   The  need to enforce the law  has  not  arisen\r\n\r\nbecause of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I urge, in a similar vein, the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nincluding  language in the sub-clause.  If he cannot do  so,  he\r\n\r\nshould  state  his stand on the matter so that a  clear  message\r\n\r\nwill be sent to the would-be mischief makers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome control of objectionable publications.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would  like  to plead for  caution.   We  must  not\r\n\r\nprohibit  publications  as  long as they  do  not  question  our\r\n\r\nfundamental beliefs.  We must keep our windows open even  if  it\r\n\r\nmeans  some foul air coming in.  The Bill is going to  give  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wide power.  There is no way to check against abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that whenever the official decides to\r\n\r\nclassify any publication as objectionable publication, he should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsult advisers who are drawn from outside the Government.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  the public would have confidence in the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  official,  bearing in mind that there is no appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt,  as the Minister's decision is final.  I therefore  plead\r\n\r\nfor establishing a Committee of Advisers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also must urge the publishers and booksellers to\r\n\r\nhave some degree of self-censorship.  Recently, my attention was\r\n\r\ndrawn  to  a  book  by  one of the popular  fiction  writers  in\r\n\r\nAmerica.   It is supposed to deal with the corporate world,  but\r\n\r\nevery  one  in  10 pages speaks of explicit sexual  acts,  often\r\n\r\nfringing  on  perversity.  I will not mention the book  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse but I will give the title to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can do no better than to end my speech by quoting\r\n\r\nagain  the Address of His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nin 1965.  May I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Needless to say, the more extreme any community is about\r\n\r\none  race, one language and one religion, the more likely it  is\r\n\r\nto  arouse  counter chauvinism amongst the other communities  to\r\n\r\nthe detriment of all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I end my speech and I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the\r\n\r\nBill.    The   amendments  are  commendable.   The   policy   of\r\n\r\ndifferentiation  the  Minister has explained  is  a  progressive\r\n\r\nstep.   In  deciding what is objectionable, the Bill  will  take\r\n\r\ninto  account different audiences and media and also  allow  the\r\n\r\nrecognition of merit on scientific, artistic and other  grounds.\r\n\r\nI   believe  this  follows  the  Report  of  Prof.  Tommy  Koh's\r\n\r\nCensorship Review Committee 1992.  I think this is something  we\r\n\r\nshould all support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, wish to seek one assurance from the Government\r\n\r\nand  to  offer three suggestions.  The assurance I seek is  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  the  meaning of \"obscene\".  The Bill  gives  a  new\r\n\r\ndefinition  of the word.  This definition needs to be  clear  as\r\n\r\nregards  other laws which use the same word.  There is a  degree\r\n\r\nof  overlap  with section 292 of the Penal Code  which  provides\r\n\r\nsanctions for the sale of obscene goods.  As such, the assurance\r\n\r\nI seek from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  is that there will be a consistent interpretation\r\n\r\nand application of what is obscene under the different laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my three suggestions. My first\r\n\r\nsuggestion  is  in  respect  of  panels  to  assist  the   Chief\r\n\r\nController.   The  Bill  defines \"objectionable\"  to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount   the   impact  of  the  medium,  artistic,  scientific,\r\n\r\neducational   and  other  merits,  and  standards  of   morality\r\n\r\ngenerally accepted by reasonable members of the community.  This\r\n\r\nis  commendable.  Past Malaysian and Singaporean cases have  not\r\n\r\ntaken  such criterion into consideration.  In the past, we  have\r\n\r\nseen  books  as  the  Tropic of Cancer by Henry  Miller  be  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  criminal prosecution.  Similarly,  in  England  and\r\n\r\nother  societies, there had been controversies  surrounding  D.H\r\n\r\nLawrence's  Lady  Chatterley's Lover.   Today,  such  texts  are\r\n\r\nstudied in University or even at `O' levels without controversy.\r\n\r\nSo,  as  the  Minister has recognised and this Bill  recognises,\r\n\r\nstandards change.  However, given this dimension of change  over\r\n\r\ntime  and  the reference to society's changing mores, and  given\r\n\r\nthe  expanded  criterion,  can the  Chief  Controller  alone  or\r\n\r\nControllers  within  the Administrative  Service  by  themselves\r\n\r\ndecide what is objectionable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then comes to my suggestion. The decision-making on\r\n\r\nwhat  is  objectionable  should  include  both  specialists  and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the community at large.  They  would  assist\r\n\r\nand advise the Chief Controller.  I understand that the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  done  this  informally  already.   The  process  should  be\r\n\r\nformalized  and publicized.  This can be an area of  growth  for\r\n\r\ncivil  society, by which I mean that civil society, the citizens\r\n\r\nof    Singapore,   should   progress   towards   greater   self-responsibility and self-regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my second suggestion. This is that\r\n\r\ndistributors of publications be allowed on a voluntary basis  to\r\n\r\nmake  prior submissions to the Ministry.  Sir, the Bill and  the\r\n\r\nAct,  as  they exist, are largely reactive.  After a publication\r\n\r\nis imported,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Controller  can decide and require certain  actions  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.   However,  import and distribution of  publications  for\r\n\r\nsale  are  a  business.  Business requires certainty and  proper\r\n\r\nplanning.   Powers under the Bill should then be  proactive  and\r\n\r\npro-business.   My  suggestion  in  core  and  in  sum  is  that\r\n\r\ndistributors  have the option to submit on a voluntary  basis  a\r\n\r\nsample copy to the Controller to have his permission for import.\r\n\r\nThere  should be a time limit given to the Controller to give  a\r\n\r\ndecision,  favourable or otherwise, and then if favourable,  the\r\n\r\nbooks can proceed en masse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I understand this is the informal practice under\r\n\r\nsection 10 of the existing Act.  However, it is sometimes  after\r\n\r\nmass imports have already been made.  My suggestion would reduce\r\n\r\nuncertainty and risks for distributors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion is that the public should have greater\r\n\r\naccess  to  the list of objectionable publications.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nnot the objectionable publications themselves but the list.  The\r\n\r\nnew  section  2B of the Bill provides that the Chief  Controller\r\n\r\nshall   keep   and   maintain   a  register   of   objectionable\r\n\r\npublications.  The list serves to inform people.  However, there\r\n\r\nis  no  provision that the register should be  made  known.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  my  suggestion  is  that it is  preferable  to  have  the\r\n\r\nobjectionable publications gazetted and, moreover, for practical\r\n\r\npublic  access,  the register should be listed on  Internet  and\r\n\r\ncopies of the register made available for inspection perhaps  at\r\n\r\nmain reference libraries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications  (Amendment)  Bill is intended to restrict  obscene\r\n\r\nand  other  objectionable publications, taking into account  the\r\n\r\ntechnological  developments  in  Singapore.   It   also   raises\r\n\r\npenalties.  The Bill, however, does not cover \"films\" which  are\r\n\r\ncovered by the Films Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to be welcomed as it seeks to take into\r\n\r\naccount   the   gaps  in  the  law  which  have  arisen  through\r\n\r\ntechnological  developments, especially electronic publications.\r\n\r\nThe definition of \"publications\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow includes computer-generated or stored graphics and sounds,\r\n\r\nand  the definition of \"supply\" also covers the transmission  of\r\n\r\nsuch publications through computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"obscene\" is the same as that used in the\r\n\r\nnew  Films Bill, though the latter does not contain a definition\r\n\r\nof  \"objectionable\".  This means that there can be both  obscene\r\n\r\nfilms and publications, but no \"objectionable films\".  It is not\r\n\r\nclear why this is the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern that I have is the somewhat wide meaning of\r\n\r\n\"objectionable\".  For example, in the new section  2B(1)(a),  it\r\n\r\nis stated that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a publication is objectionable if ... it ... describes,\r\n\r\ndepicts,  expresses or otherwise deals with ... matters  such  as\r\n\r\nsex,  horror,  crime, cruelty, violence or  the  consumption  of\r\n\r\ndrugs ... in  such  a  manner  that  the  availability  of   the\r\n\r\npublication is likely to be injurious to the public good;'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nThe  controllers appointed by the Minister are the guardians  of\r\n\r\nthe public good, as it is their opinions that count in the Bill.\r\n\r\nIn forming their views, they need not take evidence.  It is said\r\n\r\nthat  whether a matter is objectionable or not is a  matter  for\r\n\r\nexpert  judgment.  It is by no means certain how one can acquire\r\n\r\ntraining  and  expertise to determine whether a  publication  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  injurious to the public good, or what  level  of\r\n\r\ninjury  is  required  before a publication  is  declared  to  be\r\n\r\nobjectionable.  Further, new subsection 2B(3) is unclear  as  to\r\n\r\nwho  should  provide these experts with the evidence which  they\r\n\r\nare  under  a duty to consider, if available.  All  in  all,  it\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  an open-ended provision that may be difficult  to\r\n\r\napply,  and even more difficult to challenge.  I should like  to\r\n\r\nknow whether this is actually intended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I wish to raise is that the Bill does not\r\n\r\npurport   to   deal   with  the  different  types   of   obscene\r\n\r\npublications.   In the new Films (Amendment) Bill,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nspecial provision on aggravated offences where a child or  young\r\n\r\nperson is involved.  A simple illustration will be sufficient to\r\n\r\nexpose  the anomaly in the proposed laws.   An obscene  film  is\r\n\r\nmade  using a young person.   The person who makes the  film  or\r\n\r\nwho  procures the young person to make such a film will  face  a\r\n\r\nminimum of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$20,000  fine,  with the possibility of a $80,000 fine  ceiling,\r\n\r\nand  two  years  in  prison.  Another takes  a  set  of  obscene\r\n\r\nphotographs involving the same person is liable to a fine  under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill not exceeding $10,000 or two years jail or both.   In\r\n\r\nthe  days before photo-realistic images can be produced  on  the\r\n\r\ncomputer or camera, it may be justifiable to distinguish between\r\n\r\nfilm  and  publication.   But  now the  distinction,  I  submit,\r\n\r\nappears to be spurious.  I would urge the Minister to take  this\r\n\r\npoint into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a distinction is not spurious, but where it is not\r\n\r\ndrawn in the Bill, is in the case of child pornography.  The new\r\n\r\nBill does not make this distinction.  The Films (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nmakes  such a distinction. What is the reason for the difference\r\n\r\nin  approach?  It cannot be that a pornographer who  exploits  a\r\n\r\nyoung person by taking photographs is morally less reprehensible\r\n\r\nthan  his  counterpart who makes a film.  In many jurisdictions,\r\n\r\nchild  pornography  has been singled out as  a  particular  evil\r\n\r\nrequiring  special sanctions.  In the US alone, about 15  states\r\n\r\nhave  enacted  special provisions to tackle  this  problem.   We\r\n\r\nshould do the same, as we have done in the case of films.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to quote the statement of Louis Freeh,\r\n\r\nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, giving evidence\r\n\r\nbefore the Senate Appropriations Committee last year.  There  he\r\n\r\nsaid, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our children are our nation's most valuable asset. They\r\n\r\nrepresent  the bright future of our country and hold  our  hopes\r\n\r\nfor  a  better nation. Our children are also some  of  the  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable  members  of  society.  ..  Protecting  our  children\r\n\r\nagainst  the  fear of crime and from becoming victims  of  crime\r\n\r\nmust be a national priority.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to point out that the marvellous advances\r\n\r\nin  computer and telecommunications technology \"that  allow  our\r\n\r\nchildren  to reach out to new sources of knowledge and  cultural\r\n\r\nexperiences\" are also exposing them to exploitation and harm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore most earnestly urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nreview the existing and proposed legislation, with the following\r\n\r\nconsiderations in mind.  First, there should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe a distinction made between child pornography and other types,\r\n\r\nwith enhanced penalties for the former.  Second, there should be\r\n\r\nno   distinction   made  between  pornography   in   films,   in\r\n\r\npublications  and in broadcasting.  Third, there should  perhaps\r\n\r\nbe a refining of the definitions used in the legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill subject to what I have said above.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

There in the Copyright Act the  word  is\r\n\r\ndefined  as  \"broadcast  by  wireless  telegraphy\".   Electronic\r\n\r\ntransmission  is defined in this Bill as \"excludes broadcasting\"\r\n\r\nwhile  supply of publication is defined by the Bill as  covering\r\n\r\nelectronic  transmission.  This leaves  an  area  of  electronic\r\n\r\ntransmission  where messages are broadcast, that  is,  they  are\r\n\r\nsent  to several parties with one press of the button.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  would  confirm  whether  or  not  such  broadcast\r\n\r\nmaterials  as,  for example, e-mail or fax, are subject  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the word \"publication\" is defined to mean \"any\r\n\r\nbook,  magazine  or periodical, whether in manuscript  or  final\r\n\r\nform\".   As far as form goes, Mr Speaker, Sir, electronic  books\r\n\r\nand  magazines  are today feasible.  Are these in \"final  form\"?\r\n\r\nIt  is, I submit, necessary to add after the words \"final  form\"\r\n\r\nsome  words  like  \"and  published in whatever  medium,  whether\r\n\r\ntangible  or  otherwise\", to clearly cover Internet publications\r\n\r\nand so-called \"E-zines\" if this be the purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the word \"supply\" is defined. A similar word is\r\n\r\ndefined  in a slightly different way in the next Bill that  will\r\n\r\nbe  tabled before the House at a subsequent sitting, and that is\r\n\r\nthe  Films  (Amendment) Bill.  I would like to ask  if  the  two\r\n\r\ndefinitions which serve the same purpose essentially  be  worded\r\n\r\nin a similar way, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the word \"obscene\" is defined in this Bill, and\r\n\r\nagain  this word is also defined in the Films (Amendment)  Bill.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  need  to say here, I may have to say it  again  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Films (Amendment) Bill.  Suffice it to say, it was\r\n\r\nBertrand  Russell,  the sceptic, who said \"it  is  obvious  that\r\n\r\nobscenity  is  not a term capable of legal definition.   In  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  the  courts,  it means anything  that  shocks  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate\".   I  suppose  we  do not  want  such  an  arbitrary\r\n\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall, an American judge was once asked to define\r\n\r\n\"obscenity\".  I do not remember his exact words, so allow me  to\r\n\r\nparaphrase.   He said in effect that obscenity is  not  easy  to\r\n\r\ndefine.  Nevertheless, it is like an elephant.  \"I know it  when\r\n\r\nI  see  it\".   Our legislative draftsman has boldly  proposed  a\r\n\r\ndefinition.  Obscenity is defined, \"such as to tend  to  deprave\r\n\r\nor corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant\r\n\r\ncircumstances, to read, see or hear the matter .\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition of obscenity is archaic, or at least in\r\n\r\narchaic  terminology.   It comes from the  1868  case  of  R  v.\r\n\r\nHicklin,  words, which were further developed, I understand,  in\r\n\r\nthe  definition  section  of the UK's Obscene  Publications  Act\r\n\r\n1959.   Furthermore, it is too narrow in our modern  age.   Many\r\n\r\nthings which the majority of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans regard as obscene may not necessarily  be  seen  as\r\n\r\n\"depraved\"  by some sectors.  The definition, however,  requires\r\n\r\nall  who  see,  hear  or  read the publication  to  consider  it\r\n\r\n\"depraved\" or in other words \"evil\".  With the decline of  moral\r\n\r\nvalues,  even so-called family magazines and newspapers  display\r\n\r\nfull frontal nudes in the name of art or news.  Many would still\r\n\r\nsay  this  is obscene, but not all the same people may  actually\r\n\r\ncondemn  it  as  \"depravity\".  Depravity has very  negative  and\r\n\r\nominous  overtones,  and  is  reserved  today  for  some   truly\r\n\r\nobnoxious  and  heinous behaviour.  Instinctively,  many  people\r\n\r\nwould hesitate to call full frontal nudity per se as \"evil\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easier to note what is \"lewd\" or \"indecent\" or\r\n\r\n\"morally  unseemly\"  in specific circumstances.   I  would  like\r\n\r\ntherefore  to update the definition of \"obscenity\" to  something\r\n\r\nthat  is  easier to apply, such as the words \"such  as  to  lead\r\n\r\nright  minded people to consider it lewd, depraved,  corrupt  or\r\n\r\nmorally unseemly\".  Perhaps, in addition, we should also have  a\r\n\r\nlist  of  criteria such as in the new section 2B(2) to help  the\r\n\r\ncourt or the Controller decide what is indeed obscene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion and the remaining items on the Order Paper for  today\r\n\r\nbe  exempted  at  this  day's sitting  from  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think much of what I\r\n\r\nwanted to say has already been said by other speakers.  But I do\r\n\r\nwish nevertheless to lend my support and voice the concerns that\r\n\r\nhave been expressed by several of the speakers who spoke on this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Amendment Bill now seeks to assign or\r\n\r\nto confine to persons, or a person it may be, to decide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  we  may  read, what we may see, or what we may  hear.   It\r\n\r\nwould appear from the Bill that the community is not to have any\r\n\r\nsay  on this, because there is no provision made for any appeal.\r\n\r\nThere  is no board, as it were, that is proposed which may  hear\r\n\r\nany  appeals  from  any decision made by the Controller  or  any\r\n\r\nauthorised  officer.  So the society is not to have any  say  at\r\n\r\nall in what it sees, reads or hears, but it has to be determined\r\n\r\nby  an  officer.  We know not what the age of this officer  will\r\n\r\nbe.   He may be a fairly young man who is charged with the  task\r\n\r\nof deciding what is good and what is not good for the society to\r\n\r\nsee, read or hear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act itself contains in section 3 a very wide blanket\r\n\r\npower given to the Minister to prohibit any publication which he\r\n\r\nconsiders  contrary to the public interest.  And that itself  is\r\n\r\nwithout any appeal to either the courts or to any body set up to\r\n\r\nconsider the Minister's decision.  So I would have thought since\r\n\r\nthe Government already has this all-embracing power given to the\r\n\r\nMinister,  objectionable and obscene publications could just  as\r\n\r\nwell  be brought under the scrutiny of the Minister for  him  to\r\n\r\nexercise  his  power under section 3 of the Act.  But  now  this\r\n\r\nBill  proposes  to  add  two  other definitions,  \"obscene\"  and\r\n\r\n\"objectionable\"  as  matters  on  which  the  decision   of   an\r\n\r\nauthorised person is to be final.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last speaker in his comment on clause\r\n\r\n3  of  the  Bill on the   meaning of obscene, called it archaic.\r\n\r\nIt  is almost impossible for anyone to really understand what is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  a  publication  that tends to  \"deprave  and  corrupt\r\n\r\npersons\".   It  is  an  all-catching phrase  and  there  are  no\r\n\r\ncriteria  set  out as to what should be considered as  depravity\r\n\r\nand  what should be considered as corrupting persons.  And there\r\n\r\nis  nothing  in  this Bill which says who is to decide  what  is\r\n\r\nobscene.  There is, of course, a new section 2B, under clause 3,\r\n\r\nwhich   leaves   the  question  of  determining  \"objectionable\"\r\n\r\npublication to a person authorised by the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, the main object of this Bill\r\n\r\nwould appear to me to consign all our reading materials, all our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials  that we see or hear, to the judgment of  one  person.\r\n\r\nIs  this  a fitting way to prepare us for the 21st century?   It\r\n\r\nmight  have  been  all  right in the 18th century  or  the  17th\r\n\r\ncentury.   But is that how we are going to regulate  society  in\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century  that decisions about what  a  citizen  shall\r\n\r\nread,  hear or see should all be left in the hands of  a  single\r\n\r\nofficer?  As  someone had said, is this Bill retrogressive or is\r\n\r\nit  progressive?  Certainly, if you look at the control that  is\r\n\r\nto  be  given to one particular man to decide what society shall\r\n\r\nread or hear or see, it is retrogressive.  It does not take into\r\n\r\naccount the concern of the society and what the society thinks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the definition of \"objectionable\". In\r\n\r\nclause  3  (new  section  2B(2)(d))  any  publication  would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered objectionable if the officer takes the view  that  it\r\n\r\noffends  the  standards of morality, decency and propriety  that\r\n\r\nare  generally accepted by reasonable members of the  community.\r\n\r\nHow  is he going to determine the standards of morality accepted\r\n\r\nby reasonable members of the community or will he impose his own\r\n\r\nstandards  of  morality, decency and propriety and say,  \"That's\r\n\r\nit.   This  is what I say should be your morals and  you  comply\r\n\r\nwith  it.\"   Equally, under sub-paragraph (c), he  is  asked  to\r\n\r\ndecide whether it has any merit, value or importance in relation\r\n\r\nto literary, artistic, social, cultural, educational, scientific\r\n\r\nor other matters.  Is he equipped, Mr Speaker, Sir, to make this\r\n\r\njudgment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is time for us to trust our people to\r\n\r\ntake  judgments on what is good for the society as a  whole  and\r\n\r\nnot  to  continue to behave as though the members of the society\r\n\r\ncannot  make  any  judgment  or  decision  for  themselves   but\r\n\r\neverything must be made for them.  I think it was not very  long\r\n\r\nago,  the Economist  wrote about the Singapore nanny.   I  think\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  can try and do a little less with the nanny  taking\r\n\r\ncharge of everything for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been suggestions that perhaps a committee should\r\n\r\nbe  set up now which will decide questions of morality and other\r\n\r\nquestions as to whether any views or books are likely  to  cause\r\n\r\nfeelings  of  enmity,  hatred,  ill-will  or  hostility  between\r\n\r\ndifferent racial or religious groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would add my plea, the plea that has been made, that\r\n\r\nthe  questions  that I have raised should not  be  left  to  the\r\n\r\ndecision of one person but it is time that we set up a board  of\r\n\r\npersons.  We have the Inter-Religious Advisory Board.   We  have\r\n\r\nother  boards.  Is it not possible for us to get their  help  to\r\n\r\nformulate  standards of morality and decency  that  the  society\r\n\r\nshould  follow?  I would urge the Minister that  he  should  not\r\n\r\nmove on to the Third Reading of the Bill this afternoon but that\r\n\r\nhe  should refer the Bill to a Select Committee now so that  the\r\n\r\nviews of the community may be heard as to what they think of the\r\n\r\nBill  and  its  definitions and, particularly, people  from  the\r\n\r\nliterary  and  artistic bodies, cultural bodies and  educational\r\n\r\nbodies be heard on what should be considered as objectionable or\r\n\r\neven obscene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a difficult question to decide what\r\n\r\nis obscene.  To many, it would appear that the human body itself\r\n\r\nis  obscene  if there is a drawing of the human body.   Is  that\r\n\r\nwhat  we  consider  obscene?  Sometimes,  I  am  surprised  when\r\n\r\npersons  are  charged with an obscene act where it would  appear\r\n\r\nthat  displaying the human body is considered to be  an  obscene\r\n\r\nact.  So my plea is that the Bill should be referred to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  the  views of the community heard  and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not rush into passing this Bill this afternoon.  But  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  possible, then consideration should be  given  to\r\n\r\nfinding other ways than to consign the judgment on these matters\r\n\r\njust  to  a  single person.  And even if that is not acceptable,\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to providing for a  system  of  an\r\n\r\nappeal to an independent board or body that will then be able to\r\n\r\npronounce on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to\r\n\r\nthank Members for making very thoughtful and helpful suggestions\r\n\r\non the Bill and for the general support of its provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take Mr Chew Heng Ching's basic question.\r\n\r\nDoes  this  Bill  signify a change of policy on  censorship?   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is the key question we must ask.  Are we tightening\r\n\r\nor  are  we loosening?  In fact, it is neither.  It is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  this Bill to re-calibrate the general  policy  of\r\n\r\ncensorship  in  Singapore.  This issue we reopen once  every  10\r\n\r\nyears.   We had a review in 1981.  The last review was by  Prof.\r\n\r\nTommy  Koh  in 1992 and, in that review, they went  through  the\r\n\r\nfull  range  films, magazines, newspapers, the performing  arts.\r\n\r\nAnd  many  Members are not aware that in fact there is quite  an\r\n\r\nelaborate  mechanism  to  help the controllers.   Assisting  the\r\n\r\ncontrollers, we have in fact an Advisory Panel consisting  of  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of individuals drawn from a broad cross-section  of\r\n\r\nour  society, men and women, different religions, different  age\r\n\r\ngroups, different professions, different marital status in order\r\n\r\nthat  for  different  categories,  like  for  cartoons  and  for\r\n\r\ndifferent  language publications, we have a group of fair-minded\r\n\r\njury  men  who will advise the controllers on their work,  their\r\n\r\ninternal guidelines and these guidelines are reviewed from  time\r\n\r\nto time to adjust to changing mores and to the changing patterns\r\n\r\nin the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision for appeal to the Minister. In fact,\r\n\r\nvery few appeals come to me.  And even when they do come to  me,\r\n\r\nI would always cause it to be referred to a Publications Appeals\r\n\r\nCommittee  chaired by Prof. Eddie Kuo.  And it  is  very  rarely\r\n\r\nthat  I  disagree with their recommendations.  I am not sure  if\r\n\r\nMembers or indeed members of the public are aware of who are  in\r\n\r\nthe  Publications Appeals Committee and the Advisory  Panel.   I\r\n\r\nthink  I would now ask my officers, in order to reassure members\r\n\r\nof  the  public  and  Members of the House that  in  fact  these\r\n\r\ndecisions are not taken in isolation, to publish a list  of  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  involved and they are long lists consisting  of\r\n\r\nvery upright, fair-minded people in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is not to review censorship\r\n\r\nprovisions  or to change the way we censor books  or  comics  or\r\n\r\npublications.  It is to catch up with multimedia technology, and\r\n\r\ncatching up with multimedia technology is breathtaking.  I think\r\n\r\nall  of  us, as individuals, find it hard enough, and trying  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a certain level of censorship in this day and age  with\r\n\r\nthe Internet, with CD-ROMS, with VCDs, is an uphill task.  So we\r\n\r\nhave  got  to adopt a very practical approach in the way  we  go\r\n\r\nabout doing this.  The purist would say why not we start afresh.\r\n\r\nAs  Prof.  Chin  said,  how can there be a  distinction  in  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  media between film, publication, video  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThat  may  be.   But  frankly,  the  Internet  phenomenon,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  which  is a very recent phenomenon, has  exploded  so\r\n\r\nrapidly  that  no  jurisdiction  in  the  world,  no  regulatory\r\n\r\nauthority in the world, has been able to fully catch up with it,\r\n\r\nand  the  debate  is still swirling in all four corners  of  the\r\n\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is our general approach? Our general approach is\r\n\r\nnot to try and clean up the universe and anticipate all problems\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the  electronic media.  That is not  possible.   Our\r\n\r\nbasic philosophical approach is to creep.  In other words, where\r\n\r\ndo we start from?  We are used to films.  And in the old days, a\r\n\r\nfilm  was a film.  It was a simple world.  Now films have become\r\n\r\nelectronic.  Films are no longer on reels.  They are on  videos.\r\n\r\nThey  are on CDs, VCDs, LCDs and what have you.  So what we have\r\n\r\ntried  to  do is to creep from various acts into the  electronic\r\n\r\nmedia.   Recently, we updated the Singapore Broadcasting Act  to\r\n\r\ntake into account some of the new multimedia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Newspaper and Publishing Act which also creeps\r\n\r\ninto  the electronic media.  We have the Films Act which  creeps\r\n\r\nin the same direction.  We have the Undesirable Publications Act\r\n\r\ntoday which also tries to creep in that direction.  Yes, in  the\r\n\r\npure  world of cyberspace, they all converge.  But in  the  real\r\n\r\nworld,  it will take some time before they converge and it  will\r\n\r\ntake  some time before our wisdom catches up with the challenges\r\n\r\nposed  to  us  by this new technology.  So it is in that  spirit\r\n\r\nthat I table this Bill to you for your support and approval, not\r\n\r\nto ask for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange of policy on censorship, but please, to allow me to amend\r\n\r\nthe  law so that we keep up with the technology, so that we  can\r\n\r\nmaintain as best we can the level of censorship that we are used\r\n\r\nto and which our community is comfortable with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, from time to time, our standards will change and\r\n\r\nshift.   Lady Chatterley's Lover, once upon a time, shocked  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Today, it is a subject of historical study.   So  we\r\n\r\nmove  on.   Every  10 years, perhaps we take a  step  back.   We\r\n\r\nappoint  an ecumenical council, gather all the Bishops  together\r\n\r\nand  say, \"Okay, let us make new pronouncements.\"  But we cannot\r\n\r\nbe  doing this year by year.  In the meantime, we have a  system\r\n\r\nwhich  has worked well, which is practical in its administrative\r\n\r\nsimplicity,  which has served us well.  And why do I  say  that?\r\n\r\nBecause so few appeals in the end come up to me, which is a sure\r\n\r\nsign that, by and large, Singaporeans are quite comfortable with\r\n\r\nthe way the present system is operating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether this Bill will place\r\n\r\nadditional  burdens  on Internet Service Providers  (ISPs).   In\r\n\r\nfact,   ISPs  are  regulated  in  detail  under  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Act and they are not required to blank  out  sites\r\n\r\nunless  instructed  to  do  so  by  the  Singapore  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAuthority.  We allow them to pass  through websites,  but  there\r\n\r\ncould  be  a conflict with this particular Bill.  We will  study\r\n\r\nthis  in  greater detail and if there is a need to, I  will,  by\r\n\r\nspecial  exemption, exclude Internet Service Providers from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of what is \"obscene\" and what is\r\n\r\n\"objectionable\", Dr Toh See Kiat proposed a form of  words.   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  takes  objection  to  the  existing  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"objectionable\".  We can argue till the cows come home.  We will\r\n\r\nnever  agree  as  to what constitutes \"objectionable\"  and  what\r\n\r\nconstitutes   \"obscenity\".   Even  we  ourselves  in   different\r\n\r\nsettings  and  on different days may hold different  views.   It\r\n\r\ndepends so much on the context, on the mood, on the exigencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  day.   It  is a futile exercise to  try  to  codify  so\r\n\r\nprecisely that a computer can interpret it.  It is not possible.\r\n\r\nIn  the  end,  it  is  a judgment by human  beings,  for  it  is\r\n\r\nquintessentially a human matter.  And for this reason,  we  have\r\n\r\nestablished  committees of jurymen who advise  us  and,  in  the\r\n\r\nmain, we will go by their advice.  And we accept that, from time\r\n\r\nto time, as members in the committees change, as the public mood\r\n\r\nchanges,  their  views will also change and we creep  along.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is the wisest approach to take.  It is  the  method\r\n\r\nwhich will set us most at ease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we as parents, as teachers, are uncomfortable, then we\r\n\r\ncan  have a debate in this House.  We can write letters  to  the\r\n\r\npress.    We   can  post  messages  to  the  various  regulatory\r\n\r\nauthorities.   We can write to the Minister.  We  can  see  MPs.\r\n\r\nAnd  all  these things will be taken into account, as they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sent to me from time to time, and then incremental changes\r\n\r\nare  made.   There  is no need for dramatic moves  or  gestures.\r\n\r\nWhat  we have inherited has served us well.  Let us just  modify\r\n\r\nit,  tinker with it at the margins and move along.  This is  not\r\n\r\nthe time for us to make a major review of censorship policies in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various MPs have asked whether there are provisions to\r\n\r\nallow  book  importers to submit in advance  samples  of  books,\r\n\r\nmagazines or comics which they hope to import, so that they will\r\n\r\nnot  be caught afoul of the law.  In fact, this is already done.\r\n\r\nThis  is  already the practice.  There already  exists  a  close\r\n\r\nworking  relationship  between the  controllers  and  importers.\r\n\r\nThey  are  called down for briefings regularly.   We  show  them\r\n\r\nsamples  of  what is at the margin,  of what is  acceptable  and\r\n\r\nwhat is not.  When they submit samples, administratively, within\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks,  a  reply  goes back to them.  We  will  even  allow\r\n\r\nsubmissions  made in manuscript so that we can respond  quickly.\r\n\r\nOur  idea  is not to place an additional hurdle on their  trade,\r\n\r\nbut to facilitate their work.  This is not a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether our fees are excessive, no. They are just to cover\r\n\r\nadministrative costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked whether it is possible to make\r\n\r\nobjectionable language an explicit provision in the Bill.   This\r\n\r\nis  not necessary because in our determination of what should be\r\n\r\nprohibited, of what is obscene and objectionable, language is an\r\n\r\nintegral  part of the determination process.  You  cannot,  when\r\n\r\nyou  are looking at the CD,  video, reading a book, magazine  or\r\n\r\ncomic  take the language out of it.  The language is an integral\r\n\r\npart  of it.  It is part of the context and will always be taken\r\n\r\ninto account.  So I am more than happy to make this assurance to\r\n\r\nMr Shriniwas Rai and to my colleagues in the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is certainly not our intention to tighten our\r\n\r\nstandards  so  as  to  make it more difficult  for  artists  and\r\n\r\ncreative individuals to explore new possibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there checks against abuses? I have already explained\r\n\r\nearlier that every controller has a panel to advise him.   Under\r\n\r\nthe  law, you can appeal to the Minister, and the Minister  will\r\n\r\nfirst  cause  that appeal to be run through the  advisory  panel\r\n\r\nbefore he makes a final decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked for consistent interpretation of the\r\n\r\nword \"obscene\" under this Bill and as it is written in the Penal\r\n\r\nCode.  I am not a legal expert but the lawyers tell me that they\r\n\r\nare  entirely  consistent with the common law interpretation  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  obscene,  and  we  go by it.   And  certainly  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation, there is no desire to have inconsistency between\r\n\r\nthese two laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sympathetic to Mr Tay's call for the process of\r\n\r\ndetermining what is objectionable and what is obscene to be made\r\n\r\nsomewhat more formal.  I think for a start    I am not  sure  if\r\n\r\nit is already made known to members of the public, but the lists\r\n\r\nof  members  in  the  various panels and committees  are  freely\r\n\r\navailable  this evening, I will ask my officers to release  them\r\n\r\nto  the media, so that we know who are the individuals  who  are\r\n\r\nsetting standards for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether we could provide the lists of\r\n\r\nmaterials  which are considered objectionable.  These lists  are\r\n\r\nmade known to the trade and we make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  freely available to the public.  I will certainly consider\r\n\r\nposting them on the Internet as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is gazetted is gazetted. So that is clearly available\r\n\r\nin  the  public  domain.   What is objectionable  is  often  not\r\n\r\npossible  to determine beforehand.  Take, for example,  Playboy.\r\n\r\nWe  all  know  what  Playboy is.  So that is  gazetted.   It  is\r\n\r\nbanned.  But there are any number of obscene magazines that  are\r\n\r\nfar  worse than Playboy, which are not banned, because  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  come across them yet.  We do not know what the titles  are.\r\n\r\nSo  they  are roughly classified under objectionable  materials.\r\n\r\nBy   definition,  it  is  not  possible  for  us  to  list   all\r\n\r\nobjectionable  materials.   They  are  listed  as  a  class   of\r\n\r\nmaterials.   But  what  we  have already  objected  to,  we  can\r\n\r\ncertainly  list  them  and that list should  certainly  be  made\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung was concerned whether the evidence\r\n\r\nplaced before a controller is open ended or whether there  is  a\r\n\r\ncertain due process which allows the importer or the person  who\r\n\r\nis  disadvantaged to challenge it or to make  appeals.   I  have\r\n\r\nalready explained that the controller does not make the decision\r\n\r\non  his  own.   He  is  guided by internal  guidelines  and,  in\r\n\r\nmarginal  cases,  by  committees  of  jurymen.   And  there   is\r\n\r\nprovision  for appeal and I am further guided by a committee  of\r\n\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin was also concerned about the Films (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill which has been postponed to the next sitting of Parliament.\r\n\r\nHe   reads  into  that  Bill  a  special  provision  for   child\r\n\r\npornography  and he asked why there is no special provision  for\r\n\r\nchild pornography in the Undesirable Publications Act.  In fact,\r\n\r\nthere is no special provision for child pornography in the Films\r\n\r\nAct  about which we will have a debate later.  The provision  in\r\n\r\nthat Bill is to provide special penalties for those who make use\r\n\r\nof  children either to assist in the making of a film or in  the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  a film which we consider to be  objectionable.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  cover the use of children acting in  pornographic\r\n\r\nfilms.   In fact, in both Acts, there is no intention to make  a\r\n\r\nspecial definition of \"child\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npornography\".   Pornography  is  pornography.   It   varies   in\r\n\r\ngravity.   It  does  not  mean that just  because  it  is  child\r\n\r\npornography,  it  must be worse than all other categories.   You\r\n\r\ncan  find  some  really  depraved  materials  involving  incest,\r\n\r\nbestiality, the whole range which afflicts the human  condition.\r\n\r\nWe have not tried to identify these special categories either in\r\n\r\nthe UPA or in the Films Act.  Administratively, what we do is to\r\n\r\ncommunicate  our concerns to the prosecutors.  They  would  take\r\n\r\nthe depravity of the pornographic material into account and I am\r\n\r\nsure  the  judges  too  will take this  into  account  in  their\r\n\r\njudgments and in the penalties that they mete out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we should abolish the distinction between films,\r\n\r\npublications  and  broadcast, I have already  explained  earlier\r\n\r\nthat  while  there  may  be a case for this  in  the  electronic\r\n\r\nmultimedia, in the practical world, we start from where  we  are\r\n\r\nand   the problems that we face today, even though we are  quite\r\n\r\nsure  that in the future, the electronic media will be a  source\r\n\r\nof  many of the problems.  What I envisage is that, from time to\r\n\r\ntime, our various Acts will have to be updated and maybe at some\r\n\r\npoint,  they  may  have to be fused.  But this must  take  place\r\n\r\nslowly and through a process of evolution.  It is very difficult\r\n\r\nto   attempt  a  comprehensive  omnibus  Bill  encompassing  all\r\n\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked whether e-mails and faxes are covered\r\n\r\nunder  publications.  Yes, they are.  And if they are broadcast,\r\n\r\nthen they are also covered under the Singapore Broadcasting Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked whether the Act covers Internet\r\n\r\npublications  for which it is difficult to decide  whether  they\r\n\r\nare in intermediate form or final form.  On electronic magazines\r\n\r\nor e-zines, they do.  If you read the words carefully, under the\r\n\r\nvarious limbs, and under the various modes of transmission, they\r\n\r\ncover  the whole gamut.  But if there is a need to make  further\r\n\r\nclarifications later, because the technology keeps on  springing\r\n\r\nup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew surprises, then we will make the necessary amendments later.\r\n\r\nBut for the time being, there is no need to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Toh's question as to why there is a difference in the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"supply\"  here and in the  Films  Act,  that  is\r\n\r\nbecause the intrinsic media, as they are now, are different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have covered all the points\r\n\r\nraised by Members.  I would just like to make one further  point\r\n\r\nby  way of conclusion that, however hard we try, censorship will\r\n\r\nnot  seal  us hermetically from the world outside.  We know  the\r\n\r\nchallenges which the Internet poses to us and to the young.  But\r\n\r\nthere  is  also the postal service where you can put  things  in\r\n\r\nbrown  paper envelopes.  There are fax machines and there is  e-mail.   In  the end, what we are trying to do is to  distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween  different  configurations of bits and  bytes  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"This  configuration I disallow.\"  It is not an easy  task.   It\r\n\r\ncan  only become more difficult in the future.  But what we  can\r\n\r\ndo  is  from  time  to time to take certain symbolic  stands  to\r\n\r\naffirm   what  is  objectionable,  not  because  we  can  object\r\n\r\ncompletely to their existence, but to make a point to  ourselves\r\n\r\nand to the young that we look up to certain standards and we  do\r\n\r\nnot  try  to  legitimise everything which we  are  not  able  to\r\n\r\ncontrol.   That  really  underlies the  philosophy  of  all  our\r\n\r\nvarious   attempts  at  censoring  publications  and  films   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, may I ask the Minister by way of\r\n\r\nclarification?  He assures us that there are advisory panels and\r\n\r\nthe  like.  But does he not think that there is a big difference\r\n\r\nbetween having advisory panels and a board or a committee  which\r\n\r\nmakes  the decision and which can hear representations from  the\r\n\r\npeople who wish to put out the publication?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, the mechanism by which we\r\n\r\nbring  in  public opinion and allow for standards and benchmarks\r\n\r\nto shift from time to time was examined in great detail by Prof.\r\n\r\nTommy  Koh's Censorship Review Committee in 1992.

But what we really want is  a  mechanism\r\n\r\nwhich  is  speedy and practical.  There are very few  complaints\r\n\r\ntoday  from  the  trade.  As I have mentioned to  the  House,  I\r\n\r\nmyself have received very few complaints.  We do not really want\r\n\r\nto  make the process so complicated.  Members will be amazed  at\r\n\r\nthe  number  of magazines and comic books that run  through  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the censors.  My guiding principle is that they should\r\n\r\nnot  increase  their  staff.  In the old days,  they  would  run\r\n\r\nthrough every video tape.  It is not possible now.  And when you\r\n\r\ncan  put  the  whole Encyclopedia Britannica into a  few  disks,\r\n\r\ntrying to censor everything is impossible.  We do it selectively\r\n\r\nand in a practical way.  We have a practical mechanism in place.\r\n\r\nIt is not broken.  There is no need to fix it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this Bill is to enable the Government\r\n\r\nto implement the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system.  Managing\r\n\r\ndemand for road use is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  and  key strategy in our integrated approach  towards\r\n\r\nmeeting our future transportation needs. We do this in two ways:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, ownership restraint measures which include\r\n\r\nthe Vehicle Quota System (VQS) and fiscal measures like ARF,\r\n\r\ncustoms duty and road tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, usage management measures like the Area Licensing\r\n\r\nScheme (ALS) and Road Pricing Scheme (RPS).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ownership restraint measures, principally the VQS, has\r\n\r\nenabled us to cap the growth of the vehicle population to 3% per\r\n\r\nannum.   Our  vehicle population today stands at about  680,000,\r\n\r\nabout  double  the population ten years ago. We could  not  have\r\n\r\nsustained  this  rate of growth if we had not during  this  same\r\n\r\nperiod implemented the various road pricing schemes like the ALS\r\n\r\nand RPS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accumulated 23 years of experience in road pricing.\r\n\r\nWe  implemented the ALS for the Central Business District  (CBD)\r\n\r\nsince  1975.  In the last two years, we extended the concept  to\r\n\r\nthe expressways with RPS.  The decades of experience have proven\r\n\r\nbeyond  doubt  what most transport economists and town  planners\r\n\r\nhave  long  advocated, that road pricing is an effective  policy\r\n\r\nfor dealing with traffic congestion. Traffic conditions improved\r\n\r\nsignificantly after road pricing. Motorists were willing to make\r\n\r\nchanges to their travel patterns, and viable travel alternatives\r\n\r\nin  the form of bus and rail were available for commuters.    By\r\n\r\nmaking the true cost of driving transparent, motorists have been\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  choose a different route, destination,  time  of\r\n\r\ntravel,  or  even to decide not to make that trip at  all.  Some\r\n\r\nhave  also car-pooled, others have used public transport.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  choose to pay have been rewarded with a smoother and faster\r\n\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reasons for Switching to Electronic Road Pricing System</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the current ALS and RPS schemes are manual\r\n\r\nsystems  and  they  have  several  inherent  shortcomings.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  they do not allow us to vary the road pricing  charges\r\n\r\naccording  to  the level of traffic congestion. Traffic  surveys\r\n\r\nhave shown that traffic flow during the peak hours vary, with  a\r\n\r\ndistinct peak-within-peak period. We should in theory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevy a higher rate during this peak-within-peak period.  But  we\r\n\r\ncannot do so under the manual system for practical reasons.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of licences for one would have to be increased from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  14  types.    Both the motorists  and  our  enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers would be thoroughly confused, and enforcement would  be\r\n\r\nmuch more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shortcoming of the present system is the need to\r\n\r\noperate  and  maintain  a  wide distribution  network  including\r\n\r\nroadside  booths  and  petrol  stations  to  sell  the   ALS/RPS\r\n\r\nlicences.  From the motorists' point of view, the need  to  look\r\n\r\nfor such outlets is always a major hassle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP system will overcome the shortcomings of the manual\r\n\r\nsystem.  It  will allow us to charge for road usage  in  a  more\r\n\r\nflexible, efficient and equitable manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be able to implement a pricing structure that is\r\n\r\nmore  sensitive  to  the  actual  level  of  traffic  congestion\r\n\r\nexperienced on the roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system will be more convenient to motorists as it does\r\n\r\naway  with  the hassle of queuing at sales outlets  to  buy  the\r\n\r\ndaily  or  monthly  licences.  An  automated  system  will  also\r\n\r\nminimise  the  potential  for  human  error  in  the   area   of\r\n\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the ERP system will make motorists more\r\n\r\naware  of  the cost of road use. It will encourage motorists  to\r\n\r\nchoose  the  most optimal time, route and mode of transport  for\r\n\r\ntheir journeys. The result will be a reduction in the number  of\r\n\r\ntrips made by private vehicles, more efficient use of our roads,\r\n\r\nsmoother flowing traffic and less pollution. As the roads become\r\n\r\nless  congested,  we  can   review our vehicle  quotas  and,  if\r\n\r\nfeasible,   release  more COEs. Together, ERP  and  the  Vehicle\r\n\r\nQuota  System will provide a long-term sustainable and effective\r\n\r\nframework for managing the  traffic on our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken us many years to realise the ERP System, from\r\n\r\nconceptualisation to testing and now to final implementation. We\r\n\r\nfirst started discussion on the concept in 1989.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International tenders were called for contractors to design\r\n\r\nand supply the system. Tenderers were shortlisted in 1993.  Site\r\n\r\ntests  were carried out on three prototype systems in  1994  and\r\n\r\n1995, before we finally decided to go ahead with the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We virtually had to start from scratch. There was no system\r\n\r\nsimilar to what we wanted elsewhere.  We could not refer to  any\r\n\r\nother system at the time.  For example, we had some very special\r\n\r\nrequirements: the ability to process vehicles across many lanes,\r\n\r\nand  to  process  them as they are travelling at  high   speeds.\r\n\r\nThat  was  one  requirement.   We also  called  for  reliability\r\n\r\nstandards  which  were higher than currently available   in  the\r\n\r\nindustry  and,  of course, there was the  need to customise  the\r\n\r\nsystem to suit our local traffic and  weather conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ERP system has undergone extensive testing, both in the\r\n\r\nlaboratory as well as in the field, to ensure that it meets  the\r\n\r\nhighest technical standards. But as Members would appreciate, as\r\n\r\ntechnology improves, there will be the need to  upgrade  and  we\r\n\r\nwill do so, and we will improve the ERP system over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA is currently in the midst of fitting the In-vehicle\r\n\r\nUnits  (or IUs) onto all vehicles. The exercise is scheduled  to\r\n\r\nbe  completed  by July this year.  The RPS and ALS gantries  are\r\n\r\nalso being progressively replaced by the ERP gantries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>ERP Implementation Plan</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we will kick off ERP by implementing it\r\n\r\nfirst on the East Coast Parkway before we extend it to the other\r\n\r\nALS  and  RPS points.  The reason for this phased implementation\r\n\r\nis  prudent.  We want to ensure minimum hitches for  full  scale\r\n\r\noperation of this complex system.  Motorists will also  be  able\r\n\r\nto familiarise themselves with the system under this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announced recently that the two RPS points on the East\r\n\r\nCoast  Parkway,  one  at Fort Road and the other  one  at  Ophir\r\n\r\nRoad,  will be replaced by the ERP system with effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nApril this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few weeks before the ERP begins at the East\r\n\r\nCoast  Parkway  at  these two points, LTA will  be  testing  the\r\n\r\nsystem using the five sets of gantries already installed at  the\r\n\r\nEast  Coast  Parkway, the Pan-Island Expressway and the  Central\r\n\r\nExpressway.   This is to ensure that the various  equipment  and\r\n\r\nthe IUs installed on vehicles are functioning properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists are encouraged to insert Cashcards into their IUs\r\n\r\nwhen  they  drive  through the gantries.  No deduction  will  be\r\n\r\nmade.  LTA will announce details of the tests shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP rates - a matter of interest, I am sure, to Members\r\n\r\n-  are now being finalised.  LTA is monitoring the traffic  flow\r\n\r\non  our  roads,  and will set the charges based  on  the  actual\r\n\r\ntraffic  pattern at the time of implementation.   We  will  also\r\n\r\nmake  full use of the flexibility of the ERP system to implement\r\n\r\n`shoulder  pricing',  in  other words,  to  implement  different\r\n\r\npricing within the peak period and the period just outside that,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  to spread out the traffic evenly during  the  RPS\r\n\r\noperational hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, as I mentioned earlier, our experience has\r\n\r\nshown  that  road pricing works.  It helps to bring  about  free\r\n\r\nflow  of  traffic on our roads.  The ERP will be  more  than  an\r\n\r\nimprovement over the manual system of road pricing.   With  ERP,\r\n\r\nwe   are   able  to  fine-tune  the  charges  to  respond   more\r\n\r\nspecifically to the times and areas of congestion.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we will revise our vehicle tax structure and introduce  a\r\n\r\npackage of road tax rebates in order to shift more of the  fixed\r\n\r\ncost of owning a vehicle to the discretionary cost of using  it.\r\n\r\nI  will  be  announcing details of the new vehicle tax structure\r\n\r\nand   the  road  tax  rebate  package  together  with  the   ERP\r\n\r\nimplementation plan next month before the Budget debate.  Before\r\n\r\nwe are able to make the requisite changes, we will have to amend\r\n\r\nthe Road Traffic Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications to prescribe road-user charges to be paid by  the\r\n\r\nvehicle driver in connection with the use of any specified road.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister may also make rules to specify the roads for which\r\n\r\nroad-user  charges  will be levied, the days  and  hours  during\r\n\r\nwhich a road-user charge is levied, the different charge amounts\r\n\r\nfor  the different roads, hours of the day, days of the week and\r\n\r\nvehicle  classes or descriptions, and the manner  in  which  the\r\n\r\nroad-user charges are levied and collected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 also provides for the Registrar of Vehicles to\r\n\r\nrequire a vehicle owner to produce his vehicle for inspection of\r\n\r\nthe In-vehicle Unit (IU).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill empowers an employee of the LTA to\r\n\r\nrequire  a vehicle owner to furnish the identity and address  of\r\n\r\nthe  driver of his vehicle who is suspected to be guilty  of  an\r\n\r\noffence under the Road Traffic Act or its rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill makes a vehicle owner liable for any\r\n\r\noffence  under the new Part IA of the Road Traffic  Act  or  its\r\n\r\nrules,  committed using his vehicle unless at the  time  of  the\r\n\r\noffence his vehicle was stolen or illegally taken or used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Road Traffic Act is overseen by both the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications and the Minster for Home Affairs, clauses  6\r\n\r\nto  9  of  the  Bill  allow the Minister for  Communications  to\r\n\r\nexercise the same powers under the provisions mentioned in those\r\n\r\nclauses which are within his purview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill relates to the authentication of any\r\n\r\nnotices, orders or other documents issued under the Road Traffic\r\n\r\nAct or its rules.  It allows for documents such as summonses for\r\n\r\nERP   offences  to  be  generated  automatically  with  official\r\n\r\nfacsimile or electronic signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of ERP is a significant milestone in\r\n\r\nthe  history  of  land  transport  in  Singapore.   It  marks  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  shift in the way we manage the use of our  roads  - from an ownership-biased regime to a more balanced one based  on\r\n\r\nusage  as well as ownership.  This shift is necessary to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  roads remain free from congestion to support economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  a  better quality of life for  our  people.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that the ERP system will help us manage  our  traffic\r\n\r\nproblems  well into the next century and bring us a  major  step\r\n\r\ncloser to our vision of a world-class land transport system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nto  speak in support of this Amendment Bill in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill serves to tie up some of the administrative\r\n\r\nand  legal  ends for the authorities to implement the electronic\r\n\r\nroad  pricing  system which is due to begin in  over  a  month's\r\n\r\ntime.   We  are all aware, as pointed out by the Minister,  that\r\n\r\nthis will be the first of its kind implementation programme  for\r\n\r\nthe  ERP in a big major city in the world.  Naturally there will\r\n\r\nbe  some nitty-gritty issues to tie up, especially to take  care\r\n\r\nof the people who for one reason or another do not comply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can consider some grace period at the\r\n\r\nbeginning of this phasing-in to give the benefit of the doubt to\r\n\r\nthose drivers who may forgetfully miss the important thing to do\r\n\r\non those days.  A publicity blitz instructing drivers what to do\r\n\r\nmay be necessary to sink in the message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope the Minister can also allow not too costly\r\n\r\npenalties in the beginning for offenders, in order to give  them\r\n\r\nat  least  a  chance in the event that they commit the  offence,\r\n\r\nespecially as they may not be so familiar initially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek a clarification on whether and how these\r\n\r\nlaws will apply to foreign cars, especially those from Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwhose drivers may be truly unaware of the hazards driving on the\r\n\r\nhighways  once the Amendment Bill is passed.  The  question  is,\r\n\r\nfor  those  Malaysian  cars, how to effect these  penalties,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the  Amendment Bill, when  the  owners  of  these\r\n\r\nvehicles, not necessarily the drivers, may be far away,  as  the\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill puts a lot of burden of penalties on the  owners\r\n\r\nof the vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest also that some kind of leaflets, publicity\r\n\r\nleaflets  on  the  ERP for foreign drivers,  may  be  necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso,  some kind of leaflets or publicity/introduction materials\r\n\r\non  planes may be necessary to familiarise the foreign  visitors\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas.  In particular, I am not clear about new section\r\n\r\n34E(6).   If a vehicle where the ERP device, the IU as mentioned\r\n\r\nby  the Minister just now, is faulty or caused to be faulty, the\r\n\r\nvehicle is seized, and if the vehicle after investigation is not\r\n\r\nclaimed,  it  may  be  sold and the net  proceeds  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.  Is the fault of non-compliance the fault  of\r\n\r\nthe  driver  or  the owner?  How is the burden of non-compliance\r\n\r\ndistributed  between owners and drivers?  Does pin-pointing  all\r\n\r\nthe cost and blame on the owners alone, as apparent in the Bill,\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem?  Or does it provide a loophole  for  errant\r\n\r\ndrivers  to bypass the ERP process?  Should the Bill  not  place\r\n\r\nsome responsibility on the drivers who do not comply?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section of the Amendment Bill, new section 34B\r\n\r\nmentioned that the Minister may prescribe road-user charges.  As\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Minister just now, he intends  to  make  this\r\n\r\nannouncement of the scheme of charges in the coming  Budget.   I\r\n\r\nthank  the  Minister for pre-empting this point and in believing\r\n\r\nthat  this  principle of neutrality that he has  announced,  the\r\n\r\nscheme  of  charges would be such as to generate neutral  budget\r\n\r\nvalues.   If that is the case, I wonder whether it is  at  least\r\n\r\npossible  to  consider announcing this scheme  of  charges  even\r\n\r\nearlier, to let the public be informed on these various  schemes\r\n\r\nof charges and adjustments so that there is ample time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the members of the public to re-evaluate switching transport\r\n\r\nmode and for making investment decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill, but\r\n\r\nI have two simple points to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the new sections 34C and 34D refer to \"such\r\n\r\nelectronic or computerised or other facilities\".  Because of the\r\n\r\nejusdem  generis principle of statutory interpretation, I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is not sufficiently broad to cover technologies which  may\r\n\r\nuse, for example, optics (or light), microwave, radar, sonic  or\r\n\r\nother  non-electronic telecommunication media. Our  ERP  devices\r\n\r\nwould  be  using all these technologies too, I suppose,  and  in\r\n\r\nfact  there is a word which would be broad enough to  cover  all\r\n\r\nthese technologies.  It is a word which is used in section 65 of\r\n\r\nthe  Evidence  Act.  I refer to the word \"telematic\"  and  would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister to consider inserting that word in front  of\r\n\r\nthe word \"electronic\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I refer to the new section 139A and would like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  clarify  that \"an official  facsimile\"  of  a\r\n\r\nsignature would have certain control measures and safeguards  to\r\n\r\nprevent fraudulent notices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern again is with\r\n\r\nthe  concentration of power, and before I finish, I  propose  to\r\n\r\nread what a former Deputy Prime Minister of this Government  had\r\n\r\nto say about this.  I see under the new amendment, clause 3, new\r\n\r\nsection 34B, \"The Minister may prescribe road-user charges to be\r\n\r\npaid  in  connection with the user of any specified road.\"   And\r\n\r\nthen  under  the  new  section 34D, he  is  allowed  to  specify\r\n\r\ndifferent charges for different time users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 143 of the Constitution enacts that no tax or levy\r\n\r\nmay be imposed, except upon the authority of law.  Of course, it\r\n\r\nmay  be  argued that section 34B is the authority.   But  it  is\r\n\r\nquestionable whether this complies with that Article because the\r\n\r\nMinister would appear to be given a carte blanche as to what the\r\n\r\ncharge  or charges should be.  If he is in a generous  mood,  he\r\n\r\nmight reduce it.  If he is not in a generous mood, he might just\r\n\r\nup it.  Is it right that a Minister should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven the power to decide what tax or levy should be imposed  on\r\n\r\ncitizens   in   Singapore  when  under  the   Constitution   the\r\n\r\nrequirement is that it should first be authorised by  a  written\r\n\r\nlaw,  that  is,  law  passed  by  Parliament?   Should  not  the\r\n\r\nprescribed  road-user  charges be first approved  by  Parliament\r\n\r\nbefore they are put into use or collected from road-users?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is again this concentration of power in the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  as  seen under the new section 34E, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\n\"The  Registrar may remove any device or appurtenance  which  he\r\n\r\nconsiders to be fitted in contravention of any of the provisions\r\n\r\nof this Part or the rules made under this section.\"  There would\r\n\r\nappear  to  be no recourse for any owner or driver  against  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Registrar or authorised officer.  Subsection (4)\r\n\r\ndeals  with  a  person who fails to comply with a notice  issued\r\n\r\nunder  subsection  (1) who shall be guilty of an  offence  which\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that a person who fails to comply with the notice\r\n\r\nshall  be  prosecuted  in  court.   But  subsection  (1)  merely\r\n\r\nrequires  the  person on whom notice is served  to  produce  the\r\n\r\nvehicle,  and  by  subsection (4), if he does  not  produce  the\r\n\r\nvehicle,  then he may be prosecuted.  Subsection  (4)  does  not\r\n\r\nseem  to apply to subsection (3) where the Registrar decides  to\r\n\r\nremove  any device or appurtenance fitted into the car.   Is  it\r\n\r\nnot,  again  may I ask, right that a right of appeal  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the aggrieved person, not to the Minister or  to  any\r\n\r\nother  higher officer, but to the court so that the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe Registrar may be challenged in the court?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at the beginning that I was going to quote what a\r\n\r\nformer Deputy Prime Minister of this Government had to say about\r\n\r\nthe  concentration of power.  May I just read what he said,  and\r\n\r\nthis is none other than Dr Toh Chin Chye who was a former Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.  And he was reported to have said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now everything is centralised and the computer databanks\r\n\r\nmake  it  easier  for  more and more power to  be  concentrated.\r\n\r\nAnyone  who applies for a job now has to fill in a form  with  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  history.   Everybody  carries  an  identity  card  and\r\n\r\neverything is in the computer.  I see that even people who  take\r\n\r\nvideo tapes of people's weddings now have to get a licence.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount of control is just fantastic.  The danger is that we have\r\n\r\nno  check  on the use of power.  [May I repeat that, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, \"the danger is that we have no check on the use of power.\"]\r\n\r\nYet,  few people understand the significance of this.  They  are\r\n\r\njust resigned to it.  It is called democratic centralism.  Well,\r\n\r\nit is centralised, all right, but it is far from democratic.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Minister for Information and the Arts, in\r\n\r\nmoving  his Bill, said, \"I have very few appeals.  I  have  very\r\n\r\nfew  objections.\"  Perhaps, I should have read this to him then.\r\n\r\nIs  it  because  our people have become resigned  to  all  these\r\n\r\ncontrols  and feel that they are just helpless in  the  face  of\r\n\r\npower that is overwhelming?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  once  the  Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill is passed  today,\r\n\r\nland transportation in Singapore will enter a new era.  It means\r\n\r\nthat from now onwards the Government can levy any charges on the\r\n\r\nmotorists at any time and  anywhere, or to increase the levy  on\r\n\r\nany particular stretch of road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries in the world, when the government levies\r\n\r\ncharges or tolls on the motorists, it is to recover the cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction of the road.  In Singapore, our cars are  the  most\r\n\r\nexpensive  in  the world.  The Government has  imposed  so  much\r\n\r\ntaxes  on the cars that they far exceed the cost of construction\r\n\r\nof  the roads.  It does not  have to resort to levies to recover\r\n\r\nthe  construction  cost.  It is said that the experts are of the\r\n\r\nopinion that road pricing could help to  alleviate congestion on\r\n\r\nthe  road.   I am not an expert.  But I know that the system  is\r\n\r\noperated  in Singapore in such a way that whenever  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncongestion  on  any  particular  stretch  of  the  highway,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   would levy charges for the use of this  stretch  of\r\n\r\nroad.  If  there is still congestion despite the levy, the  levy\r\n\r\nwill  be increased again and again until  such a point when  the\r\n\r\nmotorists  find it  too expensive to drive through that  stretch\r\n\r\nof  road,  and  avoid  passing there. Then,  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\ncongestion and traffic will be flowing smoothly.  However,  when\r\n\r\nthe  motorists do not use that stretch  of  road, they will have\r\n\r\nto  use other alternative roads.  As a result,  congestion  will\r\n\r\nbe transferred to another part of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  what would happen?  Eventually, are we going to have  road\r\n\r\npricing  on  each and every road in Singapore  and  to  keep  on\r\n\r\nincreasing the charges so that there will be no more congestion?\r\n\r\nIs that a rational solution?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the Government used the excuse of controlling car\r\n\r\npopulation  in Singapore to implement the COE system,  resulting\r\n\r\nin  the  cost  of  owning a car in Singapore  being  exorbitant.\r\n\r\nNow,  with the quota system in place,  the Government says  that\r\n\r\nwith  the  introduction of  the ERP system, more  COEs  will  be\r\n\r\nissued  so  that more people can own cars.  So on the one  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  Government says it wants to restrict the growth of the  car\r\n\r\npopulation  in order to ease congestion, yet on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nit is going to issue more COEs to increase the number of cars on\r\n\r\nthe  road.   The  fact   is that the Government  is  encouraging\r\n\r\npeople to buy cars, and when there are too many cars on the road\r\n\r\nresulting in congestion, it would find justification in imposing\r\n\r\nheavier  charges  for the use of the road,   and  the  motorists\r\n\r\nwill have to pay more to the Government.  Apart from paying road\r\n\r\ntax for owning a car, the motorists have to pay again every time\r\n\r\nthey  use the roads.  This means multiple charges on the people,\r\n\r\nand more revenue to the  Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are well-to-do, these road charges mean\r\n\r\nnothing to them.  They can afford it, and by paying these  extra\r\n\r\ncharges, they enjoy congestion-free travelling on the road.  But\r\n\r\nfor those who have to depend on their vehicles for their work or\r\n\r\nto  earn a living, the burden would be so heavy!  So, is this  a\r\n\r\nfair  system?  The elite from the PAP Government introduced this\r\n\r\nsystem  to  reap  in   more  levies and  more  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But they do not seem to have solved the problem  of\r\n\r\ncongestion  on  the  road.   It  seems  that   the  Government's\r\n\r\nsolution  is basically to squeeze more money from the motorists.\r\n\r\nSqueeze  them until they could not afford it, give  up  driving,\r\n\r\nand    sell  their cars.  The Government will then say that  the\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion problem is now solved!  The policy of the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  is to have this pricing mechanism.  Levying  charges\r\n\r\nto  deter motorists from driving has very little effect  on  the\r\n\r\nwealthy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople.   But it certainly increases the burden of the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens.   Under  this  monetary policy and  with  the  charges\r\n\r\nincreasing, of course, the cost of doing business  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill   keep   on  rising.   This  will  definitely  affect   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first of all thank\r\n\r\nthe two speakers who supported the provisions of the Bill.  They\r\n\r\nhave  raised  several queries which I would like  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen asked several questions concerning the\r\n\r\npublicity  for  the ERP system.  I do share  with  Mr  Chay  his\r\n\r\nconcerns about having adequate publicity and this is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  I  have asked the LTA to launch a publicity campaign before\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of  the  ERP.  And  this  public  education\r\n\r\nprogramme was in fact started last year when the fitting of  the\r\n\r\nIn-vehicle  Units  (IUs)  was  started,  I  think,  sometime  in\r\n\r\nSeptember.  During this publicity programme, motorists  will  be\r\n\r\neducated  not just on the operation of the system but  also  the\r\n\r\ntechnical functions of the In-vehicle Unit.  Members may  recall\r\n\r\nthere  were  information booklets that  were  sent  to  all  the\r\n\r\nmotorists.   There was also a publicity blitz on television  and\r\n\r\nnewspapers  to explain the rationale for the ERP scheme  and  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  awareness  of the ERP  scheme.   Obviously,  that\r\n\r\nmessage  has not got through to Mr Low Thia Khiang  and  I  will\r\n\r\ndeal with his concerns later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publicity for motorists will not stop here of course\r\n\r\nbecause  we are going to implement the scheme in April which  is\r\n\r\nonly 1 1/2 months away.  LTA would be stepping up  the  publicity\r\n\r\nprogramme.   In  the  next  week, they will  be  announcing  the\r\n\r\ntesting  of the IUs whereby motorists will be invited  to  drive\r\n\r\nthrough  the  gantries in order to allow motorists a  chance  to\r\n\r\nactually make use of the IUs, to test them and be familiar  with\r\n\r\nthe  system.  The LTA will be giving some details on this  later\r\n\r\non.  Closer to the time of the implementation, which is sometime\r\n\r\nin March, the publicity will be stepped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked about the foreign cars, what is going to\r\n\r\nhappen to foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotorists.   By this, I mean Malaysian motorists in  particular.\r\n\r\nMalaysian  motorists  will be subject  to  the  same  rules  and\r\n\r\ncharges  as  our local motorists.  So long as they use  the  ERP\r\n\r\nprice roads, they will be subject to the same charges.  And this\r\n\r\nis in fact no different from the current manual system where all\r\n\r\nthe  ALS/RPS charges are also applicable to Malaysian motorists.\r\n\r\nWe  recognise the fact that Malaysian motorists do not  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore so frequently and they may not be aware or subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  same  campaign of publicity blitz.  We have therefore  made\r\n\r\nspecial provisions to distribute brochures and leaflets  at  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  as well as at the Tuas Checkpoint.  So every Malaysian\r\n\r\nmotorist coming in over the last few months has been given  this\r\n\r\nbrochure in order to make the Malaysian motorists more aware  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is the ERP system, where they can fit the In-vehicle  Unit\r\n\r\nif  they wish to, if they are frequent visitors to Singapore, or\r\n\r\nif they do not wish to, where they can get a temporary IU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that we may want to consider giving\r\n\r\nsome  publicity to those non-Malaysian motorists,  for  example,\r\n\r\nthose who arrive by air.  I think this is a good suggestion.   I\r\n\r\nwill  take it up.  For example, they may be coming here and they\r\n\r\nrent a car.    We can certainly implement that suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the penalties for ERP violations, I would like to\r\n\r\ninform him that the penalties will be consistent with those  for\r\n\r\nsimilar violations of the ALS and RPS system.  Yes, this will be\r\n\r\na  brand  new  system.  It will be something that will  be  very\r\n\r\nunfamiliar to many motorists initially, and I would expect  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be a little bit of confusion in the  beginning.   I\r\n\r\ntake  his point and I assure Mr Chay that I will ask the LTA  to\r\n\r\nbe  flexible in its enforcement of the ERP system in  the  first\r\n\r\none or two weeks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, he asked about new section 34E. Section 34E\r\n\r\nactually  talks about the liability of owners vis-\ufffd-vis  drivers\r\n\r\nor  users of the vehicles.  What this section seeks to do is  to\r\n\r\nallow the Registrar of Vehicles to detain a vehicle if the owner\r\n\r\nfails  to  comply  with the notice to produce  the  vehicle  for\r\n\r\ninspection and testing of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  IU.   This is really to cater for situations where the  LTA\r\n\r\nsuspects  that the IU has been tampered with.   We  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  600,000  In-Vehicle  Units by  the  time  we  finish  the\r\n\r\nexercise.  The possibility of tampering is a very real one and I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  important, for the integrity of the system,  that\r\n\r\nprovisions  are put in place in order to allow any tampering  of\r\n\r\nthe  IUs  to  be  nipped  in  the bud  before  it  becomes  more\r\n\r\npervasive.   This provision is really to allow the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  to actually call in a vehicle, test it and check  that\r\n\r\nno  tampering has taken place.  I hope that clarifies the  point\r\n\r\nfor Mr Chay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> I am more concerned about the burden of\r\n\r\nnon-compliance  between  owners of vehicles and  drivers.   When\r\n\r\nthe owners comply, the drivers may be deliberately bypassing the\r\n\r\nERP process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> In the same way that other provisions under\r\n\r\nthe Road Traffic Act require the owner to furnish particulars of\r\n\r\neither  himself  or  the  driver, ie, whoever  was  driving  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  at  that time.  So, in the same way, it is  up  to  the\r\n\r\nowner to furnish the relevant particulars of the driver.  If  he\r\n\r\nis  not the driver, then it is up to him to furnish the relevant\r\n\r\nparticulars.   Thereupon,  of course,  the  LTA  will  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  steps to either prosecute the driver  or  the  owner,\r\n\r\nwhoever is appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked whether we can announce the scheme\r\n\r\nearlier  in order to give the public time to consider  and  make\r\n\r\ndecisions.   I presume those decisions refer to whether or not a\r\n\r\nperson wishes to buy a car.  This is precisely the reason why  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  making the announcement after the Budget statement  is\r\n\r\nmade, because it will allow motorists, in fact, before the  next\r\n\r\nCOE  bidding cycle starts, to know what is the new tax structure\r\n\r\nlike,  what is it going to be, how it will affect him,  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  quantum  of  the  rebates that will be  given,  whether  he\r\n\r\ndecides  to  continue to bid for a car or whether he  wishes  to\r\n\r\nlook  for  other  alternative travel modes.  So sufficient  time\r\n\r\nwill be given whereby all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotorists  or  would-be motorists will be able to make  such  an\r\n\r\ninformed  decision.  This will also allow Members in the  House,\r\n\r\nduring   the  Committee  of  Supply  debate,  to  further   seek\r\n\r\nclarification  on  the matter or to debate  the  matter  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to Dr Toh See Kiat who made two points. The\r\n\r\nfirst  point  was his suggestion, I believe,  to  add  the  word\r\n\r\n\"telematic\".   I  think  the intent behind  this  suggestion  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  He is right in saying that it is likely that with  the\r\n\r\nprogress of technology, with the advancements in this particular\r\n\r\nfield,  that it is likely that we will use such technologies  in\r\n\r\nthe future.  I thank him for his suggestion and I will look into\r\n\r\nthis.  For the moment, I would like to inform him that I believe\r\n\r\nthe proposed provisions are adequate for the purpose today.  And\r\n\r\nit  is not intended to preclude, of course, the use of such  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies in the future, as and when they become available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wanted to know what is the official facsimile.\r\n\r\nBasically,  the  official facsimile refers to computer-generated\r\n\r\nor rubber stamp signatures which I think some, if not all of us,\r\n\r\nare familiar with when we receive either property tax notices or\r\n\r\neven  traffic  violations  today.  It is  essentially  the  same\r\n\r\nthing.   It  is  simply  a question of making  the  dispatch  of\r\n\r\nnotices,  offers of composition and so on more  efficient.   The\r\n\r\nterm,  as  I  said, refers to the computer-generated  signature.\r\n\r\nSimilar provisions exist in other legislation dealing with other\r\n\r\nGovernment business like property tax and traffic summonses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have covered Dr Toh's questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> My question was more on control measures.\r\n\r\nCould  the Minister assure us on the control measures  for  this\r\n\r\nbecause it is mass produced?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The control measures pertain to, first of\r\n\r\nall,  signatures which can only be used by authorised  officers.\r\n\r\nThe   control   measures  are  contained  within  the   internal\r\n\r\nhousekeeping rules and regulations pertaining to the use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch important signatures.  These are in-house regulations which\r\n\r\nare regularly audited to make sure that there is no abuse.  As I\r\n\r\nsaid,  this  is  quite  a common practice for  other  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the points made by Mr J B Jeyaretnam. I\r\n\r\nthink the main thesis of Mr Jeyaretnam's point was that there is\r\n\r\ntoo much concentration of power.  I do not know how that linkage\r\n\r\nis  made  from  what  he  has quoted,  ie,  there  is  too  much\r\n\r\nconcentration of power, and new sections 34B, 34D and even  34E.\r\n\r\nI  think the nexus is a very tenuous one.  I guess this is  just\r\n\r\nanother  opportunity  for  him to  make  his  favourite  speech.\r\n\r\nHowever,  having made it, I think I owe him an  answer  in  that\r\n\r\nrespect.   Sections 34B and 34D are simply provisions which  are\r\n\r\nactually  in  compliance with what is in the Constitution,  that\r\n\r\nthere  be no tax or no levy that can be imposed except upon  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of  the law.  And this is the reason why  I  come  to\r\n\r\nParliament to seek approval for such a charge to be imposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question may be: why do we not specify the charge in\r\n\r\nthis  particular Bill?  The answer is very simple.  The  charges\r\n\r\nmay change.  The levies may change from time to time.  It is not\r\n\r\nuncommon  for  the  levies to change fairly  quickly  or  fairly\r\n\r\nfrequently  in response to changes in the traffic pattern.   And\r\n\r\nthis  is  precisely  the  reason why the  ERP  system  is  being\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  the  first place.  It is being  implemented  in\r\n\r\norder  to respond to traffic patterns.  If we were to come  back\r\n\r\nto  Parliament  every time we need to change  those  charges,  I\r\n\r\nthink Parliament is going to be utterly bogged down by all these\r\n\r\nvarious  changes.   When we implemented  the  ALS  in  1975,  we\r\n\r\nchanged those charges after one month.  We implemented a certain\r\n\r\nrate.   We  found  that it was too high because roads  were  too\r\n\r\nfree, underutilised.  We changed it one month later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, we have had occasions to vary those charges\r\n\r\ndepending on how the traffic pattern built up, depending on  how\r\n\r\nthe  traffic pattern moved.  It is quite within the  purview  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry.  In fact, it is the responsibility of the Ministry\r\n\r\nto keep track\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof these things to make sure that the ultimate objective of this\r\n\r\nscheme, which is to remove traffic congestion, is achieved.  And\r\n\r\nyou  cannot  achieve that by having to come to Parliament  every\r\n\r\ntime  just to change the levy from $1 to $2 or from $2 to $1.50.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think Members of Parliament are going to  take  very\r\n\r\nkindly   to   that  kind  of  amendment.   So  it  is   a   very\r\n\r\nstraightforward  matter.  It is something  which  is  completely\r\n\r\nwithin the purview and the responsibility of the Ministry or the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned, and this is the reason why we have sections\r\n\r\n34B  and 34D.  Within these two particular provisions, it is not\r\n\r\njust a question of what are the charges.  It is also the time of\r\n\r\nthe  charges, the location of the charges.  Do we have  to  come\r\n\r\nback  to  Parliament every time we want to add a new  gantry  or\r\n\r\nremove one?  Or every time we want to move the time from 7.00 am\r\n\r\nto  7.30  am, or from 9.00 am to 9.15 am?  I think it is totally\r\n\r\nunnecessary.   It is really quite an administrative matter which\r\n\r\nshould rightly be left to the Ministry concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a matter of whether the Minister is in a generous\r\n\r\nmood  or  not that the charges are levied up or down.   I  think\r\n\r\neven Mr Jeyaretnam does not believe when he said that.  However,\r\n\r\nthe fact is that he has given me an opportunity to explain again\r\n\r\nwhy we have to change the charges.  Yes, the charges have to  be\r\n\r\nvaried  but it is only varied for the ultimate purpose of making\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  traffic is free flowing.  And there  have  been\r\n\r\noccasions  where charges have actually come down, as there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  occasions where it has gone up.  Ultimately,  the  traffic\r\n\r\nengineers will recommend what is the optimal charge.  We do  not\r\n\r\nwant the roads to be under utilised but we certainly do not want\r\n\r\nthem  to be clogged up either.  It is very simple.  Surveys  are\r\n\r\ncarried  out.   Recommendations are made by the  Land  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority  and they are then discussed and decisions  are  made.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not at the whims and fancies of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to Mr Low Thia Khiang's concerns about the\r\n\r\nERP system.  They are not new concerns.  They are concerns which\r\n\r\nhave  been  voiced many times in this House by  him.   That,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that those concerns are valid.  It just simply  means\r\n\r\nthat  it  is politically expedient for him to make those points.\r\n\r\nWhy do I say that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What is wrong with that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No, nothing wrong at all. But I will seek\r\n\r\nto  explain  to the other Members of the House who  are  not  so\r\n\r\nblindfolded in their thinking as to why those concerns  are  not\r\n\r\nvalid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year alone, I had occasion to monitor very closely\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  developments  in this  area,  road  pricing,  in\r\n\r\nparticular.   For this year, the question of traffic  congestion\r\n\r\nand  road pricing has been discussed in many, many journals  and\r\n\r\nmagazines.   Asiaweek  wrote about the  traffic  jams  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.   Asia  Magazine wrote about the traffic jams  in  other\r\n\r\nAsian cities.  Newsweek wrote about traffic jams in Europe.  The\r\n\r\nEconomist wrote an article called \"Road Pricing\".  In  fact,  it\r\n\r\nwas  entitled,  on  the  front cover \"Jam  today,  Road  pricing\r\n\r\ntomorrow\".  Let me take this opportunity to quote part  of  that\r\n\r\nEconomist article:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If roads continue to be operated as one of the last relics\r\n\r\nof a Soviet-style command economy, then the consequences will be\r\n\r\nworsening traffic jams and eventual Bangkok-style gridlock.  If,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, roads were priced like  any  other  scarce\r\n\r\ncommodity, then better use would be made of existing  space  and\r\n\r\nthe  revenues raised could be used to improve public  transport.\r\n\r\nThe  mere  fact  of making motorists pay their  way  would  free\r\n\r\ncapacity  to such an extent that bus travel would become  easier\r\n\r\nand faster, and subsidies can be reduced.  Politicians have long\r\n\r\nshied  away  from  this  approach because  it  is  difficult  to\r\n\r\npersuade  voters to pay for something that has long  been  free.\r\n\r\nBut some governments are starting to accept that there may be no\r\n\r\nalternative.   Charging for ownership rather than use,  as  most\r\n\r\ntax systems do, make little sense.  Heavy fixed costs, including\r\n\r\nvehicle  duties,  insurance and depreciation,  merely  encourage\r\n\r\ndrivers  to  use their cars more because the perceived  marginal\r\n\r\ncosts of motoring are so small.  The way forward must be to make\r\n\r\ncars more expensive to use.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the article goes as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who argue that road pricing is unfair because it\r\n\r\ndiscriminates against the poor [I think this is what Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang has said] ignore the fact that the people too poor to own\r\n\r\na  vehicle  suffer  the  ill-effects of congestion  without  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal  mobility.  And if the revenues were  used  to  improve\r\n\r\npublic transport, the poor would benefit disproportionately.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really the purpose of electronic road pricing is\r\n\r\nfundamentally as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to restructure our tax system and restructure the way\r\n\r\nwe  manage  our traffic to manage our roads.  The  objective  of\r\n\r\nthis is to make our transport system more efficient, to keep our\r\n\r\nroads  which are our economic arteries free-flowing.   Why?   So\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  can  remain as a good  place  to  do  business.\r\n\r\nSurely,  ultimately, that must be of benefit to  everybody   the\r\n\r\npoor, the rich, the businessmen and the consumers.  Rather  than\r\n\r\nsaying that this is going to add to the burden of businesses,  I\r\n\r\nargue  that  in fact a good transport system free of  congestion\r\n\r\nactually  helps  to lower business cost in the long  run  rather\r\n\r\nthan  to add to their cost.  As the Economist article says,  you\r\n\r\ndo  not  say that the ERP penalises the poor and helps the  rich\r\n\r\nbecause  the people who drive cars cannot be considered poor  by\r\n\r\nany  means.  If they can afford a car, surely they are not  that\r\n\r\npoor.   It  is the people who are in the buses who are the  ones\r\n\r\nwho are ultimately going to be one of the main beneficiaries  of\r\n\r\nfree-flowing roads.  So I say that, rather than looking upon the\r\n\r\nERP  as  an  enemy,  it is actually an ally of the  businessmen,\r\n\r\nincluding the small businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister?   First, the Minister refers to the Economist  article\r\n\r\nfor justification of the ERP.  My question is: will the Minister\r\n\r\nsay how much of the revenue collected from ERP will be committed\r\n\r\nto  the  improvement of the public transportation system in  the\r\n\r\nfuture?   Second,  we  are still fresh  in  our  minds  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment dragged its feet on building the North-east line  and\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Member for Potong Pasir will tell  you  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is very stingy in its expenditure on public transport\r\n\r\nand  it is not going to build the Sennett line. Third, would the\r\n\r\ncurrent  ERP  system capture the identity of a car  that  passes\r\n\r\nthrough  the  gantry?   If  so,  could  this  information  track\r\n\r\neffectively the travelling pattern of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular car or the owner of the car?  How would the  Minister\r\n\r\npropose to safeguard this information to prevent its abuse?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there is really no need for this\r\n\r\nGovernment to commit to expenditure on public transport.  We had\r\n\r\na debate in this House on the White Paper on land transport.  In\r\n\r\nthat  paper,  we  committed to the development of a world  class\r\n\r\npublic  transport system.  In order to develop that, the  amount\r\n\r\nof  money  that  has  to be spent on public transport,  ie,  the\r\n\r\namount  of money that has to be spent on building MRT lines  and\r\n\r\nLRT  lines,  is  well in excess of the amount of money  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  collected in terms of tax at any point in  time.   If  it\r\n\r\nwere  that  simple  that  we just link  the  collection  of  ERP\r\n\r\nrevenues  with  public transport, I think that  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsimplest  decisions we could take.   But that does  not  address\r\n\r\nthe  question about what kind of public transport we want,  what\r\n\r\nkind of transport management measure we want, what kind of roads\r\n\r\nwe want, and what kind of infrastructure development we want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify. What I am saying is that we need to\r\n\r\njustify  every expenditure, every project, on public  transport.\r\n\r\nIf  we  can justify that expenditure, we will be able to proceed\r\n\r\nto  build.   The North-east line is a classic example.   We  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  spend $5 billion on the North-east line.  We  started\r\n\r\nground breaking early this year.  Even as my Ministry is working\r\n\r\non  the  budget  for the North-east line, we have  gone  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance for funds and the Ministry of Finance  has\r\n\r\ngiven  us  the  approval  to proceed  in  spite  of  a  possible\r\n\r\nreduction  in  Government revenues, as a result of the  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown.  This is because it is an economically justifiable and\r\n\r\nworthwhile project.  It is not something that we created out  of\r\n\r\npolitical  expediency.  Neither was it because of  Mr  Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang nor Mr Chiam See Tong that we took so long to build  that\r\n\r\nline.   It  was because we needed to do the studies and convince\r\n\r\nthe Government that this was a project worth spending $5 billion\r\n\r\nof taxpayers' money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it on a macro basis, expenditure on public\r\n\r\ntransport infrastructure is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  commitment that has been made.  This commitment was  made  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  when this House approved the White  Paper  on  land\r\n\r\ntransport.  I do not believe that the Member actually  made  any\r\n\r\ncomments in that particular debate.  But a major debate did take\r\n\r\nplace  in  this House.  Many Members spoke and one  of  the  key\r\n\r\nrecommendations of that White Paper was a major  change  in  the\r\n\r\nway  we  fund public transport infrastructure, especially  heavy\r\n\r\nrail  transport infrastructure. So I do not think there  is  any\r\n\r\nneed for me now to make any particular commitment on expenditure\r\n\r\nof  public transport.  The developments this year and  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years will amply demonstrate the amount of effort  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing made in this area.  This is one of the key pillars of  our\r\n\r\ntotal transportation policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficult part is to convince Singaporeans that\r\n\r\ntransport management measures and road usage management measures\r\n\r\nlike ERP and the Vehicle Quota System are beneficial in the long\r\n\r\nrun.  That  is  the difficult part.  But we know  that  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that is worth doing and we know that  we  can  do  it\r\n\r\nbecause, at the same time, we are using the money that has  been\r\n\r\ncollected for public transport expenditure.  Ultimately, as  the\r\n\r\nEconomist article puts it, when people see the benefits of  road\r\n\r\npricing  and the benefits of all these measures, it will  become\r\n\r\nmore acceptable.  Let me quote to the Member another part of the\r\n\r\narticle.  It said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Governments around the world are still nervous about the\r\n\r\nimpact  of road pricing.  But as more and more charging  schemes\r\n\r\nare implemented and as the benefits of less congested unpolluted\r\n\r\nroads  are felt, attitudes will change.  In 20 years' time  when\r\n\r\npaying for road space will be regarded as the norm, people  will\r\n\r\nlook  back and wonder why they were ever prepared to put up with\r\n\r\nthe pollution, noise and paralysis of today's cities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe he asked another question about the identity of\r\n\r\ncars  passing through the ERP.  The system that we have adopted,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the Cashcard system, bills cars only as they are going\r\n\r\nthrough.    So  the identity of the vehicle is only captured  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a violation.  In other words, if you pass  through  a\r\n\r\ngantry  with your Cashcard inserted and fully loaded, the charge\r\n\r\nis deducted, there will be no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems  and there will be no identification.  But, of  course,\r\n\r\nif  there is some violation, whether it is insufficient  balance\r\n\r\nin the Cashcard or  you do not have a Cashcard, or whether IU is\r\n\r\nfaulty,   yes,   there   will   be   an   identification.   That\r\n\r\nidentification  will  be captured by a camera  for  purposes  of\r\n\r\nsending   you  the  notice  of  composition.   That   particular\r\n\r\ninformation  will only be kept for so long as it is required  to\r\n\r\nsend  you  the  summons.   Thereafter, it will  not  be  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   In  other words, there is no possibility of  violating\r\n\r\nthe privacy of any particular motorist.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister by way of\r\n\r\nclarification?   He  mentions, really jibes,  about  my  Party's\r\n\r\nconcern  that  the whole thing is a discrimination  against  the\r\n\r\npoor.   Will he not agree that the whole system of road pricing,\r\n\r\nALS, or what have you,  does not take into account the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  small tradesmen or persons whose jobs needs them to have  a\r\n\r\ncar  to  get  around, which adds to their cost,  reducing  their\r\n\r\nincome  considerably  whilst allowing those  who  are  rich  and\r\n\r\nwealthy to have unlimited access to our roads?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think it would be worthwhile perhaps for\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam to hold his fire on this one until I announce the\r\n\r\ndetails   of  the  road  tax  restructuring,  the  vehicle   tax\r\n\r\nrestructuring  and the road tax  rebates.

The  Leader  of  the  House  recalled   that\r\n\r\nimmediately  when I mentioned it to him when I met  him  at  the\r\n\r\nAustralian Day function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.34 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, read what I said then\r\n\r\nbecause a lot of what I said then is relevant to this motion  as\r\n\r\nit  was when I spoke in 1985.  But I do not propose to read what\r\n\r\nI  said then.  I do not wish to burden Members who heard it once\r\n\r\nto  hear  it  a second time.  I said then, however, that  I  was\r\n\r\nquite  sure  that  the  then Leader  of  the  House  would  have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn the Whip to leave Members to vote according  to  their\r\n\r\nown conscience.  But, of course, that was not the case.  So I do\r\n\r\nnot know whether it is too vain a hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow that the Whip has been withdrawn and that Members would vote\r\n\r\naccording to their own conscience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said more than once that we\r\n\r\nin  this  House,  I  suppose excluding those  who  are  here  by\r\n\r\nnomination, by appointment, who have come into this House  after\r\n\r\ngoing  to the voters to be chosen, to be in this House as  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  are  the  people's  voice.   We  are  here  as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and when we went to them to seek their vote,  we\r\n\r\nwere identifying ourselves - let me make that quite clear - with\r\n\r\ntheir problems, with their hopes and with their aspirations.  So\r\n\r\nwhen  seeking their vote we were claiming to be one of them,  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  them  in this House and to speak on their  behalf  on\r\n\r\nmatters  that affected them or their families.  So that  is  the\r\n\r\ncentral point - that we identified ourselves to be with them  in\r\n\r\ntheir problems and in their hardships when we went to seek their\r\n\r\nvotes.   And that must not be lost sight of once we are  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse.   As  I  said,  this is the people's  House,  not  anyone\r\n\r\nelse's.   It  is not the Government's House; it is the  people's\r\n\r\nHouse.   And  we  are  here  as people representing  the  people\r\n\r\noutside this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make another observation, and that is, it was\r\n\r\nsuggested in 1985 that my motion was a silly one because it  was\r\n\r\nno  cure for the ills the country was then facing.  May I assure\r\n\r\nMembers if that suggestion is going to be made again, that  this\r\n\r\nis  not being proposed as a cure for our economic ills.   It  is\r\n\r\nproposed  simply and solely out of my conviction that we  should\r\n\r\ntry and identify ourselves with the people in everything.  There\r\n\r\nare,  of  course, two differences between this  motion  and  the\r\n\r\nmotion  that  I moved in 1985.  One is that whereas that  motion\r\n\r\nsought  to  make the resolution a binding one on  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House, this motion makes it a voluntary gesture,\r\n\r\na decision to be made by each Member for himself or herself.  It\r\n\r\nis  not a resolution to bind all Members but leaving it entirely\r\n\r\nto the conscience or the political will of the Member concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  other difference, of course, is that, and I  shall  be\r\n\r\ncoming back to this, there is a huge difference now between  the\r\n\r\nsalaries that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  were  drawing  in  1985,  particularly  Ministers,  and  the\r\n\r\nsalaries we are drawing today in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That motion in 1985 was, not that I expected it to be\r\n\r\naccepted, not accepted, was dismissed ,and I expect this  motion\r\n\r\nwill  probably  suffer the same result.  And I expect  that  the\r\n\r\nsame  jibes  will be made, as the jibes have been made  even  in\r\n\r\nthis present session of Parliament, that it is all publicity and\r\n\r\nit  is  all  politics  of envy.  Whatever  may  be  the  result,\r\n\r\nwhatever may be the jibes, will not deter me from doing  what  I\r\n\r\nthink  is  right,  because  in the  final  analysis,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is doing the right thing by the people.   That\r\n\r\nis the final analysis - doing the right thing.  And the question\r\n\r\nthat  has to be answered is whether it is the right thing to  do\r\n\r\nat  this  particular  moment in our country's  history  for  the\r\n\r\nleaders  voluntarily to take a reduction in  their  salaries  or\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to dwell at length on the reasons for this\r\n\r\nmotion.   I think Members are only too keenly aware and we  have\r\n\r\nheard  it  in  this  House, and we have read about  it,  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  that  this country  is  facing  and  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that  our people will have in  trying  to  make  a\r\n\r\nliving  in  this place.  Of course, I am not talking  about  the\r\n\r\npeople  who draw huge salaries and have wealthy incomes.   I  am\r\n\r\ntalking about our citizens who draw $1,500 and less.  And may  I\r\n\r\nremind the Members, as I did when I moved a motion on Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  that  62% or so of our workers are earning  less  than\r\n\r\n$1,500 per month.  They will find it very hard.  It is not  just\r\n\r\nthem.   There is the loss of jobs.  We heard and read of  people\r\n\r\nbeing  laid off, retrenched.  I thought I might be able to  give\r\n\r\nMembers  the  numbers that have been laid off  since  July  last\r\n\r\nyear.   I wrote to the Ministry of Labour and I had been told  I\r\n\r\ncould  not have it now.  It would be released at the end of  the\r\n\r\nmonth.   I  do not know why I could not have had the figures  to\r\n\r\nrelease to the Members at this particular moment.  It cannot  be\r\n\r\nan  official secret.  But be that as it may, there are many  who\r\n\r\nhave lost their jobs and there will be very, very many more  who\r\n\r\nmight lose their jobs, maybe not in the same degree or level  as\r\n\r\nthe  people  in Indonesia and in other countries  who  may  lose\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs.   But  there will be people who will suffer,  who  may  be\r\n\r\nthrown out of employment.  What are we going to say to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the problem of re-employment for these\r\n\r\npeople.  I have come across several people, especially those who\r\n\r\nare  over  40 or 45 years, who have told me that it is virtually\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  get another job and yet, we hear  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime, \"Oh,  re-employment is quite easy.\"  But we never have the\r\n\r\nfigures as to how many of them have been re-employed and  within\r\n\r\nwhat period of time.  Only last week or so, we saw in the papers\r\n\r\nthat  62%  of our workers or the less well-to-do in our  society\r\n\r\nhave savings which will tide them over only for three months  at\r\n\r\nthe  most.  This was an independent survey that was carried  out\r\n\r\nand  is  not something that I am just plucking out of  my  head.\r\n\r\nBut it may very well be that 10% or even 20% may not have enough\r\n\r\nsavings  to  tide them over even for one month.   But  62%  have\r\n\r\nsavings which can only tide them over for three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the drop in the businesses. And we heard\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon from the Minister that there was a drop.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what percentage he mentioned.  So life is going to  be\r\n\r\nmuch  harder for most of our citizens.  For at least 60% or  65%\r\n\r\nof  our citizens, life is going to be much harder.  We can  only\r\n\r\nhope  that  it will not be a very long time, it will  be  fairly\r\n\r\nshort,  and that we could perhaps get back on the road.  But  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to deal with the situation as we now see it,  and  not\r\n\r\njust tell our people, \"Well, it is all right.  Don't worry.   We\r\n\r\nwill  be  okay  in 6 months' time.\"  They want to know  what  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done for them at the moment and how they are going to  be\r\n\r\nhelped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this downturn in business leading to loss of\r\n\r\njobs,  parallel to it is the rise in the cost of living.   Since\r\n\r\nthe  last elections, price of almost everything has gone up.   I\r\n\r\nmentioned  this  when I asked for a Parliamentary  committee  on\r\n\r\nprices.   Transport, education, health, everything is going  up.\r\n\r\nAnd  only  very  recently,  there was the  announcement  of  the\r\n\r\npolyclinic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges going up.  I had a question for the Minister for  Health\r\n\r\nto  ask him by how much had the cost increased.  But my question\r\n\r\nwas not reached.  So I am not able to deal with the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost and how much is being collected by way of the increase\r\n\r\nin the charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I meet people from time to time who tell me of the\r\n\r\nheavy  cost  of  health  care  and particularly  for  the  older\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  need more health care than the young  ones.   And\r\n\r\nthey  say,  \"We try and avoid going to the doctors  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible.  We try and avoid seeking medical treatment because of\r\n\r\nthe  cost involved.\"  I do not want to labour this.  I am saying\r\n\r\nthat  it must be quite clear to all of us that life is going  to\r\n\r\nbe very hard for 60% of our citizens in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister announced on 19th January this\r\n\r\nyear,  that there would be a cut back in the expenditure because\r\n\r\nthe Government expected a fall in the revenue.  It feels that it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  able to collect enough.  He announced  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposed  to cut back on the expenditure  except  on\r\n\r\ndefence  and education.  My Party responded to that announcement\r\n\r\nand  expressed its disappointment that whilst the Government was\r\n\r\nprepared  or  getting ready to cut back on expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\npeople, there was no suggestion or proposal that there would  be\r\n\r\na  cut back on the Ministers' salaries or the allowances paid to\r\n\r\nthe  Members.   There  was no response  from  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  on  that.   But we had a response  from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwithout Portfolio and his reply was that any saving by reduction\r\n\r\nin  the  salaries was not going to help.  That it is negligible.\r\n\r\nWe  do not know what the saving will be.  We have got to tot  it\r\n\r\nup  and  see what the saving will be and see whether  it  is  so\r\n\r\nnegligible that it is not worth implementing it.  I am  sure  it\r\n\r\nis not that negligible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, I shall be reverting to this topic, and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the  salaries drawn by our Ministers are  way  beyond\r\n\r\nanything  drawn  by  ministers outside so  that  any  saving  by\r\n\r\nreducing  their  salaries  by  25%  is  not  going  to  be  that\r\n\r\nnegligible.  Of course, it may not run into billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nBut I am sure it should run into one or two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars at least.  But the point is not whether  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be of any help.  That is to overlook and to ignore  the\r\n\r\nother  point  and, that is, the identification  of  us  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters equally with the people.  That is the point  that  has\r\n\r\nto  be  met squarely.  We have seen the PAP's slogan \"More  Good\r\n\r\nYears\" and we said in our press release that it would appear  to\r\n\r\nbe  that  it  was always more good years for the  Ministers  and\r\n\r\npeople  in  high places whatever the economic situation  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to somehow get across the message to the people\r\n\r\nthat  we do care about them in their situation, that we do  know\r\n\r\nof  their  difficulties  and their  problems  and  to  show  our\r\n\r\nappreciation and our knowledge, we would ourselves identify with\r\n\r\nthem  in  their hardships.  But as I said, I cannot see the  25%\r\n\r\nreduction  in  salaries for Ministers is  going  to  impose  any\r\n\r\nhardship  on  them.  So it is, as I said, simply a  question  of\r\n\r\ndoing  the  right thing, and I am sure that Members  here  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  be  seen  as  doing the right  thing  and  identifying\r\n\r\nthemselves with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Members of the People's Action Party, who\r\n\r\nare  here from Cheng San, that the voters of Cheng San  will  be\r\n\r\nwatching very closely as to what their elected Members are going\r\n\r\nto do.  Here is an opportunity.  Here is a wonderful opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  them to show themselves as identifying themselves with  the\r\n\r\npeople.   We will have to wait and see.  I see Mr Zainul  Abidin\r\n\r\nis  trying to get on to his feet.  But hold on for a while.   So\r\n\r\nhere  is  a  wonderful opportunity.  Are we going to seize  this\r\n\r\nopportunity and show our oneness?  That is it - show our oneness\r\n\r\nwith the people, not that we are a people who are set apart from\r\n\r\nthem,  not  telling them, as it were, \"we are all  right,  Jack,\r\n\r\nit's  your problem.\"  We have got to show them that we  consider\r\n\r\ntheir  problem  our  problem and we  are  prepared  to  identify\r\n\r\nourselves with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am proposing is not just a cut-back and the money\r\n\r\nremaining with the Consolidated Fund.  I am proposing  that  the\r\n\r\nsaving resulting from this voluntary cut-back in the salaries be\r\n\r\npaid into an unemployment benefit fund for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers who are thrown out of employment or into a needy welfare\r\n\r\nfund,  so  that  some use is made of the savings,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice, if it is a sacrifice, of the Ministers is put to good\r\n\r\nuse to alleviate the hardship of people who need help.  That  is\r\n\r\nmy  proposal.  Let it be paid into an unemployment benefit  fund\r\n\r\nor a needy fund.  Will the Government accept that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in the 1985 motion, whatever the outcome, I\r\n\r\npropose to do what I say.  If the Government does not set up  an\r\n\r\nunemployment benefit fund, then I have to see into what fund the\r\n\r\nreduction in my allowance by 25% may be put to.  But I hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be able to find this channel for  me  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  we  are  setting  up an unemployment  benefit  fund,  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.   Here you are, you can pay your 25% reduction  into\r\n\r\nthis  fund.\"  If, as I say, the Government proposes  not  to  do\r\n\r\nanything of that sort, then I have to try and see how my  saving\r\n\r\ncan  be  used  in  any way and show my identification  with  the\r\n\r\nvoters in Cheng San and elsewhere in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n(Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M): Sir, I will be brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked that we in this House do the right\r\n\r\nthing  and  that this motion rests also on the need  for  us  to\r\n\r\nidentify  ourselves  with  the people  of  Singapore,  with  the\r\n\r\nvoters, because we are all representatives of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not realise that the Member would really stand\r\n\r\nup  here  this  evening  to  talk about  possible  miseries  and\r\n\r\ndifficulties  of  the people in Singapore  only  to  score  some\r\n\r\npolitical  points.  Earlier, I thought there were  some  sincere\r\n\r\nand  genuine  reasons  on the part of the  NCMP  to  table  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  May I say to him that over the last 40 years, the first\r\n\r\ngroup  of PAP leaders and those in the Government had done  what\r\n\r\nhe  has  proposed.  They had exactly done what he  is  proposing\r\n\r\ntoday, ie, doing the right thing and identifying ourselves  with\r\n\r\nthe  people, but not by way of moving a motion designed to score\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical point.  What the PAP has done, which I thought I  must\r\n\r\nsay, so that it could be of some use to Mr Jeyaretnam is that\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Raise charges, taxes!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> over the last 40 years, the\r\n\r\nPAP  has  done its best to provide good government in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBy  governing the country wisely, it has done over the last four\r\n\r\ndecades  its best to promote investment in Singapore, to  create\r\n\r\njobs  and to provide job opportunities for our people.  We  have\r\n\r\ndone our best.  Our earlier generation of Ministers and MPs  has\r\n\r\nleft this House but I think we should not forget that under  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government and leadership, we have provided  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining for our people so that they can fit themselves well  in\r\n\r\nthe new and modern economy.  And over the last 40 years, we have\r\n\r\ndone  our best.  The PAP Government has done its best to improve\r\n\r\nthe  people's income and the standard of living.  We  have  done\r\n\r\nour  best to build almost one million flats in Singapore as part\r\n\r\nof  a  long-term effort to promote home ownership at  affordable\r\n\r\nprices.   We have done our best to encourage savings to be  used\r\n\r\nin good times, to be used on rainy days and to be used in future\r\n\r\nwhen they retire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all these are efforts that will probably continue.\r\n\r\nI  hope  we will continue to have good government in the  future\r\n\r\nAnd it also shows that the PAP Government actually cares for the\r\n\r\npeople.   I believe we have done the right things over the  last\r\n\r\n40  years which is one of the few reasons why today we have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   badly  affected by this economic turmoil  or  crisis.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is  the  best way to identify  ourselves  with  the\r\n\r\npeople, and not by moving a motion to score political points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to share my views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means clear that a national crisis has now\r\n\r\noccurred   which   requires  collective   sacrifice   by   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual companies may have their own problems.  They have  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  them.  And every company and even households  should\r\n\r\nspend prudently as the economic situation is unclear.  But if  a\r\n\r\ncollective sacrifice is required by all Singaporeans, eg, a  cut\r\n\r\nin the CPF rate, a freeze on all bonuses and salaries, or even a\r\n\r\ncut  in  salaries by all companies, the civil service and  GLCs,\r\n\r\nthen Parliament should take the lead by example and be the first\r\n\r\nto  undertake the sacrifice.  Unless Government intends to  call\r\n\r\nfor  a  nation-wide  collective austerity  measure,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary,  in  my view, not even desirable, for  Parliament  or\r\n\r\nMinisters to unilaterally take pay cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate Mr Jeyaretnam's compassion for the hopes and\r\n\r\ndreams  of  the  people of Singapore.  But extending  compassion\r\n\r\nmust  be an equitable exercise for all including the Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  Is it fair that we ask the Government to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthis  responsibility  alone?  What about those  businessmen  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals who earn even more than Ministers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, such symbolic populist actions are undesirable\r\n\r\nbecause they appear emotional, without addressing the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  measures which will really benefit our economy have nothing\r\n\r\nto  do with a cut in Ministers' salaries.  The right thing to do\r\n\r\nis  to find solutions to cure the ills of the economy.  There is\r\n\r\nno running away from this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's motion perhaps implies that while other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans suffer a drop in standards of living, our Ministers\r\n\r\nare  unfairly  insulated.  This is not  the  case  from  what  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, because our Ministers' salaries are benchmarked to a\r\n\r\nset  of  private  sector criteria.  As private  sector  salaries\r\n\r\ndrop,  so  do  Ministers'  salaries.  Our  leaders,  like  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, do see their incomes rise or fall depending on the\r\n\r\nstate  of  the  economy.  I hope the Minister will clarify  this\r\n\r\npoint and in response to the motion state when and how much  the\r\n\r\nlast adjustment was made on Ministers' salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was sampling for opinions on this matter, I gathered\r\n\r\ndifferent views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are those who feel that if the Government wants to be seen\r\n\r\nas  leading  by  moral  standards  -  and  moral  leadership  is\r\n\r\nimportant - then Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and MPs should\r\n\r\ntake a pay cut to show their solidarity with the people.  Hence,\r\n\r\nreaping  political capital from this gesture.  There are  those,\r\n\r\nincluding  myself, who reject this view because we do not  agree\r\n\r\nto  Government  making  symbolic gestures in  policy  decisions.\r\n\r\nAmong these, some even think that Ministers' wages should not be\r\n\r\na  political  issue  in the first place.  Even  as  a  political\r\n\r\nissue,  it  should be a separate evaluation exercise  from  this\r\n\r\nconcern on the financial uncertainty of the region.  However, if\r\n\r\nMinisters  and all Members in this House would like  voluntarily\r\n\r\nto  donate  25%  of their salaries to charity to  express  their\r\n\r\nsolidarity  with  Singaporeans, it is their private  commitment.\r\n\r\nIt is a personal gesture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us would agree that the job of this Government is\r\n\r\nto  govern,  to find the most effective measures to address  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  banking and economic difficulties.  A symbolic  measure\r\n\r\nsuch  as cutting Ministers' salaries has limited impact  on  the\r\n\r\nscale of events to justify its adoption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should look at other measures, more significant ones, to\r\n\r\nmoderate the difficulties ahead.  In the next few weeks,  during\r\n\r\nthe Budget debate, I think a lot more attention will be paid  on\r\n\r\nthis concern.  Yes, there are difficulties ahead and I think  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  has  rightfully  pointed  out  that  there  will  be\r\n\r\npossible unemployment and the rest of it.  All the more, we need\r\n\r\nto stay rational and identify concrete and constructive measures\r\n\r\nto ride out this difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I raise some concerns for this House to debate on and\r\n\r\nI  would  like to hear more persuasive reasons from  Members  to\r\n\r\nhelp  clarify  and  reinforce my own.  But at this  juncture,  I\r\n\r\nhesitate to support this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the point I was trying to raise has\r\n\r\nalready  been  mentioned  by the Nominated  Member.   Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  are  in  fact pegged to the top  earners  of  the  six\r\n\r\nprofessions in the private sector and if the private sector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  doing well, I believe Ministers' salaries will go up and  if\r\n\r\nthe  private sector is not doing well when there is an  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  accordingly the salaries of Ministers  will  also  go\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, there is now a downturn in our economy. In\r\n\r\nfact, we have heard just now from Deputy Prime Minister, BG Lee,\r\n\r\nthat  the banks' business had dipped 30%.  We have also read  in\r\n\r\nthe  papers  that  about 200 lawyers have left  the  profession.\r\n\r\nProbably  those  who  have  left  were  doing  conveyancing  and\r\n\r\nconveyancing is rather slow these days.  We also see that  there\r\n\r\nare  in  fact retrenchments in the electronics sector.  We  have\r\n\r\nheard that the retail trade is down and that the stock market is\r\n\r\nalso not doing that well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely, there is evidence that businesses are going\r\n\r\ndown.   If that is so, I would imagine that the salaries of  the\r\n\r\ntop  earners  in the private sector would also drop accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf  indeed the salaries of top people in the private sector have\r\n\r\ndropped,  then  the  Ministers' salaries should  accordingly  be\r\n\r\nscaled  down.   The  question is this: Have Ministers'  salaries\r\n\r\nbeen  scaled down?  If they have been, how much?  If  not,  why?\r\n\r\nMinisters cannot give an excuse and say that their salaries need\r\n\r\nnot be scaled down because it makes no difference to the economy\r\n\r\nor  that  they have done a good job and Singapore has  weathered\r\n\r\nthe currency turmoil relatively well compared to other countries\r\n\r\nin the region or that our currency has not been devalued as much\r\n\r\nas  the  others  vis-a-vis  the US  dollar  or  that  Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries comprise only a small percentage of the GDP.   But  the\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  the  standard has been  set  by  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  If this standard is to be adhered to, then  if  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  the  top earners of the private sector  have  gone\r\n\r\ndown,  the Ministers' salaries should drop accordingly.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister  to let us know whether  or  not  Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries have been scaled down.  If so, when and by how much?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what we are\r\n\r\nfacing  is  not  an ordinary cyclical downturn in  the  economy.\r\n\r\nThis is the most serious crisis which the region has faced since\r\n\r\nat least the 1960s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One country after another has succumbed to the contagion,\r\n\r\nstarting with Thailand, then Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea and Hong\r\n\r\nKong.   The country now facing the most serious situation, whose\r\n\r\nwell-being  will  affect  the  region  and  Singapore  the  most\r\n\r\nprofoundly, is Indonesia. We have fully discussed this earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been lucky to be spared the worst of this\r\n\r\ncrisis.   But it has not just been luck.  We are different,  and\r\n\r\npeople  have recognised that we are different.  And  if  Members\r\n\r\nread  articles  in the foreign media who are not  by  any  means\r\n\r\nuncritical admirers of Singapore, they will see that  they  have\r\n\r\nrecognised  this.  I just cite you four examples..  One  in  the\r\n\r\nFinancial   Times  earlier  this  month,  an  article  entitled:\r\n\r\n\"Singapore's  strengths  protect  it  from  turmoil\"  by  Sheila\r\n\r\nMcNutty.  She wrote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In spite of its sound economic fundamental, Singapore's\r\n\r\nexposure to the region is dragging it into the turmoil.  But the\r\n\r\nvery  strengths that put the city-state ahead of its  neighbours\r\n\r\nbefore  the crisis began  its eagerness to adjust to changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  around it  have convinced economists it will  emerge\r\n\r\neven  further in front when it ends. . The Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nis,  meanwhile,  moving  to widen the  competitiveness  gap  its\r\n\r\nneighbours had been closing before the crisis began. . Singapore\r\n\r\n.  has pressed on with plans to open up.  Economists say foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors cannot help but be impressed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the Financial Times reprinted in the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York Times, also not an admirer of ours, Thomas\r\n\r\nFriedman writing in an Op-Ed column earlier this month about the\r\n\r\ncrisis   in   an  article  entitled  \"Good  governance only\r\n\r\nprotection\" said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of those Asian nations who were fully plugged into the\r\n\r\nmarket,  those  with  the  most  non-corrupt,  transparent   and\r\n\r\naccountable  financial  systems  Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave been hurt the least.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  is in the New York Times.  Analysts write us up. They have\r\n\r\nto tell as it is because otherwise nobody will read them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Strategy is one of them and last year in July\r\n\r\nit  reported  on emerging markets and the title was:  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nSun-drenched in a grey sea\".  They gave the reasons why this was\r\n\r\nso:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore does stand out in the continuing Asian currency\r\n\r\ncrisis.   It  runs a surplus when other countries run  deficits.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  balance sheet with the rest of the  world  is  also\r\n\r\nsuper  strong.  Nor does Singapore have an asset bubble  or  any\r\n\r\nsign  of  a  major overhang of unproductive capital as  in  most\r\n\r\nother Asian countries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in July. Come October, Jardine Fleming Research\r\n\r\npublished two reports.  One said: \"Singapore  Distinct from  the\r\n\r\nASEAN-4\" and the other one said, \"Singapore's monetary policy is\r\n\r\ndifferent\".  It said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore was the only Southeast Asian country which had a\r\n\r\ncorrect  currency  policy,  one sensitive  to  global  financial\r\n\r\ndynamics with practically no barriers to trade and capital flows\r\n\r\nand  because  it  uses  currency to  check  imported  inflation,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  policy is aligned to the global inflation  profile.\r\n\r\nOf  the  region's central banks, only the MAS has  its  currency\r\n\r\npolicy in tune with the underlying `fair' value.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whatever Mr Jeyaretnam says about inflation and the\r\n\r\nstate  of  the economy, the analysts know the true state.   What\r\n\r\nhas made this difference?  Clean, competent Government.  Why  do\r\n\r\nyou  think  we  have a financial system which has  been  tightly\r\n\r\nsupervised,  a  property market where the incipient  bubble  was\r\n\r\npricked  in  time and a prudent budget surplus with  no  foreign\r\n\r\nborrowing?   By chance?  Because of the quality of the  NCMP  in\r\n\r\nthe  House?  No.  Because there have been capable committed  men\r\n\r\nin  the  Government  who will pursue sound policies,  anticipate\r\n\r\nproblems and find solutions to them in good time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to deliver this quality of Government\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  we have paid Ministers  and  civil  servants\r\n\r\nproperly.   We  did  this,  opposed by opposition  MPs  like  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam at every step.  But the policy has worked and it  has\r\n\r\nmade Singapore different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we face a major regional crisis, what has the\r\n\r\nopposition  done?  Has it called on Singaporeans to close  ranks\r\n\r\nand  work  together?  No. Has it produced any  useful  ideas  to\r\n\r\ntackle  the problems?  Neither.  No opposition MP has filed  any\r\n\r\nquestions in Parliament on this momentous development, except to\r\n\r\nquery  the  constitutionality  of the  Government's  actions  on\r\n\r\ntotally  spurious grounds, and then failed to follow up  in  the\r\n\r\ncourts when challenged to do so.  Instead the task of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraising  the issue in Parliament and debating it, explaining  it\r\n\r\nand  reflecting people's views and concerns has been left to PAP\r\n\r\nMPs and Nominated MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam's only contribution to this debate has\r\n\r\nbeen to cut political salaries by 25% and he had the honour  and\r\n\r\nthe courtesy to remind us that in fact it was an old record from\r\n\r\n1985 which he was rehashing again.  It is a meaningless populist\r\n\r\ngimmick.   If  everybody  has to tighten belts,  then  naturally\r\n\r\nMinisters and MPs should also do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I say Singaporeans will have to tighten\r\n\r\ntheir belts.  I am saying that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> For example, in the 1985 recession,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  CPF  cut  and it applied  to  everybody.   If  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam had suggested that everybody in Singapore should have\r\n\r\nwages cut by 25%, then we could have a serious debate.  We would\r\n\r\ndisagree with him that this was necessary, but it would  not  be\r\n\r\nan  absurd proposition.  But how does cutting political salaries\r\n\r\nhelp  us  to tackle the regional crisis?  Indeed, Mr Jeyaretnam,\r\n\r\nin moving the motion, concedes that it would not, but presses on\r\n\r\nin characteristic fashion nevertheless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must focus on the real problems. The crisis has not hit\r\n\r\nus  directly.  But we will still suffer the side effects of  the\r\n\r\nregion's  problems.  Trade and tourism are down.   Uncertainties\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia and other countries will affect the whole  region.\r\n\r\nLoss  of  confidence  affects our stock  market,  and  also  our\r\n\r\nexchange  rate, although less than other countries.   There  may\r\n\r\nalso  be  direct  spillovers to us if  there  are  more  serious\r\n\r\nproblems.   For example, the latest Political and Economic  Risk\r\n\r\nConsultancy (PERC) Report on Singapore speaks of the possibility\r\n\r\nof  a  \"population  exodus that could  result  in  thousands  of\r\n\r\neconomic refugees with little money or marketable skills seeking\r\n\r\nfood and shelter in Singapore\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an alarmist prospect. It may not happen, but you\r\n\r\ncannot  tell  what  may happen.  The crisis is  far  from  over.\r\n\r\nNobody  predicted the last eight months of turbulence.  Not  the\r\n\r\nIMF, not the World\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBank,   not   the  pundits,  neither  the  countries   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  not even the hedge funds.  If Indonesia  stabilises\r\n\r\nafter  the  elections in March, the rupiah recovers  its  value,\r\n\r\ncompanies  can service their debt, workers have their  jobs  and\r\n\r\ncan  earn  a  living  and  buy food  and  essentials,  then  the\r\n\r\nsituation in the region will gradually return to normal.  But if\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  economic  problems  continue,  and  there  is  high\r\n\r\nunemployment,  inflation,  food  shortages,  and  people  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to buy oil or flour or milk powder for their babies,  or\r\n\r\nsugar  or medicines, then we too will feel the effects.   Nobody\r\n\r\ncan predict how events are going to unfold over the next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our priorities now? I would put three: First, to\r\n\r\nrally  Singaporeans to be prepared for rough  weather,  to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore on an even keel despite the storm.  Second, to help to\r\n\r\nrestore stability and growth in the region, within the limits of\r\n\r\nour  capabilities, eg, through our active diplomacy,  discussing\r\n\r\nthe  matter, lobbying, suggesting proposals to other  countries,\r\n\r\nthrough  visits,  as  the Prime Minister has  visited  Indonesia\r\n\r\nthree times, and Malaysia recently.  Third, to prepare ourselves\r\n\r\nfor  the longer term and strengthen our competitiveness, so that\r\n\r\nwhen the region starts growing again, we will be well poised  to\r\n\r\nprosper for the region. So despite the uncertainty, despite  the\r\n\r\nmood  of  gloom  and  despondency, Mr Peter Seah  published  his\r\n\r\nreport  on financial services, and the Government has responded,\r\n\r\naccepting nearly all its recommendations, not to deal with  this\r\n\r\nyear's  growth rate for the financial sector or the GDP, but  to\r\n\r\nposition us for the medium term when the region recovers for  us\r\n\r\nto have all the pre-conditions in place, engine already running,\r\n\r\nstep on the accelerator and you are off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to work together as one country on these urgent\r\n\r\ntasks.  It is not going to be an easy year.  Growth is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  slower.   Companies  will make less profits.   Workers  will\r\n\r\nreceive   smaller  bonuses.   Some  will  be  retrenched.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  budget  will be tighter, leaving a  smaller  surplus\r\n\r\navailable for asset enhancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily we are competitive, compared to other countries.\r\n\r\nUnlike  in 1985, our costs are not out of line.  If you  measure\r\n\r\nexchange rates against the US dollar, the baht, the ringgit, the\r\n\r\nrupiah  and  the  won  have all gone down  much  more  than  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar.  This had made these countries  cheaper  than\r\n\r\nus,  in  a  way,  more competitive than us.  But the  effect  is\r\n\r\nsmaller  than  these  numbers suggest, because,  firstly,  these\r\n\r\ncountries have not been able to increase their exports  sharply.\r\n\r\nThey   lack  trade  financing  (which  our  multilateral   trade\r\n\r\nguarantee  proposal is meant to deal with). And also  the  lower\r\n\r\nexchange rates have been offset by very high interest rates  and\r\n\r\na credit crunch.  So they are unable to export and therefore our\r\n\r\nexports are maintaining market share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we export a different mix of products than the\r\n\r\ncountries  do.   We  are higher end, more technology  intensive.\r\n\r\nThey  are  still  mostly in the textiles and garments.   So  the\r\n\r\ncompetition  is less.  There is some overlap in electronics,  in\r\n\r\ndisk  drives, which has been affecting us.  But it is a  partial\r\n\r\noverlap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, over time high inflation will erode the cost\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  their  sharp depreciation  of  their  currencies.\r\n\r\nAlready  this  is happening in Indonesia.  Between December  and\r\n\r\nJanuary,  the inflation was 7% in one month in consumer  prices.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the risk is hyperinflation.  So although the cost  may\r\n\r\nhave gone down temporarily, it is not an advantage which can  be\r\n\r\nsustained because workers need to be fed, need to live.  If they\r\n\r\ncannot eat, they may riot.  And if they are paid more, then that\r\n\r\nwould  spiral  through, and you will be back  at  your  starting\r\n\r\npoint  but  with an extra zero on your currencies  and  on  your\r\n\r\nsalaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So overall, although the exchange rate of the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar has gone down much less than our neighbour's, I am  still\r\n\r\nconfident that our exporters can compete.  They have problems if\r\n\r\nthey are working in the region.  They have problems if they  are\r\n\r\nin  difficult  businesses, like disk  drives.   But  it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause we are out of line and uncompetitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we should still watch our costs this year, to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that we do not stray out of line.  One  cost  factor\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can control is Government rates and charges.   As  Dr\r\n\r\nTony  Tan said, the Government will be careful not to raise fees\r\n\r\nthis  year,  except where it is essential.  So, for example,  as\r\n\r\nthe  crisis  developed  last year, JTC and  HDB  took  steps  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  or defer rental increases for its lessees and tenants.\r\n\r\nBut  the rise in PUB water tariffs, announced last year,  to  be\r\n\r\nphased  in over three years, with another adjustment this  year,\r\n\r\nwill  continue.   Firstly, because water is  a  vital  strategic\r\n\r\nresource.   And secondly, because the impact of the increase  in\r\n\r\nwater  rates on lower income households will be fully offset  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  rebates  for utility  bills.   So  we  have  to\r\n\r\nproceed, and we have seen to it that we are proceeding in a  way\r\n\r\nwhich does not hurt the lower income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key cost factor is wages. In the 1985 recession,\r\n\r\nwhen  wage  costs became too high, we had to cut employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  by  15% points, from 25% down  to  10%.   But  we\r\n\r\nlearnt  from that experience the importance of wage flexibility.\r\n\r\nSo we have used the good years since 1985 to build up the flexi-wage system, precisely to meet a situation like this one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant part of wages is now in the variable\r\n\r\ncomponent,  both  public sector wages and  also  private  sector\r\n\r\nwages.   And  as a matter of policy, we have kept  the  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent separate from the fixed wages, so that employees  will\r\n\r\nbe  psychologically prepared for it to go down as well as to  go\r\n\r\nup,  depending on economic conditions.  We have not consolidated\r\n\r\nit.  We have not built it in.  We have kept it separate, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  marked  it separate, and every time we have increased  the\r\n\r\namount we have reminded people this is variable - it can go  up,\r\n\r\nit  can  go  down.  It is a cushion which we can trim  back,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, without causing too much hardship to workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, the variable component makes up at\r\n\r\nleast  20%  of wages.  Civil servants and ministers  receive  an\r\n\r\nAnnual  Variable  Component of two months'  salaries  per  year.\r\n\r\nThey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  receive a monthly Non-Pensionable Variable Payment (NPVP),\r\n\r\nwhich includes all the NWC adjustments since 1993.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if it becomes necessary for us to reduce wage costs, the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  will  do  so  by trimming  the  Annual  Variable\r\n\r\nComponent, which will not affect the monthly pay packet.  And if\r\n\r\nwe still need to trim by more, we can adjust the NPVP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will know if it is necessary to trim the Annual Variable\r\n\r\nComponent  or the NPVP for Ministers and civil servants  by  the\r\n\r\ntime  the  NWC  makes its recommendations  for  the  year.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  as usual decide on its NWC payment  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants and Ministers after that.  It will then decide  whether\r\n\r\nto trim the Annual Variable Component or NPVP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mdm Claire Chiang and also Mr Chiam pointed out,\r\n\r\nMinisters'  and  civil servants' salaries are not  fixed.   They\r\n\r\nrise and fall automatically with private sector incomes, because\r\n\r\nthey  are pegged by a formula to salaries in the private sector,\r\n\r\nand they are revised every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Staff Grade 1 is set at 60% of the average of 24 people\r\n\r\n(the   top  four  individuals  from  six  professions:  bankers,\r\n\r\naccountants,  engineers, lawyers, local manufacturing  companies\r\n\r\nand  multi-national companies), ie, the average principal earned\r\n\r\nincome  of  the top four in each of these six professions.   And\r\n\r\nStaff Grade 1 is 60% of that, and we have said eventually it  is\r\n\r\nto reach two-thirds of that over four years from1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale G is the average principal earned income of the\r\n\r\n15th person who is aged 32 years old, belonging to the same  six\r\n\r\nprofessions,  because  that is the point  where  a  young  civil\r\n\r\nservant  should be reaching at that age and is making a critical\r\n\r\ncomparison at a key point in his career.  So compared  with  his\r\n\r\ncohort, 32 years old, let us get the people in these professions\r\n\r\nranked at 15th.  If you can make it to \"G\" by 32, you should  be\r\n\r\nequal to them and deserve to be paid as well as them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a two-year lag in this formula, because we need\r\n\r\ntwo years to work the data.  The 1998 adjustment this year is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbased  on  private sector incomes which were paid in  1996,  and\r\n\r\nassessed  by  IRAS in 1997, and would be adjusted by  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  for Ministers in 1998.  But despite this two-year  lag,\r\n\r\nthe  formula maintains the right relativities between Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries and private sector earnings, whether the economy is  up\r\n\r\nor  down.   So,  for  example, last year (1997),  the  benchmark\r\n\r\ndeclined, so the Ministers' salaries were cut by 7%.  It happens\r\n\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the benchmark would be based on 1996 private\r\n\r\nsector earnings.  On that basis, the average 24, which means the\r\n\r\nStaff  1  benchmark, has increased by 12.8%, and the 15P32,  the\r\n\r\nSuperscale  G benchmark, has increased by 4.0%.  If we  subtract\r\n\r\nfrom  these  two  figures the 4.5% NWC wage adjustment  in  July\r\n\r\n1997,  then this year's Staff 1 salary, which also carries  with\r\n\r\nit  Ministers' salaries, should go up by 8.1%, just to  maintain\r\n\r\n60% of average 24.  And the Superscale G salary should come down\r\n\r\nby 0.4%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These adjustments would normally take place on 1st July.\r\n\r\nBut this is an exceptional year.  We still expect the economy to\r\n\r\nshow  positive  growth,  not negative  growth  or  a  recession.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there are major uncertainties ahead.   And  if  events\r\n\r\ntake an unexpected turn, all bets are off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Government has decided to suspend this\r\n\r\nyear's  adjustment for the Staff 1 benchmark.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  Staff  1  salary  will  be frozen  this  year,  instead  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  by  8.1%  on 1st July.  The 0.4%  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nSuperscale  G salary will proceed.  This applies to  both  civil\r\n\r\nservants  and  political office holders.  Other grades  will  be\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly adjusted.  In effect salaries of all grades will\r\n\r\nbe  frozen  or very slightly reduced this year.  Promotions  and\r\n\r\nnormal  increments  will  continue,  and  if  there  is  an  NWC\r\n\r\nadjustment  this year, it will apply to all officers,  including\r\n\r\nMinisters and MPs.  Next year, when we have the IRAS figures for\r\n\r\n1997 earnings, we will review the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers have already decided to freeze their\r\n\r\nsalaries  for this year.  Others who are still doing  well  will\r\n\r\nwant to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreward their workers.  The NWC will deliberate on the guidelines\r\n\r\nwhich employers and workers will follow.  But by suspending this\r\n\r\nyear's  salary adjustment for Ministers and civil  servants,  we\r\n\r\nwill set the tone for the private sector as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone should be restraint and caution. We must take the\r\n\r\ncrisis  seriously but in our stride.  We did not wish  for  this\r\n\r\ncrisis,  but it will draw us together.  Let us work together  as\r\n\r\none  people to tackle this challenge.  Then we will sail through\r\n\r\nthe storm safely, and emerge ahead once more.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to\r\n\r\ndetain our Members much too long from their dinners.  Yes, it is\r\n\r\nlong  enough.  They do not like to hear any proposals for taking\r\n\r\na  reduction in their salaries.  Of course, they do not wish  to\r\n\r\nhear  that.   They  do  not wish to hear  anything  about  being\r\n\r\nsetting  an example.  That is the last thing they want to  hear.\r\n\r\nSo,  of course, the response, \"Shut up!  Mr Jeyaretnam, and keep\r\n\r\nquiet.   We don't want to hear all these.  It is painful  to  us\r\n\r\nthat you ask us to set an example.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that this debate has run\r\n\r\ntrue to form.  There is nothing that I have heard this afternoon\r\n\r\nin  answer which I did not expect.  I knew what was coming.   It\r\n\r\nhas  run true to form.  The Deputy Prime Minister says it  is  a\r\n\r\nrehash  of my 1985 motion.  What is his?  If it is not a  rehash\r\n\r\nof  what we heard in 1985 from the then Minister of State  -  he\r\n\r\nhas  of course gone up the ladder, he is now a Cabinet Minister,\r\n\r\nand  I  see he is not replying - what is it, but a rehash.   But\r\n\r\nbefore  I reply to the Deputy Prime Minister, may I make  a  few\r\n\r\nresponses to the others who have spoken.  Again, as I said, this\r\n\r\nis  nothing new.  It is running true to form.  The first speaker\r\n\r\ntries  to  dismiss it as mere politics, trying to make political\r\n\r\ncapital.  I think perhaps he would do well, if I may just say to\r\n\r\nhim  to  go and speak to his own constituents and find  out  for\r\n\r\nhimself,  at  first  hand, whether it is  political  capital  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it is something quite different.  It is a call for  him\r\n\r\nto identify himself with the people.  I suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  goes and speaks to his own constituents because I have heard\r\n\r\nthis   I cannot call them \"my constituents\"  from the voters  in\r\n\r\nCheng  San, when I go round, they know what I am talking  about.\r\n\r\nIt is not political capital.  You will find out for yourself, if\r\n\r\nyou do go round and mix with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, running through to form, he says, \"Oh, the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done all this, done all this, done  all  this.\"\r\n\r\nThis  is  what  we  have heard ad nauseam.  And  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  also know what the PAP Government has done all  these\r\n\r\nyears.   Why  do you not go and ask them what the PAP Government\r\n\r\nhas done?  The cost of living has gone up.  Life has become more\r\n\r\nand more a struggle.  Life is too regulated and controlled.  Why\r\n\r\ndo  you not go and ask them instead of trying to score political\r\n\r\ncapital in this House in front of the Members here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think that I need to waste any time with the\r\n\r\nfirst  speaker's reply.  It is nothing new.  But may I  ask  him\r\n\r\nthis?   He says the PAP Government has provided all the  savings\r\n\r\nthat  they  can use during their hard times.  What  savings  are\r\n\r\nthere for the people during the hard times that lie ahead?   Let\r\n\r\nus have some concrete proposals instead of words, words, words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the Nominated Member of Parliament, Mdm Claire\r\n\r\nChiang.   I was surprised that she took up cudgels on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe Government.  That was to be expected, Nominated MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I take exception to that remark by\r\n\r\nMr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I am not withdrawing. I said this\r\n\r\nwas to be expected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> You are not being fair to the Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament.  We are here not to represent either  the\r\n\r\nPAP or the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have the floor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have the floor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Well, if you want to have the floor,\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Again, the Nominated Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nrepeats  what we were told in 1985 and what we heard  afterwards\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Deputy Prime Minister that if it is necessary  for  a\r\n\r\nnational  reduction in salaries, then perhaps  Ministers  should\r\n\r\nset  the lead.  There you have it.  \"No, we are not going to  be\r\n\r\nthe  first.  You do it first.  If you do it first, then we  will\r\n\r\nfollow.\"   That is the sort of leadership we have  got.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot,  \"We  will set you an example so that others  may  follow.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the kind of leadership one expects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated Member of Parliament asks: will the others\r\n\r\nalso  follow  suit?  Well, who knows, they will follow  suit  if\r\n\r\nthey  see  that  the Ministers have decided to set  an  example,\r\n\r\npeople in the industries and people in the banks may follow suit\r\n\r\nand  decide  that  they  will make their  contribution  as  well\r\n\r\nbecause  you  have  the Ministers setting  an  example  and  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament setting an example.  So do not,  please,\r\n\r\nwait  for  someone  else to set you an  example.   You  set  the\r\n\r\nexample yourself first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated MP again says my motion is a political or\r\n\r\nemotional  issue.   This  is not just a  gimmick.   The  British\r\n\r\nCabinet,  the  Labour Government and, in particular,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, after he was elected - and that country is not  facing\r\n\r\nany  crisis  or economic downturn - said he would not  take  any\r\n\r\nincrease  and, in fact, would take a cut in his salaries.   Then\r\n\r\nit  was followed by other Ministers because the people could see\r\n\r\nthe  great  disparity  between the  ordinary  salaries  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters' salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the example over the Causeway, which I\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  1985.  Immediately upon the commencement  of  the\r\n\r\ncrisis,  the Prime Minister announced he would take a  reduction\r\n\r\nand  he  was followed by other Ministers and even judges of  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court.  So let us get it right.  Everyone will follow if we\r\n\r\nlead  instead of waiting for somebody else to start.  And is  it\r\n\r\nto  be  suggested  that  the salaries  have  not  gone  down  or\r\n\r\nbeenreduced  in the private sector?  Mr Chiam was talking  about\r\n\r\nearnings  of  lawyers but I am not just concerned with  lawyers.\r\n\r\nIs it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot a fact that people who are earning are earning less now than\r\n\r\nwhat they were?  So have they not taken a reduction?  And I  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  Deputy  Prime Minister has attempted  to  answer  the\r\n\r\nquestion.  But Mr Chiam's question was, if the salaries  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  have gone down, are the Ministers  prepared  to\r\n\r\ntake a lower salary?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam will allow me to clarify the point which he has  just\r\n\r\nraised.  As I have explained, the Ministers' salaries are pegged\r\n\r\nto  the  private sector.  When the private sector's salaries  go\r\n\r\ndown,  the Ministers' salaries will also go down as soon  as  we\r\n\r\nascertain what the private sector's state of affairs is.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you ascertained now, because they have\r\n\r\ngone down?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As I have just explained, the latest\r\n\r\ndata we have are 1996 salaries reported to the IRAS in 1997, and\r\n\r\ndeclared  in 1998.  So in 1997, I imagine that wages would  have\r\n\r\ngone  down  some,  because the crisis started in  mid-year.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  it would go down some more.  So correspondingly in  1999,\r\n\r\nGovernment's salaries will go down, and in the year  2000  also.\r\n\r\nIt  follows.   So  there is no magic to this.   If  you  have  a\r\n\r\nformula  and  the  peg, you have to follow up and  you  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow down.  So I do not see what the difficulty is.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am afraid the Deputy Prime Minister does\r\n\r\nnot  see the import of my motion and, that is, action now in the\r\n\r\nmidst of a crisis, not action in the year 2001 when we will  see\r\n\r\nwhether we need to take a reduction in our salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nexplained  what we are doing, which is to suspend the adjustment\r\n\r\nwhich  is  due  this year, and we will watch the  situation  and\r\n\r\ndecide  what happens next year.  The test of the policy  is  not\r\n\r\nwhether  you  have  done  a histrionic  gesture  and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has taken the lead and he has volunteered; and then his\r\n\r\nDeputy   Prime   Ministers  volunteer;  his  Cabinet   Ministers\r\n\r\nvolunteer, and the MPs do, and even NCMPs hasten not to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  last.  The test is who gets into a bigger hole and  who  has\r\n\r\navoided the hole and got out faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, he moved a motion to cut salaries. We turned it\r\n\r\ndown.  But we did not stay in the hole.  We got out of the hole,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  why we have had 12 years of growth since  then  until\r\n\r\nthis   regional  problem  came.   That  is  the  test  of   good\r\n\r\ngovernment, identification with the people and the competence of\r\n\r\nthe team in charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import of Mr Jeyaretnam's motion is that we will make\r\n\r\nvoluntary cuts.  He says it is not a political gimmick.  What is\r\n\r\nit?   If  he  wants  to  make  a voluntary  cut  in  his  NCMP's\r\n\r\nallowance,  he  can do it.  Why does he have to tell  the  whole\r\n\r\nworld?  Why does he have to wait for the whole world?  Why  does\r\n\r\nhe  care  whether anybody else makes voluntary contributions  or\r\n\r\notherwise?   There  is a Malay saying that when  a  turtle  lays\r\n\r\neggs,  it  lays 100 and nobody hears about it.  When  a  chicken\r\n\r\nlays eggs, the whole village is awakened by the cackling of  the\r\n\r\nhen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, that is very funny, Mr Deputy Speaker.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, it just shows how the whole of the import of\r\n\r\nthis  motion is lost.  It is just evasive, because that  is  all\r\n\r\nthat  the Members of the ruling party are capable of, evade  and\r\n\r\nnothing  else, not capable of any reasoned answers.  The  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  says the answer is to try and get  out  of  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  your message?  What is your message to those who  have\r\n\r\nlost  their  jobs and who find that they cannot make their  ends\r\n\r\nmeet?   They  have no savings at all.  What is your  message  to\r\n\r\nthem?   The  Deputy  Prime Minister says we have  got  to  rally\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  But what is your message to these people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The message is very simple. We have\r\n\r\nbeen broadcasting it for years except that Mr Jeyaretnam has not\r\n\r\nheard  it.   It  is  that life is uncertain,  the  international\r\n\r\neconomy  is uncertain.  No job has security.  Ministers  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  job security.  If you are in a job which pays well  today,\r\n\r\nyou cannot be sure that it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  there  for  the rest of your working career.   You  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared for an upset, you must be prepared for something  which\r\n\r\nis  unexpected, and the way to prepare for it is  to  train,  to\r\n\r\ngain skills, to have something valuable which you can contribute\r\n\r\nto.  So when you lose one job, you can get into another one, and\r\n\r\nto  put  aside and save for a rainy day, instead of  saying,  \"I\r\n\r\nwill  spend  this.  The Government will provide.\"  And  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat we have done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have retrenchments. Can we avoid it?

Our small workforce of 1.9 million is a major limiting\r\n\r\nfactor.  With increasing global competition, our economic growth\r\n\r\nwill be severely constrained by a shortage of talent.  There  is\r\n\r\na   limit  to  what  we  can  generate  ourselves  through   our\r\n\r\nuniversities and polytechnics.  For instance, NUS  and  NTU  can\r\n\r\ngenerate  about 9,000 graduates yearly.  This is much less  than\r\n\r\nthe  projected requirement of 17,000 graduates per year by  Year\r\n\r\n2000 to sustain economic growth. Foreign talents are thus needed\r\n\r\nto  supplement  our  very  own so that economic  growth  can  be\r\n\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infusion of foreign talents will enhance our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.    In   an  intensely  competitive   globalised\r\n\r\neconomy,  Singapore  has  to  stay ahead  by  restructuring  our\r\n\r\neconomy  towards  more  knowledge-based and technology-intensive\r\n\r\nindustries. Already, some competitors are fast becoming  a  real\r\n\r\nchallenge   in   many  areas  where  we  have  had   comparative\r\n\r\nadvantages.   We  need to tap new growth areas and  move  on  to\r\n\r\nhigher value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadded   activities   in  order  to  stay  ahead.    To   transit\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  into  a  knowledge-based  economy,  we  need   the\r\n\r\ninfusion of top talents to supplement our own citizens. Imported\r\n\r\ntalents  will  bring with them new ideas, innovation,  and  good\r\n\r\npractices that will help us in our upgrading efforts.  They  can\r\n\r\nhelp us to remain competitive in the face of future challenges.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should not feel threatened by the admission\r\n\r\nof  foreign talents. Employment of foreign talents is not a zero\r\n\r\nsum game.  Rather than displacing local workers, foreign talents\r\n\r\nfill  up  the  gaps in our manpower resources  and  help  us  to\r\n\r\nachieve higher rates of economic growth.  By helping us to  grow\r\n\r\nthe   economic  pie,  foreign  talents  can  contribute  to  job\r\n\r\nopportunities and rewards for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign talents do not always cost less than locals. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the top talents we are eyeing are in demand globally  and\r\n\r\nthey  command high wages.  Companies in Singapore would have  to\r\n\r\ncompete  vigorously to attract these talents.  In the same  way,\r\n\r\ncompanies  would  also need to step up efforts to  retain  local\r\n\r\ntalents  who  are  equally  mobile  and  in  demand.   The  real\r\n\r\nchallenge  facing  Singapore would  be  one  of  attracting  and\r\n\r\nretaining  talents,  whether foreign or local,  to  sustain  and\r\n\r\nenhance   our   economic  competitiveness.  Rather   than   feel\r\n\r\nthreatened, Singaporeans should rise up to the challenges ahead,\r\n\r\nand  upgrade  their  knowledge and skills to raise  quality  and\r\n\r\nproductivity.   The exposure to competition will invigorate  our\r\n\r\nworkforce, sharpen our skills and stimulate dynamism within  the\r\n\r\neconomy.

There  is  a time lag between  the  dates  of  fuel\r\n\r\npurchases  and  usage.

As  a  result,  the fuel price  in  Singapore  dollars\r\n\r\nincreased  by  about 21%.  The tariff increase of 0.7  cents/kWh\r\n\r\nfor  the quarter February to April 1998 is mainly to offset  the\r\n\r\nhigher-than-expected fuel cost in the previous quarters.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October 1997, fuel oil prices in US dollars have\r\n\r\nfallen but the US dollar has continued to appreciate against the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar.   The  net effect of these  changes  will  be\r\n\r\nreflected  in  the tariff review for the next quarter.

It  was\r\n\r\nintended that this two-year moratorium period be used to  review\r\n\r\nSingapore's  position  on APLs and to consider  whether  or  not\r\n\r\nSingapore was in a position to sign the Ottawa Treaty.

The\r\n\r\nHelpline is published through a brochure issued by the CDC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various CDCs are actively working with the voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations to set up new services and schemes to better  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SHARED VALUES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Education whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will give priority to the inclusion  of  shared\r\n\r\nvalues as a component of national education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of Shared Values was first mooted by PM Goh in\r\n\r\nthe  late  1980s  as  a  way  for us to  develop  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nidentity.    The  five  Shared  Values  were  then  adopted   in\r\n\r\nParliament in 1993 after a nation-wide discussion and debate.     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shared Values are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nation before community and society above self.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Family as the basic unit of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Community support and respect for the individual\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Consensus not conflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Racial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shared Values are an integral part of National\r\n\r\nEducation.    As   National  Education   is   about   developing\r\n\r\nresponsible  citizenship  and a sense  of  rootedness  in  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  the  Shared Values fit  naturally  into  National\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Six National Education messages are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.\r\n\r\n<br>We want to keep our heritage and our way of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We must preserve racial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br>Though many races, languages, religions and cultures, we pursue one destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility.\r\n\r\n<br>This means opportunity for all, according to their ability and effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- No one owes Singapore a living.\r\n\r\n<br>We must find our own way to survive and prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We must ourselves defend Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>No one else is responsible for our security and well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We have confidence in our future.\r\n\r\n<br>United, determined and well-prepared, we shall build a bright future for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
