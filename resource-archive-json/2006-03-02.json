But over two periods&nbsp;every year, there would normally be an increase in influenza incidence: April to July and November to January.&nbsp; They roughly correspond&nbsp;to the southern winter and&nbsp;northern winter respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Influenza A is the predominant circulating influenza virus here. In the last&nbsp;three months, its incidence peaked in the first week of January 2006, when 5.7% of all patients who presented with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) tested positive for Influenza A. This&nbsp;rate of 5.7% is, in fact, lower than the corresponding&nbsp;figure of 17.9% in 2004 or&nbsp;7.0% in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, H3N2 - this is the Hong Kong flu that caused&nbsp;an epidemic in 1968 - and H1N1, the infamous Spanish flu which caused a major problem for the world in 1918, have been the influenza virus subtypes in circulation.&nbsp; To date, H5N1 has not been identified in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, whether among humans or birds.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir, anecdotal evidence from many people I talked to tells me that this is a very strong virus, and people&nbsp;are&nbsp;suffering very badly from the cough.&nbsp; It seems that&nbsp;this is something different.&nbsp; Is there a special medicine for this?&nbsp; Or is it something that normal medicine is able to cure the flu?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I wonder where did Mr Chia get his anecdotes from because, fortunately,&nbsp;there&nbsp;is no H5N1 yet in Singapore.&nbsp; He may have friends in Indonesia or Vietnam, but most of them who got it have died.&nbsp; The symptoms are the usual flu&nbsp;and severe pneumonia with many complications.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fatality&nbsp;rate is high.&nbsp; I think the recorded cases&nbsp;in about&nbsp;seven countries is more than 100.&nbsp; The fatality rate is more than half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a serious problem.&nbsp; Fortunately, for&nbsp;human beings, the problem remains&nbsp;one that largely affects the animals.&nbsp; There is now a world pandemic.&nbsp; We see&nbsp;it&nbsp;in Germany, Turkey,&nbsp;Africa, among the birds.&nbsp; It remains among the birds.&nbsp; The risk is that one&nbsp;day, the virus will mutate and become much more infectious&nbsp;- spreading from human to human.&nbsp; And that is why all of us have to quickly gear up and we have been doing so, like any other country.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Is the Government prepared for such a contingency to shut-down the whole Government, all systems and all companies in the event of such a pandemic?&nbsp; Are we prepared for this?&nbsp; What are the likely consequences of such a shut-down?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, preparations take the form of the Flu Pandemic Preparedness Plan which, by now, practically all countries would have it.&nbsp; We have been refining our Plan for a couple of years now, and it is fully published in the website.&nbsp; Like all plans, you can never be fully prepared, because while the risk now is H5N1, when it happens,&nbsp;will it&nbsp;actually be H5N1 or some other virus?&nbsp; Nature has a way to surprise.&nbsp; But there are certain generic principles&nbsp;which we can follow&nbsp;to gear up as much as we can.&nbsp; And we will continue to refine our plan.&nbsp; We have, in fact, discussed it in this House not too many months ago in response to some Members' query.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own assessment is this.&nbsp; I think our own domestic preparation plan is as good as one can get.&nbsp; But in the last few months, we have&nbsp;devoted&nbsp;our energy to work upstream,&nbsp;on the preventive aspects.&nbsp; And&nbsp;it is possible to prevent it.&nbsp; The world&nbsp;has a window to prevent this disaster from happening, but it requires cooperation from many countries, especially those with large agricultural sectors.&nbsp; That is why we work with our neighbours.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;Members would have read and I have spoken about it in this House that we are doing a major project helping Indonesia, working not just between our two countries but involving America and many other countries.&nbsp; In fact, they are right now in town to discuss this pilot project, and I am meeting them tonight.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, although I eat very little meat, I continue to occasionally eat Kentucky fried chickens.&nbsp; This H5N1 reminds me of the SARS virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is&nbsp;fearsome when it spreads, it is easily killed outside of a host.&nbsp; At a temperature of&nbsp;60 degrees, I think, the virus is killed.&nbsp; Therefore, if the chicken is properly cooked, eggs are properly boiled, the risk is almost zero.&nbsp; Therefore, when Singaporeans travel overseas, just stay away from chicken farms and wet markets where slaughtering continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we stopped the slaughtering of&nbsp;poultry in wet markets 15 years ago, there was a lot of unhappiness coming from housewives.&nbsp; But what an important contribution it&nbsp;has made to our public health.&nbsp; It has reduced significantly this risk.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For the past two years,&nbsp;they have been inspecting farms in Malaysia and making sure that the chicken farms&nbsp;which export to us are properly bio-secured.&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk&nbsp;therefore is very low, as we only import chickens from these areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, a&nbsp;large proportion of our eggs are&nbsp;locally supplied, and AVA has made sure that our farms in Singapore are properly bio-secured.&nbsp; Unless you start smuggling eggs from I do not know where,&nbsp;I think it is quite safe&nbsp;to continue&nbsp;eating your boiled eggs.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:INDIVIDUAL EMAIL ACCOUNTS FOR SINGAPOREANS--><p align=left>Column No : 672<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> already has one of the highest Internet access and infocomm savvy population in the world.&nbsp; The Infocomm Development Authority's latest Annual Survey of Infocomm Usage in Households and by Individuals&nbsp; shows that 66% of households enjoy Internet access.&nbsp; Over three-quarters of companies&nbsp; made use of the Internet.&nbsp; Singaporeans are Internet-savvy and sophisticated in our Internet usage with 61% of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s resident population aged 15 years and above using the Internet regularly.&nbsp; Email is the top Internet application used.&nbsp; About 94% surveyed said that they used email.&nbsp; This means that a high percentage of our people already have an existing email account.&nbsp; Of these accounts, some may be personal paid accounts offered by access service providers such as SingNet or Pacific Internet, personal free accounts obtained from providers such as Google and Yahoo, or accounts issued by MINDEF, schools and their employers.&nbsp; In fact, many Singaporeans have more than one email account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Government need to compete against existing service providers in issuing and maintaining email accounts for every Singaporean?&nbsp; &nbsp;To do so, the Government will&nbsp;need to expend additional resources in hardware, software and manpower.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case supporting the potential benefit from such free email accounts is not strong.&nbsp; From focus group discussions conducted by IDA, individuals have generally expressed their preference to use their existing personal email accounts rather than a new Government-issued email account.&nbsp; This could be because many people already have&nbsp;a problem&nbsp;managing multiple accounts for both&nbsp;personal use and their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process-wise, we cannot assume that every Singaporean will diligently access the Government issued email accounts to maintain direct communications with the Government agencies, such as the IRAS or CPF.&nbsp; This means that the Government will still need to continue with its current efforts to communicate with&nbsp;Singaporeans through a variety of media and also private communication channels.&nbsp; Hence, while email communication may be instantaneous and technically efficient, in practice, taking such an approach may not significantly affect public communications between the Government and the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, I think what we need to do is to show young people that the law is with them, not against them.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Curfew on Youths</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B>&nbsp; Sir, in the past, the Police used to organise Boys' Club.&nbsp; I think that is a very good thing rather than putting a curfew on the youths of today.&nbsp; The Boys' Club, I think, is more meaningful.&nbsp; They can&nbsp;keep the boys away from the streets and also&nbsp;keep them away from doing mischief.&nbsp; The Boys' Club can teach these boys social skills.&nbsp; I think this Boys' Club should be revived rather than to impose curfew on the youths, which, I believe, is counter-productive.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim is not here.&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Foreign Workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</B>&nbsp; Sir, on the subject of foreign workers, I wish to ask the Ministry of Home Affairs to exercise restraint in the issue of liquor licence to provision shop outlets operating 24 hours and even coffeeshops in housing estates.&nbsp; I would also like to ask MHA to provide a channel for the grassroots organisations and the community to be able to raise objections to the issue of liquor licence in the housing estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in my constituency in the Beach Road area, the problem has worsened with foreign workers congregating there, and residents are very unhappy because of their excessive drinking,&nbsp;getting into fights, making lots of noise and disturbing the peace. They also urinate and litter, posing health concerns to our people.&nbsp; And what is developing is that the locals are also taking up to the drinking habit, especially with the cheap liquor available. Two years ago, we were able to persuade the Liquor Licensing Board to stop the renewal of the liquor licence but they have since revived it and allowed it to continue.&nbsp; I believe the social cost far outweighs the liberal attitude that we adopt in making alcohol, especially the cheap ones, available.&nbsp; The young and the locals are beginning to get hooked in the drinking habit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we will&nbsp;not want to have a situation whereby alcohol is purchased and people are drinking in the streets, five-foot-ways and common areas.&nbsp; In fact, this is something that is not the desired situation that we want.&nbsp; People can enjoy their drinks in the privacy of their homes and&nbsp;in places that are not in common areas.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I think this is a trend that we want to stop.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Sir, yesterday, most of the MPs had spoken.&nbsp; And among those who were not here yesterday, an opportunity for them to speak was given this morning.&nbsp; From the English press reports, I notice that the emphasis seems to be on crime,&nbsp;KPIs and related issues concerning the Police.&nbsp; I want to deal with this first, although it is not the most important subject today that we have to deal with, particularly looking at the security situation that we face.&nbsp; But I want to get this subject over with so that I can explain to Members how to look at this issue of crime,&nbsp;KPIs and related issues from the proper perspective.&nbsp; I will then spend a bit of time talking about the more important subject, which is security, terrorism, counter-terrorism and how to prepare ourselves in the event of such a bomb explosion happening in Singapore.&nbsp; My Senior Minister of State and Senior Parliamentary Secretary will then answer specifically some of the other issues raised by Members.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a number of MPs have asked about the crime situation.&nbsp; While crime remains an area of the Ministry's work, let us not lose focus on the seriousness of the terrorism situation that we continue to face.&nbsp; That said, let me now get into the details of this overall crime situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, there has been an increase in crime rate by 19.9%, almost 20%, from 30,620 cases in 2004 to 36,700 cases in 2005.&nbsp; And I do feel that this increase is alarming.&nbsp; But if we were to examine the types of crime which have seen an increase, we will note that many of these crimes need not have happened, had the victims been more careful and vigilant. Many crimes were opportunistic in nature and could have been prevented if the victims were more responsible in taking care of their belongings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bulk of the increase in crime rate can be attributed to minor theft and related offences, such as theft in dwelling and other theft.&nbsp; Handphone crime featured prominently in the increases for several offences, most notably robbery, snatch theft and other theft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis has rightly pointed out that there has been a significant increase in cheating and related offences, housebreaking and snatch theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in cheating and related offences is due in part to a rise in cases of criminal breach of trust.&nbsp; Many of these involved handphones.&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical example is that of a culprit who fails to return the victim's handphone after borrowing it.&nbsp; They will say, \u201cMay I borrow your phone?\ufffd?, and they will walk away, or&nbsp;run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On housebreaking, there was an increase of some 230 cases, from 1,240 in 2004 to 1,470 cases in 2005.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>There was also an increase of 48 house-breaking involving culprits who gained entry through unsecured windows or doors.&nbsp; There was no sign of tampering of the premises.&nbsp; This suggests that the residents themselves had failed to secure their premises before they left their homes or before they went to sleep.&nbsp; Such crimes can be avoided if they take care to ensure their homes are well secured.&nbsp; Home-owners can prevent such crimes by installing alarm system to deter housebreakers and when it sounds, even if they are not at home, the neighbours can be alerted and I am sure would-be house-breakers would take precaution and run away.&nbsp; In 2005, there were 23&nbsp;serial house-breakers arrested for&nbsp;a total of 257 cases, compared to 28 serial house-breakers arrested for 208 cases in 2004.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khalis asked if there are special efforts to rehabilitate such serial offenders.&nbsp; While&nbsp;Prison does not have special rehabilitation programmes for serial house-breakers,&nbsp;it will customise the rehabilitation programmes based on the individual and his level of needs and the risk of offending.&nbsp; The programmes address the offenders' criminal thinking that causes offending behaviours and also help to impart pro-social life skills to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for snatch theft, where a person's belonging is forcibly snatched away from him, cases involving handphones have increased from 160 in 2004 to 280 in 2005.&nbsp; These 280 cases accounted for 45% of the snatch theft cases in 2005.&nbsp; Of particular concern&nbsp;are cases that&nbsp;target the handphones of young victims, which have increased from 50 cases to 93 cases in 2005.&nbsp; Robbery and theft cases involving handphones remain&nbsp;a key area of concern for the Police.&nbsp; The number of such cases increased significantly by 42% to 4,830 cases in 2005.&nbsp; This is due to the higher mobile phone penetration rate in Singapore, thereby giving to a larger pool of potential victims.&nbsp; Do you know how many handphone subscribers there are in Singapore?&nbsp; 4.3 million.&nbsp; So&nbsp;we must look at&nbsp;roughly 5,000 cases in the perspective of almost 4.3 million handphone subscribers in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, just looking back at the years of the 1950s, I am sure&nbsp;we will find&nbsp;bicycle thefts were high because those were the days we travelled&nbsp;on a bicycle.&nbsp; But today, possibly bicycle thefts are not of the same significance compared to handphones.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1950s, it would be&nbsp;zero handphone theft because no handphone was available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on KPIs, the increase in theft and related offences, especially in relation to handphones, is one of the reasons for the increase in the number of seizable offences, as reflected in the KPIs of&nbsp;MHA in the Budget book.&nbsp; Another key reason for this increase is more intensive Police enforcement against drink driving, which reflects the Home Team's commitment to keep our roads safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will address Mr Low Thia Khiang's and Mr Charles Chong's query about the Ministry's KPI indicators specifically.&nbsp; May I say that, except for an increase in the crime trend, the Home Team has met, if not exceeded, most of its key performance targets for FY 2004, and is expected to do as well for 2005 despite heightened security demands and&nbsp;limited resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the targets set for the indicators, I should point out that, among the targets for key performance indicators mentioned by Mr Low, two of them were actually revised upwards, not downwards, in 2004.&nbsp; For the \"percentage of urgent cases responded to within 15 minutes\", the target was revised from 85% to 87%, while the target of \"percentage of non-urgent cases responded to within 30 minutes\" was raised from 85% to 90%.&nbsp; The upward adjustment was due in part to the sustained period of good performance.&nbsp; While&nbsp;the actual performances on these two indicators from FY03 to FY05 had declined as reflected in the Budget book,&nbsp;they had actually exceeded the performance targets that we set.&nbsp; The targets then set were much lower than 90%.&nbsp; It was adjusted to 90% in 2004 and 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite&nbsp;heightened security demands, we have kept these two targets constant since FY04, and we have thus projected at 87% and 90% respectively for FY06.&nbsp; In addition, the target for \"percentage of 999 calls answered within 10 seconds\" has remained constant and was not adjusted downwards.&nbsp; It remains at a stringent 90% between FY03&nbsp;and FY05.&nbsp; Although the actual performance for this target actually declined slightly from 99% in FY03 to 97.4% in FY05,&nbsp;which was just a 1.6% point difference,&nbsp;it still exceeded the target set at 90%.&nbsp; So, if you read the data carefully, we are comparing the actual performance in FY03/04 and the target performance in FY05.&nbsp; The target performance actually was just&nbsp;at 90%.&nbsp; We have far exceeded that target and reached 99% and 97.5%.&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY05, it is 90%, and it may&nbsp;hit more than 90%.&nbsp; We will wait for the final figure.&nbsp; I think MPs have therefore misunderstood in their reading of the MHA's KPIs.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, we will continue to do our best to improve the performance vis-a-vis the targets we have set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low also asked if there has been a compromise on our neighbourhood security&nbsp;due to the focus on counter-terrorism and&nbsp;the hosting of high profile international events, like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings.&nbsp; Let me assure Members that we will continue to pay close attention to neighbourhood community policing and security.&nbsp; The Home Team has been able to manage its limited resources effectively so that we can balance the different competing demands while maintaining a high level of operational readiness and effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the headcount policy does impose some constraints on the Police -&nbsp;the Government has a headcount policy&nbsp;which we are also affected -&nbsp;we have been able to manage it quite well.&nbsp; In fact, we are able to manage the increase&nbsp;in demand because of the corporatisation of CISCO.&nbsp; The CISCO was corporatised with effect from last year which means that the spare headcount there could be added on to the MHA headcount.&nbsp; As such, we have kept the manpower resources in the Police relatively stable, at about 8,000 regular Police officers.&nbsp; If we include the National Service and the non-uniformed component because we also have civilian posts in the Police,&nbsp;the Police's strength has actually&nbsp;increased from 35,500 in 2001 to 37,200 in 2005.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, what matters is not just having a ubiquitous and pervasive Police presence but the effectiveness of the policing strategy.&nbsp; This is translated into the sense of&nbsp;security&nbsp;that&nbsp;people feel when they walk around Singapore.&nbsp; Safety and security are very valued dimensions in the quality of life in Singapore.&nbsp; In the first nationwide Safety and Security Survey conducted in October 2004, 83% of the respondents felt safe in the neighbourhood they lived in and 70% did not see crime as a problem.&nbsp; Foreigners have consistently provided feedback.&nbsp; They are amazed at how safe they feel when walking on the streets of Singapore in the wee hours of the morning. And they find&nbsp;this&nbsp;all the more impressive because they do not see an overwhelming Police presence.&nbsp; I have met people coming from America who asked me, \"How is it we don't see the Police even though Singapore is called a police state by their newspapers?\"&nbsp; I have friends coming from Hong Kong&nbsp;who asked me, \"How is it that Singapore's crime rate is so low and yet we don't see the Police officers?\"&nbsp; That is something quite remarkable because our people play their role and people feel safe, and the Police is&nbsp;effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the gun-related incidents that Ms Indranee Rajah referred to, and&nbsp;Mr Chiam also touched on it.&nbsp; From the data that we have had for the past five years on firearm offences, it appears that the recent gun-related incidents are isolated incidents. Between 2001 and 2005, there were only two cases of firearm offences, one in 2002 and the other in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we need not be overly concerned about the violent crimes involving firearms becoming a serious problem in Singapore, we will continue nevertheless to be vigilant and maintain our tough and zero-tolerance stance towards firearm offences.&nbsp; This is backed by the Arms Offences Act, which prescribes heavy punishment, including the death penalty, for offenders convicted of trafficking in arms and committing or attempting to commit scheduled offences with arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of loan sharks, which both Dr Tan Boon Wan and&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong mentioned, this is another crime which has an impact on the overall law and order situation in Singapore.&nbsp; Unlicensed moneylending or loan-sharking is&nbsp;a problem perceived by people to be serious.&nbsp; But let me put this in perspective again.&nbsp; Dr Tan Boon Wan asked what is the situation now after the amendments in the Moneylenders Act, which came into force this year.&nbsp; So far, seven people have been charged under the new Moneylenders Act for unlicensed moneylending with two of them also facing additional charges of harassment.&nbsp; Since last year, Police has conducted many operations and, since January this year, Police has conducted three successful operations which led to the arrest of 36 people.&nbsp; Cash amounting to almost $170,000 was seized together with&nbsp;notebooks, desktop computers and mobile phones.&nbsp; These operations have been made possible because the Police has centralised and&nbsp;beefed up&nbsp;its&nbsp;intelligence and enforcement resources under the Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Taskforce at the Criminal Investigation Department to tackle this scourge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the process of taking down an unlicensed moneylending syndicate, or any criminal syndicate for that matter, for example, drug trafficking, requires detailed and lengthy investigations and intelligence gathering.&nbsp; So it will take some time before we can see the full effect of the enhanced efforts to tackle this problem.&nbsp; I say we are making good progress and the overall assessment is that the enhanced penalties under the Moneylenders Act, the use of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, our policy of cancelling passports of convicted or detained higher-tier loan sharks as well as the more intensive enforcement actions by the Police are beginning to have an impact on the ground.&nbsp; Police is also working with the relevant agencies, such as the Law Ministry, the Housing and Development Board and the MAS, to deal with the problem comprehensively.&nbsp; We will continue to put pressure on the loan sharks to make it more difficult for them to operate in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan also asked about the case of a woman who suffered a miscarriage after confronting a loan shark.&nbsp; At this stage, we are not able to reveal any details on this case because investigations are still going on.&nbsp; But I wish to assure the House that the Police takes a stern view&nbsp;of unlicensed moneylending activities and will not let up on its efforts to bring to&nbsp;justice the culprit of this case and for other cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Ministry will continue to monitor the crime trends, adjust our crime-fighting strategies and make legislative amendments, if necessary, to enhance deterrence.&nbsp; One of the strategies that the Police will continue to pursue is&nbsp;a strong partnership with the community in preventing crime.&nbsp; The recent partnership with the community went back a long way, and I want to thank the people for their contributions in this community policing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police will work with grassroots organisations to promote a greater sense of vigilance in our neighbourhood. In particular,&nbsp;grassroots volunteers,</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Police will also leverage on the Neighbourhood Watch Zone (NWZ) scheme to rope in more residents to help look out for one another and to inform Police of suspicious persons loitering in their neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SMS Crime Alert Services is another new initiative by the Police.&nbsp; Under the scheme, Police will send SMS messages to alert community leaders, Neighbourhood Watch Zone volunteers and business associations on salient crime trends.&nbsp; This has been tried out on a pilot basis since August last year, and the Police will consider extending the SMS alert service to the wider community later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police is also working with the town councils to install CCTVs in common areas in HDB estates, such as the ground lift landings in void decks, as a crime prevention measure as well as to deter littering and other kinds of localised problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the high incidence of crimes involving handphones, the Police is also implementing measures to disrupt the disposal of stolen handphones.&nbsp; Since June 2005, where there are reasons to do so, the Police has checked the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number of the handphones of persons who were stopped by the Police.&nbsp; In April 2006, a website will be set up to enable the public to check if a used handphone they intend to buy has been reported stolen.&nbsp; So, all&nbsp;they need to do is to look up the website, check the IMEI number and&nbsp;they will know whether the phone has been reported as lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police will step up its public education efforts through a poster advertisement campaign to remind the public to be alert against handphones and other crimes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the crime rate has gone up in 2005, I would say that the overall law and order situation remains well under control.&nbsp; Singapore remains one of the safest cities in the world.&nbsp; The Home Team will continue to work closely with the community to ensure that Singapore remains a safe and secure best home for all.&nbsp; This is because keeping Singapore safe and secure is not just the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs alone.&nbsp; Indeed, public-assisted arrests accounted for 42% of the arrests of criminals involving outraging of modesty, housebreaking, robbery, motor vehicle theft, snatch theft, murder and rape in 2005.&nbsp; I think very few countries in the world could achieve this&nbsp;rate of public-assisted arrests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Singaporean has a part to play, whether it is in making sure that his handphone is not carelessly left around or his home is improperly secured.&nbsp; Every Singaporean can help beat crime by being vigilant&nbsp;and then alerting the Police of any suspicious activity in the neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise, Sir, crime remains a key aspect of the Ministry's focus.&nbsp; This, however, should not and must not detract us from our fight to keep the terrorists out of Singapore and to put in place measures to deal with a terrorist incident, if one ever happens.&nbsp; Sir, low crime does not mean no crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to what I consider to be a more important subject, which is homeland security and our measures to deal with the aftermath of a bomb blast, should it happen.&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Ravindran asked about the latest assessment of the terrorist threat in the region and in Singapore.&nbsp; Mr Ravindran has also asked about the state of cooperation between our intelligence agencies and the Police and their foreign counterparts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, terrorism remains a serious threat.&nbsp; It is very much alive and it is going to be around for a very long time.&nbsp; Although the efforts of the governments in the region have seen significant successes, extremist terrorism has shown itself to be highly resilient and adaptive.&nbsp; The Al Qaeda is weakened operationally, but its violent ideology continues to infect new groups in the world.&nbsp; In this region, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) has been weakened and the members are on the run.&nbsp; Its key operatives, such as Hambali,&nbsp;the JI's key point man in Asia of the Al Qaeda, have been arrested, and the JI bomb-maker, Azahari Husin, was killed by the Indonesians in an operation on 9th November 2005.&nbsp; Others, such as Nordin Mohd Top, Dulmatin, Umar Patek and Zulkarnaen, to name just a few, are still active.&nbsp; They are recruiting new suicide bomb-makers and are transferring their terrorist know-how, including bomb-making, to militant groups in Indonesia and Mindanao.&nbsp; So, even if all these leaders are captured or killed, new ones will take their place, not unlike the many-headed hydra snake of the marshes of Lerna in the Greek mythology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because the terrorist training camps, which continue to produce new leaders and operatives for the groups in the region, are still operating, for example, in Mindanao.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in November 2005, the Indonesian authorities discovered an abandoned jungle training camp in Maluku.&nbsp; The instructors at this camp were apparently the graduates of the&nbsp;terrorist academies in Afghanistan and the Philippines.&nbsp; This camp is believed to have provided training on bomb-making and weapons-handling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The level of cooperation between our Police and the intelligence services with their foreign counterparts, especially those in the region, has grown in strength since 2001.&nbsp; Shared intelligence led to the detection and arrests of several Singaporean JI fugitives, including Arifin Ali in Thailand and, more recently, Mas Selamat in Indonesia.&nbsp; Both of them are now in ISA detention in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the sharing of intelligence, the Police and intelligence services also share training and learn from each other's best practices and experience.&nbsp; One of the benefits we have derived from such close relations has been the access that we were given to the different&nbsp;sites where a terrorist incident has happened.&nbsp; Our police officers, for example, were able to go to London immediately after the incident in July last year and learn directly from their London Metropolitan Police counterparts who were handling the investigations.&nbsp; Such timely and first-hand exposure was invaluable to our post-blast investigators.&nbsp; One of our officers&nbsp;was actually part of the team that went into the London Underground where the bomb blast happened.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked if there is a potential danger from home-grown terrorists.&nbsp; The danger is in fact real and it already exists.&nbsp; Nearly all the JI members in detention with us today are Singaporeans.&nbsp; I think all, except one.&nbsp; Many had been involved in various activities to support or prepare for a terrorist attack inside Singapore.&nbsp; Had they succeeded in their plans, we would have had our homegrown terrorists long before the Londoners had.&nbsp; For example, Mas Selamat had planned to hijack and crash an aircraft into the Singapore Changi Airport.&nbsp; Other JI members had been targeting other critical infrastructure and soft targets.&nbsp; The consequences, if they had succeeded, would be very severe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although we have disrupted the JI cells in Singapore, we recognise that working with the Muslim community to rehabilitate the detainees and to counter the radical JI ideology are key to fighting this problem.&nbsp; We are not alone in this view.&nbsp; The <I>Zaobao</I> and <I>Today</I> articles on Nasir Abas yesterday is a case in point.&nbsp; Mr Abas was a JI member who confessed that he had trained some of the worst terrorists in our region, including the suicide bombers who mounted the Bali bombing in October 2002.&nbsp; Today, Abas is helping to spread the word in the region that terrorism is wrong and not part of the true teachings of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that we have broken the JI operations inside Singapore, and the active terrorist threat to Singapore is likely to come from outside our borders.&nbsp; However, we must be mindful that every society has its impressionable and misguided elements and they are therefore vulnerable.&nbsp; All it takes is a handful of such weaker, misguided elements within our society to be indoctrinated by terrorists or extremists with radical ideology to become sympathisers or terrorist elements.&nbsp; Such persons, whether acting on their own or, more likely, in collaboration with militants in the region, will pose&nbsp;a deadly threat to Singapore.&nbsp; This is the reason why several of our Muslim religious leaders have been active in reaching out through forums on subjects like <I>jihad</I> to counter the distortions of extremist teachings.&nbsp; They help to innoculate our people from the influence of terrorist ideology and to raise the level of community vigilance against extremist teachers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Ahmad Khalis have asked what we have learnt from the terrorist attacks in London, Madrid and Bali and from the recent exercise NorthStar V.&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis also wanted to know the status of readiness of our forces to deal with an incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have learnt at least two key lessons from the terror attacks in London, Madrid and Bali.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it pays to be prepared, and emergency exercises are the best way to get ourselves prepared and operationally-ready to face terror attacks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it was clear that a terrorist attack, especially one which involves homegrown elements, could potentially damage communal relations and social cohesion.&nbsp; I will elaborate later on the Community Engagement Programme which will seek to address this second point.&nbsp; We conducted Exercise NorthStar&nbsp;V on 8th January 2006 to test not only our own emergency response&nbsp;systems but also to sensitise our public and to involve them.&nbsp; Our review of the exercise results gives us confidence that our forces are well prepared.&nbsp; Mr Ian Johnston, the Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, who was an observer&nbsp;at the exercise, commended the high state of readiness of our agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will continue to hold regular exercises to keep our emergency responders on their toes.&nbsp; Not all of these exercises need to be on the same scale as Exercise NorthStar V.&nbsp; But we will be exploring ways to have exercises which will involve the public as well as other stakeholders and partners, as we did in NorthStar V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several Members have raised issues about our border security.&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia and Mr Charles Chong have expressed concerns on the checkpoint clearance, so has Mr Chiam.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our land checkpoints are among the busiest in the world.&nbsp; 104 million people and 46 million vehicles passed through the two checkpoints last year.&nbsp; Very few countries have such a high volume of people and vehicular movements.&nbsp; ICA has taken various measures to facilitate and expedite clearance.&nbsp; This includes, for example, the use of pre-registered cards for bus travellers.&nbsp; So, if you are a frequent bus traveller, you can get a pre-registered card.&nbsp; You can then use the automated clearance stations.&nbsp; In the pipeline are efforts to provide the same do-it-yourself (DIY) clearance facilities for bus travellers who are Singaporeans.&nbsp; They can use, for example, their Singapore passports for self-clearance at an automatic immigration clearance station.&nbsp; We will be setting this up soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During peak periods, ICA will get more personnel to perform extra shift duties.&nbsp; However, checkpoint officers are trained professionals.&nbsp; They need to be specially skilled in order to do their job well, and the pool of such people is limited.&nbsp; There is, therefore, a limit as to how many more officers we can add during peak times or to recall&nbsp;during peak periods like Christmas eve.&nbsp; Hence, some congestion will be inevitable during festive periods and peak hours.&nbsp; Nevertheless, ICA is exploring various options to enhance a pool of trained part-time staff who can be called upon to help to supplement the manpower resources during such peak periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong suggested setting a key performance indicator to measure the clearance of travellers and vehicles at our land checkpoints.&nbsp; Sir, I do&nbsp;not think it is appropriate to compare the land checkpoints with the air and sea checkpoints, because the two are totally different systems and the traffic volumes and the patterns of travel are completely different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The traffic patterns at the land checkpoints are much less predictable compared to the airport and sea checkpoints where there are scheduled arrivals and departures.&nbsp; Nevertheless, let me assure the House that the ICA constantly monitors the flow of travellers and vehicles at the land checkpoints and will take the necessary measures to improve clearance efficiency as much as possible.&nbsp; However, we must also be realistic.&nbsp; Given the volume of traffic at the land checkpoints, we must accept that, even with all the counters manned, there will be some delays, especially when there is a bottleneck</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Secondly, whatever ICA does, it must not compromise the current level of security, a concern that takes priority over convenience.&nbsp; This concern was rightly expressed by Ms Indranee yesterday and Mr Chiam earlier on.&nbsp; Our borders remain the frontline of our defence against terrorism and although we know that there is no such thing as a 100% protection, we must do whatever we can to make it difficult for the would-be troublemakers and terrorists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Rajah and Mr Chiam also expressed concern that the perpetrators of crime and terrorism could slip through our checkpoints undetected.&nbsp; Ms Rajah has also asked for the measures that we have in place to prevent the smuggling of arms and explosives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whatever we do, criminals will continue to test our security measures.&nbsp; While many will fail, a small number may succeed. We must learn from the situations where there may have been lapses, and&nbsp;take corrective action. For example, following the escape of Took Leng How through the Woodlands Checkpoint in 2004, Police and ICA jointly reviewed the security systems and put in&nbsp;place additional measures to prevent this from happening again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the checks at the checkpoints remain robust, ICA and Police regularly carry out surprise intrusion tests to assess the security performance of our checkpoints.&nbsp; We also employ a variety of latest inspection technology at our checkpoints, such as gamma ray and radiographic&nbsp;scanners, to prevent smuggling of&nbsp;illicit and prohibited goods in a non-intrusive and expeditious manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are working closely with the industry to tighten regulatory controls over commercially available chemicals that could be used to manufacture improvised bombs, explosives and devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the recent murder of Lim Hock Soon, the nightclub boss, Police is currently investigating the case.&nbsp; Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspects left Singapore before they could be identified and be linked to the murder.&nbsp;For now, we should let the Police carry out&nbsp;its investigations and not make any further speculation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, Sir, intelligence and information provided by the public are key to preventing the smuggling of firearms and explosives into Singapore. In this regard, members of the public can play their part by being vigilant.&nbsp; They should alert Police or ICA officers if they see any person acting suspiciously or trying to slip in or out of our checkpoints.&nbsp; This will further enhance our security coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the subject raised by Ms Eunice Olsen concerning the security measures taken at marinas, particularly with regard to pleasure crafts.&nbsp; Travellers on pleasure crafts leaving or arriving Singapore ports are required to proceed to either the gazetted immigration anchorages or the gazetted marinas for immigration clearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Ms Olsen for her feedback, which I take seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are reviewing our maritime security measures and practices, including the subject of immigration clearance for such vessels.&nbsp; To enhance security, we presently have a system which tracks closely all vessels, including pleasure&nbsp;crafts, coming into our ports.&nbsp; For smaller vessels below 300 gross tonnage, such as pleasure crafts, we have started to install transponders to allow us to track them within our port limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every vessel, large or small, pleasure or not, coming into our territorial waters will be monitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ICA will also require agents or operators at the gazetted marinas to submit pleasure craft's arrival or departure advice, together with the passenger and crew lists for pre-screening of the persons on board.&nbsp; This added requirement by the ICA has ensured that all passengers on board the pleasure craft are thoroughly screened prior to landing and to facilitate detection of unauthorised persons on board on arrival at the marinas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Police Coast Guard patrols keep a close watch at sea and conduct selective&nbsp;checks of vessels based on intelligence and profiling.&nbsp; These checks include face-to-face checks of passengers and physical checks of the vessels. Such checks are important as&nbsp;they prevent the off-loading of illegal immigrants or other undesirable elements within our territorial waters and before the crafts proceed to the gazetted immigration checkpoints.&nbsp;The surprise checks have yielded good results in tightening security. For instance,&nbsp;ICA's Anti-Smuggling Teams have picked up about 120 smuggling cases in 2005.&nbsp; And just last week, we detected a pleasure craft with two crew members who failed to seek immigration departure clearance when&nbsp;it left for fishing activities the day before.&nbsp; Shortly past midnight this morning, the ICA Anti-Smuggling Team detected a vessel carrying about 8,000 cartons of cigarettes and 40 kilogrammes of shag tobacco.&nbsp; A person wanted by CNB and Police was also arrested on board the vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases like these bear&nbsp;testimony that our stepped-up security efforts have been effective and fruitful in the detection of contraband items and undesirable persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr Ong Kian Min's suggestion to introduce smart chips in our NRIC to tighten security for commercial premises, I think there is no need to have the smart chip capability in our NRIC.&nbsp; We have studied this issue before and we think that right now, the technology is such that it is expensive.&nbsp; And in terms of the investment, the money spent, it is not worth the benefit derived from it.&nbsp;We will continue to monitor the development of this technology before we decide whether to use smart chip for NRIC or not.&nbsp; There must also be some uses for the NRIC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NRIC is not&nbsp;such a \"dumb\" device, as Mr Ong said.&nbsp; In the NRIC, you will find&nbsp;a magnetic strip.&nbsp; All the building owners need to do is to install the barcode reader and just swipe&nbsp;it through and the building owner or the guard will be able to easily record the particulars of the NRIC holder.&nbsp; All that is already in the NRIC.&nbsp; Building owners need to put in some money to ensure that the buildings are safer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The points raised by Mr Ong regarding the way the guards conduct their security checks are valid.&nbsp; In fact, the guard that just let go of a person who signs himself in as superman, or&nbsp;as superwoman, ought to be sacked, as it means that he was not doing his job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to engage&nbsp;building owners.&nbsp; In fact, we have started working with the building owners through the Security Watch Group Scheme. Today, more than 500 buildings are already in the Security Watch Group Scheme. They are improving their standards and the training of the unarmed guard industry. So all guards require training before they can take on the job.&nbsp; In fact, since last year, any person setting up a security guard agency will need to have trained security guards who must have the NSRS qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis asked whether the businesses are prepared for a terrorist attack.&nbsp; Sir, this is the direction we are taking by developing the Security Watch Group Scheme to involve the businesses in security and emergency preparedness.&nbsp; Such businesses or the&nbsp;tenants of a building should also know how to deal with suspicious persons and packages and respond to an incident in the building. Through the Corporate First Responder Scheme, pre-identified tenants will be given access to the cordoned area to execute business continuity recovery plans in the event of a bomb blast incident.&nbsp; This is important because, apart from saving lives, we must also be ready to bring life back to normal.&nbsp; We are progressively rolling out the scheme to all members of the Security Watch Group.&nbsp; Ultimately, building owners and their tenants must take greater ownership of their own security because the cost to them is much higher if a terrorist attack takes place, as compared to the cost of implementing security measures and hiring better guards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, now on community engagement.&nbsp; What we have done so far are the hard measures that the Government can take or has taken to prevent a terrorist attack.&nbsp; I have said before that the Government would do its very best to harden Singapore against terrorist attacks.&nbsp; I have also said before that our Government agencies will prepare themselves to the utmost in order to deal with a terrorist attack, particularly in the recovery situation, when&nbsp;a bomb blast happens.&nbsp; But what I have also said before&nbsp;is:&nbsp;&nbsp;are our people equally prepared?&nbsp; I think right now, we still have work to do.&nbsp; Our people themselves must deal with such&nbsp;a situation should&nbsp;they arise.&nbsp; The most significant issue that we have to deal with is the possible rising of&nbsp;communal tensions and the fray in our social cohesion.&nbsp; That is the part which our people should think very carefully about because in the event of a bomb blast, how will they respond to such a situation if they are not prepared?&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an effort which we will be embarking on in the next one year or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the people that defeat terrorists and terrorism, not Government alone because they are the ones on the ground.&nbsp; They are the ones who know their neighbours, they are the ones who should know what goes on as well.&nbsp; They are the ones who must&nbsp;recover from an attack and not be cowed by it. They must rise above the situation and get back to life as normal and be psychologically resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our multi-racial society,&nbsp;that is particularly important because any incident may fray communal tension and that is a key lesson we learn&nbsp;in other countries, when they have a bomb attack, for example, in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Ahmad Khalis have asked about the Community Engagement Programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Ravindran have also asked about how our community leaders and the members of the public should react to a terrorist incident.&nbsp; I am glad they asked because it gives me a chance to say a bit more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho is correct to point out that the key concern is, even if&nbsp;we have a community engagement, can it be sustained?&nbsp; That is the reason why I said that it is not just the Government that works at it.&nbsp; It must come from the people and they must sustain it and we will help them to sustain it. We will build on the current programmes such that&nbsp;they do not start afresh all of a sudden. There are already many structures, organisations,&nbsp;may efforts ongoing.&nbsp; And, in fact, we started this way back since the 1964 riots.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we need to constantly review, update and improve on them.&nbsp; New people take on leadership positions.&nbsp; New people need to know one another.&nbsp; And that is the kind of network that we need to build amongst our leaders in the various organisations.&nbsp; I am not just talking about grassroots organisations, because community organisations&nbsp;are more than just grassroots organisations that the PA runs.&nbsp; It involves all sectors of our people, whether they are unionists, employers, clan leaders, chambers of commerce or even in schools, for example,&nbsp;there is a big network of organisations and people that we must tap on.&nbsp; The question is how to link these various centres of leadership together such that they know one another so well that they can pick up a phone, see the person and talk to the person and say, \"Let us do this and calm the ground, should a bomb happen.\"&nbsp; And many of our community organisations like the voluntary welfare organisations, the ethnic-based organisations, the religious organisations, they too play a very important role in this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is not just the Government's role and I would prefer that such an engagement programme comes from the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;They give us ideas, we help them piece together, we help them connect.&nbsp; Then, we will run sessions, courses,&nbsp;seminars, forums, to ensure that we keep updated and keep current on the terrorist threat issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only when they own it that they will feel that they have a responsibility to carry it through.&nbsp; If it is dictated from the top and by the Government, they will say, \"Let me wait for the Government to tell me what to do.\"&nbsp; So I would like to reach that situation where&nbsp;the people exercise initiative. Of course, we will work with them to make sure that they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a terrorist incident, should it happen, the people&nbsp;must first know what to do.&nbsp; They are the people on the ground.&nbsp; Let us, say, a bomb blast happens.&nbsp; If they all leave the scene, that leaves&nbsp;the scene&nbsp;quite free for the security forces to move in and investigate.&nbsp; But there could be situations where they can help.&nbsp; For example, when somebody is injured,&nbsp;that somebody needs help to be brought up, whether it is in an MRT station, bus or in any place, he needs to be moved away from the scene</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

London, for example, it is the first responder, not the government, their police or ambulances, but the people who were there in the same tunnel were the ones who helped one another.&nbsp; So, I am very happy to see that, indeed, we do have such people on the ground.&nbsp; As when they see an incident, whether it is a&nbsp;traffic accident, we have people coming forward and help, and that is the kind of spirit that we want our people to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho talks about getting women involved.&nbsp; Of course, we cannot forget the other half of our population.&nbsp; We&nbsp;have, I think, 51% women in our population, slightly surpassing the men in terms of numbers.&nbsp; They have a very important role to play.&nbsp; And as for the&nbsp;suggestion that all women should learn first aid skill, yes, I encourage that.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try to facilitate that.&nbsp; In fact, the SCDF does run courses on first aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to read recently when the newspaper reported that a very young lady, 17 years old, Ms Esther Tan, who responded to a man gasping for air.&nbsp; She went&nbsp;to give him CPR before the ambulance arrived.&nbsp; I think that is a remarkable act&nbsp;and I hope more people will&nbsp;take up such life-saving skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the SCDF&nbsp;who can run such first-aid courses.&nbsp; We have many other organisations.&nbsp; The Red Cross can do so too.&nbsp; So do St John's.&nbsp;&nbsp;They too can play their roles in helping to educate the people on first aid and CPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I attended a women's Seminar on Terrorism and Emergency Preparedness.&nbsp; Ms Indranee invited me because this seminar was led by our group of women MPs and 400 other women leaders also attended it.&nbsp; The participants were given&nbsp;hands-on training on first aid and fire-fighting.&nbsp; I hope more of them will come and join us and we will try to do our best to accommodate their training needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the long and short of community engagement is that we need time to work on it.&nbsp; I hope we had done this two years ago.&nbsp; In fact, we had done it 40 years ago but I hope that we had carried on improving on it.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;not too late, but let us start now.&nbsp; I would hope that our people and leaders in the various positions would take an active interest in this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, given the long-term terrorist threat that we face, the fall-out from&nbsp;a terrorist attack on our social cohesion as a multi-ethnic society can be very significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Community Engagement Programme aims to ensure that communal relations in Singapore can withstand the strain of a terrorist attack.&nbsp; What we do today would increase and strengthen the network of trust and bond for the community, which will determine how quickly we, as a society, recover from such an attack.&nbsp; The Government will work closely with the community to coordinate,&nbsp;facilitate and&nbsp;provide support.&nbsp; The Government will also expand and deepen the network of community partners engaged under this programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Sir, first let me respond to Ms Indranee Rajah's and Mr Charles Chong's queries on child sex tourism and the Penal Code review.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Rajah expressed the concern regarding the sexual exploitation of minors. Sir, I share her concerns.&nbsp; We have and will continue to prosecute offenders with the full extent of the law.&nbsp; We are also exploring other ways to enhance protection of minors who, because they lack maturity, are especially vulnerable to exploitation.&nbsp; The Inter-Agency Committee on&nbsp;review of sexual offences, which I chair, has been studying this issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me address the problem of young persons engaging in prostitution.&nbsp; While prostitution is not an offence in Singapore, young persons should be protected from providing sexual services.&nbsp; Being more easily influenced, their consent can be impaired.&nbsp; As such, they are more vulnerable to being trafficked, controlled and exploited by pimps and traffickers who prey on them and live off their earnings.&nbsp; The existing legal age of consent for sexual activities is 16 years.&nbsp; Although there is no evidence to suggest that there is a problem of significant numbers of 16 and 17 year olds engaging in prostitution in Singapore, there should be a higher age of protection for commercial sexual activities.&nbsp; As such, Sir, we intend to make it an offence for any person to purchase sexual services from another person who is under 18 years of age.&nbsp; Other countries, such as the UK and New Zealand have adopted a similar approach.&nbsp; This move is part of the wider approach we are adopting to protect young persons against engaging in commercial sexual activities and possible exploitation and not specifically in response to the possible sexual victimisation of the young via the Internet which Ms Indranee had touched on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, I would deal with the issue of child sex tourism.&nbsp; Sir, child sex tourists take advantage of the inability or unwillingness of&nbsp;the host country to prosecute them.&nbsp; I think, Ms Indranee Rajah, in fact, gave a picture of who these people may be, who may look innocuous on the outside but terrible inside.&nbsp; Meanwhile, very often, prosecution at home is constrained by the lack of jurisdiction as most countries do not extend extra-territorial jurisdiction over sexual offences.&nbsp; Presently, Singaporeans who have sex with minors in other countries cannot be prosecuted in Singapore as our courts do not have jurisdiction over them.&nbsp; Members had earlier&nbsp;urged the Government to stop our nationals from preying on minors in other countries by denying them a safe haven through enacting legislation with extra-territorial effect.&nbsp; Sir, we have taken note of these views and have factored them into our review.&nbsp; The Inter-Agency Committee has studied laws governing sex with minors overseas in other countries.&nbsp; Countries that have extended jurisdiction overseas include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, UK and the US.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we do not condone sexual exploitation of minors in other countries by our nationals, we also recognise that if extra-territorial jurisdiction is introduced, it would be challenging to investigate and prosecute cases involving offences committed by Singaporeans in other countries.&nbsp; Ms Rajah mentioned some of these obstacles yesterday in this House, such&nbsp;as language barriers and the different local conditions, making it difficult to trace and interview foreign witnesses and to gather evidence.&nbsp; The Singapore Police has no powers of investigation overseas and would have to rely principally on the cooperation of its foreign counterparts.&nbsp; Sir, I have explained these difficulties in Parliament, taking the opportunity&nbsp;also to urge host countries to do their part to toughen their laws and enforce them vigorously.&nbsp; At the same time, I said that we will continue to study the issue and monitor developments in other countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our point was that&nbsp;efforts in this regard must be a collaborative one.&nbsp; Enacting extra-territorial laws by&nbsp;itself is no panacea.&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to note that what we said in Parliament, our exchanges galvanised action on several fronts.&nbsp; But still, despite the constraints and difficulties, we recognise that having sex with minors anywhere is, indeed, deplorable.&nbsp; Hence, the Government has decided to amend our laws to extend extra-territorial jurisdiction over our nationals who sexually&nbsp;exploit minors overseas.&nbsp; I agree with Ms Rajah that by doing so we send a strong signal that we are against this appalling act and, hopefully, it will also act as a deterrent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures against&nbsp;child sex tourism will be introduced as part of the legislative changes that we will make once we have completed the review of the Penal Code, a pet topic of Mr Charles Chong who has asked once again for an update.&nbsp; Sir, this review has taken a long time.&nbsp; It has been prolonged because, I am sure Mr Chong understands, the Penal Code with more than 500 sections is a very important piece of legislation and we want to be&nbsp;as thorough as possible in reviewing it.&nbsp; After all, this is the first comprehensive, holistic review of the Penal Code that we have undertaken for a long time.&nbsp; Moreover, the review has stretched out because, as we went along, new issues surfaced.&nbsp; For example, the impact of technology such as the Internet and mobile phones which have become an integral part of the lifestyle in Singapore and which is increasingly employed by criminals to perpetrate their criminal activities,&nbsp;has delayed our progress somewhat.&nbsp; But, let me assure Mr Chong that we will indeed be completing our review soon.&nbsp; Thereafter, as I have said, we intend to carry out a public consultation exercise&nbsp;at which time Mr Chong and other members of the public, including the Law Society, would be welcome to give their comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the topic of youth crime and our recently announced initiative to keep our youths safe, which Mr Tan Soo Khoon had alluded to in his speech.&nbsp; Last year, nearly 4,600 youths were arrested - actually it is a drop of some 8% from the year before.&nbsp; Youth crime statistics for rioting, shop and other thefts, actually fell 16% and 3% respectively, last year compared to the year before.&nbsp; Hence, let me assure Mr Fong that our youth gang situation is under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to assure him that his hypothesis that there may be a \"staggering number\" of youth gang members in Singapore, does not accord with reality.&nbsp; But I have said many times before that every youth crime is one crime too many.&nbsp; Moreover the drop of 8% is only for one year.&nbsp; Before that, for two to three years, the number of youths arrested actually was rising, so it is not time to bring out the beer, not the time to celebrate yet.&nbsp; Beer is something that Mr Loh Meng See has talked about just now.&nbsp; So we will not drink beer here.&nbsp; Nevertheless, although the youth crime situation has improved, from 2004 to 2005, youths continue to be involved in shop thefts and other thefts and also rioting ,and youths are also victims of offences, such as snatch theft, robbery, rioting and outraging of modesty, where the numbers have increased.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;phenomenon&nbsp;that bears study.&nbsp; The increase in the number of youth victims of snatch theft and robbery can be mainly attributed to more youths being targeted for handphones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Fong has suggested&nbsp;inculcating&nbsp;in students an understanding of the consequences of committing crime.&nbsp; That is a good point.&nbsp; Indeed, let me assure Mr Fong that we have been doing this through the&nbsp;Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime&nbsp; (IMYC) which I chair.&nbsp; So, for example, 2004, IMYC launched the Prison Visit Education Programme for Schools (PVEPS), a joint project involving the Police, MOE and the Prisons Department.&nbsp; Under this programme, at risk youths in schools&nbsp;are sent to the prisoners' living environment, taste the food that the prisoners eat and also get locked up in the prison cell for a while.&nbsp; They also witness a mock caning, all of which, I am sure, has a sobering experience.&nbsp; Mr Fong suggests that we extend this to all students.&nbsp; Let me say that this will certainly stretch the Prison's resources.&nbsp; I do not think there is a need for us to do that.&nbsp; It is a focused approach where resources are maximised and it will dilute our message if we let all the students undergo this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in 2004, IMYC commissioned a series of road shows in schools.&nbsp; This was something special because we made it a point to make the road shows interactive, engaging the students.&nbsp; So that is our approach, something that Mr Tan also mentioned, that with youths we cannot have a talk down approach, we should engage them, we should ensure that they understand what adults like us are doing.&nbsp; And that&nbsp; specifically was how the road shows were rolled out two years ago and continue to be rolled out - interactive, participative, engaging them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March this year, the Police and the NPCC also piloted the NPCC Police Youth Ambassador Programme, where NPCC cadets will be equipped with crime prevention and problem solving skills.&nbsp; With these skills the cadets will help to impart crime prevention messages to their peers and assist the schools in addressing youth-related issues.&nbsp; Thirty-two secondary schools would be participating in the pilot phase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to report that there are also other partners involved.&nbsp; For example, the Law Society has been holding its Law Awareness Project through talks, the launching of a newsletter and also a website.&nbsp; They inject their expertise by informing youths and young people about the consequences of their crime,&nbsp;and that is Mr Fong's point,&nbsp;not just the legal consequences but the social&nbsp;and personal consequences of what they do.&nbsp; And, indeed, the&nbsp;Singapore Association of Women Lawyers actually published a very good useful \"Teens and the Law\" handbook which talks directly to the students.&nbsp; My point is that we are all doing our part to help our youths realise their full potential and to also extend helping hands to those at risk and who may fall into trouble.&nbsp; But Mr Tan has rightly mentioned that parents are a pivotal group and this is what the recent initiative was actually meant to do - to partner parents, to&nbsp;let them know that we are partners with them and, through this measure, through the knowledge of information given to them,&nbsp;that they could be more effective as a parent.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>1.30&nbsp;pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first say that Police already conducts checks on youths found congregating in public areas after 11.00 pm, basically to prevent them from getting into trouble, either as victims or perpetrators of crime.&nbsp; Last year, during the school holidays, some 15,000 checks were conducted.&nbsp; So, it is nothing new in terms of conducting these checks.&nbsp; Over this period of time, Police has already&nbsp;developed&nbsp;some expertise.&nbsp; It is not intimidating or talking down to youths in a heavy handed manner.&nbsp; It is what Police calls, \"engaging them in conversation\"&nbsp;-&nbsp;basically, to ask them what they are doing, and also to alert them of the dangers that they face.&nbsp; They may be very well meaning and law abiding.&nbsp; But, sometimes, even females,&nbsp;being in a very quiet place at 2.00-3.00 am,&nbsp;and especially in a crime-prone area, I think that is the least Police can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what Police is now doing is really a logical step up&nbsp;- scaling up of what they have been doing -&nbsp;which is to inform parents,&nbsp;not in every case, in those situations that I have mentioned,&nbsp;that their child has been found in this area.&nbsp; This is just to inform them, and leave the rest to parents.&nbsp; If they know about it, that is fine.&nbsp; If they know about it and want to do a bit more by talking to the child, that is fine.&nbsp; If they do not know about it, I think it is good for parents to know.&nbsp; And, indeed, the letter that goes out will be signed by the CO of the NPC indicating the time, date, the details of the check and also&nbsp;a telephone number that the parents can call if they want to get more information from the Police.&nbsp; So it is really a partnership that I think will help us manage youth crime better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it have been better publicised?&nbsp; This news came out when Police gave a briefing on the crime statistics.&nbsp; It was not a press release as such.&nbsp; But in the process of discussing the youth situation and what more can be done, the Police informed the media about this measure.&nbsp; I think the presentation by the media may have, in a way, caused some people to think that it was a ban or&nbsp;curfew.&nbsp; It was never intended to be a ban or curfew, and that is why the Police had to clarify.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me just reiterate here that parents out there&nbsp;- all of us are parents&nbsp;- I think we can do more.&nbsp; Indeed, this is what the MCYS has been doing for many years, reaching out to parents through school talks, camps and so forth.&nbsp; Really, this new measure is just another plank in our package of measures that should help us to tackle this problem better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong&nbsp;says why not reinstate the Boys' Clubs.&nbsp; Mr Chiam made this call in 1997 and I responded to him&nbsp;-&nbsp;to explain to him that there was no need for the Boys' Clubs, because the clubs had outlived their usefulness.&nbsp; They had been replaced by the People's Association's T-Net Club.&nbsp; Over these years, more T-Net Clubs have emerged and reaching out to a larger group of youths, and a bigger spread of youths and promoting the things that Mr Chiam talked about&nbsp;- social values, self-esteem, social skills and also keeping them away from danger zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think this is the way to go.&nbsp; And do not forget, since 1997, in fact, new youth organisations have emerged.&nbsp; MCYS has been working with many of these organisations and the partners of MCYS, which include police officers on the ground who will then interact with these youth organisations in a very natural&nbsp;and&nbsp;complementary way to ensure that our youths are healthily engaged.&nbsp; There is really no need to reinstate the Boys' Clubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Fong asked about our efforts in helping ex-offenders reintegrate into society so as to prevent them from being dragged into a vicious cycle of criminalisation.&nbsp; Mr Fong asked about the recidivism rate.&nbsp; First, let me say, at the outset, that MHA is committed to assisting ex-offenders reintegrate back into society.&nbsp; Working closely with community partners again, our reintegration efforts begin from the time the offenders serve their sentence in prison and continue after their release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During incarceration, offenders acquire useful skills through employment and workshops.&nbsp; Currently, 26 firms operate different industries in prisons employing more than 2,000 offenders.&nbsp; Offenders also enhance their employability and educational qualifications through literacy and vocational courses.&nbsp; In the year 2005, more than 4,000 offenders were trained in areas such as landscaping, cleaning, IT skills and food preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon release, an ex-offender who requests for aftercare support will be given counselling and assistance by the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-Offenders (CARE) network, again comprising&nbsp;key partners like SCORE, SANA and so forth.&nbsp; At the same time, SCORE assists in the job placement of offenders as well as ex-offenders&nbsp; - &nbsp;with offenders being placed under various work release schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, SCORE offered employment assistance to almost 3,000 offenders and ex-offenders.&nbsp; To further enhance the assistance provided, SCORE launched an online drop portal in September last year.&nbsp; Thus far, 443 employees have registered and 343 job vacancies have been posted online.&nbsp; In total, 1,473 employers are registered with SCORE's job bank&nbsp;- up from 1,381 the year before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now give a brief update on the amendment we made last year to the Registration of Criminals Act where, by now, ex-offenders with spent records can declare in the job application forms that they do not have any criminal record.&nbsp; Since the scheme came into effect last year in October, about 114,000 ex-offenders have had their criminal records rendered spent.&nbsp; An estimated 6,000 ex-offenders will benefit annually from this scheme.&nbsp; As promised, when I moved the amendment Bill, MHA subsequently engaged the business community to get their support for this major initiative.&nbsp; We conducted a study to determine employers' attitude towards the hiring of ex-offenders and held a workshop with employers to discuss the findings.&nbsp; Leading by example, as announced earlier by Minister Teo Chee Hean, the Government has decided to amend its application forms.&nbsp; So that will help ex-offenders with spent records.&nbsp; Basically, we have now taken the lead.&nbsp; Some employers have done it.&nbsp; I take this opportunity to urge more employers to come on board and to also take that step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, MHA, as a Ministry, has also been working on an e-portal to allow those who think they may benefit from the scheme to verify whether they have a criminal record that has been rendered as spent.&nbsp; And this system will come into operation within the next one or two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we all know that Government's efforts alone are not enough.&nbsp; Employers, families and society at large must all play a part to change mindsets about ex-offenders.&nbsp; For those determined to change for the better, we must extend helping hands,&nbsp;recognising it is the&nbsp;CARE network that launched the Yellow Ribbon project in the year 2004&nbsp;- another ground-breaking initiative.&nbsp; This project has grown from strength to strength.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;a Yellow Ribbon fare was held in the prison complex for the first time last year.&nbsp; 238 pre-release offenders took part in the job fare and 175 were offered jobs on the same day.&nbsp; I am particularly pleased that the Yellow Ribbon project has galvanised community action.&nbsp; I know of several groups, including employers and tertiary institution students, who have been inspired by the message behind the Yellow Ribbon to unlock the second prison, and they have come on board.&nbsp; I think that is wonderful.&nbsp; In particular, I want to thank the 125 new employers who offered jobs to ex-offenders last year.&nbsp; Because I have said in Parliament before that getting new employers to come on board is one&nbsp; key strategy that&nbsp;we must pursue more vigorously in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Fong asked about the recidivism rate.&nbsp; I am happy to share that all these efforts have resulted in lower recidivism rates which have declined steadily over the past few years.&nbsp; In 1998, the recidivism rate peaked at 44.4%.&nbsp; In other words, for every 100 released prisoners, about 50 returned to crime within two years.&nbsp; But, today, the recidivism rate for the 2003 cohort&nbsp;- two-year span&nbsp;- has improved to 24.9%, the lowest rate thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in my remaining time, let me now deal with the other topics raised by Members.&nbsp; First, Mr Fong talked about the question of emergency vehicles&nbsp;- how we can educate Singaporeans to give way to these vehicles.&nbsp; I agree that public education is important, and we must get the maximum cooperation from our motoring public.&nbsp; This is why the importance of doing so is covered in the basic theory of driving handbook, the advanced theory of driving handbook as well as the riding theory handbook.&nbsp; As part of the training syllabus, the three driving schools, as well as private driving instructors, are also required to teach all learner drivers about the requirement to give way to an emergency vehicle.&nbsp; In addition, questions regarding this rule are included in the driving and riding theory tests, which all motorists are required to pass before they are allowed to obtain the licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from educating learner drivers, Traffic Police also constantly reminds motorists of their obligation to give way to emergency vehicles through road safety talks, especially those targeted at private companies and Government agencies which own large fleets of vehicles, such as Chevron Texaco and SAF.&nbsp; So it is a targeted approach.&nbsp; 68 such road safety talks were conducted in 2005, reaching to a total of about 10,000 drivers and riders.&nbsp; I thank Mr Fong for highlighting this point.&nbsp; This is one area that&nbsp;Singaporeans can do more about, and let us all continue to press home this message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis would like to know whether the fire situation is improving and what more can be done through public education efforts.&nbsp; Fire incidents have been declining over the past 10 years, from a high of over 6,700 fires in 1997 to 4,600 fires in 2003, down 30%.&nbsp; In 2004, the number of fire incidents increased by 8% to some 4,916 fires; and last year, there was a marginal increase of 3% to 5,039 fires.&nbsp; Last year, indeed, the marginal increase was attributed mainly to&nbsp;vegetation fires which, I am sure Mr Khalis remembers, besieged us for a while in the beginning part of the year.&nbsp; But residential and non-residential related fires actually fell by 5% and 7% respectively last year, compared to the year before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the fire situation has improved.&nbsp; And, again, like in the other areas that&nbsp;MHA is involved in, basically, it is because of a complementary partnership approach.&nbsp; Here, it is spearheaded by the National Fire Prevention Council which works with many agencies on the ground.&nbsp; I think many&nbsp;Members would know of these agencies, such as the Civil Defence Executive Committees (CDEC) and Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).&nbsp; For example, last year, in particular, home fire safety visits were conducted under the programme launched earlier on in August 2003.&nbsp; CDEC members and CD volunteers went house to house to promote fire safety tips and help residents identify potential fire hazards in their homes and, specifically, to address rubbish chute fires, which is something of concern, not because they are dangerous but because of the numbers.&nbsp; More than one-third of residential fires&nbsp;were rubbish chute fires.&nbsp; The SCDF and NFPC rolled out a public education programme in three housing blocks with high incidence of such fires. Here again, SCDF and CDEC members visited homes specifically to educate and to encourage them to desist from this act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the SCDF's target for making Singapore households emergency trained?&nbsp; The target set by SCDF is to train&nbsp;at least one member per household in civil defence skills&nbsp;- first aid and other essential knowledge - to survive an emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already said&nbsp;some of these programmes which have been launched by the SCDF, both in conjunction with the terrorism outreach as well as all the efforts throughout the year.&nbsp; And, indeed, the lady, Esther Tan, a 17-year-old girl, actually had picked up her CPR skills in one of the courses conducted by the SCDF.&nbsp; We never know when&nbsp;her skills can come in handy.&nbsp; I think her case, hopefully,&nbsp;will inspire more Singaporeans to learn basic skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SCDF is also targeting the young as part of its effort to have more Singaporeans emergency trained.&nbsp; Last year, SCDF and MOE initiated the National Civil Defence Corps in 12 secondary schools spearheaded by Mr Charles Chong.&nbsp; The aim is to impart civil defence skills amongst our youths to nurture and develop them into resilient and responsible citizens.&nbsp; This has been well received and we intend now to have more schools come on board.&nbsp; Since then, SCDF and MOE have introduced the uniformed group to seven more schools this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now answer Dr Maliki's two points.&nbsp; He makes the first point about Subutex abuse and the second point about foreign spouses of Singaporeans who are here.&nbsp; First, Subutex is, let me say, a prescription drug registered by the Health Sciences Authority for the treatment of opiate dependence.&nbsp; It is regulated by the Ministry of Health under the Medicines Act and Poisons Act.&nbsp; Since the abuse of Subutex first came to CNB's attention in late 2003, CNB has been working with MOH to explore possible measures to tackle the problem.&nbsp; Last year, in November, MOH issued a set of clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of opiate dependence to doctors.&nbsp; For example, doctors who wish to prescribe Subutex must undergo an 8-hour training course on opiate withdrawal and replacement therapy conducted by the Community Addictions Management Programme (CAMP) at the IMH.&nbsp; At the same time, MOH has also set up a Central Addiction Registry for Drugs (CARDs), an online registry which allows the central monitoring</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>of all Subutex prescriptions to patients.&nbsp; Doctors who prescribe Subutex are required to register their prescriptions in CARDS.&nbsp; So in this way, doctors can monitor whether their patients are doctor-hopping.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding&nbsp;these control measures implemented by MOH, CNB is keeping a close watch on the situation.&nbsp; The number of Subutex tablets&nbsp;seized monthly has increased from a high of more than 500 tablets in July last year to 180 tablets in December last year.&nbsp; The number of public complaints and information received by CNB on Subutex abuse has also come down to 19 in December from a high of 31 in November last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki has asked whether Subutex will be classified as a controlled drug under the MDA.&nbsp; Given that MOH's control measures were implemented recently in November last year, I think we should allow some time for the measures to take effect and then we can assess.&nbsp; But let me assure Dr Maliki that CNB remains vigilant and we will not hesitate to make Subutex a controlled drug, if the need arises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki's second topic is on immigration and he has asked about the impact of our policies&nbsp;on immigration facilities for foreign spouses of Singapore and how we can better educate Singaporeans on the requirements.&nbsp; First, let me assure Dr Maliki that our policies&nbsp;on long term immigration facilities take into account the preservation of family unity.&nbsp; We are mindful of the need to manage this carefully, as&nbsp;the proportion of marriages involving a Singaporean and a foreign spouse has increased from about 21% in the year 2003 to almost 30% last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member well knows that marriage to a Singaporean does not automatically guarantee that the foreign spouse would be granted long-term immigration facilities.&nbsp; However, even in cases where the foreign spouse is not eligible for Permanent Residence, we would still consider granting the foreign spouse a Long Term Social Visit Pass to enable him or her to remain in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So essentially, we need to ensure that foreigners given PR status do not become a burden to the State.&nbsp; Basically, citizens and Permanent Residents sponsoring their foreign spouses or children of PR would need to show that they are able to support them financially.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as I have said earlier, ICA adopts a sensitive and calibrated approach.&nbsp; And&nbsp;based on ICA's records, the approval rates for PR and Long Term Social Visit Pass applications for foreign spouses have been relatively stable for the past three years, at 60% for PR cases and 85% for Long&nbsp; Term Social Visit Pass cases.&nbsp; So where appropriate, ICA now also has been providing applicants with the reasons for rejection, to help them understand what they can do to improve their eligibility when they re-apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in short, ICA's guidelines governing the grant of long-term immigration facilities to foreign spouses are sufficiently compassionate to allow deserving spouses to stay in Singapore.&nbsp; We&nbsp;will be&nbsp;keeping in mind the importance of sustaining their marriage and supporting family cohesion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me take Mr Loh Meng See's topic which is my last topic before my colleague, Mr Maidin, covers other aspects on the training and the professionalism of the Police Force.&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See's query is whether liquor licences are being issued too liberally, especially to provision shops and coffeeshops.&nbsp; First, let me assure Mr Loh that Police takes a very careful approach in this because every application is assessed by Police.&nbsp; So it is not a liberal approach.&nbsp; Police takes into consideration factors, such as the location of the store and background of the applicant.&nbsp; Since 1999, our figures showed only a very gradual increase of about 2.5% per year for all liquor licences.&nbsp; So let me assure Mr Loh that there is no liberal policy when it comes to issuing liquor licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the issuance of a liquor licence is subject to conditions relating to the sale of the liquor.&nbsp; Perhaps, for example, in HDB estates where neighbourhood provision shops and coffeeshops are located, sale of liquor is prohibited beyond midnight, or in some cases, 1.00 am.&nbsp; A licensee is also prohibited from supplying intoxicating drinks to any drunken person or contribute to situations of drunkenness and disorderly conduct, such as brawls on the premises.&nbsp; And to ensure full compliance with licensing conditions, Police will keenly conduct checks on licensees.&nbsp; So licensees who breach these conditions may have their licences suspended or revoked.&nbsp; So the licences are issued with conditions and checks are carried out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked if we can consider&nbsp;for Police or the Liquor Licensing Board to consult the grassroots leaders who can raise objections before an application is approved.&nbsp; If we do that, my guess is that most grassroots leaders would say, no.&nbsp; Because it is a facility where they want accessibility, but not near enough because it causes problems for residents.&nbsp; When that happens, then Police and the Liquor Licensing Board will be in a dilemma.&nbsp; Then, it would be difficult for this aspect of Singapore life to function properly.&nbsp; I think we should leave things as they are.&nbsp; I&nbsp;accept the point that there must be dialogue and consultation should problems arise.&nbsp; Because after all, the grassroots leaders know the situation and their help is invaluable in tackling problems that arise.&nbsp; And I concede the point that in Mr Loh's ward, because of the congregation of the foreign workers, he has the problems of noise, maybe some brawls and perhaps blocking a passageway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr Loh himself will know that, over the years, Police has been working very closely with the grassroots leaders under the CSSP project that harks back&nbsp;four to five&nbsp;years, to ensure that the foreign workers who are enjoying their day of rest, particularly on weekends,&nbsp;will not cause undue and excessive problems&nbsp;with residents.&nbsp; So measures have been taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is an approach that we must continue to press on.&nbsp; But I would encourage Mr Loh to continue to work with the Police and, indeed, let me know what other measures Police can take to help him manage this problem better.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</B> Sir, I will now respond to some of the questions raised by Members concerning their Neighbourhood Police Centre (MPC) system, Home Team training and professionalism raised by Dr Maliki, Mr Ravindran and Mdm Ho Geok Choo yesterday.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, Sir, Dr Maliki raised some questions about the NPC system and the level of Police presence on the ground.&nbsp; Sir, the transition from the Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) system to the NPC system started back in 1997 when the first NPC was established and was completed in 2001.&nbsp; It was a strategic move by the Police to evolve and keep pace with the changes in the operating environment, and to improve the system of community policing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is a nationwide network of about 32 NPCs supported by 65 Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs).&nbsp; Under the NPC system, the NPPs still retain an operational role and have not been completely replaced. Overall, the number of service points has not changed significantly under the two systems.&nbsp; There were 98 fixed service points under the previous system compared to 97 fixed service points today, comprising NPCs and NPPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating hours of the existing NPPs have been shortened to allow for the redeployment of more officers for patrol duties during periods of lull activity at NPPs, in other words, more officers are being released to do patrol work.&nbsp; This means their presence is more visible in the neighbourhood, rather than reduced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki has also asked about the number of personnel assigned to police our housing estates under the NPP and NPC systems.&nbsp; Sir, prior to the implementation of the NPC system, a total of 2,210 officers&nbsp;would patrol the total land area of Singapore.&nbsp; Under the current system, this number increased to 2,761 officers, or an increase of more than 500 officers, or about 25%.&nbsp;This works out to a ratio of about&nbsp;one officer serving 1,580 residents as opposed to 1,700 in 1997.&nbsp; This was achieved, although our population has increased from around $3.8 million to $4.35 million last year.&nbsp; The increase in the number of officers is achieved through the optimisation of our police resources, including better utilisation of our full-time Police NSmen to complement the regulars in frontline duties.&nbsp; The number of Police cars on patrol at any one time has more than doubled from 45 to 96, giving an average of three for each of the 32 NPCs.&nbsp; Furthermore, in addition to the frontline NPC officers, we now also have strategic reserve forces from Special Operations Command and Key Installation Command, making regular patrols in designated areas to&nbsp;project greater Police visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it might however be recognised that effective policing is not determined solely by the number of police posts or police officers on the ground.&nbsp; The public, as explained earlier, has a crucial role to play as well.&nbsp; The cornerstone of our NPC system is&nbsp;the focus on developing community leadership and responsibility for the safety and security of the neighbourhoods.&nbsp; In particular, the Community Safety and Security Programme (CSSP) and the Neighbourhood Watch Zones serve as useful platforms for the Home Team to connect with the grassroots leaders and residents to tackle local safety and security issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki also asked about the key performance indicators (KPIs) of our NPCs.&nbsp; Sir, the performance of the NPCs is measured under various KPIs, such as crime rates, response time and community engagement, which should reflect the corresponding emphasis on the NPC system.&nbsp; We monitor these KPIs closely and there have been improvements in several areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For CSSP, for example, the number has gradually increased over the years from around 492 in 1999 to 695 last year.&nbsp; And since the implementation of the NPC, we see more members of the public coming forward to assist the Police in apprehending criminals.&nbsp; This percentage of public assistance, as mentioned by the Minister earlier, reached 42% last year.&nbsp; It was about 30% in 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the question of how the crime rate has changed since the switch from the NPP system, let me say that this is not a very meaningful comparison as the crime rate is influenced by many different factors, social economic factors and all, and it would not be correct to attribute changes in the crime rate solely to our&nbsp;move to the NPC system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ravindran and Mdm Ho have requested for an update on the training of Police officers.&nbsp; I am happy to inform the House that beyond enhancing its operational capabilities, Police has continued to place strong emphasis on the training of its officers to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to cope with today's policing environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the basic training, special groups of officers are provided with advanced training in skills that are becoming increasingly critical for tackling the latest crime and terrorism challenges.&nbsp; This includes computer forensic skills for investigating cyber-crimes and post-blast investigations skills for dealing with terrorist bomb attacks.&nbsp; With the migration of the Police Academy to the new Home Team Academy early this year, the training of our Police officers will be supported by even better facilities, including a Training Village, where a&nbsp;realistic scenario based training will be conducted.&nbsp; Police officers will also be able to attend various</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In addition, the Home Team will explore how we can tap on the experiences of suitable retired officers, such as re-employing them as instructors in the Home Team Academy, so that their experiences will not be lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran mentioned that if&nbsp;an officer&nbsp;dies today after 30 years of service, all his experiences will be lost.&nbsp; If we compare one-to-one, maybe we will get worried, because someone with such vast experiences will retire and a new rookie will come in, without experience and almost \"blur\".&nbsp; But&nbsp;in reality, that&nbsp;is not true.&nbsp; If someone with 30 years' experience&nbsp;retires today, there is another guy with maybe&nbsp;29, 28 or 25 years of experience.&nbsp; In other words, the full force of the police team has people with varied experience.&nbsp; We will try to tap the experiences of those who have left.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must mention that the new Home Team Academy also has what we call the Knowledge Depository Branch.&nbsp; They will help young officers to get to know better&nbsp;on what has happened, what we have gone through.&nbsp; This institutional memory will be passed on to the newer officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;Mdm Ho&nbsp;also suggested that police officers today should receive special training to deal with youths.&nbsp; Dealing with youths is not something entirely new for our&nbsp;officers.&nbsp; The police has various procedures in place to assist our&nbsp;officers to engage the&nbsp;young ones.&nbsp; These procedures have been designed so that we will not alienate our youths but, in fact, to reflect the authority and,&nbsp;where possible, befriend them, because the police officers are there to assist them in whatever ways to look after the young and protect them from possible crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are instructions on how police officers&nbsp;handle different categories of people, such as the young or&nbsp;those in the category of being a&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;or non-suspect.&nbsp; They will know how to handle these cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will also take up Mdm Ho's suggestion to extend such training to officers in other Home Team departments who have to interact with youths.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one of the reasons for setting up the Home Team Academy is for the Home Team departments to share their core expertise with one another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to inform Mdm Ho that we will be launching a Behavioural Sciences Programme, which would be spearheaded by the Police Psychological Services Division.&nbsp; The programme will develop the knowledge and skills of our Home Team officers in the specialised area of behavioural sciences.&nbsp; Tie-ups or collaborations with external institutions of higher learning and research institutes will certainly be something that we will explore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho&nbsp;also noted that the law enforcement officers today have to strike a balance between protecting the wider interests of society and that of the individual. &nbsp;Indeed, the police is very mindful of the need to manage this delicate balance.&nbsp;

Is he saying that counter-terrorism is the focus now and not crime-busting?&nbsp; DPM seems to attribute the increased crime rate to victims being careless.&nbsp; I would like to seek clarification from him that is this the new philosophy of the police in dealing with crime rates.&nbsp; Is he saying, for example, that if a person is being robbed, it is&nbsp;because the person is careless, that he or she walks into the path of the robber?&nbsp; Or if the pocket is being picked, is he saying that the person is careless because his pocket is not deep enough?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the last clarification I have is on crime rate.&nbsp; The fact is that the crime rate has been going up.&nbsp; But DPM, based on his macro-assessment,&nbsp;says that it is not really a problem because generally we are still a very safe society.&nbsp; What is the correlation between crime statistics and social safety?&nbsp; Can he clarify that, because I am a bit \"blur\" with that?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, Mr Low is seldom \"blur\".&nbsp; I do not know whether he is \"blur\" here&nbsp;because he wants to blur the situation.&nbsp; On&nbsp;the message I am sending, am I telling our police officers that busting crime is no more important but put all&nbsp;their time on to counter terrorism?&nbsp; I did not say that.&nbsp; What I am saying is that the focus of the MPs' speeches, and as reported in the English press,&nbsp;seems to be that crime is the most important thing of what MHA does.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA has many roles.&nbsp; Dealing with crime is one of it.&nbsp; And dealing with that is not just the MHA's role.&nbsp; It is also the role of the public.&nbsp; Here, I am glad to say that 42% of the arrests of various types I mentioned were helped by the members of the public.&nbsp; I say again here that no country in the world has achieved this.&nbsp; When I mentioned this to police forces overseas, they said they wished they had the same situation.&nbsp; When I mentioned this to some people in some of our neighbouring countries, they said that they just encountered the opposite.&nbsp; When they see a crime, they would rather run away.&nbsp; So, our public is willing to confront a criminal, as can be seen in the case of the recent gun robber who went to an NTUC Fairprice outlet.&nbsp; At&nbsp;the carpark,&nbsp;a naval officer went around and assisted the security guard, who happened to be a retired police officer, in overcoming the suspect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us not under-play the issue of&nbsp;crime-busting.&nbsp; In fact, clearance rate by the&nbsp;police has been maintained at a very high level.&nbsp; In other words, when a crime is committed, the police managed to clear many of these crimes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has there been a new philosophy where the police say, \"Well, it is your problem, not ours, so please do not create the problem for yourself.\"?&nbsp; There is no new philosophy.&nbsp; I have always said here that dealing with crime is not just a police responsibility.&nbsp; Everyone has a responsibility to prevent the crime from happening.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;we have read of stories, we have seen Crime Watch programmes.&nbsp; Why do people lose handphones in hawker centres?&nbsp; They have such great confidence in the safety of Singapore that when they go to the hawker centre, some of them will leave their handphones on the table to&nbsp;reserve the seats.&nbsp; Then, merrily, they trot along to the hawker stall to&nbsp;queue for the food.&nbsp; Can you imagine, if we were to ensure that such crimes do not happen and&nbsp;we need police presence, how many more police officers do&nbsp;we need?&nbsp; Should we be putting police officers as security guards and standing watch at hawker centres for such people?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;a person&nbsp;has a home and&nbsp;he has valuables in&nbsp;his home, I would advise strongly that&nbsp;he installs an alarm system and turn it on at the right time when&nbsp;he leaves home.&nbsp; No point installing it and not turning it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a spate of such incidents in the 1990s where some homeowners had their homes burgled when&nbsp;they did have an alarm system but they did not turn it on.&nbsp; So is it only a police problem that&nbsp;they did not turn on&nbsp;their alarm system?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; It must be that of the homeowner.&nbsp; So, whatever it is, we are not advising&nbsp;them to walk into a robber.&nbsp; Nobody knows when a person is going to turn into a robber, unless they&nbsp;have the prescience to know that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us not try to \"blur\" the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not say that crime is no longer a problem.&nbsp; I said low crime does not mean no crime and that the crime situation is under control.&nbsp; The targets that the police has set have been met.&nbsp; In many years, they have&nbsp;over-achieved.&nbsp; That is the situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On counter-terrorism, let me&nbsp;not under-state this.&nbsp; I think it bears repeating that counter-terrorism is the most important issue facing us today.&nbsp; If we have would-be terrorists slipping through our checkpoints, because, as some people prefer, to&nbsp;facilitate checks and make it easier for people to come through our Woodlands Checkpoint, like Mr Steve Chia has suggested, I think&nbsp;we will have a bomb&nbsp;or maybe guns in Singapore too.&nbsp; Do&nbsp;we want that?&nbsp; I think let us be more cautious about that, be stricter in our immigration and checkpoint measures, prevent such people from coming in or such guns from being smuggled in or, worse still, explosives from coming in, and we will be able to sleep better at night.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As to how the girls who are serving are dressed,&nbsp;it all depends on what your own sense of taste is because, if you are in those places where you are drinking beer, you are with people I think&nbsp;who can accept the dress.&nbsp; Of course, if the dress is indecent or obscene, then the police can take note of it.&nbsp; But if it is a short skirt or a bustline that may not be as high as some women would like it to be, it is subjective.&nbsp;

I would like to ask whether the police advises or guides the management on the appropriate level and practice of security checks in and around the building.&nbsp; The reason I ask this is that a businessman friend of mine from Taiwan told me just earlier this week that when he visited one of our regional shopping malls - I think it is Kovan, but I will have to check with him - and took photographs of the shops&nbsp;inside the building, he was approached by a uniformed security guard and told to stop.&nbsp; He was even asked to go into the security office as the guards wanted to go through the pictures that he had taken on his digital camera.&nbsp; He also noticed that the dustbins within the shopping mall had all been removed.&nbsp; So I would like to ask whether this is the position recommended by the police or is it something the building management has taken upon itself and, secondly, whether the private security guards have the power or authority to stop innocent people from taking photographs in public.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, Mr Ong has raised a point which is valid.&nbsp; Indeed, building security is a responsibility of building owners.&nbsp; In fact, the tenants in these buildings can and should also play a role, because we cannot expect the police to be guarding that property.&nbsp; A building is&nbsp;a private property.&nbsp; It is owned by a commercial organisation for business purposes.&nbsp; Therefore, the security of that building must belong to that of the building owner and the management.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police has indeed worked with the management of these buildings to tighten up security and help them with measures.&nbsp; In fact, we give advice.&nbsp; We go around Orchard Road and many other places in the key parts of Singapore where we have a lot of members of the public accessing them, to advise them on what sort of security measures that need to be taken on the outside as well as the inside of the building.&nbsp; The fact that a guard in a regional mall stopped that person from taking photographs shows that he is doing his job.&nbsp; He is doing his duty.&nbsp; If somebody is taking a picture of his building, surely he can ask, \"What are you doing?\"&nbsp; This is especially so when that&nbsp;person is inside the building,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head F of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the current Parliament's practice is for the Minister to introduce a Bill, or Bills, or its amendments at the First Reading.&nbsp; He will then speak and explain his reasoning for the proposed Bill or amendments at the Second Reading, followed by comments from MPs before summing up to reply to any questions raised by the MPs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, and often enough, Members, the press and the general public cannot grasp the essence of the proposed Bills presented and the important key features and highlight of the Bills and/or the amendments would be lost in the text.&nbsp; This is especially so if it comes in a thick stack of papers and is very technical in nature, which some Bills are.&nbsp; This past practice handicaps comprehensive debate and the gathering of effective feedback for the Minister and his Ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent Bills passed by Parliament, after the Second and Third Readings, without comprehensive debate nor feedback caused several controversies and unhappiness with the general public.&nbsp; One such Bill was the transfer of assets from the reserves to the statutory board without going through the President.&nbsp; The MOF had to come out and explain many times over several papers after the Bill was passed.&nbsp; Yet, the public is still unsatisfied about the clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another was the appointment of a CEO for MUIS by the Minister for Muslim Affairs.&nbsp; There were a lot of unhappiness and allegations that this Bill was bulldozed through by the Minister without much debate and consultation with the community and no opportunity for them to provide effective feedback before the Bill was passed into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my proposal is to amend the Standing Orders so that the Minister will speak and address the House upon the presentation of the Bill at the First Reading.&nbsp; This will allow Members, the media and the public to pick up the important points that the Minister wants to highlight.&nbsp; Public comments and effective feedback can then be sought by&nbsp;Members and the media before the Bill is read again at the Second Reading.&nbsp; This suggestion is just like what the Finance Minister had been doing with the Budget Speech all along, giving time for his ideas to be digested and feedback sought before it is debated.&nbsp; Such a practice will encourage more effective and focused debate at its Second Reading and not allowed the Bills to be constantly passed through without any Backbenchers speaking on it, just like what we have been saying of late.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, Sir, members of the public would not be caught by surprise when some of the controversial Bills are passed through without their better understanding and&nbsp;Members of Parliament are accused of sleeping through the Bill and&nbsp;debate.&nbsp; I hope Mr Speaker will agree and institute this new practice for the good of our Parliament and everyone here as soon as possible.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia has asked that the Ministers should speak at the First Reading of the Bill and his reason for asking for this to be done is that he can better understand why the Bill is introduced when it is read the first time.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently the objective&nbsp;of every Bill is stated at the end of the Bill.&nbsp; There is an Explanatory Statement in the Bill and this statement states the purpose of each section or amendment and whether public monies will be spent as a result of the Bill.&nbsp; So Members do have a good idea as to why the Bill is introduced at its First Reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, like the Casino Control Bill, for example, information is also set out in the Bill, giving the legislative origins or the history of the provisions.&nbsp; For Bills which have a significant public impact and, I think, this is what Mr Steve Chia was referring to when he said that there is not enough time being given, the public consultation exercise is usually conducted on the intended provisions of the Bill and this is undertaken by the Ministry in charge before it is introduced in the House.&nbsp; I can cite some recent examples.&nbsp;We had the Parks and Trees Bill and the Competition Bill in 2004, the Workplace Safety and Health Bill, the Biological Agents and Toxins Bill and the Deposit Insurance Bill in 2005.&nbsp;In fact, I recall that most of the MAS' Bills which are, by nature, very technical, are given a round of public consultation before they are introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This consultation process generates the publicity and the awareness of the proposed legislation and its policy directives.&nbsp; In some instances, the Ministries concerned also put up a statement to give&nbsp;more details of the Bill before the Second Reading.&nbsp; So, from this, one can see that sufficient information is already provided on the purposes and scope of the Bill at the First Reading.&nbsp; What Members should do is to look at the details of the Bill, do their homework, study the Bill carefully, research the matters brought up in the Bill so that they can be well prepared when they finally come to Parliament to speak after they hear the Minister's Second Reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sufficient time is also given to Members to examine the Bill in detail before its Second Reading.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the Standing Orders stipulate that there must be at least seven clear days after the Bill is gazetted&nbsp;before its Second Reading.&nbsp; Usually, in our case, because Parliament sits on average every month,&nbsp;there is, in fact,&nbsp;much more than the seven clear days that is stipulated in the Standing Orders.&nbsp; At the Second Reading, the Minister would make his speech to elaborate on the Bill, then the debate follows and Members can make their views known and question the Minister on specific aspects of the Bill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the current practice has served us well.&nbsp; It is also the practice in the British House of Commons and other Commonwealth Parliaments in Canada,&nbsp;Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, to name a few.&nbsp; There is no need to change this practice.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Clarification, Sir.&nbsp; The current Bill has served us well in the past, but apparently it has not served well because there have been complaints that Bills are passed through without any debate in Parliament, as two of the examples I quoted were not effectively debated.&nbsp; So what is the problem with us changing the practice so that we can actually make Parliament even more effective and the Bills are even more publicised by the media and more feedback can be gathered before it has been passed into law?&nbsp; If it is a good practice, we should change it.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I explained, before the Bill is read the first time, or when it is presented to Parliament, and before it is gazetted, there are explanatory notes being given.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the case of the Casino Control Bill, which is a very complicated Bill and, as Mr Steve Chia noted just now, it is actually a huge stack, the Ministry in charge,&nbsp;the Ministry of Home Affairs, actually provided a lot of explanatory notes, provisions, explaining why the various clauses are drafted as such.&nbsp; It is during this time that public feedback and&nbsp;consultation are sought, and Members can actually go through these notes and make reference to them to prepare for debate on the Bill.&nbsp; So it is not correct to say that there is no time given or there is not enough information given as to the contents of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what the Member is probably commenting on is that&nbsp;the Bills that are put to Parliament are actually passed and&nbsp;not that there is not enough debate.&nbsp; In fact, most of the Bills, controversial Bills particularly, see extensive debate in this House, not just from Members of the Opposition and the Non-Constituency MPs, but also from the PAP Members of this House.&nbsp; So I dare say that if the PAP Members can take the trouble and the effort to do their homework and come up with&nbsp;very cogent, relevant and useful points for the Minister to consider, I do not see why other Members cannot do the same.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)</B>: Sir, I beg to move,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, 2005 was another excellent year for&nbsp;Singapore's transport sector.&nbsp; On the land transport front, the Land Transport Authority continued with its mission to develop Singapore's land transport infrastructure.&nbsp; The Punggol LRT east loop and Sengkang LRT west loop were opened on 29th January 2005, boosting our rail network by 8%.&nbsp; Construction on the Circle Line is well underway, while plans for the downtown extension and the Boon Lay extension have been announced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2005, the road network was also expanded by more than 100-lane kilometres.&nbsp; In addition, adjustments have been made to several land transport policies, regulations and schemes and the outcomes have been positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the Government's commitment to foster a more inclusive society, I am happy to note that wheelchair-accessible buses have been introduced in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now go into details on some issues regarding our land transport system.&nbsp; Our total vehicle population has grown by 44% from 509,000 vehicles on our roads in 1989 to&nbsp;735,000 that we had last year.&nbsp; This steady vehicle population growth over time, accompanied by lower ARF and COE prices, has enabled many more people to own cars.&nbsp; I would like to ask whether this vehicle growth rate is sustainable over the long term and what is the allowable rate&nbsp;of increase going forward.&nbsp; In connection with the new growth rate, will there be an increase or reduction in the COE quota for 2006?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although there are now more vehicles on our roads, we can still be proud of a well-managed and generally congestion-free road system.&nbsp; With ERP, we manage well under normal circumstances.&nbsp; But, if for some special ad-hoc reasons and occasions, many more drivers decide to descend or converge in a particular area, a massive jam or gridlock can occur.&nbsp; We cannot really control how many cars&nbsp;come for a particular occasion and we cannot impose ERP on short notice.&nbsp; One example is the Investiture ceremony last year, where for the first time the ceremony was delayed.&nbsp; Most of the special events can be predicted, for example, Kreta Ayer, Chinatown, during Chinese New Year, Orchard Road during light-up and other major events and festivities.&nbsp; But some can happen without warning.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry of Transport and the Land Transport Authority to work closely with other agencies like the Traffic Police to foresee and cope with such situations effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics and key performance indicators of the Ministry of Transport.&nbsp; A desired outcome of the Ministry of Transport is to have a quality integrated and efficient land transport system.&nbsp; One of the key performance indicators (KPI) is the percentage of expressways and arterial roads which are congestion-free during peak periods.&nbsp; By congestion-free, it means expressways where traffic can move at a speed above 45 kph and arterial roads with speed above&nbsp;20 kph.&nbsp; I observe that&nbsp;using this KPI, the percentage of expressways with speed above 45 kph has dropped from 99.2% in FY2003 to 97.9%&nbsp;in FY2004, to only at least 95% in the revised FY2005.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>I am puzzled by this steady decline over the last few years, especially since during those years the ERP was implemented and rolled out along many stretches of expressways to ease and smooth out traffic flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the percentage of arterial roads above 20 kph has increased marginally, from 94.7% in FY2003 to 95.5% in FY2004, and it is hoped to maintain&nbsp;at at least 95% in the revised FY2005.&nbsp; I would have thought that congestion along arterial roads&nbsp;worsened as motorists avoided the ERP along the expressways, and used other roads instead. Could the Minister clarify and explain these figures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would think that these figures and statistics, which I have just quoted, would sound rather academic and meaningless to the man-in-the-street.&nbsp; What do these figures translate to or reflect in the actual situation he is facing day to day?&nbsp; To the average motorist, these figures are meaningless because, to him, the actual traffic situation that affects him every day is more important.&nbsp; At least, 95% of expressways above 45 kph may sound very impressive on paper, but the motorist would be most unhappy if he were to be caught in the remaining 5% of expressways every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, managing traffic jams.&nbsp; I think it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;most meaningful to motorists if we introduce a code for the different levels of congestion.&nbsp; We need not be too specific or exact as in the&nbsp;system which informs us of the number of minutes required to arrive at a certain point along the expressway.&nbsp; I would like to propose, for example, \"green\" can mean that the expressway traffic is smooth flowing and moving at above 45 kph; \"yellow\" means slow moving traffic at between 30-45 kph;&nbsp;\"red\" means crawling traffic at between 20-30 kph; and \"black\" means drivers are stuck in the traffic, at standstill, and most of them have black faces!&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be easier to interpret and give the drivers a clearer mental image of the situation than mere speeds expressed numerically in kph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on our early&nbsp;warning displays, I observe that, at present, the early warning LED displays along the expressways do not tell us much about the actual traffic situation.&nbsp; \"Accident on Lane 1 after Kallang\" or \"Jam after Kallang\" does not give&nbsp;motorists a sense of how bad the jam is. It does not tell you how long is the tail-back.&nbsp; How long would the driver need to take to pass through that section?&nbsp; I only know that if it says \"Massive Jam\", I better give it due respect and avoid that section at all costs.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the severity of the traffic jam be represented by similar colour codes.&nbsp; So motorists can see at a glance and be better informed of the situation, so as to decide whether to join the jam or to take an alternative route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on \"clean\" vehicles, I would like to ask about the amount of incentives granted to encourage the use of \"clean\" vehicles.&nbsp; Hybrid vehicles are still more expensive to buy and the cost benefits still do not add up.&nbsp; It is also a question of infrastructure and demand - chicken and egg.&nbsp; Take compressed natural gas, for example.&nbsp; One major complaint is the lack of convenient refuelling stations.&nbsp; But private companies would not want to take such a big risk to invest large sums of money to build the infrastructure and the network of refuelling stations unless the demand can be assured.&nbsp; And without convenient refuelling stations, few motorists will be prepared to own and use a compressed natural gas vehicle.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, I would like&nbsp;to declare that I am a director of SBS Transit.&nbsp; One of our policies for the mass public transport system is to avoid duplication of services.&nbsp; Hence, in areas served by&nbsp;the MRT, bus routes are carefully planned to minimise duplication of the MRT routes.&nbsp; This policy has reduced the number of point-to-point bus services.&nbsp; In spite of the predictability, speed and comfort of the MRT services, a significant segment of commuters still prefer point-to-point services.&nbsp; They do not like the inter-modal transfers for a number of reasons.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;dislike the additional waiting times; others find transfers confusing and inconvenient.&nbsp; Singaporeans want choice.&nbsp; I think the time is ripe to give them greater choice by allowing competition between our MRT and buses.&nbsp; The MRT system is now quite mature, except for the Circle Line, with a well-established commuter base.&nbsp; Competition would drive our operators to provide better services and add flexibility and robustness to our system.&nbsp; The ultimate winners will be the Singapore public.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Public Transport System</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min:</B>&nbsp; Sir, adverse feedback has been received from the public about the quality of our bus service.&nbsp; The dissatisfaction centres around unreliability of service, long waiting time and overcrowding.&nbsp; This may stem from commuters' rising expectations.&nbsp; I would like to ask how this adverse feedback can be addressed, whether any new requirements or standards are to be imposed and whether their compliance&nbsp;would lead to an increase in cost of operation, leading to increase in fares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in imposing any new service standards, I would like the authorities to be mindful of the fact that while operators can ensure that the buses leave the bus interchange according to the schedule, unreliability, long waiting time and overcrowding further down the route could also be due to unpredictable traffic conditions along the way.&nbsp; Traffic congestion along the route can cause uncertain arrival and bunching.&nbsp; I think complaining against the bus operators would not solve the problem, because traffic condition is beyond their control.&nbsp; Also, penalising the operators is not the solution.&nbsp; I would like to ask what measures will be taken to enable our buses to ply their routes with more certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next,&nbsp;on public transport concessionary fares for the lower-income group.&nbsp; When there is a downturn, the transport operators, NTUC and other organisations may volunteer to come up with a few million dollars to start a transport fund for that period.&nbsp; I think we should have a more permanent Government-supported transport fund to give those from the lower-income group the mobility and ability to travel further, whether for work or leisure. For example, why should a low-income resident from my constituency, Tampines, be prevented from taking up a job in Tuas just because, for him, the transport cost of getting to and back from his workplace would be prohibitive in relation to his income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as a poor student in London, season passes allowed me to travel to college and visit places of interest that I would otherwise not been able to.&nbsp; There were London Transport season tickets, Brit Rail passes, Inter Rail, EU Rail and in the US, Greyhound bus passes, etc.&nbsp; Our public transport operators are not issuing season tickets because they say that would result in them collecting less revenue.&nbsp; They dictate that commuters pay on a per trip basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are only two public transport operators here.&nbsp; If SBS&nbsp;and&nbsp;SMRT do not offer, then commuters have no choice but to pay for every trip.&nbsp; I think the Government should step in to provide for the lower-income group to give them more mobility to get to their place of work and earn a living to provide for their families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A season ticket can also serve as a cap on their transport expenses, help them in their budgeting and allow them to take their families out of the neighbourhood to visit other places of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point relates to&nbsp;Tuas Industrial Estate.&nbsp; We still have thousands who are structurally unemployed.&nbsp; There are jobs available for them in Tuas. There are companies there that cannot find workers to fill vacancies.&nbsp; The present situation which has existed for many years is unsatisfactory.&nbsp;We have spent millions of dollars developing that industrial estate.&nbsp; We should not allow poor accessibility and inadequate bus services to prevent us from realising its full potential.&nbsp; We need to adopt more creative solutions to tackle the present shortcomings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I observe that there are not many pedestrians walking along the roads in Tuas.&nbsp; This is understandable.&nbsp; The roads there are dusty and unsheltered from the elements, and workers spend most of their time working within the compound of the factories.&nbsp; Unlike the CBD and Orchard Road, factory workers there do not have to come out of their factories to visit other factories for meetings.&nbsp; Even for lunch, workers do not venture far on foot.&nbsp; Many of the factories have their own canteens&nbsp;or food is brought there for the workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it does not make sense to subject the public transport operators to the universal service obligation that they must and can only ply approved routes and pick up and drop off passengers at designated bus stops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuas needs a rethink and a different system.&nbsp; We should carve Tuas industrial estate out, exempt it from the universal service obligation and try something different.&nbsp; For example, how about adopting some variation of the mini-bus service that one finds in Hong Kong?&nbsp; These mini-buses can wait at MRT stations and, when a sufficient number of passengers have boarded, make shorter loops into minor roads in the industrial estate. &nbsp;Instead of only being allowed to stop at designated bus stops, they could be allowed to stop,&nbsp;drop off or pick up passengers at the factory gates.&nbsp; Instead of being required to run most hours of the day, they should have the flexibility to adjust their operating hours according to the passenger demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies could also be encouraged to band together with other factories in the vicinity to organise these mini-buses to pick up their workers at specified times and to take them back to the MRT station.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our public transport has travelled a long distance from the early days of the Hock Lee and STC bus companies.&nbsp; Then, safety and reliability of services were a great challenge.&nbsp; Today, we have moved beyond that phase and we would like the Ministry to review and set out performance standards for our public transport at present and in the future.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to assess the performance standards of our public transport system.&nbsp; Every time when there is a fare increase, the main attention is on whether the transport company is financially able to absorb the increase in the operating costs.&nbsp; Many users are not looking at other performance standards.&nbsp; For example, are our transport system operating efficiently and what is the utilisation rate of our public transport system?&nbsp; All these will work its way out into the fares eventually.&nbsp; The people do not know how well our public transport companies are performing.&nbsp; Are we maximising our infrastructure which the Government has built and provided over the years?&nbsp; The people need to know what are the benchmarks for our public transport system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are the related questions.&nbsp; What is the utilisation rate of our public bus system and MRT system as compared to other cities in the world?&nbsp; How many people have we served in our peak hours?&nbsp; Have we reached our maximum capacity, or must we do more to encourage our people to use the public transport system so as to lower the fares, as in the case of the North East Line?&nbsp; What are our fares as compared to, say, Asian cities like Hong Kong and Taipei?&nbsp; How are our public transport companies' financial performance as compared to other transport companies in similar cities, given that the Government gives them the monopoly to run the public transport system with the provision of first-class infrastructure by the Government?&nbsp; And what other public transport performance benchmarks that other cities are using to ensure that the standard of their public transport system is performing satisfactorily?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like the Ministry of Transport to look into the following areas of concern on the ground:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;When we decided to privatise our public transport system, the belief was that in doing so, it would give the operators greater flexibility to offer the best at the most competitive prices.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they are privatised.&nbsp; Routinely, these companies put up proposals to the Public Transport Council for fare revisions.&nbsp; It is almost a cyclical motion that every&nbsp;other year, they will be knocking on the door to ask for fare revisions.&nbsp;

However, since the Committee was concerned that those who can afford bigger luxury cars will outbid the smaller car buyers, it proposed that the merger of car categories be done gradually.&nbsp; Thus, the recommendation of the Committee back in 1999 was supposed to be an intermediary step.&nbsp; Apparently, the Committee felt that ultimately, there should be only one car&nbsp; category while recommending that the Open Category be maintained.&nbsp; In my view, the Committee's recommendations are sound.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since 1999, we have experienced several business cycles.&nbsp; LTA has adjusted the number of quotas for the vehicles.&nbsp; The demand for cars has also changed with time.&nbsp; In fact, over the past 12 months, the quota premiums of the two categories, Category A and Category B, tracked each other very closely.&nbsp; With the price of oil hovering around US$60 with a little chance of coming down, the desirability of gas guzzlers has dropped while the demand for fuel efficient cars has increased, so much so that, in fact, over the past year, Category B premiums are often-times lower than that of Category A.&nbsp; In extreme cases, it was $4,398 lower in January 2005, and in December 2005, it was $3,080 lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the concern that luxury car buyers would squeeze out the smaller car buyers seems to be misplaced.&nbsp; In fact, it turned out to be the other way round that the big car buyers are now being protected by the quota system.&nbsp; If anything, the segregation of the Vehicle Quota System builds in distortion in the allocation of car quotas as buyers adjust to the changing driving habits, fuel costs as well as&nbsp;awareness of global warming.&nbsp; Therefore, the VQS, as implemented today, does not encourage Singaporeans to buy smaller cars which are more fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge the Minister to constitute another review committee to see whether it can merge the two categories into one.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</B> Sir, let me thank Members who have spoken on my Ministry's budget.&nbsp; I thank them for their views.&nbsp; Let me now proceed to answer the points that were raised.&nbsp; Mr Ong asked about the outcome of the vehicle growth rate review.&nbsp; Since the introduction of the VQS in 1990, our vehicle population growth rate, as Mr Ong stated, has been set at 3% a year.&nbsp; The rate was last reviewed in 1999, when we decided that it should be maintained at 3%.&nbsp; My Ministry has completed its latest review, and we have agreed and decided to retain the vehicle growth rate also at 3%, but only for the next three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the growth rate, we took into consideration our ability to further expand the road network, the traffic conditions on our roads, the extent of road charging, the planned development of public transport infrastructure and the need to allow more people to fulfil their aspirations to own cars.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the vehicle population grew by 44% from 1989 to 2005, a period of 16 years,&nbsp;while the road network only expanded by 17%.&nbsp; Although the roads are fairly free flowing today, Members will agree that the traffic has definitely become heavier over the years.&nbsp; We have controlled congestion through the use of ERP, coupled with road expansion and improvement works.&nbsp; This has resulted in better utilisation of the overall road network capacity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, however, our road expansion will slow down in the years ahead as we become more built-up, especially in the city areas.&nbsp; We envisage that, at the most, our roads will increase by another 8% over the next 15 years,&nbsp;half the rate of the previous 15 years.&nbsp; Having&nbsp;weighed the various considerations, we have decided to maintain the vehicle growth rate at 3% for three more years.&nbsp; We will monitor the impact on traffic conditions closely and we will review the rate again in 2008.&nbsp; But I would urge Members to realise that in view of our land constraints, it is not possible to maintain the 3% growth rate indefinitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong asked what is the COE quota for the coming year.&nbsp;I am pleased to inform him that the total COE quota for 2006 is 131,127.&nbsp; This quota is just marginally lower than the original quota announced for quota year 2005, which was 132,581.&nbsp; The reduction is due mainly to a lower number of adjustment to COEs introduced for this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong also expressed concern that the KPIs for expressways seem to be declining.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; The KPI is an average figure derived from both the morning and evening peaks.&nbsp; Therefore, his observation that the KPI for expressways has dropped is correct.&nbsp; This is because the ERP system is managing the morning peak traffic very well.&nbsp; However, the traffic situation during the evening peak has been deteriorating.&nbsp; I am sure many motorists, including Members here, would have also experienced this.&nbsp; The percentage of expressways with speed above 45 kph in the morning peak was 100% in FY03 and 99.1% the following year.&nbsp; On the other hand, the percentage for the evening peak period has fallen from 98.8% in FY03 to 96.8% in FY04.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is quite a big drop.&nbsp; Overall, this has led to the average KPI declining.&nbsp; So without the ERP on most expressways during the evening peak, we can expect the average KPI to further decline in line with the growth of our vehicle population.&nbsp; That is why on 1st August 2005, we implemented the ERP along the north bound CTE during the weekday evenings, from 6.00 pm to 8.00 pm.&nbsp; Since the introduction of the evening ERP, traffic speeds along the north bound CTE have definitely improved.&nbsp; LTA will therefore be studying how to improve the expressway speeds during the evening peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong also commented that while&nbsp;95% of the expressways&nbsp;are above 45 kph, the other 5% are below the threshold and&nbsp;a motorist would be unhappy if he is caught in the 5% of the expressway every day.&nbsp; I would like to explain that the traffic speeds are measured during the peak hours over the entire stretch of all our expressways.&nbsp; Even for the stretch within the 5%, the traffic speed is only&nbsp;marginally below the optimium speed range, ie, from&nbsp;40 kph&nbsp;to 44 kph.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, the ERP would have been increased.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;the average motorist's journey would go beyond&nbsp;the affected stretch, he will be driving along stretches which are quite</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, the colour-coding of roads according to different levels of congestion is already being done&nbsp;in the form of an interactive map on the one.motoring website.&nbsp; The different colours represent the different speeds the road will be operating at that point in time.&nbsp; Therefore, we would encourage motorists to consult the map before they start their journey.&nbsp; But for motorists along the road, LTA currently makes use of the electronic signs above the expressways to convey information on the on-going traffic conditions along the expressways and some major roads.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Ong that the messages could be more informative and helpful, especially in giving motorists an estimate of the time it will take them to clear the traffic congestion.&nbsp; I will ask LTA to follow up on Mr Ong's suggestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong may also like to know that LTA is working with interested service providers to make traffic information available to motorists on a personalised basis, ie, the driver can find out exactly what to expect while he is driving, about the traffic conditions on the roads that he is going to be travelling on.&nbsp; Whether such a service will eventually be available will depend on the demand and, hence, its viability.&nbsp; This is because the service provider will have to make some investments and will therefore have to charge for such personalised information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong also asked how LTA and the Traffic Police manage public events.&nbsp; When there is a major public event that is being planned, the current procedure requires the organisers to consult the relevant agencies, ie, LTA, Traffic Police and others, to identify the impact on road users and to implement the appropriate mitigation&nbsp;measures to minimise the impact.&nbsp; This would include traffic control plans at key road junctions and advance publicity of the event so that the participants and the general public are aware of the event and the potential traffic impact.&nbsp; Motorists are also advised to use alternative routes.&nbsp; I think Members would have noticed in recent months that there have been a lot of advisory messages on our signboards.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure Mr Ong that LTA will continue to work closely with the Traffic Police and event organisers to manage public events so that they do not congest the island too much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on green vehicles, Mr Ong has observed that the hybrid cars are still more expensive than conventional petrol-driven ones, and they are not that convenient to use because of lack of fuel points.&nbsp; As Members are aware, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) has been enhancing the incentives for green vehicles.&nbsp; From 1st January this year, buyers of new hybrid cars can now enjoy a tax rebate equivalent to 40% of the car's open market value, an increase from&nbsp;20% previously.&nbsp; This further narrows the cost differential between the green cars and the conventional ones.&nbsp; With the enhanced rebates, the annualised total cost of some green vehicles&nbsp;is similar to, if not lower than, those of conventional cars.&nbsp; But even though their upfront prices may be a little bit higher, green vehicle owners enjoy savings in fuel costs.&nbsp; Green vehicles&nbsp;tend to be more expensive than conventional ones as they do not enjoy huge economies of scale at the present moment.&nbsp; But I think this is likely to change in the years ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, more people are becoming more environmentally-conscious.&nbsp; Coupled with high oil prices, more motorists are therefore likely to go green.&nbsp; As a result, car manufacturers are responding with a greater choice of hybrid and other green vehicles.&nbsp; We are hopeful that more environmentally-conscious Singaporeans will also find green vehicles more attractive in time to come, especially if&nbsp;fuel prices remain high.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to work with MEWR to continue to monitor the developments in the green vehicle market and to review the policies on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Wee Siew Kim asked for more competition between the different modes of transport in the public transport sector.&nbsp; Now I know why he was so interested, being&nbsp;on the Board of SBST.&nbsp; Yes, I think it will help SBST if there is more competition.&nbsp; Definitely.&nbsp; But I think we have to look at it on a national basis.&nbsp; We have, as a nation, invested a lot of money on our MRT lines, and we owe it to the people from whom the funds came from that we optimise the use of our MRT system.&nbsp; That is why we have regulated&nbsp;the PTOs to ensure that there is minimal duplication of services along the parts of Singapore where the MRT line runs.&nbsp; But it does not mean that everything is cast&nbsp;in stone.&nbsp; There are some places where the MRT lines are already operating near to maximum capacity.&nbsp; At those places where the MRT lines are already quite fully utilised, I think there is scope for us to introduce bus services to complement the MRT services, and I will ask LTA to examine that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong Kian Min asked about the priority measures to smoothen bus travel, and I think Mr Wee also asked about that, ie, the congestion on the road does not allow the buses to keep to their schedule.&nbsp; So what are we doing to help smoothen the bus travel?&nbsp; All bus systems in heavily built-up cities face the same problem of variable arrival times at the bus stops and bunching of buses due to congestion.&nbsp; Therefore, our experience in Singapore is not unusual or unique.&nbsp; To improve the general traffic flow, LTA will continue to carry out road improvement works, such as road widening where space is available, and improvements to the junctions and traffic light timings, etc.&nbsp; It will also work with PTOs on various traffic schemes to improve the reliability of bus services.&nbsp; The most common and effective one, which Mr Wee also mentioned, is the provision of the dedicated bus lanes along heavily-used roads during peak periods.&nbsp; Another measure is the \"B\" traffic light signals which ensure that buses are given priority at suitable traffic light junctions.&nbsp; These \"B\" signals go green before the rest of the usual traffic light, and therefore the buses are able to move off before the rest of the traffic.&nbsp; This allows the buses a head start, to weave through the different traffic lanes, especially if&nbsp;they have&nbsp;to cross the road to make a turn later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as an example of the new approach that LTA has taken, LTA conducted a trial for a full-day bus lane along Orchard Road recently.&nbsp; This helped to improve bus speeds by 15% from an average of 13 kph to 15 kph.&nbsp; As a result of the positive results, we will be implementing full-day bus lanes permanently along Orchard Road.&nbsp; LTA will look into the feasibility of extending this to other roads.&nbsp; LTA will also be deploying traffic wardens to ensure that bus lanes are kept clear during operational hours, complementing the Traffic Police's efforts of enforcement against illegal parking in the bus lanes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong talked about his happy experience in London as a student when he was able to use the heavily subsidised concessionary passes.&nbsp; I would not join Mr Ong in extolling the virtues of the London system.&nbsp; This is because the low concessionary fares enjoyed by Mr Ong was a result of heavy government subsidies.&nbsp; The financial subsidies to cover operational deficits in London continue today, but it is under better control because the operation of&nbsp;buses and the maintenance of trains have been contracted out to private operators who undertake to manage the system more efficiently.&nbsp; But they are still running at a big loss and, therefore, have to be subsidised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give an example.&nbsp; Last year, the subsidy for the London bus operations alone amounted to S$1.65 billion and the subsidy for the London Underground system amounted to S$2.25 billion.&nbsp; These are huge figures.&nbsp; But they were even much higher before.&nbsp; In Singapore, the Government is committed to helping low-income earners.&nbsp; This is well reflected in the Prime Minister's announcement in his Budget Statement of the $2.6 billion Progress Package.&nbsp; As Members know, we also have a host of financial support measures for low-income earners.&nbsp; In addition, MCYS adopts a many-helping-hands approach by partnering VWOs and community organisations, such as the CDCs, in reaching out to identify those genuinely in need of help and reaching out to help them.&nbsp; This&nbsp;system of general assistance focused on the low-income earners is a better way, instead of giving out subsidies to the entire population or by targeting subsidies at particular services.&nbsp; This allows recipients' discretion on how to use their financial assistance; it also prevents distortion of consumption patterns and avoids misallocation of resources.&nbsp; To take Mr Ong's example, I think it is better for us to provide financial assistance to his lower-income worker living in Tampines and let him decide whether to spend it on additional transport costs by taking a job in Tuas on the other side of the island, or to use the money on worthwhile things, such as a computer for his children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This way, we neither distort his travel patterns nor his needs.&nbsp; But when special circumstances require additional help to be given, we are ready and able to rally such support.&nbsp; For example, when transport fares were increased last year and the economic outlook at that time was still uncertain, the transport operators, together with the community organisations and the unions, were able to provide additional financial support targeted at the lower-income groups.&nbsp; But this should be one-off measures to tide the lower-income earners over a difficult period and should not be relied on as a systemic or on-going measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong lamented about the reluctance of the PTOs to widen the use of travel concessions and season tickets.&nbsp; These are granted by the PTOs to various groups of individuals, such as pre-school children, students and senior citizens, to help lower their cost of travelling.&nbsp; These concessions remain the prerogative of the PTOs, and they are actually cross-subsidised by the majority of full-fare-paying commuters.&nbsp; The PTOs have, therefore, been very prudent about extending the travel concessions beyond the present groups, as it would ultimately result in other commuters paying higher fares.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong also talked about Tuas.&nbsp; First, let me assure Mr Ong that Tuas today is already adequately served by public transport.&nbsp; There are now four public services serving Tuas with a total fleet of 41 buses, and they link Tuas Industrial Estate to Boon Lay MRT Station and the Boon Lay Bus Interchange which are located together.&nbsp; SBS has planned its bus schedules to match the ridership, which is concentrated during the morning and evening peaks, with very low demand during the off-peak period.&nbsp; PTC has periodically checked and found that the bus services to Tuas are quite adequate.&nbsp; By 2009, the public transport to Tuas will further improve when we have completed the Boon Lay Extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will extend the East-West MRT line westward into the Jurong estate into the Joo Koon Circle area.&nbsp; There will&nbsp;be a new&nbsp;MRT station and bus interchange there.&nbsp; Workers will find it a lot more convenient and accessible when the facility is ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>carve Tuas Industrial Estate out of the Universal Service Obligation (USO) and allow other players to come in to provide mini-bus services.&nbsp;We have actually considered this before.&nbsp; Our conclusion is that this is not likely to lead to better service level at today's fares.&nbsp; This is because the bus ridership pattern is very peakish in Tuas, like in most industrial estates, and the travel time also coincides with travel time elsewhere, ie, whoever operates there cannot be using free capacity freed&nbsp;up because the buses are lying&nbsp;idle, and therefore be able to offer a low-cost service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, without the USO, the bus operators will only ply during the peak hours, with very little coverage during the off-peak hours,&nbsp;in fact, little or even no coverage.&nbsp; Also, the bus operators operating mini-buses may not be able to enjoy the same economies of scale as SBS and SMRT do.&nbsp; So, in short, the workers in Tuas may be worse off than today, as there will be no guarantee that fares will be the same or lower than the current level, and the service may not be available throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I must admit that the employers in Tuas do face a bigger transport challenge and, therefore, the workers there face a bigger transport challenge than many other places in Jurong.&nbsp; For example, the travel time for bus commuters can be very long, in view of the sheer physical size of Tuas.&nbsp; Let me give an example.&nbsp; The four bus services that ply Tuas Industrial Estate take between 50 minutes to more than one hour just to go from the Boon Lay Bus Interchange to the end point of their service in Tuas, that means, that one-way trip can take almost an hour or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it less attractive for our workers to work there and, therefore, employers there have had to compensate them in some other ways for this inconvenience. Some employers pay a higher salary.&nbsp; Others offer a dedicated company bus shuttle for their employees because these shuttle services are faster, they are more direct and flexible, and can be customised to cater to their special work arrangements, like their shift hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the end of the day, the employment market in Singapore is an open and competitive one.&nbsp; Workers who are structurally unemployed will need to be re-trained for the jobs that are available, whether these are in Tuas or elsewhere in Singapore.&nbsp; And employers will need a competitive remuneration package if they wish to attract the right worker, in keeping with the demands of the job, their workplace, and the skills required.&nbsp;&nbsp;This applies definitely to employers in Tuas too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on&nbsp;to the points made by Mdm Cynthia Phua. She asked about the quality of service, whether we are setting QoS&nbsp;standards which are relevant to the commuters. The existing QoS standards, which were first developed in 1994, have been evolving in tandem with the service demand&nbsp;and the increasing expectations of commuters.&nbsp; To this end, PTC recently reviewed the existing standards, and&nbsp;they have come up with a new set. The revised set is now being refined&nbsp;by the PTOs for implementation later this year.&nbsp;The existing bus standards used to measure averages over a period of time, usually on a per week or&nbsp;per month basis. This does not really reflect the everyday experience very well.&nbsp; The new QoS standards will be more sensitive to individual incidents of, for example, overloading and long waiting times, and will better reflect the experience of commuters.&nbsp; One of the things you can measure,&nbsp;for example, will be how the individual bus services comply with the scheduled headways. At the moment, we lump them altogether, so it all looks very good.&nbsp; But there could be a few services that are actually having a very poor compliance.&nbsp; This will allow PTC now to identify exactly where are the problem areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua also asked whether we benchmark. Sir, yes, we do benchmark the operators regularly to ensure that they offer a quality service that is convenient, efficient and affordable to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Sir, let me explain how they have measured up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we do opinion surveys.&nbsp; The opinion surveys showed that the vast majority of the public is satisfied with our public transport system. That is the silent majority. The survey showed that more than 80% of the public respondents agreed that Singapore's overall land transport system provides adequate choices, and is well-integrated and efficient.&nbsp; In addition, our system is also rated very highly by foreigners when compared to Hong Kong, London, New York, Paris and Tokyo, which have very good and well-developed public transport systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the surveys, LTA also carries out benchmarking, which I have mentioned, and&nbsp;let me go into this.&nbsp; The four areas of benchmarking are: &nbsp;firstly, system utilisation,&nbsp;which&nbsp;measures how well the assets are used to generate revenue, without compromising on service quality and safety; secondly, fares, which give an indication of cost to the commuters and affordability;&nbsp;thirdly, productivity, which refers to how efficiently the resources are being used;&nbsp;and fourthly, financial performance, which in our case is important because, unlike most other cities, we do not subsidise operating cost of the operators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when compared with 10 rail and 10 bus operators from cities in Asia, Europe and North America, our two operators, SMRT and SBS, came up amongst the top in each of these four areas. For example, SMRT's rail system was consistently ranked the top three in the KPIs. For buses, the KPIs showed that SMRT Bus and SBS Transit came in either first or second in the KPIs.&nbsp; In terms of fares, which are normalised using the purchasing power parity or gross national income per capita for comparability, Singapore's public transport fares are amongst the lowest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our strong ratings are an affirmation of the quality of our public transport system and the operators.&nbsp; But I think our challenge is not what happens today, but how do we keep pace with the rising commuters' expectations.&nbsp; My Ministry, together with the PTC, would therefore continue to engage the key stakeholders to ensure that we continue to have a public system that serves the needs of most Singaporeans and that remains affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mdm Cynthia Phua also asked how do we make sure that the PTOs do not just ask for fare revisions but use their reserves to reduce fares.&nbsp; Sir, let me clarify that, as the KPIs have shown,&nbsp;our system is among the most cost-effective and most affordable. This is well borne out by the past fare adjustments.&nbsp; Let me give her some data.&nbsp; If you look over the past 18 years, wages have gone up by an average of 182%.&nbsp; Our fares have gone up by only 17% for the buses and only by 33% for the MRT. That is because we&nbsp;deliberately kept the MRT fares very low for the first couple of years when the MRT started.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I can say that&nbsp;the bus operators have done our commuters a world of good, by keeping their operations very efficient and by keeping the fare increases very low.&nbsp;&nbsp;So are they having an&nbsp;overly high rate of return?&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; Actually, their rate of return has been very modest.&nbsp; I do not have the figures here but the rate of return is in the region of about 4%-6%, which, I think, for an operation with such an heavy capital investment, these are quite modest figures, as I am sure, Mdm Phua, being from&nbsp;the private sector, would appreciate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Phua asked about traffic congestion along Braddell Road.&nbsp; I would advise her to communicate with LTA and we will look into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, now, let me move on to Mr Chiam's questions.&nbsp; He has asked for the feeder service fares to be reduced.&nbsp;He quoted a fare of 90 cents for the LRT and 80 cents for the trunk service.&nbsp; Actually, the feeder fare is exactly the same as the fare for the trunk bus services. That means that for the feeder fares and the LRT fares, for people with the ez-link cashcard, the fare is 64 cents today, not 80 cents or 90 cents, as quoted by Mr Chiam.&nbsp; But if they pay by cash, the cash fare is 90 cents, and this is the same for both feeder services as well as for the trunk services.&nbsp; The cash fares are higher.&nbsp; For those who do a transfer, they enjoy a 25-cent rebate, that means those who take the feeder bus, they pay 64 cents, but when they transfer, they get a 25-cent rebate from that 64 cents.&nbsp; So, in actual fact, they pay only 39 cents. So the fares are already very low.&nbsp; And the advantage for those on the feeder services is that it is a flat rate. So even though they may travel a longer distance than the first bus fare band, they do not have to pay additional fare, like what those passengers on the trunk service have to pay.&nbsp; I think they are already treated very well, and they are paying a lot lower than what Mr Chiam had feared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng talked about wheelchair-accessible buses.&nbsp; Sir, let me assure Mr Ang that the pace of introduction of the new wheelchair-accessible buses is already very rapid.&nbsp; There is no way that we can&nbsp;change all the buses today, because it would be very wasteful.&nbsp;&nbsp;To try and&nbsp;retrofit the ramps on existing buses would also be very costly.&nbsp; What we are doing is we are going to fit&nbsp;the new buses as they come in with the ramps.&nbsp; The figures show that about 40% of the entire bus fleet will be replaced by those with ramps in the next five years.&nbsp; This works out to about 1,500</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen felt that the current&nbsp;segmentation of categories A and B distorts the allocation of car quotas and it is timely now to amalgamate them into one.&nbsp; Sir, I think the rationale for the current segmentation is still relevant today.&nbsp; The conversion of the COE prices for the two categories in recent years means that actually there is no great benefit to merging them now.&nbsp; There may be a variation of a few hundred dollars, usually.&nbsp; The times when the gap was so big, I think, are very rare.&nbsp; This is because it is hard for us to predict the future preferences for car sizes.&nbsp; For example, consumer preferences may change as fuel prices move up or down, or as big cars become more fuel-efficient, driven by the high fuel prices.&nbsp; More importantly, if the economy booms again, on a sustained basis,&nbsp;the demand for bigger cars may grow.&nbsp; As such, I think preserving the separate categories will safeguard the interest of smaller car buyers and there is, therefore, no immediate need to merge them.&nbsp; But let me assure Dr Wang that my Ministry will continue to monitor the trend and take his views into serious consideration should the recent trends of lower category B prices persist over the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Movements of cargoes involved a lot of manual labour and most of Singapore's early migrants found employment opportunities there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many shipping lines from all over the world called at the port and the economics evolved around it.&nbsp; However, when it came to complex shipping laws and ship financing, as well as insurance, London was the ideal choice for shipowners and those working in the maritime industry.&nbsp; To develop Singapore's international maritime status, the Singapore Maritime Foundation was set up on 5th March 2004.&nbsp; This was established with the assistance of the MPA,&nbsp;with funding from the Government.&nbsp; The SMF is a public-private partnership set up to serve as a forum for the Singapore maritime industry players to exchange ideas, proposals and projects, which the MPA would then follow up with the relevant Government agencies to bring these ideas to fruition.&nbsp; In short, the SMF will serve as Singapore's maritime ambassador, partnering MPA, in promoting Singapore.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister on the result of these initiatives, in particular the following:&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</B> Sir, Singapore is known as among one of the biggest and busiest ports in the world.&nbsp; We succeeded in becoming among the best by not only exploiting our geographical location, building our strength from an entrepot trade by plugging ourselves into the world economy and using every opportunity presented to us to make ourselves relevant to the world, but also in applying modern technologies and the latest management philosophies.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now in the process of enhancing our standing by making Singapore an important international maritime centre.&nbsp; To achieve this, we used a three-pronged strategy.&nbsp; First, we have to attract a core group of shipowners, operators and managers, to base their operations in Singapore.&nbsp; Second, we need to develop the breadth and depth of maritime ancillary services.&nbsp; Third, we have to enhance the operating environment for the maritime business through conducive and responsive regulatory and fiscal policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as in other business enablers and service providers, our objective can only be achieved if we are able to convince the shipowners that, apart from the conveniences offered, they stand to benefit financially by coming to Singapore.&nbsp; This means that Singapore must also offer financial incentives, develop our manpower capacity and market our services world-wide.&nbsp; In this connection, I would like to ask the Minister the following questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to what extent has MOT succeeded in creating the conducive fiscal environment so that more shipping and insurance companies and more shipowners will use Singapore as their base?&nbsp; Second, our approach to manpower development to meet the projected growth in this sector seems to be based more on the demand side.&nbsp; We work hard in stimulating growth for this sector and then work towards providing the manpower needed either by bringing in talent and expertise from abroad or training them locally.&nbsp; The problem with this approach is that it may put our people at a disadvantage as there is always a time lag between the increase in demand and our ability to provide the local manpower. As we may take some time to train our people, an increase in demand for workers in this industry will encourage companies to opt to headhunting or hiring ready-made talent and expertise from abroad, thus depriving our locals from benefiting from it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what plan his Ministry has in ensuring that the setting up of the International Maritime Centre would also provide Singaporeans with a fair share of the employment opportunities?&nbsp; What lesson can we learn from other more successful ports in the world in providing the manpower requirements for their IMC and in marketing our services?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim, you have two cuts.

This is about double today's capacity.&nbsp; The spin-offs to the economy are well-known.&nbsp; Just several&nbsp;years ago, we were rocked by the departures of Maersk and Evergreen.&nbsp; 2005's performance certainly provides relief that we have not only recovered but actually pulled way ahead.&nbsp; However, there should never be a moment of complacency as so much is reliant upon our port doing well and growing.&nbsp; Can I ask what new strategies and additional measures are being implemented to ensure that we stay ahead of our competition and can the Minister give us an outlook of the challenges and opportunities ---&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In 2002, Evergreen Marine Corporation, then the world's second largest shipping company after Maersk, shifted its operation from PSA to PTP.&nbsp; These moves are not the only threats to our ports as there are others in the region as well as Hong Kong which are ready to replace PSA as the premier port.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a tour around PSA last year, I saw the hive of activities at the container port.&nbsp; I was impressed with the improvements done to enlarge the port handling capacity and improvements made to the efficiency of the port operation.&nbsp; I was thus not surprised that for the first month of 2006, PSA overtook Hong Kong as the No. 1 container port in the world.&nbsp; As competition remains high, our port must continue to be sensitive to the needs of shippers so that it will work as a&nbsp;partner with them to serve their customers whose cargoes need to be delivered safely and timely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, Mr Andy Gan asked about PSA's performance.&nbsp; The departures of Maersk in 2000, and Evergreen in 2002 were, indeed, lessons well learnt.&nbsp; Since then, PSA has enhanced its competitive position by continually restructuring cost, raising productivity and, most importantly, responding proactively to its customers' needs.&nbsp; Their efforts have resulted in tangible achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Between 2001 and 2005, PSA's throughput increased by some 40% and PSA has just reported a healthy profit of over S$1.2 billion for the financial year 2005.&nbsp; The Singapore port operations, which contributed the majority of the group's profit, registered a strong increase of 21%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have retained our position as the world's busiest port by vessel tonnage, with total tonnage rising 10% to 1.15 billion gross tonnes.&nbsp; Singapore is also the top bunkering port with bunker sales growing 8% to reach 25.5 million tonnes, double that of our nearest rival.&nbsp; And, notably, Singapore overtook Hong Kong to regain the position as the world's busiest container port, having lost the lead since 1998.&nbsp; The Singapore port itself handled 23.2 million TEUs of containers in 2005.&nbsp; Our throughput growth of almost 9% compares well with the 2% recorded by Hong Kong, 4% by the Port of Tanjong Pelapas and 6% by Port Klang.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If world trade continues to boom and fuel container shipping growth of about 6% per year, we estimate that throughput will probably double in about 12 years' time.&nbsp; For planning purposes, we have therefore made preparations for our ports to have the capacity to handle 50 million TEUs&nbsp;by 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, despite our favourable market position, we cannot take our customers nor our good performance for granted.&nbsp; Regional ports are competing hard to increase their share of the container transhipment business.&nbsp; It is therefore critical that the Marine and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and our port operators work hard to remain competitive.&nbsp; To ensure this, we have adopted three main strategies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we must continually build on and improve our port infrastructure to meet the needs of shipping lines.&nbsp; As mentioned, we are doubling capacity by 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides reclaiming more port land at Pasir Panjang Terminal over the next few years, we are also looking at a number of options to raise capacity beyond the expansion of Pasir Panjang Terminal to meet the longer term growth needs of our ports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we need to ensure that we maintain our edge in operational efficiency, connectivity, as well as cost.&nbsp; For instance, Singapore has launched an integrated platform called the TradeXchange that will provide a single common access to existing trade systems, such as</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>TradeNet, Marinet, PortNet, from October next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, our terminal operators must continue to keep in close touch with their customers and remain responsive to their needs.&nbsp; For example, more shipping lines are now keen to co-invest in dedicated terminals to gain assurance of capacity.&nbsp; Our port operators must allow for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA has already entered into joint ventures with major shipping companies like COSCO and the Mediterranean Shipping Company to operate dedicated terminals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan also asked about the impact of the purchase by Dubai Ports World of P&amp;O ports on PSA's internationalisation efforts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, P&amp;O operates some 29 ports around the world with a strong presence in South Asia, Australia and the US.&nbsp; Acquisition of P&amp;O would have helped PSA expand overseas in new markets amid growing competition in the industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as the bidding for P&amp;O intensified, PSA, after careful consideration, decided that it would not be to its interest to make a higher counter-bid for P&amp;O.&nbsp; There are still many opportunities in the global marketplace of ports.&nbsp; I am sure PSA will continue to be on the lookout for attractive projects to increase its international footprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; On the Government's part, we will continue to closely monitor key industry trends, such as consolidation and vertical integration in the global port and shipping sectors.&nbsp; And where necessary, we will adjust and adapt quickly and flexibly to maintain our port's competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the International Maritime Centre (IMC) itself.&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Andy Gan and Mr Yatiman Yusof have asked about the progress of the IMC, and I am pleased to report that we have made some noteworthy progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, shipowners and operators are the cornerstone of an IMC and they are the primary generators of demand for other maritime ancillary services, such as ship management, shipbroking, marine insurance, finance and legal services.&nbsp; Our fiscal incentive schemes, such as the Singapore Registry of Ships (SRS) and the Approved International Shipping&nbsp;Enterprise (AIS), are therefore designed to encourage a core group of shipowners and operators to set up here in Singapore, and both schemes have had some measure of success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Registry of Ships is now the fifth largest merchant fleet in the world with more than 3,200 vessels totalling 33 million gross tonnes flying the well-respected quality Singapore flag.&nbsp; This is an improvement from our seventh position and an increase of more than 40% since 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the AIS, we have a stable of 68 international shipping groups.&nbsp; In 2005 itself, we registered a strong 50% increase with reputable global players like Norgas Carriers, Teekay Shipping and J Lauritzen joining our cluster.&nbsp; With more reputable names in our maritime fold, our cluster has increased in prominence.&nbsp; AIS companies have committed to generate business spending in excess of $2.5 billion annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It is therefore fitting that the Minister for Finance should announce in this year's Budget that the AIS scheme will be extended by a third 10-year term, bringing the maximum incentive period for qualifying shipping companies to a total of 30 years.&nbsp; This extension will provide shipowners and operators with greater certainty to develop their business in Singapore for the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surge in the Registry tonnage as well as the rise in the number of AIS participants can only mean multiplying effects for the maritime ancillary services.&nbsp; These are, however, uneven across the different ancillary services.&nbsp; Sir, there are some services which are sticky and more resistant to relocation to Singapore, which include financial, insurance and legal services.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Government will continue to direct more efforts at attracting such services here by working closely with industry partners to identify gaps which we can fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim asked about the promotion of ship financing structures.&nbsp; Singapore's growth as a base for shipping companies has also spurred the growth of ship financing activities here.&nbsp; We have already a number of major foreign ship finance banks, but with the slew of new buildings, especially from Asia-based shipowners and an already well developed financial sector in Singapore, there is clearly an opportunity for us to do more and aspire to be Asia's ship financing hub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Maritime Finance Incentive (MFI) will target alternative ship financing structures such as shipping funds and shipping trusts.&nbsp; It provides tax exemption for ship investment vehicles and a 10% concessionary tax rate for ship investment managers.&nbsp; This incentive can bring ship ownership and investment beyond the traditional shipowners to institutional investors and even the investing public.&nbsp; Beyond just adding to the growth of our economy and, in particular, the financial sector, the MFI will make Singapore a more comprehensive one-stop location for all the stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Since the Budget Speech announcement, I am glad to inform the House that we have&nbsp;received positive feedback and strong industry interest in this scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yatiman Yusof also asked about manpower development.&nbsp; Indeed, this is an integral part of our IMC strategy.&nbsp; In 2002, the MPA had set aside $50 million over five years under the Maritime Cluster Fund to give maritime training a boost.&nbsp; To date, we have spent about $24 million on various manpower development programmes and tie-ups with universities and institutions.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Yatiman that these are opportunities open to both Singaporeans and foreigners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, our position as a leading port and maritime centre can only be sustained if we build up capabilities in the area of commercial and technical research.&nbsp; To this end, MPA and NUS have set up the Centre for Maritime Studies to focus on research on maritime business issues in June last year.&nbsp; Maritime R&amp;D received a further boost with the launch of the NOL Fellowship Fund to fund research in key transportation and logistics issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong Kian Min raised a question on how our local shipping SMEs will fit into the plan to develop Singapore as an IMC.&nbsp; I wish to assure Mr Ong that both SMEs and global shipping groups are very important complementary components of our IMC strategy.&nbsp; SMEs in fact make up the majority of companies in the maritime services sector performing critical functions in areas such as ship agency and crewing, bunkering and ship chandling, just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the IMC in Singapore grows, SMEs will also benefit from the larger market and expertise brought in by international shipping groups.&nbsp; Singapore shipping SMEs are therefore well placed to grow into world-beating companies.&nbsp; One such example is Pacific International Lines (PIL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, as we strive to develop as a world-class maritime centre, our aspirations must be greater than just being fast followers of others, but leaders in research,&nbsp;industry development and public-private collaboration and partnership.&nbsp; In this regard, the Singapore Maritime Foundation plays an extremely important role in terms of facilitating networking amongst different sub-sectors, profiling the industry as well as leadership in marketing and promotion efforts overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the advantage, Sir, of being along a major maritime trade route between India and China, and in the heart of South East Asia with a first-class hub port and a growing and vibrant maritime community.&nbsp; Singapore is well known for being a predictable, efficient and quality business environment.&nbsp; These are qualities which appeal to the maritime business, given the capital intensive requirements and the long term and cyclical nature of the industry where players seek to minimise sovereign risk arising from the changes in tax or regulatory policies.&nbsp; Singapore would be well placed to be the maritime hub of Asia.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Air Transport</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> <B>Mr Ong Kian Min:</B> Sir, on air transport, I am pleased that, notwithstanding Changi Airport's record performance last year, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore continues to be proactive in anchoring airlines at Changi through various incentives.&nbsp; These include generous financial incentives for airlines, a dedicated Budget Terminal and upgrading of our existing passenger terminals, just to name a few.&nbsp; All these moves put us in good stead to capitalise on the rise of China and India, the growing trend of budget travel in the region and ASEAN's progressive move towards open skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop of liberal civil aviation policy and open skies, many Singaporeans are extremely disappointed, to say the least, by the Australian government's decision to defer Singapore Airlines' entry to the Pacific route.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether we had been misled by the Australian government officials during the negotiations on our Free Trade Agreement, the Air Services Agreement or otherwise and had given away too much.&nbsp; Secondly, had we gone out of our way to accommodate the Australian airline, Qantas, by granting&nbsp;it all the necessary operating freedoms in Singapore?&nbsp; Thirdly, what other ammunition or leverage do we have to force an opening of the Pacific route in the near future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, regardless of Australia's decision, I believe we should continue to adopt a liberal aviation policy to grow Changi's hub position and not succumb to the temptation to engage in a tit-for-tat.&nbsp; To protect our national carrier in the way Australia has decided to do would work&nbsp;to&nbsp;our detriment rather than to the benefit of Singapore's economy in the long term.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

How are the plans progressing on exploring the possibility to negotiate for open skies agreement with these countries and others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Australia's rejection to allow SIA permission to fly beyond its eastern states to the United States of America, what is the Ministry of Transport's next move to overcome this set-back?&nbsp; This disappointing and inward-looking decision by Australia to block SIA from its Pacific route does not bode well for good business relationship between the two countries built up over years of goodwill and friendship.&nbsp; While Qantas and Jetstar have the right to fly to and beyond Singapore, this advantage accorded has obviously been ignored by Australia to the detriment of its bilateral relationship with us where fair play and free competition are the cornerstones of good economic relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has given the fifth freedom rights freely while others seem to be guarding theirs jealously.&nbsp; Our generosity in offering the fifth freedom rights to Qantas has been taken for granted and unfairly taken advantage of, especially when half of Qantas' flights travel beyond our shores.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that Singapore is Australia's largest trade and investment partner in South East Asia.&nbsp; And in the year 2005, bilateral trade between the two countries was worth A$8 billion.&nbsp; Changi Airport's Terminal 3 refurbishment costing S$2 billion was designed by an Australian architect firm, Woodhead International.&nbsp; All these do not seem to matter when it comes to SIA seeking to fly and compete fairly along the routes from Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge the Australian government to rethink its stand on blocking SIA from this route, as the flying public of both countries will benefit economically from having more choices of airlines and prospect of competitive fares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</B> Sir, I am very indignant, not at our Minister for Transport or our Government, but at the Australian government and&nbsp;their Minister for Transport for turning down Singapore Airlines' air rights to ply the trans-Pacific route between Australia and the US.&nbsp; The manner in which it was turned down was also very suspect.&nbsp; According to Australian Senator, Kerry O'Brien, who is the Labour's spokesman for transport, there was no transparency.&nbsp; It was a closed-door review and it was described by him as \"shambles\".\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons given were far from convincing.&nbsp; Truss, who is the Minister for Transport, for example, said that it would be better to allow their own budget airline, Virgin Blue, to come in, and that would increase competition.&nbsp; Sad to say, Virgin Blue, as the name suggests, is still untried when it comes to flying the trans-Pacific route.&nbsp; Truss himself said that the carrier might be ready to fly in 2007. At the moment, it lacks planes; it has absolutely no infrastructure and it was last reported in the <I>Australian</I> that it was going to come&nbsp;up with a concept plan for flying this route.&nbsp; Qantas probably prefers competition of this type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am sure that many Members of this House</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B> First, let me thank Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Andy Gan and Prof. Chin Tet Yung for their remarks on our attempts to get an open skies agreement (OSA) with Australia.&nbsp; Sir, I fully understand and appreciate their strong disappointment over Australia's decision to continue denying SIA the right to fly the trans-Pacific route.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Members are aware, we have been holding talks with Australia on the OSA for the last 10 years.&nbsp; Despite the delays and postponements that took place during this extended period,&nbsp;we have reasons to be confident, especially over the past three years, that we would be able to achieve progress on this.&nbsp; At the same time, the Government has, in good faith, unconditionally facilitated and encouraged the growth of Qantas Airways and&nbsp;its associate in Singapore, Jetstar Asia, at Changi Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong and other Members have asked whether we have been misled by Australia.&nbsp; Let me explain the developments in our discussion with&nbsp;our Australian counterparts.&nbsp; On more than one occasion, there were clear indications by senior Australian leaders that both sides would work towards concluding an OSA.&nbsp; Our understanding was that the issue was largely one of working out an acceptable roadmap for the OSA to be phased in, taking into account the impact on Qantas.&nbsp; This was in fact agreed between the then Australian Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, and&nbsp;I when we met in Canberra in February last year.&nbsp;This was also widely reported in the mass media.&nbsp; We had, therefore, in good faith, expected the Australian government to honour its words and were hopeful that this issue would be resolved within a reasonable timeframe.&nbsp; However, this latest decision suggests that the Australian government has abandoned any commitment to work towards an OSA with Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore and Australia share very similar strategic and economic outlooks.&nbsp; We cooperate extensively in many areas, including education, trade, defence and security.&nbsp; We signed&nbsp;a Free Trade Agreement in 2003 which has augmented our trade relations and people-to-people flows.&nbsp;It was also affirmed in the FTA&nbsp;the commitment of both countries to achieve an OSA within a reasonable timeframe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the bilateral relationship is therefore a close and mutually beneficial one.&nbsp; We are confident that it will strengthen in the years ahead.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the absence of an OSA means that the full potential of this partnership may not be realised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong has asked whether we have done the right thing in being helpful and generous to Qantas in Singapore, and what leverage remains for us.&nbsp; As some Members have observed, we have already granted Qantas substantial fifth freedom rights in Singapore and no longer have this as a bargaining chip.&nbsp; But what we have done is the right thing.&nbsp; We must not lose sight of our main goals, which are to grow the Singapore economy and our Changi aviation hub.&nbsp; This means placing national interest over the interest of any Singapore carriers.&nbsp; SIA has had to compete openly against all the foreign airlines that we have opened our doors to. This policy has forced SIA to constantly improve its service quality, product offering in order to stay ahead. In the process,&nbsp;its customers have benefited immensely, and so has SIA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, open competition is always in the consumers' interest.&nbsp; For instance, the entry of low-cost carriers and the competitive response of full-service carriers have reduced airfares and widened travel choices.&nbsp; This contributed to our record&nbsp;nine million visitor arrivals last year, a 7% growth.&nbsp; They generated close to $11 billion in tourism receipts.&nbsp; Had we adopted a protectionist stance, our economy would have lost out, fewer jobs would have been created and Singapore would not be&nbsp;the vibrant tourism and business hub it is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Australian government has made its decision.&nbsp; It is a decision we have to respect. And we have to move on. We will continue to hold discussions with other partner countries to enhance our air links with them.&nbsp; In the meantime, we already have a reservoir of available air rights with many other countries that SIA and other Singapore carriers can make use of to achieve future growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Gan and Mr Ong asked whether we are negotiating for more routes and&nbsp;air rights for SIA and our other carriers.&nbsp; Let me assure them that we are.&nbsp; For this year, we will be discussing with several countries, and with our ASEAN partners, on additional air rights.&nbsp; In addition, the ASEAN Transport Ministers at our last meeting agreed on a roadmap that includes the lifting of all restrictions on passenger flights between ASEAN capitals by 2008.&nbsp; We have asked our senior officials to study this further and to accelerate the milestones of the roadmap and&nbsp;extend the proposal to go beyond capital cities to other points within ASEAN.&nbsp; Our aim is to have an open skies in ASEAN to realise the full vision of the ASEAN Economic Community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">4.36 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Wee asked about what we are doing to help the maintenance and repair and overhaul (MRO) industry in Singapore.&nbsp; As Mr Wee has observed, the promotion of such industries comes under MTI.&nbsp; But we do work with MTI and EDB very closely on developing the whole sector as an industry that we want to develop in Singapore.&nbsp; My Ministry performs a regulatory role and what we do is that we try to ensure that we have a conducive regulatory environment for the growth of this industry in Singapore.&nbsp; Let me tell him what we are doing in some areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, CAAS helps to open the overseas markets for the MROs by entering into agreements with other aviation authorities, to mutually recognise the work done by&nbsp;the MROs on foreign aircraft and&nbsp;aircraft components.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, CAAS has been working with SIA and&nbsp;our other MROs on&nbsp;the servicing of new aircraft types, including the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will further expand their potential customer base.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we will earmark additional airport land to support related activities such as airframe maintenance, business and general aviation, and small aircraft assembly.&nbsp; This will enable our aerospace industry to ride on the growing demand from low-cost carriers and the potential growth of business aviation in Asia.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head&nbsp;N of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Southeast Asia is on&nbsp;the strategic consideration of every major superpower. Because of vital sea routes, abundant natural resources and the rising political and economic importance of ASEAN,&nbsp;every great power wants to engage the region and Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, the hustling and bustling to bring Southeast Asia into their respective spheres of influence&nbsp;are ongoing and apparent.&nbsp; In the light of this competing interest and long-term ambitions of these big superpowers, I would like to ask the Minister (a) how he intends to position Singapore in the emerging regional geo-political architecture; (b) how the Government intends to engage the major powers to enhance the region as a region of peace, stability and economic prosperity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, I would like to ask the Minister for his assessment of the regional outlook in the short term and&nbsp;medium term, and the potential events that can derail the positive developments taking place in the region. There are also other countries and big powers that would like to engage Singapore. In particular, I would like to highlight the following countries.&nbsp; China and India will emerge as great superpowers in another 20 to 50 years.&nbsp; It will mean that there will be a greater flow of people, investments and greater engagement between these two countries and Singapore.&nbsp; We have already signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India and we are now in the process of negotiating one with China.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how he intends to engage these two emerging giants of Asia and what steps will be taken to strengthen the already good relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Sir, we enjoy good relations with the US and, last year, we signed the strategic framework agreement with the US.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how we can go on to enhance our relationship and continue to engage the US in the region and with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next region I would like to ask the Minister for an assessment is the Middle East.&nbsp; The Middle East has already entered our radar screen as a region of great economic importance and, as a region, we can engage as part of the future architecture of a vibrant and prosperous Asia.&nbsp; The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process was a good start and I would like to ask the Minister how he intends to take our relations with the Middle Eastern countries, particularly the Gulf countries, to the next level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the EU continues to be a group of great importance to Singapore and the region.&nbsp; While as a region, relations could be better if not for the Myanmar issue, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the state of relations between Singapore and the EU, and the same between ASEAN and EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on Russia.&nbsp; Russia is a great power with a long history of presence and engagement in Asia.&nbsp; Recently, our Minister Mentor, Mr Lee, visited Russia and I think relations have now come up to a better level.&nbsp;Russia has a large land mass in Asia and&nbsp;has&nbsp;strategic and political interests in Asia.&nbsp;

This vision was further reinforced at the ASEAN Bali Summit in 2003 where three key pillars were laid out for ASEAN's move towards the ASEAN Vision 2020:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Political instability and frequent changes in political leaders in various ASEAN countries have made it difficult for ASEAN to have a stable and sustainable leadership to spearhead or implement its plans.&nbsp; The ASEAN principles of non-interference in the domestic affairs of its member countries and consensus decision-making processes further reduce its effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless there is political will among ASEAN leaders to quickly develop an operating framework for the achievement of its vision, I am pessimistic that ASEAN's Vision 2020 will be realised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, there are mixed feelings about the success of the Summit among many political analysts.&nbsp; Sir, analyst Mohan Malik, in&nbsp;the <I>Yale Global</I> dated 20th December 2005, commented:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Instead of creating a common bond, the first Summit may have intensified old strategic rivalries and forced smaller nations to choose sides.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the eve of the Summit, China proposed dividing EAS members into core and secondary countries, and Chinese and Korean leaders refused to hold bilateral or trilateral talks with their Japanese counterparts.&nbsp; China's stance provides insights into Beijing's insecurities regarding the momentum for a broader East Asian Community, shifting power alignments within Asia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the Summit, it was decided that the ASEAN+3 (APT)&nbsp;group will be the vehicle for realising the dreams of forming the East Asian Community.&nbsp; While I am happy that ASEAN will be the hub of the EAS and the key driver within the APT, I wonder whether the non-APT partners will share the same enthusiasm and support for the EAS in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, China and many other diplomats have also suggested that anyone with interests in the Pacific, ie, Russia and perhaps the USA, could eventually take part in the EAS.&nbsp; Such a move would make the EAS indistinguishable from the ARF or APEC, and I would like to ask the Minister what is the impact of the EAS on the ARF and APEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the absence of great power cooperation, ie, between the Chinese and the Japanese, the Koreans and Japan, and between China and India, it looks like the EAS will have difficulty taking off.&nbsp; If at all, EAS seems to have intensified old rivalries.&nbsp; If such rivalries continue, there is every risk that the community-building exercise would be fatally compromised.&nbsp; At best, the EAS may just emerge as another talk-shop like APEC or ARF, where leaders meet, declarations are made, but little community-building is achieved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With Malaysia, we have several outstanding issues.&nbsp; There is the package of items under negotiation.&nbsp; Notably, lately, the issue of the bridge to replace the Causeway was raised in the newspapers by the Malaysian press again.&nbsp; It was variously called the \"crooked bridge\", then&nbsp;the \"scenic bridge\", and then, famously, now called&nbsp;the \"cynic bridge\" by Dr Mahathir, former Prime Minister of Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;But more seriously, Sir, there is also&nbsp;the current on-going international arbitration being conducted on our ownership of the Horsburgh Lighthouse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to give us an update and&nbsp;assessment of the above outstanding issues with Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to state that whatever is the state of the physical bridge between Singapore and Malaysia, what is more important is the state of the mental bridge between the two countries.&nbsp; If there is no mental connect between the two countries, then however beautiful a physical bridge that we build will not be effective to link up the peoples from these two countries.&nbsp; This is a pity, as our two countries are so closely related by history, family ties and emotions, and there is so much that we can do and work together for the mutual benefit of our respective peoples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the bridge is to facilitate the movement of people and to enable more Singaporeans to visit Johor and other parts of Malaysia, then one important aspect I wish to remind the Malaysian and Johor state government is the state of security in Johor.&nbsp; If the safety and personal security in Johor is not improved, no matter how excellent or scenic a bridge we build, Singaporeans will be hesitant to visit Johor and spend time and money there.&nbsp; We read constantly about the spate of robberies,&nbsp;high-speed highway chases, car thefts, snatch thefts and other threats against the lives and safety of Singaporeans visiting Johor and other parts of Malaysia.&nbsp; If security is not improved in Malaysia, especially in Johor, Singaporeans will still be very wary of visiting Malaysia, irrespective of the bridge that we build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Indonesia, our Minister Mentor, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, recently visited this country.&nbsp; Relations with Indonesia have improved over the years.&nbsp; It is a very large country with very important ties with us.&nbsp;

Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), who won the general elections in 1990 and&nbsp;has been denied its legitimate right to take power by the ruling military regime, has been in detention for the past few years.&nbsp; And, recently, it was announced that her detention will be further extended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Myanmar government has convened a national convention to draft a new Constitution to pave the way for the new elections, many observers point to the whole thing as a fuss because the NLD is not allowed to participate.&nbsp; In fact, speeches to be made at the Convention have to be cleared by the authorities and criticisms of the government will not be allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Myanmar government's sudden and ill-prepared move to a new capital, Pyinmana last month without informing anyone, its own people and its neighbours included, shows how secretive and isolated its rulers have become.&nbsp; The continued state of affairs in Myanmar constitutes a threat to ASEAN's safety and security and continues to undermine the credibility of the organisation.&nbsp; As an example, it has been reported that the government there spends only US$22,000 a year to fight an increasing HIV-AIDs epidemic. Can you imagine what it would be like if&nbsp;a bird flu pandemic were to break out over there and you get the government there, which is ineffectual and unwilling to cooperate with its neighbours?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myanmar consistently becomes an obstacle in ASEAN's dealings with the rest of the international community.&nbsp; Many other countries had threatened to boycott ASEAN dialogue meetings if Myanmar had insisted on being the Chairman this year. As a parliamentarian, I too have encountered difficulties each time I meet my counterparts from other countries, especially those from Europe.&nbsp; Inevitably, a major part of the time of our discussions is spent dealing with questions about Myanmar, instead of on more substantive issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what can be done now?&nbsp; I think ASEAN has to continue to hold Myanmar to the promise it has made to commence genuine political reforms which includes national integration of its diverse ethnic groups and the release of political prisoners. We have to up the ante.&nbsp; If there is no credible move by Myanmar, ASEAN must be prepared to consider alternatives. The first would be to get Myanmar to voluntarily take leave of absence from the organisation, which is of course a face-saving measure. Secondly, ASEAN should suspend its membership for an indefinite period of time.&nbsp; And, thirdly, which is the most severe move of all, terminate its membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASEAN is drafting a charter and it can use this opportunity to define what it expects from its members.&nbsp; Myanmar has to be made to realise that its road to democracy must be a real one and it must bring about a&nbsp;better life for its people.&nbsp; We all look forward to its people obtaining their legitimate right to democracy and freedom, though I must add here that it should not necessarily be the kind we now see in some other Southeast Asian countries where democracy, unfortunately, has been taken to mean fluctuating between people demonstrating on the streets and the threat of military coups.&nbsp; I think that would just result in further political turmoils.&nbsp; What we all desire to see is a strong Myanmar that is politically stable, bringing happiness and prosperity to its people so that it can once again contribute meaningfully to ASEAN and hold its head up high in the international community.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Middle East</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</B>&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, the current focus of attention appears to be towards the awakening and growth of China and India, which is quite valid.&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;strongly believe that the Middle East is another economic&nbsp;block that we should devote some attention to develop better foreign relations as well as economic relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several Middle Eastern countries that are aiming to modernise.&nbsp; Many are blessed with oil, providing continuing future growth. &nbsp;Notably, these more progressive countries or states are Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bahrain as well as many others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe there are several Middle Eastern countries with oil wealth&nbsp;looking towards making substantial investments around the world. The recent bid of US$6.8 billion or S$11 billion by Dubai Ports&nbsp;World for the British based, Peninsular and Oriental (P&amp;O) Shipping Company, for ports in the US is an example.&nbsp; As we know, Dubai, in fact, out-bidded Singapore's PSA for P&amp;O.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Middle Eastern countries are keen to use their oil money to acquire businesses and assets in foreign countries.&nbsp; Today, we read in the <I>Business Times</I> about Dubai International Capital (DIC) planning to raise a total of US$15 billion to invest in international companies.&nbsp; I think it is ideal to encourage Middle Eastern countries to look East, actually, more precisely, Far East.&nbsp; Singapore could be an interesting investment&nbsp;locality&nbsp;for Middle Eastern countries. &nbsp;We have a large population of Muslims and, therefore, our lifestyle in Singapore can easily accommodate the needs of the Muslims from the Middle East, in terms of food, mosques for praying, housing and other needs.&nbsp; Moreover, Singapore can serve as their bridge to venture into other countries in the Southeast Asian region as well as towards China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been many ministerial and business missions conducted by Singapore to various countries in the Middle East in the past few years.&nbsp; The MFA could work with MTI, IE Singapore and other Singapore business groups to promote investments and foster better foreign relations with certain countries in the Middle East.&nbsp; Therefore, I wish to hear from the Minister what are his Ministry's initiatives and foreign relations effort directed at the Middle East.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</B> Sir, it has been two years since we engage countries in the Middle East intensely.&nbsp; Since then, there&nbsp;have been many high level contacts and our businessmen and companies have made in-road into various economic activities there.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Middle East offers vast opportunities for our businessmen but the fact is that there is&nbsp;still a lot that we have yet to learn about the region.&nbsp; To engage and reach out to the new partners, like those in the Middle East, we need to develop friendship at all levels and know more about their language, culture and religion. We need to encourage Singaporeans to learn Arabic, travel there and feel the pulse of the society there and learn about how they do business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the interest in the new relationship is not one-sided. Countries in that region seem to want to engage and work with Singapore too.

China needs the US market; China values US investment; China also holds hundreds of billions of dollars in US financial instruments.&nbsp; And without China's cooperation, it is more difficult for the US to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to fight the war against terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US and China are now engaged in a strategic dialogue.&nbsp; They are cooperating on the problem of proliferation in North Korea and Iran.&nbsp; From a strategic competitor, the US now describes China as a \"responsible stakeholder\" in the global system.&nbsp; When US Deputy Secretary of State, Robert Zoellick hugged pandas in Chengdu recently, he&nbsp;was sending a signal of the way the US is seeing China.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key issue in Sino-US relations is Taiwan, as pointed out by Mr Hawazi.&nbsp; Because President Bush has taken a clear position on One China, it is difficult for pro-independence forces in Taiwan to win support.&nbsp; It is important for the Taiwan issue to be handled properly because of the importance of good US-China relations to regional and indeed global stability.&nbsp; The recent move to cease the function of the National Unification Council and the application of its Guidelines is worrying.&nbsp; It goes against earlier undertakings and will cause cross-strait tensions to rise unnecessarily.&nbsp; In the interest of regional stability, we hope that this issue will be handled with wisdom and restraints&nbsp;by Taiwan, China and the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as US-China relations are managed well, the prospects for continuing peace and development in East Asia are good.&nbsp; In Kuala Lumpur last December, the first East Asia Summit (EAS) was convened.&nbsp; In addition to the 10 countries of ASEAN and the three countries of Northeast Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand were also included.&nbsp; As Mr Ravindran pointed out, the East Asia Summit is driven by ASEAN.&nbsp; We included India, Australia and New Zealand to make sure that ASEAN is at the centre and the group is clearly outward-oriented and inclusive.&nbsp; The first meeting went well.&nbsp; The Leaders of the 16 member countries have agreed to meet annually.&nbsp; It will take time for us to develop an agenda and we must now work hard to shape it and to do this&nbsp;in a way which does not&nbsp;cause the Americans or Europeans to think that we want to exclude them.&nbsp;There will be many issues to discuss which involve all of us because the entire continent is in ferment.&nbsp; Obvious issues would be maritime security, the war against terror, energy supplies and, of course, economic connectivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries in the East Asia Summit&nbsp;make up half the world's population.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Mr Hawazi was right to point to the economic potential of this region to the global economy, which will have a combined GDP which is likely to be&nbsp;greater than that of the US or Europe in, let us say,&nbsp;20 years' time.&nbsp;&nbsp;China and India are emerging as two new poles in the global economy.&nbsp; As they engage more with each other, politically and economically, we must make sure that ASEAN's interests are taken into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran referred to an article written by Mr Malik.&nbsp; I read that article and I think that it is not quite objective in the way he has portrayed China's role in the EAS.&nbsp; Yes, he was right that China had a different view of it initially, but once China realised that ASEAN had its own consensus, they were quite prepared to go along, and I believe China will play a positive role in the EAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, ASEAN can only play an active role in this entire process if we ourselves are united.&nbsp; I appreciate the points made by Mr Ravindran, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Hawazi that ASEAN must get its act together.&nbsp; At the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Leaders appointed an Eminent Persons Group (EPG) to recommend what steps we should take to integrate ASEAN economically, politically and socially beyond what we are already doing.&nbsp; The Chair is Mr Musa Hitam, former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, and our own representative is Prof. Jayakumar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need political will to achieve the ASEAN 2020 Vision mentioned by Dr Teo and Mr Ravindran.&nbsp; It is not enough just to have meetings, which there are already too many&nbsp;in ASEAN. This year's Summit in Manila will be critical because the EPG will be presenting its recommendations to the Leaders.&nbsp; Once the Leaders agree on the main points, ministers and officials will draw up an ASEAN Charter which will then become the constitutional basis of our future development.&nbsp; Some hard decisions have to be made as to how we achieve consensus, whether we are always dragged back by the slowest amongst us, whether we are prepared to subject disputes to third party panels for resolution.&nbsp; I hope that some progress would be made by the time Singapore hosts the ASEAN Summit in 2007, which&nbsp;is the 40th Anniversary of ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myanmar might be a problem.&nbsp; As Mr Tan Soo Khoon lamented, the&nbsp;developments in that country are a cause for concern.&nbsp; To insulate ASEAN, the Myanmar government had agreed to give up the ASEAN Chair this year.&nbsp; That has been helpful.&nbsp; Because internal developments in Myanmar are sometimes a mystery to us, like the sudden bizarre decision to shift the seat of government from Yangon to Pyinmana, it has become more and more difficult for ASEAN to defend Myanmar at the UN and other international forums.&nbsp; Despite calls by ASEAN, and as Mr Tan Soo Khoon recounted, Aung San Suu Kyi remains, for a long time, under house arrest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Kuala Lumpur last December, the Myanmar Prime Minister agreed to receive Malaysia's Foreign Minister Syed Hamid as an ASEAN envoy on a fact-finding visit.&nbsp; Unfortunately, till today, no date has been set for his visit.&nbsp; When ASEAN Foreign Ministers meet in Bali in April, I expect some hard decisions to be made on ASEAN's approach towards Myanmar.&nbsp; If Myanmar needs time out to attend to its own domestic preoccupations, I think we should respect it but, at the same time, the rest of ASEAN should not be held back.&nbsp; But, should we, as Mr Tan suggested, expel Myanmar from ASEAN?&nbsp; Of course, Mr Tan put it politely in the form of options.&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;look at the strategic picture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago, when Burma received its independence from Britain, it decided not to join the Indian Union.&nbsp; In fact, it was clear from the beginning that&nbsp;it was part of Southeast Asia.&nbsp; But it remains a buffer state between China and India.&nbsp; China has decided that whatever happens in Yangon, the back-gate to China would be wide open.&nbsp; And, because of that, India, in its own strategic calculations, has decided that it will keep its side-gate to Myanmar open.&nbsp; So, this month, President Abdul Kalam will visit Myanmar.&nbsp; Because these two gates are wide open, the Western embargo against Myanmar is not going to work.&nbsp; The country has fertile soil, rice is plentiful, the sea&nbsp;teems with fish.&nbsp; It is in our interest to ensure&nbsp;that we stay engaged with Myanmar, that our own gate to Myanmar is open.&nbsp; But what happens to that country is a source of concern.&nbsp; So, I think, let us just take a realistic approach.&nbsp; We are in no position to affect the course of internal developments.&nbsp; Whatever happens there, good or bad, it is for the Myanmar people to bear the consequences.&nbsp; But I think we will have to distance ourselves a bit&nbsp;if it is not possible for them to engage us in a way which&nbsp;enables us&nbsp;to defend them internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the impact of recent political developments in the Philippines and Thailand on ASEAN, a point alluded to by Mr Tan and mentioned by Dr Ong Chit Chung, we have to wait and see.&nbsp; Although some Filipinos, including former President Fidel Ramos, have objected to the declaration of a State of Emergency in the Philippines, it is not for us to second guess President Arroyo's decision when she faces a rebellion by a segment of the Philippine Army.&nbsp; However, I do not expect any change to the Philippines hosting the ASEAN Summit and the EAS at the end of this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the protests against Prime Minister Thaksin in Bangkok, a concern raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung, we hope that fresh elections will bring some finality to the debate of the last few weeks.&nbsp; Has Singapore companies been affected?&nbsp; Not so far from the reports that I have read.&nbsp; When the leader of the Democratic Party, Mr Abhisit,&nbsp;was in Singapore a few weeks ago, he said that their actions against Prime Minister Thaksin were not directed against Singapore.&nbsp; So, on the whole, I would say that Singapore-Thai relations have not been adversely affected by the recent developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;share Dr Ong's concern about the situation in Southern Thailand.&nbsp; The Muslim problem in the southern provinces has deep roots and has to be managed with that history in mind.&nbsp; It has affected Thailand's relationship with Malaysia.&nbsp; This is not good for ASEAN.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the whole, while keeping our fingers crossed, we can be optimistic about the future of ASEAN and I do not quite share Dr Teo Ho Pin's pessimism.&nbsp; As a group, we are doing well economically.&nbsp; Investor confidence in Indonesia is gradually returning.&nbsp; President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is determined to improve the business environment and we see progress in various part of the archipelago.&nbsp; In Aceh, the tsunami disaster has brought some good in the form of a peace agreement with GAM. If we look elsewhere, Vietnam is now the fastest growing economy in ASEAN.&nbsp; ASEAN countries have no choice but to draw closer&nbsp;in the face of China's and India's emergence as regional superpowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Japan's complicated relationship with China, there is a strong desire on the part of Japanese businesses to adopt a China plus One&nbsp;strategy.&nbsp; What we want is to make sure that the&nbsp;plus One is&nbsp;ASEAN.&nbsp; &nbsp;ASEAN can provide an alternative manufacturing base for Japanese companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore signed an economic agreement with Vietnam last year which will help Vietnam tap on Singapore's international connectivity until such time as Vietnam is able to establish its own.&nbsp; Keidanren is interested to make use of this agreement to help Japanese companies invest in Vietnam using Singapore as a complementary hub.&nbsp; I was cheered this morning to read that Intel has decided to invest in a US$300 million facility outside Ho Chi Minh City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to bilateral relations with our immediate neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and answer the questions raised by Mr Leong Horn Kee and Dr Ong Chit Chung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relations with Malaysia are good. They rest on a bedrock of common history and common interest.&nbsp; We have only to see the way the two Police Forces have cooperated on the Tan Chor Jin case recently.&nbsp; Within a few hours they were on his trail and now he is being extradited back to Singapore.&nbsp; So there are many things going on, which can only go on because of very good relations between counterpart departments on both sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January this year, the Agong made a state visit to Singapore - the first such visit after 18 years.&nbsp; Bilateral trade and investments have also picked up considerably on both sides of the Causeway. Yes, negotiations on the full bridge are still ongoing.&nbsp; The fourth round of negotiation has just ended on Monday. &nbsp;A fifth round of talks is tentatively scheduled for this month.&nbsp; These negotiations have made progress towards an appropriate balance of benefits for both sides.&nbsp; However, as negotiations are now in a delicate stage, it would not be useful for me to publicise the details.&nbsp; As for the low hanging fruits mentioned by Dr Ong Chit Chung, well, some are on our trees and some are on their trees and we have got to decide what is the correct balance fruits to be plucked, otherwise no fruits can be plucked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to earlier reports about moves to build a half-bridge on the Malaysia side, Wisma Putra has clarified to us in a TPN that Malaysia remained committed to negotiations for a full bridge and only soil studies are being conducted.&nbsp; We have explained to Malaysia the serious implications of a unilateral move by Malaysia to demolish its side of the causeway and replace it by a crooked bridge, however&nbsp;scenic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Pedra Branca, a question asked by Mr Leong Horn Kee, the case before the ICJ is expected to be heard in 2007.&nbsp; Both sides have already put in their written submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for security in Johore, a question raised by Mr Leong Horn Kee, I should just say that Johore leaders themselves are aware of this problem and have said publicly that they are giving it their full attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Malaysia, our overall relationship with Indonesia has improved significantly since a year ago.&nbsp; In the coming year, we can expect our economic cooperation with Indonesia to gather momentum.&nbsp; As Members are aware, Singapore is also working with Indonesia on combating avian flu through a pilot project in Tanggerang, which is a Kabupaten next to Jakarta. A multilateral meeting is right now&nbsp;being held in Singapore,&nbsp;involving officials from Singapore, the US, Indonesia&nbsp;and international agencies.&nbsp; We are also going to open a consulate in the new province of Kepulauan Riau, Kepri,&nbsp;which consists of the islands of the Riaus, all the way up to Natunas. Negotiations for an extradition treaty, defence cooperation and counter-terrorism are being carried out in parallel, and making good progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee asked about our relations with India and China and what impact their rise will have on our relationship with the US and Japan.&nbsp;This was also touched upon by Mr Ravindran.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a year ago, our relationship with both India and China has improved appreciably.&nbsp; It is our national strategy to engage both of them deeply and comprehensively and position ourselves for the growing trade between them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in Delhi which raised our relationship with India to a new level.&nbsp; In a nutshell, what CECA does is to restore in some respects the old position of the British Raj when trade between India and Singapore flowed freely, when standards were common,&nbsp;and professionals like doctors, accountants and engineers were able to move back and forth freely,&nbsp;operating within the same legal and regulatory framework.&nbsp; Our bilateral trade with India has been growing rapidly.&nbsp; Last year, it jumped 41%. For much of the 19th century, the largest trading partner of British India was, in fact, Qing Dynasty, China.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was established by the East India Company for the China trade and grew on it.&nbsp; Well, in this century, there will be a new China trade which will benefit us immensely.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>The flow we are now seeing will become a flood.&nbsp; Already, within a few years, China will again be India's largest trading partner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore encourage more Singaporeans to visit and understand India.&nbsp; India is not homogeneous. Conditions vary from state to state and from city to city.&nbsp; But the country on the whole is growing. I just read Finance Minister Chidambaram's budget speech.&nbsp; They are expecting 8%&nbsp;growth this year, and he said double digit growth for India is now within reach.&nbsp; He is an old friend.&nbsp; And when he was Finance Minister some years ago, I remember him making his budget speech at that time, and he said, \"at a stretch, 7%.\"&nbsp; Now he is talking about double digits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be an effective partner of India, we need deep knowledge and this requires effort on our part.&nbsp; We will be upgrading our representation in Mumbai and Chennai and will be helping India to develop&nbsp;a Special Economic Zone. And we must also make full use of the Indian expatriate community in Singapore, which is growing. &nbsp;President Abdul Kalam's visit to Singapore in January this year symbolised the growing links between our two countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our China account is also growing nicely.&nbsp; Bilateral relations are back on track and picking up speed. We will increase our consular presence in China, opening new consulates in Guangzhou and Chengdu. We have also upgraded our representation in Shanghai.&nbsp; Last year, the Chairman of China's National People's Congress, Wu Bangguo, and Vice Premier Wu Yi visited Singapore.&nbsp; In October, PM Lee had a very good introductory visit to China as Prime Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Singapore-China FTA, both Prime Ministers&nbsp;agreed that it would benefit both countries in the long term and facilitate regional cooperation and integration.&nbsp; A Joint Expert group will be formed soon to look into this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in Singapore's interest to have both India and China engage all of ASEAN and not just Singapore alone.&nbsp; For this reason, we have pushed hard for the conclusion of ASEAN's FTAs with them and to bring everyone&nbsp; together under the umbrella of the EAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for both Singapore and ASEAN, it is important that we also strengthen our links to the US, Japan and Europe at the same time.&nbsp; The continued strategic presence of the US in Asia helps us to maintain peace in the region, even as it goes through rapid transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's links with the US are excellent.&nbsp; Last year, we signed a Strategic Framework Agreement which strengthens security cooperation.&nbsp; The US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement has strengthened our competitive position, particularly our attractiveness as a hub for intellectual property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASEAN's relationship with the US has also improved.&nbsp; As Mr Ravindran pointed out, an Enhanced Partnership Agreement was mooted last year setting the stage for a summit meeting between President Bush and the Leaders of APEC's ASEAN members in Busan.&nbsp; At the coming APEC meeting in Hanoi, it is likely that another such summit will be held.&nbsp; US officials are already talking about this becoming an annual Summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Mr Hawazi about Japan, Japan is indeed another important player in the region and a strong partner of Singapore.&nbsp; With renewed growth of the Japanese economy, which we should remember is still more than twice the size of the Chinese economy, it behooves us to engage Japan more deeply.&nbsp; Singapore's links with Japan have never been better.&nbsp; This June,&nbsp; the Japanese Emperor and Empress will make a state visit to Singapore.&nbsp; This is the first ever State visit by a Japanese Emperor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Mr Ravindran and Dr Warren Lee, our relationship with Europe is good.&nbsp; PM Lee had interesting meetings with both President Chirac and Chancellor Merkel during his official visits to France and Germany at the end of last year. President Chirac, Prime Minister Tony Blair,&nbsp;Spanish Prime Minister Jose Zapatero and&nbsp;Russian Prime Minister Fradkov were all in Singapore last&nbsp;July&nbsp;for the International Olympic Committee's meeting, and they called on our key leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next month, we look forward to welcoming Queen Elizabeth, for whom many older Singaporeans have a special affection.&nbsp; In the last few months, we have also played host to the&nbsp; visits of the Hungarian Prime Minister&nbsp;and the Lithuanian President.&nbsp; All the Central and Eastern European countries are keen to engage us and they welcome our businessmen to go there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, while Singapore's relations with Europe are good, ASEAN's relationship with Europe can be improved.&nbsp; There is a tendency among Europeans to concentrate on China, Japan and India when they look at Asia.&nbsp; Southeast Asia catches their attention only when there are particular issues of domestic political importance to them, like Myanmar, or when there are natural disasters like the Boxing Day tsunami when Europeans responded with the greatest generosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Europeans have also played a helpful role in the Aceh peace process. But the strategic understanding of Southeast Asia is lacking.&nbsp; It is in Singapore's and ASEAN's interest to capture a greater European mindshare for our region. For indeed, we are important to them. Something like 40%, if not half, of their total international trade passes through our waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Mr Ravindran and Dr Warren Lee, Russia's economy is of growing importance to Singapore. Last year, Minister Mentor&nbsp;Lee Kuan Yew visited Russia twice and had good discussions on ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation.&nbsp; With high commodity prices, Russia, as a resource-rich country, is playing a significant role in the global economy. We will be helping Russia to develop&nbsp;a Special Economic Zone.&nbsp; We also support a deepening of Russia's political and economic engagement with ASEAN in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Warren Lee asked about the state of our relationship with Australia, in particular, the implications of our hanging of a convicted drug trafficker and the decision by the Australian government to keep SIA out of the trans-Pacific route. Mr Tan Soo Khoon also commented on this during the Budget debate. In actual fact, overall, our relationship with Australia is excellent and remains excellent.&nbsp; We have extensive interest in each other's economy; we share common views on many strategic issues; there is a high degree of comfort in our interactions; our defence links are broad and deep.&nbsp; Although there were strident reactions to the hanging case -&nbsp;some quite racist -&nbsp;the majority of Australians supported us.&nbsp; Throughout, the Australian government was entirely proper in the way it handled the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the trans-Pacific route, while we were naturally disappointed, and we just heard Minister Yeo Cheow Tong recount the history, in the end, we respect the decision of the Australian Cabinet to protect Qantas. That is their decision. But it is clear that our hopes for Open Skies with Australia are perhaps not realistic in the short term despite Australia's commitment to Open Skies in our Free Trade Agreement. But we will continue to work for Australia's deeper engagement with ASEAN.&nbsp; We fought hard for Australia's inclusion in the EAS and supported strongly Australia's FTA with ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran, Mr Leong and Mr Hawazi asked about our links with the Middle East.&nbsp; This is an important new region for us, particularly in the economic field. With abundant energy resources and high prices, which will stay high because of the growing economies of China and India, many Middle Eastern countries have the resources to build up their physical and social infrastructure and to invest overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to OPEC's estimate, over the next 25 years, some US$500 billion&nbsp;will be spent on oil infrastructure. Another US$100 to US$150 billion will be spent annually on social and economic infrastructure in the Gulf region, according to the <I>Gulf Times</I>. Qatar alone has US$130 billion&nbsp;worth of projects on the table.&nbsp; Growing tensions between Islam and the West after September 11 have led many Middle Eastern countries to look increasingly to Asia, not only as a partner for trade and investment, but also as a model for development.&nbsp; There is a certain frustration with the West, and we can only imagine their disappointment at the recent strong reaction in the US Congress against Dubai's acquisition of P&amp;O's ports in the US.&nbsp; China and India have become new factors in the politics and economics of the Middle East.&nbsp; They are already among the largest consumers of Middle Eastern oil exports.&nbsp; The decision of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to make Asia the first region of his overseas visits, including both China and India in his itinerary, was deliberate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore enjoys a good reputation in the Middle East, much more than most Singaporeans realise.&nbsp; We are often held up, sometimes to our embarrassment, as a model for development and of good government, especially by the smaller Gulf states who share with us many similarities.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we embarked on our new policy two years ago to engage the Middle East, we found friends everywhere who were happy to work with us.&nbsp; We discovered to our pleasant surprise that they knew far more about Singapore than we did about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Middle East, therefore, presents a huge new opportunity for us.&nbsp; Our companies are welcome there. For example, SATS (Singapore Airport Terminal Services) made its first entry into the Middle East last month when it was awarded a contract to handle ground operations at the Doha International Airport, quite a valuable contract.&nbsp; Against stiff international competition, Sembcorp Utilities won the Fujairah Independent Water and Power Project in Abu Dhabi. &nbsp;It was the first time that Abu Dhabi has chosen a Singapore company since it embarked on its privatisation drive several years ago.&nbsp; And some of our SMEs, like BreadTalk and Charles &amp; Keith, are also gaining footholds in that region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all this is just the beginning.&nbsp; A new frontier has opened up for us.&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee painted a picture of what is happening there.&nbsp; Mr Hawazi asked, how should we&nbsp;prepare Singaporeans for this new adventure.&nbsp; Well, we have to do many things.&nbsp; And the first thing is to recognise that there are many things that we do not know.&nbsp; To begin with, we need good political relations.&nbsp; This explains the flurry of high-level visits on both sides. Last year, Singapore helped to organise the first meeting of Asian and Middle Eastern countries called AMED.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-eight&nbsp;countries and the Palestinian National Authority participated.&nbsp; It was a good inaugural meeting.&nbsp; Without the cooperation of many of our Arab friends, that meeting could not have been held.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ice broke easily and quickly.&nbsp; Many of the participants from the Middle East were pleasantly surprised to find a reflection of their own region in Singapore.&nbsp; One Egyptian journalist wrote warmly about our Arab district near Kampong Glam though he also lamented that our command of the Arabic language is poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi said that we should learn Arabic, and indeed we should. Now, every time I meet Foreign Service Officers of Arab origin, I say, \"Look, you better brush up your Arabic\".&nbsp; We are encouraging our officers to study Arabic.&nbsp; And it should not just be Foreign Service Officers. We need more Singaporeans to learn the language.&nbsp; I was happy to learn that an enterprising graduate of Al Azhar University has recently opened a school to teach Arabic in Kembangan. URA is thinking of doing up our Arab district to give it a richer Middle Eastern character.&nbsp; And we are attracting more and more tourists from the Middle East here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the Johns Hopkins wing, some have already described it as an Arab hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be establishing a Middle East Institute to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the region's culture, economics and politics. As we build up Islamic banking in Singapore, more of the funds from the Middle East - and it is a lot of funds - will flow here. To facilitate the growth of our economic links, we will be expanding our diplomatic coverage in the Middle East, concentrating on the countries which provide us with more opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Israel and the Palestinian Authority</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Warren Lee:</B>&nbsp; Sir, we have a long and fruitful relationship with Israel.&nbsp;But, at the same time, Singapore has good relations with the Palestinian people and the countries of the Middle East.&nbsp; We know we&nbsp;do not take sides&nbsp;but wish for better&nbsp;understanding, peace and a better life for&nbsp;all their peoples.&nbsp; Could the Minister update us on our relationships with Israel and the Palestinian&nbsp;Authority, especially in view of the recent elections in the Palestinian territories and&nbsp;developments in Israel itself?&nbsp; Has our improved relations with the countries of the Middle East impacted on our relations with Israel?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Cultural Diplomacy</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Sir, I filed a budget cut on \"Cultural Diplomacy\" under MFA.&nbsp; MFA redirected it to MICA.&nbsp; It was only at my insistence that it was now back in MFA, and I am grateful for that.&nbsp; But I wonder whether it reflects how cultural diplomacy is viewed in MFA,&nbsp;that it is not an integral mission of MFA, a very marginal one, one best left to MICA.&nbsp; I would urge the Minister to review this in the light of globalisation and Singapore's evolving position in the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA has done a first-rate job in international diplomacy.&nbsp; But Singapore's interest in the context of globalisation can be promoted more effectively if we adopt a&nbsp;more activist stance in cultural diplomacy.&nbsp; It helps to present the softer face to the world beyond our cold economic achievements,&nbsp;our hard-edged military powers and our almost robot-like bureaucracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the task of cultural diplomacy would be to produce understanding that goes beyond stereotyped images of ourselves and to mould perceptions of the world about us&nbsp;- about our spirit,&nbsp;our values, our soul.&nbsp; We may say that we may not have much of&nbsp; a Singapore spirit or soul, but it has changed over the last few years especially.&nbsp; We have a lively growing arts scene,&nbsp;we have the Esplanade -&nbsp;thanks to the Foreign Minister when he was MICA Minister -&nbsp;and we are increasingly held up as a successful model of a multi-cultural nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many parts of the world, cultural diplomacy plays a central role in their Foreign Affairs Ministries and is a fundamental pillar of foreign policy.&nbsp; The MFAs of many countries have a Cultural Affairs Division and they send their Cultural Attache to&nbsp;their missions abroad with appropriate funding.&nbsp; Sir, I first learned that the Hungarian MFA has a Cultural Affairs Division when I was a Senior Journalist covering PM Goh Chok Tong's visit, then PM, in 2001.&nbsp;I met the Hungarian MFA officials and they showed me their cards, and I noticed that it has a Cultural Division. And they gave me a pad, an information sheet, on MFA.&nbsp; The way they wrote it, you can tell that it is not a typical MFA frame of mind.&nbsp; It was almost poetic, and one of the factsheets with the MFA logo says, \"History shows that the very notions of nation and literature, nation and culture, confront us as a kind of&nbsp; a Janus mask&nbsp;- one side shows the struggle of a historical community for survival while the other shows the historical continuity of high artistic and literary values.\"&nbsp; In other words, there is on one side of the face,&nbsp;the struggle for survival, which is something we can identify with as a nation.&nbsp; On the other hand, Hungary is keen to show to the world its other face - the softer face -&nbsp;their values, their way of life, what they hold dear to their hearts&nbsp;and&nbsp;their culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I wonder, for Singapore, what is our face to the world?&nbsp; I think the struggle for survival is ever present.&nbsp; I think our cold economic realities, our worries for&nbsp;vulnerability, always remain at the fore, and that is understandable.&nbsp;But I think we are growing&nbsp;another side of the face, and it is&nbsp;a matter of showing it.&nbsp;I hope MFA will play a bigger role in looking out for ways to show that.&nbsp; One way is to sign cultural agreements, and I know we do that.&nbsp;When I was in Hungary, in fact a cultural agreement was signed with Hungary and Singapore. And I remember some Hungarian officials telling me, \"You mean Singapore is interested in culture?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, it&nbsp;gives them a different view of Singapore, a better one.&nbsp; I hope that we will do that more actively in MFA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was looking up the websites of different MFAs, and I notice that Canada has a Cultural Division, Chile has a Cultural Division, Israel has a Cultural Division -&nbsp;so many&nbsp;- Greece, Ireland, and all of them put it as an integral part of foreign policy.&nbsp; And I hope that our MFA will set up a Cultural Affairs Division, or a unit&nbsp;at least,&nbsp;to look out for more opportunities to sign cultural agreements and to promote it.&nbsp;As our Minister said,&nbsp;we are looking at the different civilisations, the growing divide between the Islamic world and the rest. We can play a role as an interlocutor, promoting dialogue between the different civilisations and to show that Singapore is not just a place where we celebrate our economic achievements and our ability to survive, despite the odds,&nbsp;but there will be a place that promotes culture, and that we are proud of it and that the world should know that Singapore is more than an Economic Inc., a corporation.&nbsp; I hope that MFA will help us in that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</B> Dr Warren Lee has asked about our relations with Israel and the Palestinian National Authority.&nbsp; We have sustained our longstanding relationship with Israel, and made more friends among the Palestinians, through the visits last year of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Speaker of Parliament Mr Abdullah Tarmugi to Ramallah.&nbsp; SM Goh and Speaker Abdullah's visits were indeed historic firsts for Singapore leaders to the PNA.&nbsp; These visits were invaluable as they gave us a better insight to the situation on the ground.&nbsp; We note that HAMAS has begun to moderate its position towards Israel and has expressed willingness to engage Israel in dialogue and diplomacy under certain conditions.&nbsp; And we urge HAMAS to renounce the use of violence and continue to make efforts to work with Israel to build lasting peace in the Middle East and an independent Palestinian state through the Quartet Roadmap.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now on the question raised by Ms Irene Ng on cultural diplomacy, I cannot agree more that cultural diplomacy is useful in bringing people together.&nbsp; To the question&nbsp;she asked about what face we have, what face will Singapore presents to the world, I think we all know that Singapore has many faces.&nbsp; \"Uniquely Singapore\" - that may be the Singapore Tourism Board's slogan and motto.&nbsp; But at MFA, we present Singapore in total.&nbsp; Having a Minister like&nbsp; Minister George Yeo, who came from MICA, one can surely rest assured that culture will be an important part of our agenda.&nbsp; Just as the Minister also came from MTI, economics is also an important part of our MFA&nbsp; agenda.&nbsp; We all would agree that when diverse people are culturally attuned to one another, they interact in a more open and trusting manner.&nbsp; Through sharing our arts, heritage and culture, cultural diplomacy allows Singaporeans to make friends and create more space for our political and economic interests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA has been involved in many cultural diplomacy programmes.&nbsp; A notable one last year was \"Singapore Season\" in London.&nbsp; Our mission in London had supported MICA and the National Arts Council&nbsp; in the project, which presented Singapore in an integrated manner, leveraging our local films, food, design and flagship arts companies like the Singapore Dance Theatre and Singapore Chinese Orchestra.&nbsp; A business conference and a networking dinner were also held to engage European opinion makers.&nbsp; On its own, MFA has also initiated smaller scale cultural diplomacy initiatives.&nbsp; Last October, our mission in Moscow initiated the World Premier of Vladimir Martynov's Symphony-Cantata called \u201cSingapore\ufffd?.&nbsp; It was well-attended and received good coverage from the Russian media.&nbsp; Washington Mission also organised a \"Singapore Encore\"&nbsp;in May 2005, together with SIF (Singapore International Foundation), featuring the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, the Nuradee Brothers, and the jazz singer Robert Fernandez.&nbsp; Mission used the occasion to invite contacts from the Administration, Congress, business and media circles for an evening of fun and good food.&nbsp; Just last month, Washington Mission also assisted the Asia Society in Houston, Texas, to host the Annual Tiger Ball in honour of Singapore.&nbsp; Every year, they have this annual ball - the Tiger Ball - and each year they feature one country and Singapore was the chosen country for the last dinner.&nbsp; The event allowed us to profile and showcase Singapore's culture, foods and traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members would like to note too that many of MFA's visiting delegations were also hosted to exhibitions, performances and exposed to our local culture.&nbsp; During AMED last June, we took the opportunity to introduce our Middle East and other Asian guests to our prized local dishes like <I>laksa, satay</I> and chicken rice, and also embraced them in song and dance at the Malay Heritage Centre, complete with Yemeni-Arab music, which they greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Recently, a Chinese delegation was hosted to the \"Nutcracker\" put up by the Singapore Dance Theatre at the Esplanade.&nbsp; And during my visit to Indonesia last December, I was also able to establish links with South Sulawesi for cooperation between the Malay Heritage Centre and the Bugis connections in Makassar.&nbsp; Where appropriate, we also showcase exhibitions by our local artists at our Singapore Art Museum, and/or the exhibitions at the Asian Civilisation Museum and our cultural heritage centres.&nbsp; Active cultural diplomacy efforts by MFA are indeed on-going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; According to MICA, which leads our international cultural cooperation efforts,&nbsp;seven G-G Cultural Agreements and&nbsp;six Agency-Agency Cultural Agreements have also been signed with countries such as China, India, South Korea, Jordan, Germany and Ireland over the past&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; Our agencies, and through them our arts groups and companies, are encouraged to pursue whatever arrangement necessary to achieve our goals of internationalising our arts.&nbsp; MFA will continue to assist our agencies in pursuing international cultural exchanges and in bringing Singapore culture to a wider international audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a wider context, I would also like to raise this question of inter-faith dialogue.&nbsp; On the&nbsp;Prophet caricature issue,&nbsp;I think we all&nbsp;realise that&nbsp;religion plays an important part of living culture, so inter-faith dialogue is also&nbsp;important to our role.&nbsp; The Prophet caricature issue has reminded us how sensitive religious divisions can be.&nbsp; The Internet had quickly propagated what started as an issue in Europe to Southeast Asia as well.&nbsp; Both President Yudhoyono and Prime Minister Badawi had to talk about it because their Muslim grounds had been aroused. &nbsp;In ASEAN, we must not allow similar misunderstandings between Muslims and non-Muslims to surface, worse, to divide us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore in everyone's interest to have frequent, open and constructive dialogues involving key stakeholders, to address concerns and misperceptions.&nbsp; This will help to defuse potential conflict amongst the different religions.&nbsp; Singapore can play its part in promoting such inter-faith dialogue.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the first Arab-Muslim Israeli Ambassador visited Singapore.&nbsp; We would receive Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino for the 25th Anniversary of Singapore-Holy See relations in June this year.&nbsp; These are occasions where inter-faith dialogues could be organised.&nbsp; It is educational for us, and we could benefit from the experience and wisdom of these personalities.&nbsp; At the same time, we can contribute and share with them our own experiences.&nbsp; These could be small but first steps towards eventually having a wider-based inter-faith dialogue forum in Singapore, a venue where different faiths could come together in open and constructive dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I would also like to add that this concept of an inter-faith dialogue venue relates back to the fundamentals of Singapore's existence.&nbsp; As a small country with no economic hinterland, our survival depends on us being able to remain relevant to the world.&nbsp; Our foreign policy is designed to support this approach.&nbsp; Singapore is now a key transport and logistics hub with efficient road networks, seaport and airport, as well as extensive air and sea links.&nbsp; We are a political hub by virtue of being part of Southeast Asia that forms the core of key regional architectures</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I would also like to urge our MFA to look at Israel, which has 70 cultural agreements with different countries and it is also a small state.&nbsp; I also wonder why it must be left to MICA to pursue these cultural agreements and not MFA.&nbsp;

It is not just the number of agreements we sign.&nbsp; When you look at MFA, you realise that we are very short of people.&nbsp; We have enough difficulties in getting&nbsp;Singaporeans to represent us as Ambassadors, and that is why we have had to rely on Non-Resident Ambassadors.&nbsp; And what more if we appointed cultural attaches, like the big countries do?&nbsp; Nevertheless, we are active in various forms of cultural activities, as in the examples I have given just now.&nbsp; You can see from the kinds of things that we do, the numbers will grow, the activities will grow, and the reach-out will also improve.
