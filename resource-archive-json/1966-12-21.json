This  valuable\r\n\r\nReport  is the culmination of careful deliberation\r\n\r\nby  eminent  legal personalities  and  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nrecord  Government's appreciation of their  public\r\n\r\nservice.  I wish to take the opportunity  also  to\r\n\r\nthank  the  various individuals and  organisations\r\n\r\nlisted in the Appendices to the Report, for  their\r\n\r\nrepresentations  and  views  which  were  of  much\r\n\r\nassistance to the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Commission have\r\n\r\nreceived   the   very  careful  consideration   of\r\n\r\nGovernment and I am glad to state that most of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations are acceptable in their  entirety.\r\n\r\nOn others, while Government agrees in principle to\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations, it differs in  the  detailed\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  A  few of  the  recommendations,\r\n\r\nhowever, are not acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has made various recommendations\r\n\r\nin  regard to the protection of fundamental rights\r\n\r\nand  freedoms of the individual and the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  various provisions of the Constitution\r\n\r\nought  to  be entrenched. The Commission has  also\r\n\r\nsuggested the creation of a non-elected advisory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbody  to be called the \"Council of State\", with  a\r\n\r\nsmall  membership, not subject to dissolution  but\r\n\r\nrenewing  itself  at  regular  intervals  by   the\r\n\r\nretirement and replacement of a proportion of  its\r\n\r\nmembers  in  rotation, and  the  creation  of  the\r\n\r\noffice     of    Ombudsman    (or    Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommissioner). The Commission also touched on  two\r\n\r\nmatters  not  expressly covered by their  specific\r\n\r\nterms of reference, namely, the Judiciary and  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal briefly with these recommendations.\r\n\r\nAt  Chapter  II  of their Report,  the  Commission\r\n\r\nmakes  recommendations in regard to the protection\r\n\r\nof  the right of life and personal liberty of  the\r\n\r\nindividual,  the  prohibition of slavery  and  all\r\n\r\nforms   of   forced  labour,  protection   against\r\n\r\nretrospective  criminal laws and repeated  trials,\r\n\r\nequality   of   all   persons  before   the   law,\r\n\r\nprohibition of banishment and freedom of movement,\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  speech, assembly and association  and\r\n\r\nreligion. All these recommendations are acceptable\r\n\r\nto Government. The Commission has also recommended\r\n\r\nthe inclusion of three new Articles not written in\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Constitution, viz. -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the right of every individual not to be\r\n\r\nsubjected to torture;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the granting to the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  right to elect a Government  of  their\r\n\r\nown choice; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the right to apply to court for the\r\n\r\nenforcement of those provisions relating to\r\n\r\nfundamental rights and liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These are all acceptable in principle and will  be\r\n\r\nincorporated  in some form in the new Constitution\r\n\r\nto be drawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to property rights, the Commission\r\n\r\nrecognises the fact that Singapore is only a small\r\n\r\nisland of 225 square miles and more and more  land\r\n\r\nwill  be  required  for  public  purposes  as  the\r\n\r\npopulation  increases.  The  Commission  therefore\r\n\r\ndoes  not recommend the reintroduction of  Article\r\n\r\n13  of the Constitution of Malaysia in its present\r\n\r\nform. However, the Commission recommends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  there  should he an  Article  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution providing as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) No person shall be deprived of property\r\n\r\nsave in accordance with law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No law shall provide for the compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition or use of property except for  a\r\n\r\npublic  purpose  or  a  purpose  useful   or\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to  the public and  except  upon\r\n\r\njust terms.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Government would accept this Article but  for\r\n\r\nthe  words  at the end, namely, \"and  except  upon\r\n\r\njust terms\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be aware that we have, at various\r\n\r\ntimes  while  within  Malaysia,  sought  to  amend\r\n\r\nArticle  13 of the Malaysian Constitution  in  its\r\n\r\napplication  to  Singapore. The intention  was  to\r\n\r\nfollow  the  provisions in the Indian Constitution\r\n\r\nso  that  any  law  providing for  the  compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition of property shall be valid so long  as\r\n\r\nthat law provides for compensation and that such a\r\n\r\nlaw  shall  not be questioned in court as  to  the\r\n\r\nadequacy   of  the  compensation.  The  new   Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition  Act, which has been  passed  by  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  will  be brought into  force  shortly,\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the setting up of a  Lands  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard and it is not considered desirable that  the\r\n\r\nintentions  of that legislation should be  stifled\r\n\r\nby  landowners  being able to raise constitutional\r\n\r\nissues   when   disputes  over  the   quantum   of\r\n\r\ncompensation arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has recommended three methods of\r\n\r\nentrenchment  in respect of various provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first method is a provision in the\r\n\r\nConstitution  that  the  Bill  for   an   Act   of\r\n\r\nParliament altering the Constitution shall not  be\r\n\r\npassed by Parliament until it is expressed  to  be\r\n\r\none for amendment of the Constitution and contains\r\n\r\nno other provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method is a provision in the\r\n\r\nConstitution  that  the  Bill  for   an   Act   of\r\n\r\nParliament  altering certain named  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution shall not be passed by Parliament\r\n\r\nunless  the Bill is supported at the final  voting\r\n\r\nin  Parliament by the votes of not less than  two-thirds of all the elected Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third method is that any alteration of\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions  can  only  be  made  by   the\r\n\r\naffirmative vote of a very substantial majority of\r\n\r\npeople  qualified to vote in general elections  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  of  a very substantial majority  of  the\r\n\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given very careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  all  three  methods   and   the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  each and  has  decided,  in  the\r\n\r\nsituation  now prevailing in Singapore,  to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  second  method  of  entrenchment.  All  those\r\n\r\nrecommendations  accepted by  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nalso    recommended   by   the   Commission    for\r\n\r\nentrenchment will be so entrenched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendation on the creation\r\n\r\nof  a  non-elected advisory body to be called \"the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  State\",  while Government  agrees  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  to  the creation of  such  a  body,  it\r\n\r\ndiffers   in   the   suggested   composition   and\r\n\r\nfunctions.  Further, it is the view of  Government\r\n\r\nthat  it would be more in keeping with its  purely\r\n\r\nadvisory capacity for the Council of State to  sit\r\n\r\nin  private rather than in public. This will  also\r\n\r\nensure that discussions taking place are frank and\r\n\r\nconstructive and not held with an eye on the Press\r\n\r\nor publicity or with a view to scoring a political\r\n\r\npoint.  Membership of this Council, which will  be\r\n\r\nanalagous  to the Privy Council, would be  of  two\r\n\r\ntypes -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Permanent members: This would consist of men\r\n\r\nof distinction who will be chosen from those who\r\n\r\nhold or have held high offices, e.g. Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinisters, former Chief Ministers, the Chief\r\n\r\nJustice, the Speaker, the Chairman of the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission, Puisne Judges, the Attorney-General and former Permanent Secretaries. There\r\n\r\nwould be no age limit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Members who are removable: Appointments\r\n\r\nwould  be on the advice of Cabinet and  would\r\n\r\nbe  for  a fixed period of, say, three years,\r\n\r\nPersons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappointed would be mature citizens  who  have\r\n\r\neither  rendered distinguished public service\r\n\r\nor  attained  eminence  in  their  respective\r\n\r\nwalks  of life regardless of race, colour  or\r\n\r\ncreed as recommended by the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendation on the creation\r\n\r\nof   the  office  of  Ombudsman  or  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommissioner,  while Government  is  in  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the thinking behind this recommendation,  it\r\n\r\nis  considered that the time is not opportune  for\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of such an office in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMembers  may  be  aware that  the  system  of  the\r\n\r\nOmbudsman,  which has its origins  in  Scandinavia\r\n\r\nand  seems  to  be  working fairly  satisfactorily\r\n\r\nthere, is a novel idea insofar as the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nis   concerned.   New   Zealand   is   the   first\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  country to have an Ombudsman  -  the\r\n\r\nsystem, having been introduced there recently,  is\r\n\r\nstill  in its experimental state. It is considered\r\n\r\nthat the creation of the Ombudsman on the lines of\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Commission  should  be\r\n\r\ndeferred  until the results of the  experiment  in\r\n\r\nNew Zealand and elsewhere are known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also made recommendations - not\r\n\r\nexpressly covered by their terms of reference - in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  Judiciary and the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.  The  Commission has recommended  that\r\n\r\nprovision be made in the Constitution vesting  the\r\n\r\npower  of appointment of judges in the High  Court\r\n\r\nand other superior judges, in the President acting\r\n\r\non  the  advice of a body comprising the  superior\r\n\r\njudges  and  presided over by the  holder  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest  judicial office in the Republic.  It  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  considered  that the  present  practice,\r\n\r\nwhereby  judges  are appointed  by  the  President\r\n\r\nacting  on  the advice of the Prime  Minister  who\r\n\r\nconsults   the  incumbent  Chief  Justice   before\r\n\r\ntendering  such  advice  to  the  President,   has\r\n\r\nhitherto   worked   satisfactorily   and    should\r\n\r\ncontinue. It is considered undesirable that judges\r\n\r\nas  a  body should form a self-perpetuating group,\r\n\r\ndetached  from  the  community  and  the   elected\r\n\r\npolitical leadership. The recommendation that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  be  made  in the Constitution  for  the\r\n\r\nremuneration of judges to be provided by  law  and\r\n\r\nto  be  charged on the Consolidated Fund, for  the\r\n\r\nremuneration and other terms of office  (including\r\n\r\npension rights, allowances, etc.) of a judge to be\r\n\r\nunalterable to his disadvantage during the  tenure\r\n\r\nof his appointment and for the non-abolition of  a\r\n\r\njudicial  office so long as it has  a  substantive\r\n\r\nholder,  is  acceptable. It  is  agreed  that  the\r\n\r\nremuneration  of  judges  should  be  such  as  to\r\n\r\nattract   the  ablest  men  of  high  professional\r\n\r\nability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Public Service Commission, it\r\n\r\nis  agreed  that the Chairman and members  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission should be  persons  who\r\n\r\ncan  command the respect and enjoy the  confidence\r\n\r\nof  all sections of the population.

Members are aware, when Singapore became\r\n\r\npart  of Malaysia, the Malaysian Government by  an\r\n\r\nOrder  extended  the Malaysia Holidays  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1951,  to  Singapore,  with the  result  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Holidays Ordinance ceased to have effect\r\n\r\nin Singapore. Now that Singapore has left Malaysia\r\n\r\nand   has   become  a  sovereign  and  independent\r\n\r\nRepublic,  it is obviously desirable to  have  our\r\n\r\nown holidays legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, in the main, repeats the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  former  Holidays  Ordinance,  but  makes  one\r\n\r\nimportant change. There is no provision  to  allow\r\n\r\nBank  Holidays to be observed, as used to  be  the\r\n\r\npractice  in  the  past when  1st  July  and  31st\r\n\r\nDecember were observed as Bank Holidays to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  banks  to close the mid-year and  end-of-year\r\n\r\naccounts.    Subsequently,   as   a   result    of\r\n\r\nconsultations  with the Singapore  banks,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen agreed that, by reorganising their work,  the\r\n\r\nbanks  can dispense with Bank Holidays in  future,\r\n\r\nand thus provide a more convenient service for the\r\n\r\npublic.

Now that Singapore has become a\r\n\r\nsovereign   and   independent  Republic,   it   is\r\n\r\nconsidered desirable to bring the law up to  date.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to repeal\r\n\r\nand   re-enact   with  suitable   amendments   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Societies Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the amendments which have been made are\r\n\r\nthose dealing with political associations. I think\r\n\r\nhon.   Members  will  agree  that,  in   view   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's sovereign and independent  status,  it\r\n\r\nis   necessary  to  provide  that  any   political\r\n\r\nassociation  registered in Singapore  should  have\r\n\r\nits  membership confined to Singapore citizens and\r\n\r\nshould   have   no   affiliation   or   connection\r\n\r\nwhatsoever   with   political   parties    outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  which are considered to be contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe  national interest. We have at the  moment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore a number of political parties which  had\r\n\r\nbeen  registered as Singapore branches  of  parent\r\n\r\nbodies in Western Malaysia many years ago\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand which, during the time when Singapore was part\r\n\r\nof   Malaysia,  quite  naturally  became  strongly\r\n\r\norientated  towards Kuala Lumpur.  This  situation\r\n\r\nwas  perfectly all right as long as Singapore  was\r\n\r\npart  of Malaysia. But with Singapore's withdrawal\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia,  it  is quite clear  that  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation cannot be allowed to continue.  I  think\r\n\r\nit is only reasonable to expect that these various\r\n\r\npolitical  parties should now move with the  times\r\n\r\nand   take   appropriate  steps  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nmembership  is confined to Singapore citizens  and\r\n\r\nto  cut  off all affiliations or connections  with\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  outside  Singapore.   It   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  proposed to empower the  Registrar  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  registration to any political  association\r\n\r\nwhich   does   not  meet  this  requirement.   Any\r\n\r\npolitical  association which is already registered\r\n\r\nwill be given a reasonable period within which  to\r\n\r\namend   its  constitution  to  comply  with   this\r\n\r\nrequirement, and should such society fail to amend\r\n\r\nits  constitution  accordingly within  the  period\r\n\r\nallowed, there is provision in the Bill for action\r\n\r\nto be taken to dissolve the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable the Registrar to keep track of the\r\n\r\nactivities of registered societies, it is provided\r\n\r\nthat any registered society seeking to establish a\r\n\r\nbranch  must  seek  the  prior  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar who may withhold his approval on certain\r\n\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar or Assistant Registrar is also\r\n\r\nempowered  to  order  any  registered  society  to\r\n\r\nfurnish  him  with  any information  that  he  may\r\n\r\nrequire  concerning the society, or any  document,\r\n\r\naccounts and books relating to the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also considered desirable to provide for\r\n\r\nmore  effective  control in  the  registration  of\r\n\r\nsocieties. Accordingly, the Registrar is empowered\r\n\r\nto  refuse  registration in  certain  cases  where\r\n\r\nthere   are   reasonable  grounds   for   refusing\r\n\r\nregistration. For example, a proposed society  may\r\n\r\nbe   refused   registration  if  its   rules   are\r\n\r\nconsidered to be insufficient to provide  for  its\r\n\r\nproper  management and control, or the society  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be used for unlawful purposes  or  for\r\n\r\npurposes prejudicial to public peace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  welfare  in  Singapore. In  any  case,  where\r\n\r\nregistration  has been refused by  the  Registrar,\r\n\r\nthere is provision for an appeal to be made to the\r\n\r\nMinister for reconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any society which has not been registered will be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  be  an  unlawful  society  and  it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered   desirable  to  expand   the   present\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating to unlawful  societies  which\r\n\r\nare not considered adequate. Thus, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  existing provision which makes it an  offence\r\n\r\nfor  any  person to act as a member of an unlawful\r\n\r\nsociety,  attend a meeting of an unlawful society,\r\n\r\nor allow such a meeting to be held in any premises\r\n\r\nbelonging to or occupied by him, it is proposed to\r\n\r\nprovide   that   certain   other   activities   in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  unlawful societies  should  also\r\n\r\nconstitute  offences under the law. Thus  it  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  an offence for any person to  incite  or\r\n\r\ninduce another person to become a member or assist\r\n\r\nin  the  management  of  an unlawful  society,  to\r\n\r\nprocure from any other person any subscription  or\r\n\r\naid  for  the purposes of an unlawful society,  to\r\n\r\nprint,  publish or sell any newspaper or  document\r\n\r\nissued by or on behalf of an unlawful society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill are a re-enactment of the present provisions of the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance  with appropriate  amendments\r\n\r\nand additions where necessary to bring them up  to\r\n\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support wholly the\r\n\r\nBill which has been introduced by the Minister for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs.  I believe it  will  resolve  the\r\n\r\nimpasse  faced by the Registrar. It is appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  it  should  be implemented  because,  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent   sovereign   State,   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  have  a positive  stand  towards\r\n\r\nsocieties  in Singapore, irrespective  of  whether\r\n\r\nthey    are   political   parties,   non-political\r\n\r\nassociations, pro-Communist or non-Communist. What\r\n\r\nis necessary for the Government is to protect the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprosperity  and  the  safety  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  Singapore,  there  are   political\r\n\r\nparties  which  have the same name  and  the  same\r\n\r\nsymbol as some political parties have in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAs  we  have  become an independent and  sovereign\r\n\r\nState,  we  must  protect  the  good  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween   Singapore  and  neighbouring  countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly  Malaysia. And  it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\navoid   any  misunderstanding  between   the   two\r\n\r\nGovernments and the two peoples, so that political\r\n\r\nparties  with  the same name and the  same  symbol\r\n\r\nmust  be  made  to alter their names and  symbols.\r\n\r\nAlso to avoid any misunderstanding between the two\r\n\r\npeoples,  I believe we do not wish to see repeated\r\n\r\nthe incident created by U.M.N.O. at the behest  of\r\n\r\nAhmad  Haji Taff, the leader of U.M.N.O., who  has\r\n\r\nused  U.M.N.O. Singapore for his own selfish  ends\r\n\r\nand for the ends of political parties in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAs  the leader of U.M.N.O. Singapore, he has  been\r\n\r\nairing the interest of the Malaysian Government. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  in this way he thinks that the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  one  day  appoint  him   as   an\r\n\r\nAmbassador abroad, like Dato Haji Jumat, a  former\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Singapore and an ex-Assemblyman  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai, who was appointed as an Ambassador\r\n\r\nfor the Malaysian Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the aid of the amendments moved by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture and Social Affairs, I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar will be able to exercise the powers\r\n\r\ngiven   to   him  to  overcome  his  difficulties.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties and non-political parties  which\r\n\r\nhave  misused their associations will have  to  be\r\n\r\ndealt with accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wholly support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support the  Societies\r\n\r\nBill.  I  personally feel that it  has  got  three\r\n\r\nbasic  features. One is to bring us into  the  new\r\n\r\nsituation. Secondly, it is to protect the interest\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens. Thirdly, it is  to  stop  anti-national  elements  from  infiltrating  into   our\r\n\r\ncountry. As the Minister has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  said,  the  old  Societies  Ordinance  is\r\n\r\noutmoded and cannot be effectively used in our new\r\n\r\nsituation. When we were in Malaysia we  were  part\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  as  a State. But, according  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Malaysia, the people  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nor Sarawak were not Singapore citizens unless they\r\n\r\nwere  registered  under the Singapore  Citizenship\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  But, at that time, our Government  was\r\n\r\nadopting   an  enlightened  and  liberal  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  people  who came from Malaysia  or  other\r\n\r\nterritories  within Malaysia. So we allowed  these\r\n\r\npeople to register themselves as a society or as a\r\n\r\npolitical  society in Singapore.  They  were  also\r\n\r\nallowed  to  hold  office in such  societies.  But\r\n\r\nsince  we became independent on the 9th of August,\r\n\r\n1965,  the  whole situation has changed.  We  have\r\n\r\nentered a new stage. Therefore, if we continue  to\r\n\r\nallow the old situation to exist, then it would be\r\n\r\nunwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, freedom of assembly is one of the\r\n\r\nfundamental rights of the people. The formation of\r\n\r\na  political  society  is an  expression  of  this\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  assembly. So the societies registered\r\n\r\nunder  the Societies Ordinance will have all their\r\n\r\nlegitimate activities recognised by the law. It is\r\n\r\nonly fair that only citizens of Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to hold important office in the societies.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the basic rights of the people. But\r\n\r\nthis  was  not the situation in the past.  Whether\r\n\r\nyou  were  a  citizen or not, you were allowed  to\r\n\r\nhold  office  in  the societies  then  registered.\r\n\r\nBecause  of this unhealthy situation in the  past,\r\n\r\nit was possible for some anti-national elements to\r\n\r\ninfiltrate  into  some  societies  registered   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly some political societies,\r\n\r\nold  boys' associations and trade unions. We could\r\n\r\nsee all these facts from the statements issued  by\r\n\r\npolitical detainees recently released. These anti-national  elements,  formed  under  the  guise  of\r\n\r\nregistered  societies,  were  carrying  out  anti-national  activities against the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Societies Bill, which makes provision to\r\n\r\nconfine  membership  of any society  to  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  only, is a very correct move indeed.  It\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that  our  societies  will  no  longer  be\r\n\r\ninfiltrated by anti-national elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one point, however, which\r\n\r\nI  wish to bring to the attention of the Minister,\r\n\r\nand  that is as follows. Those who are law-abiding\r\n\r\nand  loyal  residents should be allowed to  become\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore within one or two years.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve there are some such persons holding office\r\n\r\nin  our registered societies. So I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to exercise his powers under the Bill  to\r\n\r\nallow such persons to continue holding office  for\r\n\r\nthe   time   being  until  they  become  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens by law. As long as the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore are protected, I believe  that\r\n\r\nall loyal citizens will support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my full\r\n\r\nsupport  for this Bill. At the same time, I  would\r\n\r\nlike   the  Minister  to  explain  certain  points\r\n\r\nrelating  to  it.  I  do  not  know  whether   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  will have to consider  the  name  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  party  to  be  also  in  the   national\r\n\r\nlanguage when he carries out the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill  relating  to the registration  of  political\r\n\r\nparties.  I  do not, for a moment,  say  that  the\r\n\r\nother  languages  are  not official  languages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  know that this is a  fact.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  must  be stressed that the  name  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  party or society must also  be  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language so that it can  be  made  clear\r\n\r\nthat  it is fully loyal to the country. There  are\r\n\r\nsome political parties in Singapore which are  yet\r\n\r\nto   be   registered,  like  U.M.N.O.,  and  these\r\n\r\ninitials,  in  my view, represent  English  words.\r\n\r\nThey   stand   for  the  United  Malays   National\r\n\r\nOrganisation.  The initials may be misleading  and\r\n\r\ncould    stand    for   Ultra   Malays    National\r\n\r\nOrganisation. Even if we do not say that this name\r\n\r\nhas  come from the English-educated people, we can\r\n\r\nsay   that  it  has  come  from  our  very   close\r\n\r\nneighbour. So if every political party is required\r\n\r\nto  submit several names in the different official\r\n\r\nlanguages, this will be of great assistance to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar   of  Societies  when  considering   its\r\n\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nexplain  his  stand on this question in  order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the work of the Registrar of Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been a common feature\r\n\r\nin  the  political history of Singapore and Malaya\r\n\r\nthat  the  names  of many political  parties  have\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the national language. This  feature\r\n\r\nwas  quite prevalent even as far back as ten years\r\n\r\nago.  So  this  is  a historical tendency  of  the\r\n\r\ntimes. That is why the P.A.P. also has its name in\r\n\r\nthe national language. We had the foresight to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  So  I  hope  the  Minister  will  give   an\r\n\r\nexplanation on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill  which  has\r\n\r\njust  been introduced by the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nand  Social Affairs. Actually it should  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  at the present  moment,  but  it\r\n\r\nshould have been introduced much earlier to  amend\r\n\r\nthe defects in the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill contains 20 pages\r\n\r\nwith  38  clauses which should have been  compiled\r\n\r\nmuch earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a fact that the events described by the\r\n\r\nMinister did take place many years ago, we  should\r\n\r\ntake  steps not only to deal with the registration\r\n\r\nof  political  parties but also to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nregistration    of    labour    unions,    welfare\r\n\r\nassociations, deaf and dumb associations,  and  so\r\n\r\non.  May I know whether the Registrar is empowered\r\n\r\nto  withhold the registration of any organisations\r\n\r\nlike  the  old  boys' associations  which  conduct\r\n\r\nkindergarten  classes in many parts of  Singapore?\r\n\r\nWe  have no objection to kindergarten classes  run\r\n\r\nby  associations with the object of  moulding  our\r\n\r\nchildren into loyal subjects. The same can be said\r\n\r\nof  political parties.

The main  provisions  in\r\n\r\nthis   Bill   are  outlined  in  the   Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement attached to the Bill.

The\r\n\r\nprovisions, which are new, are also applicable  to\r\n\r\nprivate companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"director\" has been widened to\r\n\r\ninclude   a   person  in  accordance  with   whose\r\n\r\ndirections  or  instructions  the  directors   are\r\n\r\naccustomed to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 122 requires every company to have at\r\n\r\nleast two directors, one of whom shall be resident\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 131 and 132 impose upon the directors the\r\n\r\nduty  of disclosing any conflicting interests they\r\n\r\nmight  have  and prohibit officers of the  company\r\n\r\nfrom acquiring an advantage because of information\r\n\r\ngained by virtue of their position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 133 restricts the right of companies to\r\n\r\nmake  loans to their directors or to directors  of\r\n\r\nrelated  companies,  and  clause  135  requires  a\r\n\r\ndirector  to  inform the company promptly  of  any\r\n\r\nmatters  affecting  his  own  position  which  are\r\n\r\nrequired to be known by the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 136 prohibits tax-free payments to\r\n\r\ndirectors,  and  clause 137  strictly  limits  the\r\n\r\nright  of a company to make payments to a director\r\n\r\non his retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions will ensure that directors do\r\n\r\nnot  take undue advantage of their position in the\r\n\r\ncompany  and will prevent the company from  giving\r\n\r\nundue preference to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special provisions have been introduced in this\r\n\r\nBill  to  control  unit and  property  trusts  and\r\n\r\ninvestment  companies.

Furthermore,  an\r\n\r\napproved  company auditor may be  called  upon  to\r\n\r\ncertify  the correctness of accounts of  companies\r\n\r\nturning public. As these certifications are to  be\r\n\r\nmade  on the prospective companies, it is arguable\r\n\r\nthat such an act may not be legally carried out by\r\n\r\nan  approved company auditor. In order that  these\r\n\r\ndoubts  be  removed,  it  is  proposed  that  this\r\n\r\nfurther  amendment be made so as to make it  quite\r\n\r\nclear  that  any approved company auditor  who  is\r\n\r\nmerely performing acts which he will be allowed to\r\n\r\nperform under the proposed Companies Act would not\r\n\r\nbe excluded by this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
