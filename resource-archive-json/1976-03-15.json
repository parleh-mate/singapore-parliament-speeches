If the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nis  interested in their detailed use. I have  all  the\r\n\r\nfigures  here.  For example, the fringe  car  park  at\r\n\r\nLorong  1.

It is leased to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nShuttle  Bus  (Pte) Ltd for night garaging  of  buses.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the fringe car park at Serangoon Road, where\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Bus Service Ltd is using it  for  night\r\n\r\ngaraging.

The\r\n\r\nfringe car park at Whitley Road is used as a car  park\r\n\r\nduring the day. It is also leased to the Singapore Bus\r\n\r\nService  Ltd for day-and-night garaging of buses.

The resilient and hard working\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  will  respond  positively   to\r\n\r\nwhatever problems we may have to face, if we take them\r\n\r\ninto  our confidence and explain to them frankly  what\r\n\r\nthe odds against us are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we became independent in 1965, against\r\n\r\nunpredictable  odds,  we  were  able  to  launch   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme successfully.  Every  true\r\n\r\nSingaporean had put his shoulder to the wheel so  that\r\n\r\nwe   could  progress  comfortably  as  an  independent\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1968 when the British announced their total\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  we were faced with a massive  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.  Together  with our  workers,  we  took  bold\r\n\r\ndecisions   that   created  a  climate   for   massive\r\n\r\nindustrial  investment. As a result of this  bold  and\r\n\r\nunprecedented   cooperation  between  Government   and\r\n\r\nlabour, we  enjoyed a period of full  employment  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps now, we are facing yet another crisis which\r\n\r\nwe  have  to face squarely and decide on a  course  of\r\n\r\naction which though might be unpalatable in the  short\r\n\r\nterm, would accrue benefits to the Singaporeans in the\r\n\r\nlong run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the euphoria of almost full employment two\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  we  are at the moment  facing  the  bleak\r\n\r\nprospect  of serious unemployment. We have to  prepare\r\n\r\nourselves and plan constructively to create new  jobs.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last  two years, for the first time,  we  had\r\n\r\nlarge scale retrenchments in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 we had almost full employment with no\r\n\r\nretrenchment  at all. In 1974 registered  retrenchment\r\n\r\nwas  1 7.081. In 1975 9,500 and in the last two months\r\n\r\nalone,  145  able-bodied workers were  retrenched.  We\r\n\r\nmust  not only help the retrenched workers to get back\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs but we must also create more jobs to  help\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed and also create enough jobs for  about\r\n\r\n30.000 school leavers who join the labour market every\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is projected that in the next two years we will\r\n\r\nhave to create a total of 84,000 new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs  in  order  to  achieve a  target  of  reasonable\r\n\r\nemployment. This is going to be a gigantic task unless\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the workers and our entrepreneurs can\r\n\r\nchart  out  a plan of action to attract new industries\r\n\r\nand capital investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions in the developed countries argue that\r\n\r\ntheir overseas investment has resulted in loss of jobs\r\n\r\nfor their own nationals. They are, therefore, mounting\r\n\r\npressure  on  their own governments and industries  to\r\n\r\nprevent   the  export  of  their  capital   investment\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prospective investors from the developed\r\n\r\ncountries  will not come to Singapore  as  eagerly  as\r\n\r\nthey  have  done in the past. The potential  investing\r\n\r\nnations  like  the United States, Western  Europe  and\r\n\r\nJapan,  are  themselves  facing tremendous  opposition\r\n\r\nfrom  their own trade unions against expansion outside\r\n\r\ntheir  home bases. It is estimated that in the  United\r\n\r\nStates   alone  there  are  almost  8  million  people\r\n\r\nunemployed.  This  is  almost  8%  of  their   working\r\n\r\npopulation.  Developed countries in Europe  like  West\r\n\r\nGermany. Britain and France, each have over 1  million\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers,  and  Japan  is  in   a   similar\r\n\r\npredicament.  With  the investment prospect  being  so\r\n\r\nbleak, what do we do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make Singapore once again attractive to\r\n\r\noverseas  investors.  We  must  make  sure  that   our\r\n\r\nmanufactured products are of high quality and  cheaper\r\n\r\nthan  those produced by our competitors. This  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  if  we can increase productivity and reduce  our\r\n\r\nunit  labour  cost.  We made Singapore  an  attractive\r\n\r\nplace  for  investment an 1968. We can  do  this  once\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, our workers will respond\r\n\r\npositively  if  we take them into our  confidence  and\r\n\r\nexplain to them frankly what the odds against us  are.\r\n\r\nThe  workers' response alone would not be  sufficient.\r\n\r\nSimilar  responses  should  be  forthcoming  from  our\r\n\r\nexecutives,  managers, manufacturers,  industrialists\r\n\r\nand  entrepreneurs. Sacrifices are called for not only\r\n\r\nfrom   the  workers  but  also  from  the  executives,\r\n\r\nmanagers, supervisors,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and civil servants: in other words  every\r\n\r\nsector of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost full employment that we had in the past\r\n\r\nand  also  the high standard of living we are enjoying\r\n\r\nin Singapore, with reasonable wage increases, has made\r\n\r\nthe   ordinary  man-in-the-street  in  Singapore  over\r\n\r\nconfident   and  complacent  about  his  future.   The\r\n\r\nattitude of \"all is well\" is over-prevalent. A greater\r\n\r\neffort is needed to bring home to our people the stark\r\n\r\nrealities of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturers will have to continue to search\r\n\r\nfor  new  markets for our manufactured goods.  We  can\r\n\r\nalso   look   into  the  possibility  of   introducing\r\n\r\nprotective tariffs on selected items that are  locally\r\n\r\nproduced  in excess, due to depressed markets  abroad.\r\n\r\nThe  possibility  of  at least a limited  preferential\r\n\r\ntrading can be pursued within the ASEAN market. I have\r\n\r\nin   mind   items  like  electronic  calculators   and\r\n\r\ntransistors which are being produced in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwhich  are also being dumped in the local market  from\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturers, especially the local ones, must\r\n\r\nbe  tough and high pressure salesmen. They must go out\r\n\r\nto  compete  and to sell. They seem to be over-reliant\r\n\r\non  the  Government, asking for one concession or  the\r\n\r\nother.  While  asking the workers  to  work  hard,  to\r\n\r\nreduce  cost,  to  increase  productivity,  they  must\r\n\r\nthemselves set good examples of what they preach. When\r\n\r\nworkers  are  asked to economise and  cut  costs,  the\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  managers should not  be  seen  to  be\r\n\r\nchanging  the  fleet of management Mercedes-Benz  cars\r\n\r\nevery three to five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our biggest labour intensive industries is\r\n\r\nship-building  and  ship-repairing.  In  recent  years\r\n\r\nshipyards  have grown rapidly in Jurong. Tanjong  Rhu.\r\n\r\nSembawang, etc.  Recently  we  hear   of   declining\r\n\r\nprospects  in this particular sector, and  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  retrenchments.  This  is  a  serious  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern. Fierce competition is being felt by our local\r\n\r\nshipyards  from  Hong Kong, and especially  Japan.  In\r\n\r\norder  to keep the Japanese workers employed  and  the\r\n\r\nshipyards going, large ship-builders in Japan are  now\r\n\r\nsuccessfully competing with our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshipyards  in the building of small barges and  small-sized craft. They are successfully bidding against our\r\n\r\nlocal  shipyards in ship-repairing and reconditioning.\r\n\r\nOur  shipyards, in order to remain competitive, should\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  provide faster service  and  competitive\r\n\r\ncosting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the statutory boards\r\n\r\nand   Government-owned   commercial   and   industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises  either wholly owned or on a joint-venture\r\n\r\nbasis.  Recently the Minister for Labour, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance,  commented  on  the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  improved personnel management.  This\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  personnel management  and  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  is required not only in the private  sector\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  the  Government-owned  enterprises  and\r\n\r\nstatutory boards. They too in many instances lack  the\r\n\r\ncorrect attitude in their industrial relations branch.\r\n\r\nThey  think they have the protection of the Government\r\n\r\nas  Government-owned enterprises, and yet they  refuse\r\n\r\nto  adopt the same attitude of the Government  towards\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  their staff and  understanding  of\r\n\r\ntheir  problems. We are aware of some Government-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises  and their subsidiaries with unenlightened\r\n\r\nindustrial relations' attitude in their dealings  with\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions. I know of one statutory board where\r\n\r\na  senior member of the staff, in answering a query by\r\n\r\nthe  union raised in a polite letter in respect  of  a\r\n\r\npromotion exercise, replies and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As you are fully aware of the provisions of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act (Cap. 124), you will  realise\r\n\r\nthat it is futile for me to send the union any further\r\n\r\nguidelines  of promotion since the union will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  act  on them, However, their generality  and\r\n\r\nsimplicity  will only serve to insult the intelligence\r\n\r\nof  anyone.  The delay in replying to your  letter  is\r\n\r\nregretted, but it never ceases to amaze the management\r\n\r\non the  extent at which the union will go to  select\r\n\r\nfutile issues.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the view of this senior officer of a Government\r\n\r\nstatutory  board,  the query is a futile  issue.  Such\r\n\r\nattitude  by  senior officers of Government  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  would only bring disruption to good industrial\r\n\r\nrelations, to say the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has invested large sums of money in\r\n\r\nsome private enterprises as joint ventures in order to\r\n\r\npromote  industrialisation and employment.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso  some  large  industries  wholly  owned  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Many of these wholly owned industries form\r\n\r\nsubsidiary companies and joint ventures on  their  own\r\n\r\nfor  supporting  services. While not criticising  such\r\n\r\nenterprising expansion of these companies, they should\r\n\r\nbe   told   to   be  cautious  of  proper   financial,\r\n\r\nsupervisory  and  management  control  by  the  parent\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enterprises are increasing and expanding.

While congratulating\r\n\r\nthese  enterprises on their business  acumen  and  far\r\n\r\nsightedness,  may I suggest that we are still  new  in\r\n\r\nthe international industrial competitive world and  if\r\n\r\nour  enterprises  are  not  careful,  they  would   be\r\n\r\nswallowed-up by bigger sharks in the industrial field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own industries must first look into the\r\n\r\npossibility  of expanding locally in order  to  create\r\n\r\nemployment   for   our   own   nationals, even    if\r\n\r\nprofitability   is   smaller  compared   to   overseas\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a large Government-owned industry which,\r\n\r\nhaving  been exempted by law from obtaining  workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation  insurance, continued to  insure  with  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  enterprise for workmen's compensation.  By\r\n\r\nso  doing, it resulted in a financial benefit  to  the\r\n\r\ncommercial insurance firm and a loss to the  industry.\r\n\r\nHaving  realised  this at a later date,  the  industry\r\n\r\ninnocently  applied  to  the Ministry  of  Labour  for\r\n\r\nexemption  only  to  be  told that  they  are  already\r\n\r\nenjoying   such   a  privilege.  This   is   only   an\r\n\r\nillustration to show that proper management control of\r\n\r\nour own enterprises is called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our top civil servants and other suitable Government\r\n\r\nnominees  sit  on the Boards of these Government-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises  and partnership companies. In  their  own\r\n\r\nMinistries  they  are  already  over-worked  to  their\r\n\r\nlimit,  and  they could not possibly  be  expected  to\r\n\r\ndevote fully to the workings of these enterprises.  It\r\n\r\nwould be unfair to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpect them to do so. The burden of responsibility  of\r\n\r\nscrutiny  and  control of proper management  of  these\r\n\r\nenterprises  must rest with the Ministry  of  Finance.\r\n\r\nAnd with the present position of the establishment  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance where there is a shortage  of 196 Division I officers. I fear that the situation  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be extremely difficult, Large sums of public\r\n\r\nfunds are invested in these enterprises which are  not\r\n\r\naccountable  either  to  shareholders  or, in   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  to Parliament. This makes the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry  of  Finance, in  respect  of  these\r\n\r\nenterprises, greater than we can reasonably expect.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister for Finance will give very  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration   to   the   possibility   of   `having.\r\n\r\nsufficient  checks  and balances  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of these Government enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one area which the Government has to look into\r\n\r\nis  in respect of a revision of entertainment expenses\r\n\r\nto various Ministries. In the past few years, the cost\r\n\r\nof  living  has  gone  up  and  so  has  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nentertainment.  In  order  to  make  amends  for   the\r\n\r\ninflationary  cost  of living, adjustments  have  been\r\n\r\nmade   to   wages.   However,  I   notice   that   the\r\n\r\nentertainment  expenses  provided  for   the   various\r\n\r\nMinistries have remained static. Most of our Ministers\r\n\r\nreceive   State  guests  and  other  eminent   foreign\r\n\r\nvisitors in their Ministries. I have been told by some\r\n\r\neminent visitors from abroad that our Ministers  could\r\n\r\nnot decently entertain their guests. It appears as  if\r\n\r\nthat  some  guests of Ministers are only  served  with\r\n\r\nsoft drinks and in some instances Chinese tea even  at\r\n\r\nan  hour  when  they should be served  with  lunch  or\r\n\r\ndinner.  I  agree that they should not be lavish  with\r\n\r\ntheir entertainment but, at the same time, they should\r\n\r\nnot appear to be Shylocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was customary for the Minister for Labour, who is\r\n\r\nhere   now,  to  invite  some  prominent  trade  union\r\n\r\nofficials to dinner at the end of each year  when  the\r\n\r\ntop  officials  of the Ministry and the  trade  unions\r\n\r\ncould  meet  in  an  informal atmosphere  and  discuss\r\n\r\nproblems  of  mutual  interest. This,  I  notice,  has\r\n\r\nceased  in  the last year or two. This is perhaps  the\r\n\r\nresult of the niggardly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentertainment expenses allotted.

Govindasamy:</b> May I, at this juncture,\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Minister for Finance  for  producing\r\n\r\nAppendix A of the Establishment List in Paper  Cmd.  4\r\n\r\nof  1976  showing the vacancy position  in  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService at the beginning of December 1975. If you  can\r\n\r\nrecall,  Sir, I asked for such a List during the  last\r\n\r\nBudget  debate  in  1975. Although the  Minister  then\r\n\r\nstated that this was somewhat difficult, I am grateful\r\n\r\nthat  the  vacancy position at least is provided  this\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, during his Budget Statement, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has handed out his quota  of  tax\r\n\r\nincreases for this month. This month's quota has  been\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  import duty on tobacco.  While  not\r\n\r\nquarrelling on this tax increase, can I take  it  that\r\n\r\nthis  tax increase is the only one for FY 76?  It  has\r\n\r\nbecome  the habit of our Government to increase  taxes\r\n\r\nor  other  forms  of  revenue not only  during  annual\r\n\r\nBudget but periodically in-between budgets. People  in\r\n\r\nSingapore do not any more look apprehensively  towards\r\n\r\nBudget  statements by the Minister for  tax  increases\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  a  habit of  increasing  taxes  and\r\n\r\nrevenue  collection in one form or another  throughout\r\n\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will this regular imposition of increased\r\n\r\ncollection of revenue by the Government and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards end?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of the motion by the Finance Minister  on\r\n\r\nthe Budget policy for FY 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must congratulate him for the way he presented the\r\n\r\nBudget  statement  and  for the  general  thoughts  on\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy. However, I would like to make  some\r\n\r\ncomments  on his Budget statement. First of  all,  and\r\n\r\nmost  notable  is  the fact that the Budget  statement\r\n\r\nthis year was described variously and by varied people\r\n\r\nas \"painless,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfriendly,\"  etc.  The Budget statement  is  obviously\r\n\r\npainless   because  the  Ministry  of   Finance   has\r\n\r\nperfected the art of taxing without appearing  to  be\r\n\r\nreally trying. The Finance Ministry has from time  to\r\n\r\ntime imposed tax increases and sometimes even without\r\n\r\nreference  to Parliament. Quite often,  news  of  tax\r\n\r\nincreases  come  out  of  golf  courses  long  before\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament realise that they are in for  a\r\n\r\nnew  tax  increase.  I think this  has  very  serious\r\n\r\nrepercussions, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of this opportunity to delve  on  some  of\r\n\r\nthese thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, the Member for Telok Blangah, has\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  on,  in Singapore  today  we  are\r\n\r\nbreeding a horde of exceptionally powerful top  civil\r\n\r\nservants and may I call them \"The Magnificent  Seven\"\r\n\r\n(or Eight, or Nine). I believe that if too much power\r\n\r\nis vested in the hands of too few, we may be courting\r\n\r\ntrouble in the years ahead. As I understand it, these\r\n\r\ntop   civil   servants  have  been  given  tremendous\r\n\r\nincentives  to  remain  at the  top  by  giving  them\r\n\r\ndirectorships of various Government-owned  companies.\r\n\r\nAs  my  colleague, the Member for Telok Blangah,  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  on, these  people  are   already\r\n\r\nheavily  taxed in terms of time and energy  in  their\r\n\r\nown Ministries and so how could they possibly give of\r\n\r\ntheir  best to run these various companies which  are\r\n\r\nwholly or partly-owned by Government? Sir, I wish the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  could throw  some  light  on  this\r\n\r\npolicy  of  appointing  the same  people  to  various\r\n\r\ncompanies.  If you look at company X, the  people  on\r\n\r\nthe  board  of directors are A, B, C,  D  and  E.  In\r\n\r\ncompany Y, it is B, C, D, E and A. In company  Z, it\r\n\r\nis C, D, E, A and B. And it goes on in that fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on a matter which I\r\n\r\nthink would be of common interest, The revenue of the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Singapore comes mainly from  taxes  and\r\n\r\nthat  taxes come from 20% or 30% of the wage  earning\r\n\r\npopulation.  Therefore, it means that something  like\r\n\r\n70%  of wage earners have, in one way or another, not\r\n\r\nbeen paying taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  all  know  that if the Finance Ministry  were  to\r\n\r\napply  its genius (and there is no shortage of genius\r\n\r\nin  the  Finance Ministry) taxes could very  well  be\r\n\r\nborne  by a greater section of the population.  This,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  means that this 20% to 30%  of  taxpayers\r\n\r\nneed  not  shoulder  the  responsibility  of  revenue\r\n\r\ncontribution. I wish to draw particular attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  hordes of taxable hawkers, shopkeepers and  such\r\n\r\nlike  people who, year in and year out, have not been\r\n\r\npaying taxes. Many of them are driving around town in\r\n\r\nMercedes Benzes, Jaguars; you name the biggest car on\r\n\r\nthe  road  and they have it. Yet the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  blatantly turned a blind eye to these people.  I\r\n\r\nthink  they should be taxed. I do not know  how  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  taxed. I feel humble to make  suggestions\r\n\r\nbut  I  trust  that the Finance Minister's  officials\r\n\r\nwill 1ook into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third matter is manpower\r\n\r\nresearch.  From  time to time we have faced  problems\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  manpower placement, projections  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  requirements and the supply for  the  years\r\n\r\nahead.  We are, in fact, facing such problems now  as\r\n\r\nwe  faced them sometime ago, the various problems  of\r\n\r\nmanpower shortage. I think it is primarily due to the\r\n\r\nfact that there is no Central Manpower Planning Unit.\r\n\r\nI understand that the Finance Ministry has a Manpower\r\n\r\nResearch  Unit.  So  has  the  Labour  Ministry,  the\r\n\r\nDefence Ministry, and perhaps even the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Why can't these various manpower  research\r\n\r\nbodies  be  combined into a Central  Research  Centre\r\n\r\nwhereby  projections can be made for the future?  One\r\n\r\nMinistry planning something quite irrelevant to  what\r\n\r\nanother  Ministry is planning can lead to  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncross-purposes and wrong projections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A last matter which I think would be of current\r\n\r\ninterest  is  the mini-tax that the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nproposed   this  time,  and  that  is,  the  somewhat\r\n\r\nfriendly  10% tax increase on cigarettes and tobacco.\r\n\r\nOn  the matter of a rather moral judgment passed, the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  called those smokers  \"anti-social\r\n\r\nelements\".  I  am  sure he is aware  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, in  his  earlier  years,  used  to   smoke\r\n\r\nsomething  like  50  cigarettes  a  day.  I  am  just\r\n\r\nwondering whether in those younger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndays  the  Prime Minister could be described as  anti-social. On the other side of the argument, the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that  it would  be  wonderful  if  all\r\n\r\nsmokers were to, now and henceforth, be good boys  and\r\n\r\ngirls and therefore give up cigarette smoking for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  their health. May I suggest to  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister that if it is his genuine intention and  also\r\n\r\nthat  of the Government to be concerned for the health\r\n\r\nof  the  people,  then  he should  increase  taxes  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes and tobacco by 200%, not 10%. Ten per  cent\r\n\r\nis  a  tax  gimmick. I treat it at  that.  With  these\r\n\r\nwords, Sir, I hope that the Finance Minister will give\r\n\r\nus  honest replies. I do hope that he will give us  an\r\n\r\nassurance that at least for the coming year there will\r\n\r\nbe  no  new  taxes between now and the next Budget  so\r\n\r\nthat  we do not have to sit in front of the television\r\n\r\nset every night to wait for the \"9 p.m. Shocker\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance  has  described  our\r\n\r\neconomy's  performance in 1975 as a  fair  one  though\r\n\r\ndisappointing  compared with the double  digit  growth\r\n\r\nrates  of earlier years. I have studied carefully  the\r\n\r\nfigures  that he presented to this House, and I  reach\r\n\r\nthe conclusion that our economic performance last year\r\n\r\nwas a very poor one. Unemployment rose to at least 6%.\r\n\r\nOur  two engines of growth, manufacturing and entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  went  into  reverse thrust,  though  signs  of\r\n\r\nrecovery  became evident in the second  half  of  last\r\n\r\nyear.  We  cannot  congratulate  ourselves  that   our\r\n\r\nservices  sector  provided some  compensatory  growth.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members  can  refer  to  columns  47-52  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Survey where they can see that we  increased\r\n\r\nour  GDP  last  year by making more  telephone  calls,\r\n\r\nriding  in  more taxis and buses, living in  more  HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  and using more electricity, gas and  water  in\r\n\r\nour  homes. These things certainly improve our welfare\r\n\r\nbut  they  hardly provide us with any  wherewithal  to\r\n\r\nsustain  our  future  standards of  living.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we  were  living on the fat  of  past  capital\r\n\r\naccumulation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members can refer to Tables 2.3 and2.6 of the\r\n\r\nEconomic Survey (cols. 135-6 and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143-4)  where they will see the heavy contribution  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government sector in both consumption and capital\r\n\r\nformation  last year. What is particularly  disturbing\r\n\r\nis the negative rate of real private capital formation\r\n\r\nof -7.5%. Despite the substantial increase of 21.9% in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  sector's capital  formation,  overall\r\n\r\ncapital formation turned Out to be -2.1%. This means a\r\n\r\ndiminution  in  the rate of growth of  our  productive\r\n\r\ncapacity and employment generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer Hon, Members to Table XX\r\n\r\non cols. 95-6 of the Economic Survey entitled \"Changes\r\n\r\nIn  GDP Deflators. 1973-75\". Two important points  may\r\n\r\nbe  noted.  One  is  that,  while  imported  inflation\r\n\r\nsubsided substantially, our GDP deflator, which is  an\r\n\r\nindex  of inflation, still rose by at least 5 percent.\r\n\r\nTable XIII on cols. 85-6 shows that our wages rose  on\r\n\r\nthe  average by 7 percent last year. The question that\r\n\r\nmust  be posed is whether our NWC recommendation  last\r\n\r\nyear and in previous years did not result in cost push\r\n\r\ninflation last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Hon. Members might wish to note\r\n\r\nin  Table XX is the surprisingly low increase  in  the\r\n\r\ndeflator  for  the  Service  Sector  of  only  3%.  In\r\n\r\nparticular, the  deflator for  Wholesale  and  Retail\r\n\r\nTrade,  Restaurants and Hotels rose by only 1 percent.\r\n\r\nGiven  the share of this sector of 28 percent of  GDP,\r\n\r\nanother  4  percent rise in the deflator would  reduce\r\n\r\nour overall real GDP growth to about 3 percent. Now. I\r\n\r\nam not saying that a mistake has been made but I would\r\n\r\nfeel  more  comfortable with some official explanation\r\n\r\nfor  the  much below average increase in the  deflator\r\n\r\nfor the Services Sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to our prospects for the current\r\n\r\nyear.  As the Minister for Finance has rightly  noted,\r\n\r\nthe economies of the U.S., Europe and Japan are in the\r\n\r\nprocess of recovery from the worst recession since the\r\n\r\nGreat  Depression. Given the slack in  our  trade  and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  our  immediate  prospects  are   good.\r\n\r\nparticularly if we can find new markets for  petroleum\r\n\r\nproducts.  Members will note that the value added  for\r\n\r\npetroleum  products in 1975 was barely  two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nthat in 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our medium-and longer-term prospects are more\r\n\r\nworrisome.   Much   would  depend  on   the   economic\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the  advance  countries  and  on  how\r\n\r\npotential  investors look at Singapore as a  base  for\r\n\r\ntheir  activities. The economic outlook for the  world\r\n\r\neconomy over the medium and long term depends on  four\r\n\r\ninterrelated factors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Price of Petroleum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this morning's headlines, at least over the\r\n\r\nshort  and  medium term, I believe we can  expect  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  petroleum to rise inexorably. Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill note that OPEC was able to raise the price of oil\r\n\r\nby  10% last year in the face of world recession which\r\n\r\nhad  reduced the demand for oil. This June or July  we\r\n\r\ncan  expect a 10-15% rise in the price of oil, for two\r\n\r\nreasons. Firstly, world demand will rise significantly\r\n\r\nwith   economic   recovery.  Secondly,   contrary   to\r\n\r\nexpectations, most OPEC countries have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nspend  substantial amounts of their oil revenue.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  should  be warned not to mistake  the  public\r\n\r\nposturing for real. Some OPEC governments are  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of buying back oil concessions at  the  least\r\n\r\nprice possible; hence they would not wish to encourage\r\n\r\nanticipation  of  further increase  in  the  price  of\r\n\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Prices of Food and Raw Materials\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor concerns the prices of food and\r\n\r\nraw  materials.  Hon. Members will remember  how  food\r\n\r\nprices  contributed  significantly  to  our  inflation\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  1973-74.  World  grain  stocks   are\r\n\r\ngenerally  low  so that minor harvest  variations  can\r\n\r\nlead  to  big  swings in food prices. Had  the  Soviet\r\n\r\nUnion  not reportedly slaughtered substantial  numbers\r\n\r\nof  cattle and poultry last year, thus reducing  their\r\n\r\ngrains  import  requirements significantly,  our  food\r\n\r\nprices would have gone up instead of going down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world economy recovers, we can also expect\r\n\r\nraw  material  prices to rise. Members will  note  the\r\n\r\nextensive world debate about whether or not there will\r\n\r\nbe  shortages of food, basic materials and energy.  On\r\n\r\nthe basis of facts presented, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  tell  who is right and  who  is  wrong.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we should bear in mind that vested interests\r\n\r\nare  involved. Interestingly enough, since the  energy\r\n\r\ncrisis  and the formation of other commodity  cartels,\r\n\r\nthe  Club  of  Rome has back-tracked from its  earlier\r\n\r\npessimistic  forecasts.  In  my  view,  however,   the\r\n\r\nsuccess of OPEC and the recent volatility of food  and\r\n\r\ncommodity prices, plus the inexorable march  of  world\r\n\r\npopulation,  should be sufficient  causes  for  alarm.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should not expect the recent falls in the\r\n\r\nprice  of  rice  to  be  a  permanent  and  continuing\r\n\r\nprocess. For the world as a whole, shortages of  food,\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  energy will mean lower  standards  and\r\n\r\nhigher  costs  of  living  unless  counterbalanced  by\r\n\r\ntechnological progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Technology\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my third point. I have been\r\n\r\nwatching the economic recovery in the U.S, with  great\r\n\r\ninterest.  So  far, the recovery has been  based  upon\r\n\r\nreplacements of inventory and some rise in consumption\r\n\r\ndemands,  but  very  little  investment,  The   weekly\r\n\r\nmagazine.  The Economist, has noted that \"the  average\r\n\r\nage  of  industrial equipment in Europe at the end  of\r\n\r\nthis 1974-76 recession is older than it was at the end\r\n\r\nof   the  1970-71  recession;  while  in  America  all\r\n\r\ncapitalists   have  ambitious  contingent   investment\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the future\". So The Economist concluded\r\n\r\nthat  the  prospects are cheerful that the  industrial\r\n\r\ncountries   may  pull  out  of  this  recession   with\r\n\r\ninvestment-led recovery. However, I would hesitate  to\r\n\r\nleap to the same conclusion. Investments can be viewed\r\n\r\nas comprising three components:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) replacement investment of aged equipment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) investment to meet demands of increasing population and affluence for existing goods and services, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) investment stimulated by new technology which result in new goods and services being demanded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists and governments usually act as though,\r\n\r\nwith  the right incentives via tax rebates and  lower\r\n\r\ninterest   rates,   new   investments   are    easily\r\n\r\nforthcoming.  The first two categories of  investment\r\n\r\nthat I mentioned earlier do indeed respond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordingly.  However, the third  type  of  investment\r\n\r\ndepends  on  technological  innovations  about   which\r\n\r\neconomists  know very little. Yet. I strongly  suspect\r\n\r\nthat, without   such  innovative  investments,   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries will suffer from dynamic  under-employment as opposed to the static kind of  Keynesian\r\n\r\nunemployment.  In my view, technical innovations  take\r\n\r\nplace  in  two stages. The first occurs when some  new\r\n\r\nidea  strikes  some obscure scientist in  some  humble\r\n\r\nlaboratory. Years, perhaps decades or centuries later,\r\n\r\nsuch new ideas may be implemented commercially via the\r\n\r\nmuch vaunted Research and Development of corporations.\r\n\r\nA breakthrough like the steam engine, jet engines, the\r\n\r\ntransistor and petrochemicals leads to the creation of\r\n\r\nwhole  new  industries,  resulting  in  much  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and new employment because even old industries\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  the  input demand and expenditure  from\r\n\r\nrising   incomes,  The  trouble  is  that  we   cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee  sufficient innovations. Witness the  meagre\r\n\r\nresults  of  billions  of dollars  of  expenditure  of\r\n\r\nbrilliant  manpower and expensive equipment in  cancer\r\n\r\nresearch.  In  the  current world  economic  recovery,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the advanced countries and the  developing\r\n\r\ncountries  in  consequence, may suffer from  prolonged\r\n\r\nunemployment, if there is inadequate investment of the\r\n\r\ninnovative  type.  If this should be  the  case,  more\r\n\r\ninflation will result as Government frantically try to\r\n\r\nprevent   unemployment   by   Keynesian   pump-priming\r\n\r\ntechniques of deficit financing and increases in money\r\n\r\nsupply.   Moreover.   Governments,   hard-pressed   by\r\n\r\nunemployment,  may  try to export it  via  competitive\r\n\r\ndevaluations  of their currencies and  via  protective\r\n\r\ntrade  measures  The recent turmoil in European  money\r\n\r\nmarkets involving sterling and the French Franc  is  a\r\n\r\nsymptom of what I am describing. Unfortunately, we can\r\n\r\nonly watch with anguish to see if new investments  are\r\n\r\nsufficiently  forthcoming in the  advanced  countries.\r\n\r\nMembers   will   note  that  virtually  every   report\r\n\r\nindicates   the   seriousness   and   persistence   of\r\n\r\nunemployment in the industrial countries  for  several\r\n\r\nyears  to  come, and I believe the Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah made an earlier reference to the same point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. International Monetary Arrangements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point concerns international monetary\r\n\r\narrangements.  In November last year, the  leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe   six  largest  industrial  nations  met  at   the\r\n\r\nRambouillet   Summit  to  try  and  coordinate   their\r\n\r\neconomic  policies. Among the agreements reached  were\r\n\r\npresumably those measures adopted by the International\r\n\r\nMonetary  Fund's  committee  on  monetary  reform   in\r\n\r\nJanuary this year at Jamaica. In particular, the major\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries agreed to contain  gyrations  in\r\n\r\nexchange  rates of their currencies by mutual  support\r\n\r\noperations. The official price of gold was  abolished.\r\n\r\nIn addition the IMF will sell off 1/6th of its gold to\r\n\r\nbenefit  poor developing countries and return  another\r\n\r\n1/6th  to member-countries. The committee also  agreed\r\n\r\nto  boost  IMF  quotas by 33%, thus  increasing  their\r\n\r\nborrowing capacity accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I view all these measures as inflationary. Already,\r\n\r\nthe  floating  of exchange rates has made  governments\r\n\r\nfeel  freer  in  disposing of their  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nreserves, since they are no longer committed to defend\r\n\r\nexchange   rates   within  fixed  margins.   Moreover.\r\n\r\ncountries  feel  freer to pursue  their  own  monetary\r\n\r\npolicies  to meet domestic objectives without worrying\r\n\r\ntoo  much about the balance of payments. The agreement\r\n\r\nto   contain  exchange  rate  fluctuations   is   also\r\n\r\ninflationary because it attacks the symptoms  and  not\r\n\r\nthe  causes  of  the  disease. As  long  as  divergent\r\n\r\ndomestic  imperatives  of unemployment  and  inflation\r\n\r\nresult  in  different rates of money supply  increases\r\n\r\nand  budget deficits, exchange rates cannot be stable.\r\n\r\nTo  compound  difficulties, relatively  free  capital\r\n\r\nmovements  between countries will mean that  inflation\r\n\r\nwill  be  freely  exported and  re-exported.  If,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a major industrial country were to  increase\r\n\r\nits  money supply unduly compared to others, this will\r\n\r\ncause  capital to move out, and its currency value  to\r\n\r\ndepreciate.  By the Rambouillet agreement,  the  other\r\n\r\nmajor industrial countries will step in to prevent too\r\n\r\nlarge a depreciation of the currency in question. This\r\n\r\nresults   in  unintended  increases  in  their   money\r\n\r\nsupplies as domestic currency must be used to  buy  up\r\n\r\nforeign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abolition of the official price of gold\r\n\r\nincreases  the value of gold reserves by a  factor  of\r\n\r\nthree as the market price is at least three times  the\r\n\r\nofficial  price  of  gold. This effectively  increases\r\n\r\nworld reserves by some US$80 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, from the analysis of the four factors of\r\n\r\nprices   of   petroleum,  food  and   raw   materials,\r\n\r\ntechnology and international monetary arrangements, we\r\n\r\ncan  conclude that while the world economy  should  do\r\n\r\nwell  this year, and perhaps the next, the longer term\r\n\r\noutlook is clouded with much uncertainty. Inflation is\r\n\r\nan abiding problem even though excess capacity of some\r\n\r\n10-20%  has been reported. Bottlenecks will  occur  as\r\n\r\nthe  excess capacity is not uniformly spread  and  the\r\n\r\nvelocity  of  circulation  of  money  will  rise  with\r\n\r\nincreasing economic activity. Hence, unless the  world\r\n\r\nhas  a  good  harvest this summer and  OPEC  exercises\r\n\r\nrestraint,  we  can expect prices to be  on  the  move\r\n\r\nagain in the second half of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then can we conclude about Singapore's economic\r\n\r\nprospects? This year, and perhaps 1977, we  should  do\r\n\r\nreasonably well, perhaps briefly even touching double-digit  growth rates again. However, unemployment could\r\n\r\nbecome   a   serious   problem, if   sufficient   new\r\n\r\ninvestments are not forthcoming. We should not  forget\r\n\r\nthat  we  are in keen competition with other countries\r\n\r\nand  with other regions. We face what may be described\r\n\r\nas  a  sandwich problem. In low technology areas, our\r\n\r\nexisting  industries can expect, tough competition  as\r\n\r\nother  developing nations learn the ropes of industry.\r\n\r\nIn  higher  technology fields, we must  attract  firms\r\n\r\nfrom  the  advanced countries and upgrade our existing\r\n\r\nones.   Both  are  not  easy  to  achieve.  It   would\r\n\r\nconsequently be fatal for us to indulge in euphoria as\r\n\r\nwe  recover from the recession. Instead, we should re-examine  our  work habits and attitudes.  Do  we  take\r\n\r\nsufficient pride in our work, or do we care  only  for\r\n\r\nquick  profits  and quick returns? Do we  deserve  the\r\n\r\nwage  and  salary increases that we have had over  the\r\n\r\npast several years? Our young\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngraduates  from the schools, colleges and universities\r\n\r\nshould  orientate  their attitudes  correctly  -  they\r\n\r\nshould  display  eagerness to learn  and  proper  team\r\n\r\nspirit, take great pride in their work and expect  to\r\n\r\nwork hard for their promotions and wage increases.  In\r\n\r\ntimes  of general economic boom even mediocre managers\r\n\r\nand  executives can be successful; in times  of  tough\r\n\r\ncompetition, only the ablest and the fittest survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, if our economy is to stand up to the\r\n\r\nrigours of international competition and if we are  to\r\n\r\nweather  future recessions successfully, our  services\r\n\r\nand  products must bear the hallmarks of  quality  and\r\n\r\nreliability   and  our  people  and   leaders   should\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  the  capacity to bear sacrifices  and  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to  changing conditions with minimum  trauma.\r\n\r\nOur  economy was hard hit in the last two years by the\r\n\r\nworld  recession, Let us make no mistake  about  that?\r\n\r\nThe  lesson  should not be lost on us as we  face  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should re-double our efforts to sell our goods\r\n\r\nand  services abroad. In this connection,  the  recent\r\n\r\nmove  to  set up the export credit insurance guarantee\r\n\r\nscheme  is a step in the right direction. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance also mentioned that, last year,  we  sent\r\n\r\nsix  major  trade  missions abroad  while  30  foreign\r\n\r\nmissions came to Singapore. I hope we can reverse  the\r\n\r\nfigures in future years!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now offer some comments about recent\r\n\r\ndevelopments in ASEAN. The Prime Minister said rightly\r\n\r\nin  Bali recently that \"the basic question is  how  to\r\n\r\nensure  continuing  stability by stimulating  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment to resolve social and political  problems.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, increasing disaffection and discontent will\r\n\r\nfuel    incipient    insurgencies   into    full-scale\r\n\r\nrevolutions\".  In the other four ASEAN countries,  the\r\n\r\nkey   economic   problem   is   not   industrial   but\r\n\r\nagricultural  in nature. Yet, despite a resolution  to\r\n\r\nstabilise    commodity   prices   and   to   intensify\r\n\r\ncooperation  in  the production of basic  necessities.\r\n\r\nparticularly for food and energy, more attention seems\r\n\r\nto   have   been  paid  to  industrial   rather   than\r\n\r\nagricultural  development in the  region.  The  urgent\r\n\r\nneed is to improve the lot of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeasant if communist insurgency is to be contained. In\r\n\r\norder  to  attract more investments into  the  region,\r\n\r\nASEAN as an organisation could jointly provide as well\r\n\r\nas  seek  investment guarantees for long-term  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I offer some comments on some non-economic policy issues in Singapore? I am particularly\r\n\r\nconcerned about the use of sterilization as a means of\r\n\r\ngetting children into choice schools and as a means of\r\n\r\nobtaining marriage licences for non-citizens.  Fifteen\r\n\r\npriests recently voiced their objection to these moves\r\n\r\nin  an  open letter to the Prime Minister.  While  the\r\n\r\nwording  of the letter is too strong, the moral  issue\r\n\r\nis  a  genuine  one.  Government is rightly  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  excessive population growth but it  should  not\r\n\r\nadvocate  immoral means to attain its good objectives.\r\n\r\n\"Render  to Caesar the things which are Caesar's,  and\r\n\r\nto  God  the  things which are God's\" says the  Bible.\r\n\r\nPriests   should   not  govern  but   neither   should\r\n\r\ngovernment  attempt  to  influence  individual   moral\r\n\r\nchoices.  Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately I was  abroad\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on the Abortion Bill. I  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to register my strong objection  on  moral\r\n\r\ngrounds. I believe the Member for Punggol is  with  me\r\n\r\non  these issues. With these reservations, I  give  my\r\n\r\nsupport to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement\r\n\r\nthis  year  came  to this conclusion,  \"the  financial\r\n\r\npolicy  outlined  in  this  year's  Statement   is   a\r\n\r\nrelatively unexciting one.\" Viewed from the context of\r\n\r\nthis  budget,  this  conclusion is  correct.  However,\r\n\r\ncertain exciting financial measures announced earlier,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  increases in car registration fees and  road\r\n\r\ntax,  and the way they were announced were not  to  be\r\n\r\nfound  in  the  Annual Budget Statement.  We  have  no\r\n\r\nreason  to believe that such unusual measures and  the\r\n\r\nway  they  were announced will not be repeated  before\r\n\r\nthe next Budget statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his statement the Minister said\r\n\r\nthat on 1st February, 1976 the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal number of vacancies for Division I officers  has\r\n\r\ndropped  to 2,414. This is a large number of vacancies\r\n\r\nfor  Division  I posts. According to his  explanation,\r\n\r\nthe reason is that the salary scales in the Government\r\n\r\nservice  cannot  compete with the private  sector  for\r\n\r\nsuch personnel. The point is if these Division I civil\r\n\r\nservants  have left their service merely because  they\r\n\r\nwant  a higher pay, then I think it is better for such\r\n\r\nself-seeking officers to leave, This may  be  for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of  the  Government and the public. However,  if\r\n\r\nthey  leave  the service not for monetary  gains,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps  for the unfair allocation of duties or  their\r\n\r\nsuperior  officers  have been too demanding  on  them,\r\n\r\nthen the Government should do something to rectify the\r\n\r\nsituation.  Otherwise, such vacancies  will  never  be\r\n\r\nfilled satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance our efficiency and to compete in\r\n\r\nthe  international  market, we cannot  just  hope  and\r\n\r\nexpect  the  workers  alone  to  work  harder  and  be\r\n\r\nforbearing. At the same time, we should also hope  and\r\n\r\nexpect  our  Division I officers to be as  hardworking\r\n\r\nand  forbearing as our workers, If we are  all  imbued\r\n\r\nwith  the  same  sense of national  consciousness  and\r\n\r\nplace national collective interests above our personal\r\n\r\ninterests, then there should not be such frequent job-hopping  from  the Government service to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  Therefore,  I  hope  that  in  filling   such\r\n\r\nvacancies  vital  factors such as personal  integrity,\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  dedication to service are  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount.  A  capable  civil servant  without  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness is not a good civil servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the only tax increase is that on\r\n\r\ntobacco. This measure should be welcome by the  public\r\n\r\nfor  the  reason  that  it will  discourage  cigarette\r\n\r\nsmoking and reduce hazards to health. However, as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  pointed out, despite  warnings  on  the\r\n\r\nhazards  to  health  and the ban on advertisements  on\r\n\r\ncigarette  smoking, tobacco consumption is  increasing\r\n\r\nand many young people are taking to cigarette smoking,\r\n\r\nmuch  to the regret of the Finance Minister. I believe\r\n\r\nmany  parents  have the same feeling  as  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  aware  that  not  a  few  young  people  take  to\r\n\r\ncigarette  smoking as soon as they are  inducted  into\r\n\r\nthe  National Service. Since the Minister  feels  that\r\n\r\ntobacco is \"poisonous\" and smoking is an \"anti-social\"\r\n\r\nact  and  besides it would \"increase the risk of  lung\r\n\r\ncancer  and  cancer of the nose\". I hope  he  and  his\r\n\r\nCabinet  colleagues will try to find out, on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  why our National Servicemen are taking  to  the\r\n\r\nbad  habit  of cigarette smoking so soon  after  their\r\n\r\ninduction. On the other hand. I hope he will seriously\r\n\r\nconsider   legislation  to  place  an  age  limit   on\r\n\r\ncigarette smoking. For example, just as we have  place\r\n\r\nan  age  limit on eligibility to apply for  a  driving\r\n\r\nlicence,  or an age limit on persons who  want  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  a  bar,  we can place an age limit on  cigarette\r\n\r\nsmoking. Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that cancer is not\r\n\r\nconfined to a particular age group. Therefore, I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance will try his best to persuade\r\n\r\nhis  Cabinet Colleagues to give up smoking  early.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, they could keep themselves healthy; on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand they as elders could literally set a  good\r\n\r\nexample  to the younger generation. \"in speech  as  in\r\n\r\npractice\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nlistened, with growing depression, to the discourse of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Whampoa upon  our  bleak  future  in\r\n\r\neconomic  terms. Correct as he may be in his forecast,\r\n\r\nthe  point  still remains that since the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nPacific  War,  the last ten years -the  years  of  our\r\n\r\nindependence  - have been by far the most  comfortable\r\n\r\nand  satisfying  for the bulk of our  citizens.  True,\r\n\r\nthere  have been one or two anxieties. In 1968  strict\r\n\r\nlabour legislation had to be enacted to enable  us  to\r\n\r\nface up to the anticipated British withdrawal. In 1969\r\n\r\nwe   faced  for  a  few  days  the  threat  of   civil\r\n\r\ndisturbance, and, as has been pointed out  already  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, the immediate future does not seem to  be\r\n\r\ntoo  good. But by and large 1965-75 has been a  decade\r\n\r\nof  impressive and assuring performance. The people  - citizens and leaders - have worked hard to make for  a\r\n\r\nswift and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunprecedented  growth. Our GNP nearly tripled  in  the\r\n\r\nlast decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's skyline has been transformed out of all\r\n\r\nresemblance  to the old water-front scene  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  shining  new skyscrapers in the Central  Business\r\n\r\nDistrict  and  the high-rise apartment  buildings  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  constructed everywhere.  The  general\r\n\r\nstandard   of  living  of  the  people  has  obviously\r\n\r\nimproved  with greater than ever consumption of  goods\r\n\r\nand services beyond the basic survival needs, and at a\r\n\r\nfair  level  of comfort. Money paid Out in  wages,  at\r\n\r\nleast by employers paying the payroll tax, in the last\r\n\r\nfinancial year was about equal to that paid out during\r\n\r\nthe whole of the first five years of our independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite such progress, and partly because of it,\r\n\r\nthere  somehow  seems  to me to  be  some  fundamental\r\n\r\nquality  or  qualities  lacking  in  the  Singaporean.\r\n\r\nBasically  this  shortcoming consists  of  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nconcern  for others that amounts in some cases  almost\r\n\r\nto  an obsession with selfish interests. Too often,  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  is  disinclined to look  beyond  his  own\r\n\r\nimmediate circumstances to the realities of the larger\r\n\r\nworld  around him. He has also generally not been  too\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  striking  a  proper  balance   between\r\n\r\npersonal goals and group goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what has been the cause of this unrelenting\r\n\r\ndevotion  to individualistic and (I am afraid)  short-sighted  goals? It was our own successful development,\r\n\r\nand  the high expectations of the material quality  of\r\n\r\nliving it has engendered, that has perhaps resulted in\r\n\r\nthis  particular condition. It seems to  me  that  our\r\n\r\nstrategy   of   emphasis  on  certain  values   deemed\r\n\r\nnecessary  for development has resulted in a  kind  of\r\n\r\nover-kill, inadequately tempered as this strategy  has\r\n\r\nbeen   by   non-materialistic   considerations,   like\r\n\r\ncultural   interest,   aesthetic   appreciation,   and\r\n\r\nconsideration of religious and traditional values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what generally are the virtues, the qualities of\r\n\r\nour development-oriented persons that we have only too\r\n\r\nwell succeeded in inculcating? They are chiefly (a)  a\r\n\r\npowerful  need for achievement. (b) the urge  to  act.\r\n\r\n(c) far-sightedness, in terms of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity for material advancement, (d) interest  in\r\n\r\ncareer, not  necessarily  in  a  job  -what  may  `be\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  low  job primacy, (e)  high  motivation\r\n\r\ntowards  material returns, (f) occupational  mobility,\r\n\r\nand (g) indifference to religious or cultural matters.\r\n\r\nWith  this  array, it is no wonder that  we  have  had\r\n\r\nexamples  of  young civil servants  leaving, after  a\r\n\r\nwhile,  for  greener and richer pastures.  At  another\r\n\r\nlevel,  job-hopping  was recently a  noted  phenomenon\r\n\r\namong  our young people. And we have also, as a result\r\n\r\nof  this development-orientation, a preoccupation with\r\n\r\na  task, with a job, with something to do and perform,\r\n\r\nand  very  little  concern for  the  person,  for  the\r\n\r\nindividual,  for  other graces.  And  indifference  to\r\n\r\nreligious and cultural matters has not made things any\r\n\r\nbetter  in this respect. And for this reason I applaud\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member  for Whampoa said in  the  last  few\r\n\r\nsentences of his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, a factor contributing to our\r\n\r\ninordinate sense of well-being and complacency is  the\r\n\r\nkind  of praise that we have constantly received  from\r\n\r\noutside.  Many of the views representing  what  others\r\n\r\nsay  about us all over the world are expressed by such\r\n\r\nreferences as dazzling growth:\r\n\r\nextraordinary techniques of statecraft; Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbroken  inexorably  with the  past  and  leaped  self-assuredly  into  the  future  with  a  roar  that   is\r\n\r\nresounding  round  the world; our  life-style  has  no\r\n\r\nparallel  in  Southeast Asia. We  stand  high  in  the\r\n\r\nesteem  of the most developed countries of the  world.\r\n\r\nWe are the political light of the region. Singapore is\r\n\r\nthe  most  remarkable city on earth - and so on,  with\r\n\r\nadulation far exceeding criticism. I wonder how  these\r\n\r\nwriters   and   journalists  who  have   echoed   such\r\n\r\nresounding praise of Singapore would treat  us  if  we\r\n\r\nget into serious difficulty, especially as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  possible over-confidence that such adulation  can\r\n\r\nengender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time our own newspapers are not backward\r\n\r\nin taking up this same cue of pandering to the ego and\r\n\r\nconceit  of the Singaporean. Headlines have said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the best base for oil supply;  so  many\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars have been spent to do this, that  and\r\n\r\nthe other. Singapore is the top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregional  centre  for  such and such  kind  of  trade.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is the top tourist spot in Asia.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a centre for technical expertise. Singapore is the\r\n\r\ntop  maker  of  \"jackups\", whatever  that  may  mean.\r\n\r\nSingapore will be the first Asian country possibly  to\r\n\r\ngreet  the two millionth tourist in 1979. There  is  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  way  to  a  richer  ASEAN.  These  headline\r\n\r\nimpressions  were  gathered from about  a  fortnight's\r\n\r\nreading  of two English language newspapers. Even  our\r\n\r\nroad taxes have become the talk of the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this kind of ambience. Mr Speaker, Sir, how do\r\n\r\nyou  expect  a young emerging community  to  react?  I\r\n\r\nshall  tell  you.  Mr  Speaker. Sir.  Recently  I  had\r\n\r\noccasion  to  review essays written by  students  from\r\n\r\nhigher educational institutions in Singapore, who were\r\n\r\ncompeting  for  scholarships to attend summer  schools\r\n\r\nabroad.  Too frequently, when these students  referred\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, they reflected a sense of  complacence\r\n\r\nand superiority from Singapore's success. It seemed to\r\n\r\nme  they felt that with Singapore the way it was,  the\r\n\r\nwhole world was their oyster. Do you think, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nsuch smugness can help in developing a sense of social\r\n\r\nresponsibility?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many indications of inability or\r\n\r\nreluctance to subordinate personal interest  to  group\r\n\r\ninterest.  Look  at the way industrial accidents  have\r\n\r\nhappened.  From  another angle, if  you  look  at  the\r\n\r\nconditions in which workers are frequently transported\r\n\r\nto  their  place of work, loaded in open lorries,  you\r\n\r\nwill  feel  here  another indication of  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nconcern for people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In various spheres of activity, further\r\n\r\nillustrations may be found. In national service  there\r\n\r\nmay  be enough instances to show how the eagerness  to\r\n\r\nlook forward to the run-Out date (ROD) has resulted in\r\n\r\na  lowering of concern with continuing responsibility.\r\n\r\nOn  another  point, I have heard of cases of  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  losing items of equipment issued  to  them\r\n\r\nand,  instead  of taking the responsibility  for  this\r\n\r\nloss,  they expropriate the missing item from somebody\r\n\r\nelse who is left to shoulder this responsibility if he\r\n\r\nis unable to steal from somebody else\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain.  Inasmuch  as  it has been found  difficult  to\r\n\r\nretain administrative officers in the civil service, I\r\n\r\nwould not be surprised if the same difficulty is faced\r\n\r\nin  the SAF of recruitment into the officer-class  and\r\n\r\nretention of officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is skiving in the Special Constabulary: a\r\n\r\nreluctance  to  do  the small national  service  stint\r\n\r\nbecause of the boredom of the activity. Again, here it\r\n\r\nis  not  the thought of service, the subordination  of\r\n\r\nindividual   interest   to   the   group   need,   but\r\n\r\ninconvenience to self that is the paramount concern in\r\n\r\nmany instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another way, complaints not too long ago about\r\n\r\nthe  poor standards of finish in the building industry\r\n\r\nare  also  a pointer, Take for example, all  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen said about the quality of finish in HDB flats. We\r\n\r\nmeet with many instances, when we order a service or a\r\n\r\ngood,  of  eagerness to get a job done and be finished\r\n\r\nand  for  the bill to be settled as soon as  possible.\r\n\r\nOne  fairly  persistent example of  this  is  the  way\r\n\r\ncontractors do road surfacing work. Because of lack of\r\n\r\nsupervision  I  am  sure that in many  instances  such\r\n\r\ncontractors  are allowed to get away with sub-standard\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roads, you see how self-centred the motorist\r\n\r\nis.  Instances of aggressive driving and lack of  road\r\n\r\ncourtesy  abound.  Sometimes this egotism  has  become\r\n\r\nobsessive  as  when  misunderstandings  arising   from\r\n\r\nmotoring  incidents have led to ugly  scenes.  Once  a\r\n\r\nMercedes-flaunting young executive or businessman  was\r\n\r\nbooked  by a traffic policeman for a parking  offence.\r\n\r\nThe  owner  of  the  Mercedes  disdainfully  told  the\r\n\r\npoliceman  that he could pay quite easily the  traffic\r\n\r\nfine  he  expected would be imposed, and promised  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  policeman that he would come back to  indulge\r\n\r\nhis expensive parking habit again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reference to the Mercedes has put me in mind of\r\n\r\ntop  civil  servants. In their case too, preoccupation\r\n\r\nwith their special concerns has sometimes pushed aside\r\n\r\nmore  civil  considerations, The  Head  of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService has mentioned that in a number of instances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncivil  servants have contrived to get laws  passed  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to do their work more easily. I would  go\r\n\r\nfurther  to say that, if necessary, the civil  servant\r\n\r\nwill now and then even ignore legislation in order  to\r\n\r\nsuit his own convenience. For example, a few years ago\r\n\r\nwe  had  a publicised instance of the law relating  to\r\n\r\nadvanced accounts not being observed, and this was the\r\n\r\nsubject of some newspaper comment and a reply from the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance.  In this  case, audit  reports\r\n\r\npointed  out  the fact of advanced accounts  exceeding\r\n\r\nthe  authorised limits for the years 1965 to  1969/70,\r\n\r\nbut no attempt was made to seek Parliament approval to\r\n\r\nraise the limit until 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then we have continued to meet with similar\r\n\r\ninstances  of the law not being observed.  Two  recent\r\n\r\nexamples  come  to  my mind: one, in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nvaluation   of   our  investments  in  our   financial\r\n\r\nstatements, and another the failure to  show  certain\r\n\r\ncivilian  posts  under  Expenditure  on  Manpower  (as\r\n\r\nrequired  by  law), instead of under  Other  Operating\r\n\r\nExpenditure,  of  the  Ministry  of  Defence  Head  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to make the law more applicable were not\r\n\r\ninstituted until these irregularities were reported to\r\n\r\nParliament.  In this connection. I am not saying  that\r\n\r\nwe should retain outdated regulations, but if what has\r\n\r\nbeen  laid down by Parliament is considered not to  be\r\n\r\napplicable  under changed circumstances,  then  action\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken to change regulations promptly;  and\r\n\r\nnot  just ignore these regulations (in some cases  for\r\n\r\nseveral  years),  thus setting an example  of  placing\r\n\r\nexpediency  before correct behaviour. If such  actions\r\n\r\nreflect  indifferent regard for the authority of  this\r\n\r\nHouse, can  we  expect  the public  to  receive  more\r\n\r\nconsideration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying all this, we have the background of our\r\n\r\nvery recent forbears being migrants who were primarily\r\n\r\ninterested   in  getting  what  they  could   out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is well-accepted and has been referred\r\n\r\nto  more than once even by our political leaders.  Now\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  assess to what extent this attitude  has\r\n\r\npercolated  down  to  the younger generation.  If  our\r\n\r\nschooling has been successful, then our young people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  have  different  attitudes.  But  in  the  very\r\n\r\nrespect  of  a  sense of values directed towards  more\r\n\r\ngracious  relations between people, our education  has\r\n\r\nnot   been  so  successful.  Our  education  has  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful   in  emphasising  the  very  developmental\r\n\r\ntraits that I have referred to earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we must not take for granted that what is\r\n\r\nlearnt  in school receives reinforcement at  home.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  values  inculcated in school may be  in  direct\r\n\r\nconflict  with values at home. One exercise we  should\r\n\r\ntry  to embark on is to reach Out to the homes to  try\r\n\r\nand  engender social support for the values learnt  in\r\n\r\nschool.  I  am  sure  there will  be  several  Members\r\n\r\ndwelling and expanding on this point and similar ideas\r\n\r\nwhen we come to the debate on Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of moulding the right attitudes in\r\n\r\nour young people cannot be overemphasised, considering\r\n\r\nthe   wide   ramifications  of  the  result   of   our\r\n\r\neducational efforts. Let us consider. A young man  who\r\n\r\nis  about to cast his vote may well have had  all  his\r\n\r\nyears  of  education and further education  under  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  jurisdiction. In a few  years'  time  he\r\n\r\nwill  marry  and begin to have a family. How  will  he\r\n\r\nbring  up that family, that second generation  of  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  Presently  our  young  people  are  not\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government; they are not  anti-national,\r\n\r\nthey  are not even anti-PAP. Despite a few who try  to\r\n\r\navoid national service more for reasons of wanting  to\r\n\r\navoid personal discomfort, generally the acceptance of\r\n\r\nnational  service  shows  that  the  people  are   not\r\n\r\nagainst,  indeed they recognise the need for, measures\r\n\r\ntaken in the national interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is important to note is this. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  our  young  people are all fully  committed  to\r\n\r\nexactly the same values as the Establishment. This may\r\n\r\nbe simply because many of them are not certain of what\r\n\r\nit  is  that  is  desirable in terms of  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nSingapore they want. What one can be certain about  is\r\n\r\nthat they want to feel that they are participants, not\r\n\r\nmerely people being directed and told what to do, They\r\n\r\ndo not want to be part of a system where they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare the ruled and others the rulers. They want to have\r\n\r\na say. That is why the People's Association appears to\r\n\r\nface  difficulties because it is organising for  young\r\n\r\npeople.   Perhaps  the  young  people  want  to   find\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  a  position where  they  can  organise\r\n\r\nthings for themselves!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more thoughtful and socially motivated want to\r\n\r\nparticipate   in   activities   aimed   at   community\r\n\r\nimprovement.  It  is in this way that  we  could  help\r\n\r\narrange  opportunities for young people to  understand\r\n\r\nworthwhile,  genuine and practical relationships  with\r\n\r\none  another, not the vague, phony rapport and freedom\r\n\r\nproclaimed in the advertisements directed at  the  new\r\n\r\ngeneration.  We should help our young  people  find  a\r\n\r\nuseful  role for themselves, but they want to identify\r\n\r\nthis role themselves. Certainly we should not tolerate\r\n\r\nlaziness and skiving, complacence and truculence.  But\r\n\r\nwe should not treat our young citizens in the same way\r\n\r\nas, in the past, the Ministry of Education has treated\r\n\r\nour  teachers, many of whom have not yet got over  the\r\n\r\ntrauma of exposure to over-bearing officialdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our younger citizens have generally not known the\r\n\r\nhardships  their  elders  have  experienced  in  their\r\n\r\nlifetime.    These    same   older    folk    (perhaps\r\n\r\nunderstandably)  in the flush of good  times  want  to\r\n\r\npush  out  of their minds the trouble they have  faced\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among our younger citizens, those who are reaching\r\n\r\ntheir majority years will remember best these last ten\r\n\r\nyears  of good going, of more and more consumer  goods\r\n\r\ncoming  within  their  means  of  enjoyment:  clothes,\r\n\r\nentertainment,  TV (including colour),  perhaps  cars,\r\n\r\nleisure  outings. They have been assured of places  in\r\n\r\nprimary schools and enjoyed opportunity to proceed for\r\n\r\nfurther and higher education. In many instances  their\r\n\r\nparents  have bought flats built by Government;  these\r\n\r\nsame  parents  perhaps  with the  disapproval  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah have spent sizable sums  and\r\n\r\nconsiderable  effort to redecorate and  furnish  these\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious political and national crises, conflict and\r\n\r\nwars  are  quite  foreign to  the  experience  of  our\r\n\r\nyounger citizens. In the West, in socialist countries,\r\n\r\nyoung  people are in some way constantly  reminded  of\r\n\r\nhow their countries have faced serious situations. For\r\n\r\nexample,  we ourselves have seen such films on  TV  as\r\n\r\nCities  at  War, World at War, even comedy  programmes\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Dad's  Army.  Our young  people  view  these\r\n\r\ndetachedly. To a Western youth, they would  be  subtle\r\n\r\ninsights   to  a  more  turbulent  past  his  parents'\r\n\r\ngeneration   experienced.   Other   things   such   as\r\n\r\nmemorials, monuments, ceremonies, and so on are  other\r\n\r\nforms  of  reminders of grimmer times. Our own  youths\r\n\r\nhave remained in more blissful condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education and social upbringing of our young\r\n\r\npeople  have not conduced to encouraging them  to  see\r\n\r\ntheir  world  as  a  larger place than  their  housing\r\n\r\nestate    and    transcending   parochial    Singapore\r\n\r\ncircumstances. In this they have not been better  than\r\n\r\ntheir  elders. Schools have stressed examinations  (at\r\n\r\nthis  level, this is the test of meritocracy). I  have\r\n\r\nhad  some  thoughtful young people in my constituency,\r\n\r\nas  I  am  sure other MPs have in theirs,  complaining\r\n\r\nthat   newspapers  and  mass  media   and   Government\r\n\r\nattention  have not focussed the notice  of  youth  on\r\n\r\nconcerns  beyond the circle of light  which  they  see\r\n\r\nfrom  inside  their wells. I think we should  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully  before  blaming a  member  of  our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration for his limited perspectives, even if  such\r\n\r\nperspectives  tend  to  make  him  also  an  egotistic\r\n\r\nindividual.  Especially when we think of the  sins  of\r\n\r\nthe fathers being visited upon their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what can we do about such a circumstance that\r\n\r\nhas  arisen? Our Government has always worked  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of attending to first things first. That is  why\r\n\r\nthere  has been so much emphasis throughout all  these\r\n\r\nyears  on economic and material development.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  in respect of our education policy there has been\r\n\r\na  stress on the preparation for work, development  of\r\n\r\nskills and so on. While we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertainly cannot let up on our development thrust,  we\r\n\r\nshould  make  adjustment  for  development  of  values\r\n\r\nimportant  for  society, for harmonious  living,  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment of rounded and mature citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think the time has now come for us to\r\n\r\nthink  of  a  policy  which will  lay  stress  on  the\r\n\r\ninculcation  of  healthy  values  which  balance  self\r\n\r\nagainst  the needs of the community, not only  in  our\r\n\r\npupils in school but also more broadly the message has\r\n\r\nto be carried across to the adult citizens at home.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  mean by policy that we should determine  what\r\n\r\nkind  of people we want to produce in specific  terms:\r\n\r\nwe  cannot make people in the splitting image of  some\r\n\r\npreconceived mould; we cannot make people in  our  own\r\n\r\nimage  and  likeness;  but we want  to  encourage  and\r\n\r\npromote  actively the development of a healthy pattern\r\n\r\nof  values. This aspect we have before left to develop\r\n\r\nincidentally. Now we have to attend to this matter  in\r\n\r\na more deliberate fashion. I think the time is ripe, I\r\n\r\nthink the problem is urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this, the two Ministries that appear to have\r\n\r\nthe  most important role to play would be the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture and the Ministry of Education. I would not\r\n\r\nlike to preempt on what may be said when the debate on\r\n\r\neducation  and culture gets under way, but I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthere will be plenty said and I would have one or  two\r\n\r\nthings to say myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moments of melancholy, in\r\n\r\nrespect of these thoughts I have expressed. I may feel\r\n\r\nthat  indeed a grave situation has arisen.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nnever  in doubt that the Government, with the help  of\r\n\r\nits  Backbenchers,  will  take  successful  action  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  the  situation  -  with  the  help   of   the\r\n\r\nBackbenchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, whilst I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support  of the motion moved  by  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, I would like to make  reference\r\n\r\nto  the  policy on taxation with regard to income  tax\r\n\r\nand other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the revenue from Income Tax is\r\n\r\nforecast  to  rise  by  9.1%  to  $1,200  million,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $100 million. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontained  in  Table II, page 3, of the Memorandum  on\r\n\r\nthe Main and Development Estimates of Singapore (Paper\r\n\r\nMisc.  4 of 1976). In reply to my question on the  1st\r\n\r\nof this month, the Finance Minister asked me to listen\r\n\r\nto  his  Budget statement and to bring up this  matter\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate on his statement. And  the  matter\r\n\r\nthat  I  brought  up was the question  of  income  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, Sir, I envisaged that either\r\n\r\nthere  was  some hope to my question when he indicated\r\n\r\nto  this House that he would give a full reply, or  it\r\n\r\nmay not be. Whatever it may be, Sir, I would still try\r\n\r\nmy best to make a case for his careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being optimistic that our Finance Minister is not\r\n\r\nunsympathetic.  I  believe that this  appeal  of  mine\r\n\r\naffects  both thousands of middle income group workers\r\n\r\nas  well  as  revenue to the State's coffers.  To  the\r\n\r\nformer, present-day cost of living has shot up  beyond\r\n\r\nall proportions, even though the Government is able to\r\n\r\ncontain  inflation  to a low rate.  Even  though  this\r\n\r\ninflationary  rate  has slowed down,  prices  of  most\r\n\r\ncommodities, however, have not rolled back.  But  what\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister may not  be  aware  of  is  the\r\n\r\ndecline  in  the purchasing power of our  dollar.  The\r\n\r\nmany  thousands of workers have to pay more for  their\r\n\r\nrefreshments  and meals; the thousands  of  housewives\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay more for their marketing. Worst of  all,\r\n\r\ncompulsory  CPF contribution of up to 15% takes  up  a\r\n\r\ngood  chunk of the workers' wage increases in the last\r\n\r\nfew  years. Perhaps I have to qualify my statement.  I\r\n\r\nam not against CPF contribution. In fact, I am all for\r\n\r\nit  because  this  is  a  good policy  as  it  enables\r\n\r\ncontributors to the CPF to make use of whatever  funds\r\n\r\nthey  have in the CPF to buy HDB flats, and  now  HUDC\r\n\r\nflats. Sir, I know Members are aware of the hard times\r\n\r\nahead as stressed by the Finance Minister, and I would\r\n\r\nlike to believe that whilst workers have been exhorted\r\n\r\nto  work  harder  and expect little increase,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand  Government can help to  relieve  them  of\r\n\r\nhaving to tighten their belts too much by raising  the\r\n\r\ntax reliefs on personal and earned income which at the\r\n\r\nmoment are $2,000 and $1,000 only. Members will recall\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance Minister introduced an amendment to the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Act  in November last year (Bill No 52/75).  This\r\n\r\nBill passed by Parliament gave those who are 55 or  60\r\n\r\nyears of age bigger personal tax reliefs ranging  from\r\n\r\n$2,000 to $3,000 respectively. I do not `dispute  that\r\n\r\nthese  people should benefit from it, but I  certainly\r\n\r\nbelieve that with such difficult times ahead, (in this\r\n\r\nmanner,  the  Members  for Telok Blangah  and  Whampoa\r\n\r\nprobably  share  my view) the Finance  Minister  could\r\n\r\neasily  accommodate  the  younger  taxpayers.  On  the\r\n\r\npresumption  that $1,000 as tax relief is  granted  to\r\n\r\nsay.  25.000  taxpayers  in the  middle  income  group\r\n\r\nbracket,  this may cost a shortfall of $25 million  in\r\n\r\nrevenue; but Hon. Members will not disagree when I say\r\n\r\nthat  it  will bring true relief to the many thousands\r\n\r\nof the middle income workers and their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envisage that the Finance Minister in reply would\r\n\r\nmost  probably  say that we are most generous  in  the\r\n\r\ngranting  of  tax  reliefs,  for  example, those  who\r\n\r\nmaintain  their aged parents are entitled to a  relief\r\n\r\nof $750 for each parent living with them; another $300\r\n\r\nfor  maintaining a garden properly. Allow me to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  more  than half of the  population  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  are  now  living in HDB flats  and  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of relief for the maintenance of gardens  is\r\n\r\nout.  Vet  HDB  flat dwellers have to pay  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges which go towards maintenance of open spaces in\r\n\r\nHDB estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I believe that the Government can play a\r\n\r\ngreater  role through granting bigger tax  reliefs  to\r\n\r\nthe  wage earners, especially in these hard times. Ten\r\n\r\nyears ago, when not many people lived in HDB flats,  a\r\n\r\nworker earning $300 per month could easily maintain  a\r\n\r\nfamily of three children, as rental was cheap and cost\r\n\r\nof living pretty low. Today if a worker earns the same\r\n\r\namount,  he  has  to  contribute to  the  CPF  and  to\r\n\r\nmaintain his family. This sum has to go towards paying\r\n\r\nfor  his  flat at monthly instalments or  rental,  PUB\r\n\r\nbills,  daily needs, children's education,  transport,\r\n\r\netc.  Therefore. Members can easily conclude that this\r\n\r\nis inadequate. This is the reason why I am making this\r\n\r\nimpassioned  plea to the Finance Minister to  consider\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter.  Hon. Members would be interested to  note  an\r\n\r\narticle  in  the  Straits  Times  of  5th March, 1976\r\n\r\nheadlined \"Only one in 8 earning $600 or more\" wherein\r\n\r\nit states that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nearly 75% of the 873.000 workers employed in\r\n\r\nSingapore  last year earned less than $400  per  month\r\n\r\naccording to a Government survey on the labour force'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of narrowing the gap between\r\n\r\nthe  haves and have-nots; I am not referring to it but\r\n\r\nthis is a matter of paramount importance vital to  our\r\n\r\nsurvival  viewed from a point where inflation  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  few years has eroded consistently the purchasing\r\n\r\npower  of  our  dollar.  I  welcome  the  Government's\r\n\r\nexhortations to the people reminding them of the  need\r\n\r\nto  be thrifty and to work harder and not to expect  a\r\n\r\nbonanza in return; but may I ask the Finance Minister,\r\n\r\nis it not a fact that charity begins at home?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumption that should such tax reliefs be\r\n\r\ngiven, there would be a fall in revenue collection  as\r\n\r\npointed  out earlier; may I hasten to suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  that he can levy  through  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxation on those luxury items which are not basic  to\r\n\r\neveryday  needs to recover revenue lost  through  such\r\n\r\ntax  concessions. I believe that such  measures  would\r\n\r\nbring little ill-effect on the people. In making  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion, permit me, Sir, to reiterate that  I  have\r\n\r\nno wish to tell the Hon. Minister what he should do as\r\n\r\nfiscal  matters are his prerogatives and  problems.  I\r\n\r\nmerely wish to request him to consider not my plea but\r\n\r\nthe  general feeling of many people about this matter.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Budget Statement has been well-received\r\n\r\nand  it has been termed as \"No Shocks Budget\" by  some\r\n\r\nquarters,  may I say that the shocks had already  been\r\n\r\nmade through several tax measures announced at the end\r\n\r\nof  last  year  and the very beginning of  this  year.\r\n\r\nNaturally that is the reception - no shocks.  But  the\r\n\r\nshocks   were  made  before  and  after   the   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.  And probably as the Member  for  Kim  Seng\r\n\r\nenvisaged, maybe in the middle of this financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of CPF contributions that I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch on, Sir, is the question which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been asked by some quarters, and that is  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  a  ceiling of $4,000 is allowed to a  taxpayer\r\n\r\nfor  relief.  I am sure the Minister is aware  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  NWC  increase as well as CPF contributions\r\n\r\nhave been increased too in the last few years. I would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest that there should be no ceiling on tax\r\n\r\nexemption  for CPF contributions, otherwise  it  would\r\n\r\nmean paying tax on the CPF contributions in excess  of\r\n\r\n$4,000.  In  this  respect,  life  insurance  premiums\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  taken  into consideration  as  these\r\n\r\npolicies are meant to benefit the beneficiaries of the\r\n\r\nholder of a life insurance policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of Customs & Excise duties, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  base of income tax should be  extended  and\r\n\r\nspread more evenly and as widely as possible. In  this\r\n\r\nrespect  it would be pertinent to point out, as  shown\r\n\r\nin  the Table on comparison of revised estimates FY 75\r\n\r\nand estimates FV 76 in the Memorandum, the two largest\r\n\r\nincreases by way of percentage are items 7 and 8 (Road\r\n\r\nTax and Motor Vehicles -- Ad Valorem Registration Fees\r\n\r\nat  $20.4  million and $9 million or 23.3%  and  22.0%\r\n\r\nrespectively) as against an overall increase  of  8.2%\r\n\r\nunder Class I -`Transfer Receipts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of AVRF, I do not see excise duty for\r\n\r\nlocally assembled cars. I am disappointed to see  this\r\n\r\nbecause the impression I gather from the imposition of\r\n\r\nsurcharge  and  increase  in  road  tax  for   private\r\n\r\nvehicles  were  meant to discourage car  ownership  - despite  this, the forecast of revenue  for  road  tax\r\n\r\nwould  increase from $87.6 million in FY  75  to  $108\r\n\r\nmillion in FY 76. Why is this so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  are  well  aware  that  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nimporting more motor vehicles from Japan, followed  by\r\n\r\nEurope,  where prices seem to be much lower  than  our\r\n\r\nlocally  assembled  cars. The latter  is  enjoying  no\r\n\r\nexcise  duty  which I brought up in a previous  debate\r\n\r\nwhen  import duty/AVRF were increased. I strongly urge\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister to look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on is the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Authority of Singapore. There is  a\r\n\r\nforecast drop of 1 .4% out of 8.2% revenue (Class I  - Revenue) to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  derived from TAS and telephone bills; in this case\r\n\r\nTAS  is  seen as being unable to cope with the  demand\r\n\r\nfor   telephone  facilities.  This  is  not   a   rash\r\n\r\nstatement.  I know of many applicants who are  on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting list. Perhaps, it would be in order to ask why\r\n\r\nthere are long delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind therefore, there appears to be some wrong\r\n\r\nforecast  in  the  number of lines needed  in  various\r\n\r\nhousing   estates  both  in  the  public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors.  I  suggest that this problem be looked  into\r\n\r\nbecause  I  cannot  agree  with  the  forecast  of   a\r\n\r\ndecrease.  In  fact,  there  should  be  an   increase\r\n\r\ninstead.  As I have pointed out just now,  by  way  of\r\n\r\nillustration, this TAS card states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We acknowledge receipt of your application dated\r\n\r\n4th August, 1975, the contents of which are receiving\r\n\r\nattention of the Sales Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>More than six months have elapsed. I am glad that both\r\n\r\nthe   Hon.  Minister  for  National  Development   and\r\n\r\nCommunications and his Senior Minister  of  State  are\r\n\r\npresent. I would like this problem to be looked  into,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion. Sir, may I suggest a table to be\r\n\r\nknown  as \"changes in cost\". I would like the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister   to  consider  having  such  a  table.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has enunciated the principle that,  as  far\r\n\r\nas  possible, users of public services be made to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  such services without being subsidised by general\r\n\r\ntaxation.  So  we have seen increases in the  hospital\r\n\r\nfees,  school  fees. HDB conservancy charges,  refuse,\r\n\r\netc. However, the timing of these increases appears to\r\n\r\nbe  erratic  so  much so that the  public  are  caught\r\n\r\nunawares and they are consequently unable to make tidy\r\n\r\nadjustments   or   even   psychological   adjustments.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  Government has to explain anew  every  time\r\n\r\nincreases are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not a more orderly procedure and time-table be\r\n\r\nadopted  so  that people know that at a  certain  time\r\n\r\neach  year,  certain fees or charges will  be  revised\r\n\r\naccording  to certain standards, like changes  in  the\r\n\r\nindex  of  cost? Moreover, in order to  reduce  public\r\n\r\nresentment.  I  suggest  that  Government   ought   to\r\n\r\nconsider appointing suitable representative panels  of\r\n\r\ncompetent  people to review the proposed increases  so\r\n\r\nas to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that the public are not unduly taxed and  that\r\n\r\nevery   means   is  taken  to  increase   governmental\r\n\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the motion standing in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Finance Minister has struck a sombre note\r\n\r\nin  his Budget Statement laid before this House on 1st\r\n\r\nMarch 1976. Recent political events and trends in  and\r\n\r\naround  our  region, coupled with world-wide  economic\r\n\r\nproblems and difficulties, are beginning to make  even\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  our national efforts to  promote  and\r\n\r\nadvance   the   welfare   and  well-being   of   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  There can already be  discerned  warning\r\n\r\nsigns of political and economic storms ahead of us. We\r\n\r\ncan  either  wither  in  the face  of  the  storms  or\r\n\r\nsurvive, depending on how much political will, courage\r\n\r\nand  national cohesion we can harness from amongst the\r\n\r\n2.2  million Singaporeans. But first we have to  shake\r\n\r\noff  the  euphoria that has lulled the senses  of  the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans because of the past few years of relative\r\n\r\naffluence and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past few years, not a single day has\r\n\r\npassed  without our hearing or reading  the  newspaper\r\n\r\ncolumns about complaints and grumblings about the  bus\r\n\r\nservice,  increases in road taxes, inadequate personal\r\n\r\nreliefs in income tax, and a host of other grievances.\r\n\r\nGrumbling by Singaporeans over personal inconveniences\r\n\r\nand discomforts has grown from a national past-time to\r\n\r\na  national obsession. I' am not saying that  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  complaints are not valid. I am not saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  in  what it  conceives  as  national\r\n\r\ninterests  over  the years, has not  been  obliged  to\r\n\r\nadopt unpleasant policies and measures which give rise\r\n\r\nto   individual  and  sectional  complaints  from  the\r\n\r\npublic.  What I am wondering is whether our  obsession\r\n\r\nwith criticising the internal policies and actions  of\r\n\r\nGovernment over a period of years has not numbed us to\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of  the dangers that lie before  us  as  a\r\n\r\nnation  of  both  the political and  economic  fronts.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans may find some difficulty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  relating  their personal problems and frustrations\r\n\r\nto  the more serious regional and global political and\r\n\r\neconomic  events that inevitably will  have  more  far\r\n\r\nreaching  implications  for  us,  and  in  making  the\r\n\r\nnecessary adjustment to accept sacrifices for the long-term  interests of our country and ourselves  and  our\r\n\r\nfellow citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in the past risen to the occasion and have\r\n\r\nmet  far  more  difficult challenges previously  as  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  as a nation. The older generations  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans know what hardship means because they had\r\n\r\npersonally experienced hardships in their lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, we have a younger generation of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  who have grown up during  a  period  of\r\n\r\ncomparatively good times and have become accustomed to\r\n\r\na pampered life without knowing what is real hardship.\r\n\r\nThe  comparatively easy life that they have led up  to\r\n\r\nnow  has  insulated them from the harsh  realities  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I, therefore submit, the challenge\r\n\r\nthat is really before the Government in the course  of\r\n\r\nthe  next  decade  when we must,  as  a  nation,  sail\r\n\r\nthrough many violent political and economic storms, is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government will be able to mobilise  its\r\n\r\nforces and make use of all available avenues like  the\r\n\r\nschools   and  other  educational  institutions,   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, the media of radio and television,\r\n\r\nto  inculcate  in  the  population, particularly  the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation  of  Singaporeans,  the  sense  of\r\n\r\npolitical  and economic realism and quick reflexes  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to any political and economic changes.  This\r\n\r\nchallenge. Mr Speaker, Sir, is as crucial to the long-term  well-being  of  Singaporeans  as  the  need   to\r\n\r\nintensify  our  national efforts to  create  more  and\r\n\r\nbetter jobs through economic growth and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Our\r\n\r\neconomy has thus demonstrated a resilience acquired by\r\n\r\nthe diversification of activities, particularly in the\r\n\r\nservice sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance we expect would generate some more\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  economy  and  with  it, greater\r\n\r\neconomic  enterprise  to meet  the  needs  of  a  more\r\n\r\nrelaxed world, we hope, in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today 156 years old as a community of peoples\r\n\r\nwho converged on to this island for a living, 16 years\r\n\r\nold   as  a  people  under  the  management  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment, and  10 years old as a  sovereign  nation\r\n\r\nresponsible for its own successes or failures.

Central  planning  based  on\r\n\r\nnational  priorities, a dependable administration  and\r\n\r\nregulated private enterprise have been key factors  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  strategy for survival and success.  But\r\n\r\nthe  principal force which bolsters this  strategy  is\r\n\r\nour manpower. If our manpower can continually increase\r\n\r\nits  economicability in both the  public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors, our industrialisation will take off  and  the\r\n\r\nresulting economic momentum can be sustained. There is\r\n\r\nalready  generated  in the manufacturing  and  service\r\n\r\nindustries  sufficient potential for  the  final  lift\r\n\r\nbut, markets aside, the primary back-up factor is  our\r\n\r\nmanpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manpower must be able to cope with the\r\n\r\nrequirements   of   the  manufacturing   and   service\r\n\r\nindustries at all levels of technology. This calls for\r\n\r\nlong-range manpower planning to mesh with the economic\r\n\r\ndirections into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe years ahead. Of course there are areas in which it\r\n\r\nmight  not be prudent to make forecasts as changes  in\r\n\r\nscience  and technology in the world are taking  place\r\n\r\nwith   astonishing  rapidity.  But  adequate  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  there must be. This is possible because  the\r\n\r\nvariables involved in manpower planning are relatively\r\n\r\nuniform and manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore correct that Government should be\r\n\r\nspending  $41  million on industrial training  through\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Training Board and Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  to enhance the economicability of our manpower.\r\n\r\nHowever,  certain questions may be asked in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness of ITB as it is presently organised\r\n\r\nand  managed.  What  is the rate of  drop-out  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of training? What is the rate of trainees  who,\r\n\r\nhaving  completed training, do not seek employment  in\r\n\r\nthe  industries?  And what are the  reasons  for  this\r\n\r\nsituation  aside  of  the explanation  that  wages  in\r\n\r\nindustry  are  not  attractive? I do  not  expect  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to supply me with the answers in his  reply.\r\n\r\nBut neither have I asked these questions merely to  be\r\n\r\nrhetorical.  By these questions. I wish  to  make  the\r\n\r\npoint  that these moneys which are to be spent by  ITB\r\n\r\nand  EDB  for  financial year 1976 should produce  the\r\n\r\nexpected results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to that aspect of the problem of manpower\r\n\r\nwhich disturbs all of us - the reluctance of our young\r\n\r\nworkers  to  accept  employment  these  days  in   the\r\n\r\nindustries. That they will, in the course of time,  do\r\n\r\nso,  is anticipated. But at this point of our economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  we cannot afford to risk the competitive  edge\r\n\r\nof our economy being blunted either by youthful labour\r\n\r\ncopping out of employment for diverse reasons  or  for\r\n\r\nthe reason that industry has failed to meet their wage\r\n\r\nexpectations.  With  immigrant  labour   standing   at\r\n\r\n100.000   up,   parents  who  are   supporting   their\r\n\r\nunemployed adolescent or adult sons who choose  to  be\r\n\r\nunemployed   had   better   rearrange   the   domestic\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  these young men  so  that  they  are\r\n\r\npersuaded  into gainful labour for their  own  benefit\r\n\r\nand for the lasting economic good of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a youthful, vibrant generation of workers.\r\n\r\nThose  between  1  5-34  years  above  constitute   an\r\n\r\nextremely  high percentage of the economically  active\r\n\r\npersons   in  society  numbering  873.000,   If   this\r\n\r\nmanpower,  our  young  workers,  can  reconcile  their\r\n\r\nestimation  of their own worth with the wage  capacity\r\n\r\nof  our  industries under the guidance of the National\r\n\r\nWages  Council, and offer good labour for  wages, our\r\n\r\neconomy  will continue to demonstrate its  resilience,\r\n\r\nand collectively we, as a people, will benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said a few words on the question of our\r\n\r\nmanpower, I wish to refer to another problem which  is\r\n\r\nbasic.  I will refer to a specific development in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  transport and education and, thereafter,  I\r\n\r\nwill  allude to the shortcoming in the Administration.\r\n\r\nThere emerged in Parliament in 1974 a hefty debate  on\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion  in  the city  area  and  the  bus\r\n\r\ntransport  system. Following this debate a  number  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  preventive  and penalising  in  nature  were\r\n\r\ntaken  in  quick  succession. They  caused  much  pain\r\n\r\nbecause  these measures offered the choice  of  sudden\r\n\r\ninconvenience or payment. Motorists cringed and  paid.\r\n\r\nThe  record, that  is, the Hansard, shows  that  the\r\n\r\nBackbenchers had already vigorously posed the  problem\r\n\r\nof  traffic  congestion and the need for a  sound  bus\r\n\r\ntransport system as far back as December 1968. Between\r\n\r\n1968  and  the end of 1975 no jolting measures  beyond\r\n\r\nwidening  roads  were  undertaken  to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   On   the  contrary,  high-rise  development\r\n\r\nconcentrated in the city. Mass transit commuters  grew\r\n\r\nin  numbers.  Then, in a flash as it were, realisation\r\n\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, critics in the Back-bench\r\n\r\nabound.  Again  since 1 968 there were repeated  pleas\r\n\r\nfor  coherent long-range planning in education.  There\r\n\r\nwas  sufficient articulation to show that  the  system\r\n\r\nwas  not  working. An effort in replanning would  have\r\n\r\ninvolved a reconsideration of the economic, social and\r\n\r\ncultural  premises  upon which the system  was  based.\r\n\r\nThis could have thrown up areas of indiscretion, over-zealousness,  irrelevance,  administration  myopia  or\r\n\r\nplain  blind-alleys  in education.  Instead  only  the\r\n\r\nsystem was structured and restructured. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompartments and corridors were redesigned  when  what\r\n\r\nwas  required  was  a survey of the building's  entire\r\n\r\nlayout  and location in relation to the mainstream  of\r\n\r\nthe  country's educational future. Then again  in  an'\r\n\r\ninstant,  so  to  speak, there  was  discovered  grave\r\n\r\ndefects  in education and there was felt the  need  to\r\n\r\nremedy these defects in a hurry. These developments  I\r\n\r\nhave  described  in traffic congestion  and  education\r\n\r\nstress the point that there was lacking the effort  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  effects of policies after implementation\r\n\r\nand  the  coordination  of  the  effects  of  policies\r\n\r\nimplemented by Ministers. I put the view that if there\r\n\r\nhad  been  any  such  effort,  obviously  it  had  not\r\n\r\nsucceeded,  But on the other hand, if it had,  urgency\r\n\r\nof  traffic congestion in the city area and the  slide\r\n\r\ninto  illiteracy in education would have been apparent\r\n\r\nin the early stages and the situation remedied in good\r\n\r\ntime  without  having to resort  to  a  succession  of\r\n\r\nremedial measures which are causing confusion and eco-spasms   in  some  families  as  parents  attempt   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the meaning of education policies  and  as\r\n\r\nthey budget to retain the small family car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is known to execute its plans for the\r\n\r\nprosperity  and security of the country in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the order of priorities it determines from  time\r\n\r\nto  time.  Foremost in the list of national priorities\r\n\r\nwould  be  matters pertaining to the  economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  security. But there are  societal  needs\r\n\r\nwhich may not qualify for priority rating on the basis\r\n\r\nof   national   urgency  but  which  are  nevertheless\r\n\r\nimportant  social  requisites in  the  development  of\r\n\r\nsociety. These are disregarded today to the poverty of\r\n\r\nour   children  in  human  values  tomorrow,  If   the\r\n\r\ndirection,  along  which  our  society  is  urged,  is\r\n\r\ntowards   opportunities   for   the   acquisition   of\r\n\r\nsufficient  needs, social security and the intangibles\r\n\r\nwhich make the good society, then these needs must  be\r\n\r\nmet  so  that  our people will be able to  give  their\r\n\r\nlives  and  souls  meaning and  contentment.  Suitable\r\n\r\ncommunity    centres   are   places   which    provide\r\n\r\nopportunities  for interaction among  people.  So  far\r\n\r\ndown the scale of priorities are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres that Government expects  people  to\r\n\r\nhelp  pay  for  the  establishment  of  even  one  key\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  in  each  constituency.  There  are\r\n\r\nneeded   suitable  TV  programmes  for   the   masses,\r\n\r\nprogrammes which are constructive in the art of living\r\n\r\nin congestion and constriction, a feature of the times\r\n\r\nwe  live in. And other requisities which I shall  deal\r\n\r\nwith in the debate on the Estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make the comment that there may be\r\n\r\ndeveloping a tendency of the Government to ignore  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  rational in its explanation  of  actions\r\n\r\nwhich tax or restrict the public. The case of the  10-year  old  car  is  notorious. The  argument  that  is\r\n\r\noffered  to the public is that if the owner  can  meet\r\n\r\nthe  tax, then  the car is fit to be driven.  So  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  drawn is that our roads are fit  only  for\r\n\r\nthose  who can pay to drive their old cars or who  can\r\n\r\nafford to buy new cars. Such actions of the Government\r\n\r\ndo  not  assist  in strengthening in our  society  the\r\n\r\nrealisation that we can survive and prosper only  when\r\n\r\nthe  people and the Government act in concert  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the common good. These are times when  the\r\n\r\npeople must clearly understand the whys and wherefores\r\n\r\nof Government actions affecting their lives because we\r\n\r\nare  moving into an increasingly regulated life-style,\r\n\r\nand must do so if every one is to have his modicum  of\r\n\r\nthe good things. People still cherish the style of the\r\n\r\nrecent  past- the pre-recession, pre-inflation  period\r\n\r\nand  will  find  some difficulty in adjusting  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy of living which has been made necessary for us\r\n\r\nby  issues  which are global in origin and effect  and\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  control. But I say, Sir, as much  as  the\r\n\r\npeople should not take the Government for granted, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  afford  to  take  the  people  for\r\n\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  described his Budget  Statement  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse as \"a relatively unexciting\" one, This may be so\r\n\r\nif you are not a smoker or you have not been expecting\r\n\r\neither shocks or surprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to the large majority of wage earners, the\r\n\r\nannouncement first of all by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the NTUC and now the Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe  need  for an adjustment in our wage  policy  must\r\n\r\ncertainly cause a certain amount of unhappiness. For a\r\n\r\nnumber of years now our workers have come to expect  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   annual   adjustment   in   wages.   Such\r\n\r\nexpectation   in   the  past  was  not  unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  fierce rate of inflation  prevailing\r\n\r\nand the satisfactory rate of growth in our economy. As\r\n\r\nthings  stand today, we are suddenly awakened  to  the\r\n\r\nfact that unless something is done and done quickly to\r\n\r\nrelate wage increases rather more closely to the  rate\r\n\r\nof  productivity,  particularly in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector, we shall soon lose our competitiveness in  the\r\n\r\nexport market. The gravity, of the situation has  been\r\n\r\nvery  eloquently put forward both by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  the  Minister for Labour and the  Secretary-General  of the NTUC. I have no doubt that the message\r\n\r\nwill  have  been  driven home loud and  clear  to  all\r\n\r\nunions and their members affiliated to the NTUC.  With\r\n\r\na responsible and enlightened union leadership such as\r\n\r\nwe  fortunately have in Singapore today, I  feel  sure\r\n\r\nthat the position will be accepted by all workers even\r\n\r\nthough some may take it somewhat grudgingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urging our workers to tighten their belts, it is\r\n\r\nin  my view imperative that the Government should take\r\n\r\nevery step to ensure that the purchasing power of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  will  not  be  eroded by unjustifiable  price\r\n\r\nincreases in goods as well as services of an essential\r\n\r\nnature   in   the  forthcoming  months.   Whilst   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done  reasonably  well  in   bringing\r\n\r\ninflation under control, the various measures taken by\r\n\r\nthe  Government to stimulate the economy in the months\r\n\r\nahead may yet spark off another round of inflation, if\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  watch out. For a start I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  keep a closer watch on all  Government\r\n\r\nand statutory charges. The Budget this year, as in the\r\n\r\nprevious  year,  may be considered  to  be  relatively\r\n\r\npainless, but experience has taught us that this state\r\n\r\nof  painlessness may not last too long before  we  are\r\n\r\ntreated  to a whole series of shocks by way of  higher\r\n\r\ntaxes  and  charges. The combined sum  total  of  such\r\n\r\nrevised  taxes and charges, taking into  account  both\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirect  and  indirect effect, quite often far  exceeds\r\n\r\nthe  wage  increment of an average worker in  any  one\r\n\r\nparticular  year.  Such frequent increases  have  also\r\n\r\ncontributed  in  no small measure to  pushing  up  the\r\n\r\ncosts of our manufacturing products and to that extent\r\n\r\nreducing our competitive edge in the export market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In emphasising the importance of improving the\r\n\r\nquality  of  our workers, the Minister has  said  that\r\n\r\nthis  must  be  matched  by better  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nmanagers and that thorough continued modernisation and\r\n\r\ninnovation,  management  must improve  production  and\r\n\r\nadministration, financial    control,     personnel\r\n\r\nmanagement and marketing methods. Sir, I cannot  agree\r\n\r\nwith him more, but to his observation I would add that\r\n\r\nto  maintain  our competitive position the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  also  strive  to achieve greater  productivity\r\n\r\nrate in the civil service through constant improvement\r\n\r\nin  the standard of administration and the quality  of\r\n\r\nservice. It may be wishful thinking on my part  but  I\r\n\r\ndo sincerely hope that we can look forward to the days\r\n\r\nwhen increased Government revenue will be achieved not\r\n\r\nso  much  by  the jacking up of rates and charges  but\r\n\r\nrather as a result of greater efficiency in Government\r\n\r\nadministration  and that Government expenditure  of  a\r\n\r\nrecurring nature may be kept constant, if not reduced,\r\n\r\nby  minimising unnecessary wastage either in terms  of\r\n\r\nmaterials or manpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I am therefore pleased to note\r\n\r\nthat  frank  admission of the Minister that  a  recent\r\n\r\nanalysis  by  his  Ministry  revealed  that  both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and statutory boards had been too lavish in\r\n\r\ntheir use of professionals and technically trained men\r\n\r\n(Sir,  these are the exact words of the Minister).  He\r\n\r\nhas  promised to reverse the position. To the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  this is indeed welcome news as the  competing\r\n\r\ndemand  from Government for such categories of persons\r\n\r\nover  the  last  few years has not  only  reduced  the\r\n\r\nsupply  but  also contributed to the rising  costs  of\r\n\r\nsuch personnel to the private sector. Consequently, it\r\n\r\nhas  considerably slowed down the management's efforts\r\n\r\nto carry out any measures aiming at modernisation or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninnovation. Sir, in the latter part of the  Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech  he refers to a total number of 2,414 vacancies\r\n\r\nin  Division I of the civil service when he speaks  of\r\n\r\nmore  effective use of budgetary allocations. In  view\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister's  announced intention  to  be  less\r\n\r\nlavish in the area of manpower, I am wondering to what\r\n\r\nextent recruitment of Division I officers will now  be\r\n\r\naffected.  As  I  see it, whilst it is,  essential  to\r\n\r\nensure  adequate numbers of officers in all levels  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service, numbers alone will not in  itself\r\n\r\nbring  about  better  efficiency. The  inculcation  of\r\n\r\ncorrect   attitudes,  sufficient   exposure   to   the\r\n\r\npractical  realities  of  life,  coupled  with  proper\r\n\r\ntraining programme, organisation and methods that  are\r\n\r\nconstantly reviewed and kept up-to-date with  changes,\r\n\r\nshould   be   the   correct   emphasis   in   ensuring\r\n\r\neffectiveness in the Administration's use of budgetary\r\n\r\nallocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, it is perhaps relevant to draw\r\n\r\nthe attention of the House to the fact that year after\r\n\r\nyear  there has been substantial shortfalls in  actual\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure as against provisions voted by\r\n\r\nthis House. The comparative figures for the last three\r\n\r\nyears  will  be of interest to Members (See footnote).\r\n\r\nThis    only   serves   to   demonstrate   that    the\r\n\r\nAdministration's ability to use budgetary  allocations\r\n\r\napproved by Parliament is perhaps not as effective  as\r\n\r\nwhat  we  would like it to be. Bearing  in  mind  that\r\n\r\nGovernment spending is increasingly being resorted  to\r\n\r\nas  a fiscal measure to stimulate the national economy\r\n\r\nor  to counter-inflation, there appears to me to be an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  for  the Government to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  machinery  is  adequately  geared   to\r\n\r\nrespond quickly to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemand of changing economic circumstances at all times\r\n\r\nso  that  money voted by this House may be efficiently\r\n\r\nused and controlled in order to achieve the direct  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the indirect objectives of Government without\r\n\r\nundue delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In studying the Economic Survey Report, I cannot\r\n\r\nhelp  but feel that our economy, up or down, has  over\r\n\r\nthe  last few years become more and more dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe    public   sector;   activities   of   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, statutory  boards  and  Government-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises, such as SIA and NOL, have  provided  the\r\n\r\nmain  thrusts and stimuli to our economic growth, with\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector playing a decreasing  role.  This\r\n\r\ndevelopment although inevitable to some extent  is  to\r\n\r\nmy  mind not entirely healthy and may in time lead  to\r\n\r\nloss  of entrepreneurial enterprise and skills in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many enterprises have been embarked upon by\r\n\r\nGovernment,  initially with the primary  objective  of\r\n\r\nproviding the necessary lead and encouragement to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  but  as time  goes  on  the  original\r\n\r\nobjective  is lost sight of and what is  left  of  the\r\n\r\nmotivation  is  no  more than just  profit-making,  at\r\n\r\ntimes  at the expense of and in conflict with  private\r\n\r\nsector  development. Perhaps, if we  are  not  already\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  we ought to periodically review thoroughly\r\n\r\nthe activities of all Government-owned enterprises not\r\n\r\njust  to  assess their viability or profitability  but\r\n\r\nalso   to   ascertain  to  what  extent  the   primary\r\n\r\nobjectives  set  for  them  have  been  fulfilled  and\r\n\r\nwhether  their activities have not resulted, and  will\r\n\r\nnot result, in disincentives to the private sector  to\r\n\r\neither  enter  o  expand in the  same  directions.  An\r\n\r\nexample of the primary objectives not being pursued by\r\n\r\na  Government-owned  company is to  be  found  in  the\r\n\r\noperation of the Singapore Pools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\t     Estimated             \r\n\r\n\t    Expenditure             Actual                             Under-\r\n\r\n\t     Voted by             Expenditure        Difference      utilisation\r\n\r\n\t    Parliament      \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\t      Million$               Million$          Million$\r\n\r\n  1972/73     $  784                  $  665            $119             15%\r\n\r\n  1973/74     $1,326                  $1,107            $219             17%\r\n\r\n  1974/75     $1,562                  $1,132            $430             28%\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Private)  Ltd.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, despite\r\n\r\nthe  increasing  cost of services and  materials,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance was able  to  present  a  \"soft\r\n\r\nbudget\"  with a tax increase only for cigarettes.  For\r\n\r\nthis,   everyone   in  Singapore  must   rejoice   and\r\n\r\ncongratulate him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have again a \"soft budget\" that will not affect a\r\n\r\ngreat  part of our population. We have gone through  a\r\n\r\nrough period caused by inflation and many parts of the\r\n\r\nworld  have  suffered from inflation too,  But  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, through the able leadership of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  and  above all an  excellent  and  able\r\n\r\nGovernment, have conquered inflation  and  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to control the cost of living to such an  extent\r\n\r\nthat we have this present \"soft budget\". We have had a\r\n\r\nvery  low  growth rate. Although there  were  promises\r\n\r\nmade  about an upturn in the economies of many of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial countries towards the latter part of  1975,\r\n\r\nthis growth did not really take place. Fortunately for\r\n\r\nSingapore  we are seeing a certain growth rate  taking\r\n\r\nplace, but very slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of a number of tax concessions in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget Statement is an excellent move.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmove  that will no doubt benefit the commercial sector\r\n\r\ndirectly.  But  indirectly it will  benefit  Singapore\r\n\r\nmore,  for  we  look  forward to a healthy  commercial\r\n\r\nsector  in  Singapore to produce a healthy and  strong\r\n\r\nSingapore  financially.  It  is  my  hope  that   more\r\n\r\nconcessions of a similar nature could be introduced so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be able to earn more foreign  exchange,\r\n\r\nmore interest from the industrial countries, and after\r\n\r\nall this will benefit our country in return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are several matters which I wish to\r\n\r\ndraw the attention of the House. It was announced that\r\n\r\nthe  increases in road tax for motor cars was  not  to\r\n\r\nget  more revenue but to reduce the number of cars  on\r\n\r\nthe road, especially old cars that often break down on\r\n\r\nthe road. I wish to point out that the condition of  a\r\n\r\ncar does not necessarily depend on its age. It depends\r\n\r\non  how much it has been used and how well it has been\r\n\r\nmaintained. To say that all cars over 10 years old are\r\n\r\nnot  road-worthy and therefore should  be  discouraged\r\n\r\nfrom  running on the road is to presume that only  old\r\n\r\ncars break down on the road. In fact, new cars of  all\r\n\r\nmakes, including  the luxurious  Mercedes  Benz,  are\r\n\r\noften  seen  stalled along the road-side,  with  their\r\n\r\nbonnets lifted up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention is to reduce the number of cars on\r\n\r\nthe  road,  then the Registrar of Vehicles  should  be\r\n\r\ninstructed  to assess each owner's need  for  the  car\r\n\r\nbefore allowing it to be registered. This is not a new\r\n\r\nidea.   It  was  done  in  many  countries,  including\r\n\r\nSingapore, just after the Second World War  when  the\r\n\r\ndemand for cars exceeded the supply and priorities had\r\n\r\nto be laid down. Alternatively, if the intention is to\r\n\r\nenhance road safety by ensuring that all cars  on  the\r\n\r\nroad  are  roadworthy, then the Registrar of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nshould  be instructed to have all cars above 10  years\r\n\r\nold  to  be  inspected annually. Imposing a  surcharge\r\n\r\ndoes not make the car any safer. In fact, it makes the\r\n\r\ncar  less safe because owners will have less money  to\r\n\r\nspend  on  maintenance. The irony is that old  drivers\r\n\r\nare certified fit by a medical examination and not  by\r\n\r\npaying a surcharge on their driving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlicences,  but old cars can be accepted as road-worthy\r\n\r\nnot by an inspection but by paying a surcharge. I hope\r\n\r\nthat  this  anomaly could be corrected, so  that  some\r\n\r\npeople  who cannot afford the luxury of new  cars  but\r\n\r\nnevertheless  need cars for earning a  livelihood  may\r\n\r\nretain their old cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, not every car owner need to drive his car\r\n\r\ninto  town. There are many people living in the  rural\r\n\r\ndistricts  who do not drive their cars into town  more\r\n\r\nthan once a week. Removing their cars do not help very\r\n\r\nmuch  in  reducing the number of cars going  into  the\r\n\r\nCentral   Business  District.  Besides,  forcing   the\r\n\r\nremoval of old cars from the road by a surcharge  hits\r\n\r\nnot   only  the  car  owners  but  also  other  people\r\n\r\nindirectly, i.e, those in the motor-repair shops,  the\r\n\r\nspare  parts shops, the tyre shops, the battery shops,\r\n\r\nthe  secondhand  car dealers, the spray-painters,  the\r\n\r\nupholstery  makers  and all those connected  with  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of motor cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I wish to stress is the ugly\r\n\r\ntendency found in various departments in Singapore. We\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  introducing taxes or  bills  in  various\r\n\r\nforms;  in small, small quantities. But let  me  quote\r\n\r\none  maxim. Little drops of water make a mighty ocean.\r\n\r\nThe  taxpayer  feels the pinch, bit by  bit,  and  his\r\n\r\nearnings  seem  to be slowly dwindling.  He  sees  his\r\n\r\nsavings  and his earning power dwindling as the  years\r\n\r\ngo  by. Steps must be taken to see that this does  not\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to comment on is the\r\n\r\neducation system. For many years our education  policy\r\n\r\nhas  been  changing, and changing so  rapidly  and  so\r\n\r\ndrastically that the school principals are frustrated,\r\n\r\nthe   teachers   are   confused,  and   the   students\r\n\r\nconfounded, I am not saying that running the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education is an easy job. On the contrary, I  have\r\n\r\nthe highest respect for the Minister for Education and\r\n\r\nall  his predecessors for they have been subjected  to\r\n\r\npressures   such  as  population  increase,   economic\r\n\r\nsurvival,   social  advancement,  and  even   parental\r\n\r\ninterference, So the schools were run not  to  provide\r\n\r\nan education for our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren and to prepare them for a meaningful and rich\r\n\r\nlife, but to provide them with sophisticated technical\r\n\r\ntraining  in  order to enable them  to  excel  in  the\r\n\r\nmodern  rat race. The result is that those who succeed\r\n\r\nin  this  mad scramble, which starts from the  primary\r\n\r\nschools,  become human robots while those who  do  not\r\n\r\nmake the grade become social misfits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I sympathize with the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation and all his predecessors, but I believe that\r\n\r\nunless  we  can provide our young children in  primary\r\n\r\nand   secondary  schools  with  a  better  educational\r\n\r\nfoundation,  and not just a technical foundation, the\r\n\r\nvalues of loyalty, integrity and honesty will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  sacrificed in the long run. We shall then  have  a\r\n\r\nheartless  society  operating under  the  law  of  the\r\n\r\njungle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One contributing factor to this deteriorating\r\n\r\ncondition is the removal of the cane from the teacher.\r\n\r\nI  understand that in some schools if the teacher were\r\n\r\nto  touch a child, she should be prepared for  a  long\r\n\r\ncomplaint from the parent, probably with a demand from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry for an explanation. Under such conditions\r\n\r\nno conscientious teacher could give of her best to her\r\n\r\nstudents.  The  authority and dignity of  the  teacher\r\n\r\nshould  be quickly restored and the student should  be\r\n\r\ntaught  to accept his position in the school,  in  the\r\n\r\nhome arid in the society. The only way to achieve this\r\n\r\nis to teach him discipline. I am not surprised if some\r\n\r\nof  our repenting delinquents say that if they had not\r\n\r\nbeen  spoilt by their teachers and their parents  they\r\n\r\nwould not be in their present predicament. Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir,  if we are not to accept this blame, I urge  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  educate  our  children  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\neducation and not for the sake of giving in  to  these\r\n\r\ndifferent pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we seem to be losing our international trade to\r\n\r\na  certain extent. Many ships do not call in Singapore\r\n\r\nas  before.  Steps must be taken to ensure  that  more\r\n\r\nships  call  at our Port, Finally, I wish  to  support\r\n\r\nthis  \"soft  budget\" that has been  presented  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the 1976 Budget Statement has been received with a sigh of\r\n\r\nrelief  by many who expect the 1 976 Budget to reflect\r\n\r\nthe  chain of unsettling events during the past  year.\r\n\r\nBut  while  the  budget does not contain  any  drastic\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  tax liability for Singaporeans,  the\r\n\r\nsombre tone of the whole budget hardly gives cause for\r\n\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Singapore workers' point of view, the only\r\n\r\nnote  of  optimism struck in the 1976 Budget Statement\r\n\r\nis  the disclosure that the rate of inflation has been\r\n\r\nsuccessfully stabilised during the past year. But  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of inflation is only of secondary importance\r\n\r\nin  relation to the general health of our economy.  As\r\n\r\nanalysed  in the 1976 Budget Statement, events  during\r\n\r\nthe  past  year  have brought about a  change  in  the\r\n\r\navailability of markets for the manufactured  products\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and in the availability  of  funds  for\r\n\r\ninvestments in Singapore. It would also appear in  the 1976  Budget Statement that the prospects for  a  more\r\n\r\nfavourable economic condition in Singapore are matters\r\n\r\nof  hope  rather than of expectation. The  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have the advantage of being  forewarned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General  of the National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress   to  brace  themselves  for  more  stringent\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions during the next  two  years.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore, by making constructive  plans\r\n\r\nto  overcome  the difficult circumstances  confronting\r\n\r\nSingapore  during the next few years, has  effectively\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  its  qualities of capable  and  decisive\r\n\r\nleadership which has been largely responsible for  the\r\n\r\nrapid  economic development of Singapore in less  than\r\n\r\ntwo  decades.  No rational person, whether  inside  or\r\n\r\noutside  this House, can fault the emphasis  given  in\r\n\r\nthe 1976 Budget Statement to the development of skill-intensive   projects  and  the  training  of   skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower  as  well  as  the  continued  promotion   of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a financial centre for the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these projects and proposals can but only be\r\n\r\nintended  for  the general benefit of all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  that  it  seeks to make our economy remain  viable\r\n\r\nthrough creating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient employment opportunities for our increasing\r\n\r\nworkforce  in  the next few years.  It  is  with  this\r\n\r\nconsideration  in  mind that I speak  with  confidence\r\n\r\nthat  the workers of Singapore will give their fullest\r\n\r\nsupport  and  cooperation  to  the  efforts   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to safeguard the economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing so, I must hasten to correct whatever\r\n\r\nmisimpression  may  have  been  formed  over   certain\r\n\r\ncomments made by the Minister for Finance in the  1976\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement.  To the extent  that  the  apparent\r\n\r\nproliferation   of   non-wage  items   in   collective\r\n\r\nagreements and contract of service has served to  make\r\n\r\nthe cost of labour in Singapore prohibitively high  in\r\n\r\nrelation to that prevailing in certain other countries\r\n\r\nin  the region, the attention drawn by the Minister to\r\n\r\nthe  problem  must be appreciated by  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nspirit  in  which the comments were made. But  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time comments by the Minister have given rise  to\r\n\r\nsniggering  remarks  by employers  about  unreasonable\r\n\r\nclaims by trade unions such as the payment of $1  .000\r\n\r\nby  way  of funeral benefit. It is, however, desirable\r\n\r\nthat  Members  of  this House should  have  a  correct\r\n\r\nperspective of those fringe benefits commented upon by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance. It is generally  the  rule\r\n\r\nthat  where  workers  have the benefit  of  favourable\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  or wage scales, their fringe  benefits\r\n\r\nare nothing out of the ordinary. But where workers  do\r\n\r\nnot  enjoy the benefit of good salary scales  or  wage\r\n\r\nscales,  there is a tendency for deficiency  in  their\r\n\r\nwages  to  be made up in the form of fringe  benefits.\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the funeral allowance cited by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council was established in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most, if not all the various kinds of fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits  secured by Unions for the benefit  of  their\r\n\r\nmembers  were  done  after the Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  was  established  after  the  passing  of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance.1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I say that there might have been some attempts\r\n\r\nto  circumvent the NWC recommendations after 1972  but\r\n\r\nthe House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  remember  that it was to a very limited  extent,\r\n\r\nbecause  most  of  the fringe benefits  were  obtained\r\n\r\nbefore 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to consolidate the various allowances\r\n\r\nand have them integrated into the salaries is a matter\r\n\r\nto  be  sorted  out  by the Unions and  the  Employers\r\n\r\nconcerned, with the assistance of the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, this House can rest assured that the\r\n\r\nNTUC  and  its affiliated trade unions will  seriously\r\n\r\nlock  into  the  whole question of  wages  and  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits with the view to drawing up a rational policy\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of  the  circumstances  disclosed  and\r\n\r\nanalysed in the 1976 Budget Statement. The workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  appreciative of  the  need  for  their\r\n\r\nemployers to remain in business in order to  pay  them\r\n\r\ntheir  wages and to provide more employment for  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  But  just as workers have  every  right  to\r\n\r\nexpect,  as  taxpayers, capable  leadership  and  good\r\n\r\nplanning  from the Government of Singapore, they  have\r\n\r\nthe  same  right  to  expect, as employees, efficient\r\n\r\nmanagement  and good example from their  employers  if\r\n\r\nSingapore is to overcome its problems in the next  few\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker.

The recently appointed Malaysian  Minister\r\n\r\nof  Finance,  Tengku Razaleigh, is  President  of  the\r\n\r\nASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as the fall of the Indo-Chinese states\r\n\r\nbrought   the   five  of  us  ever  closer   together.\r\n\r\nculminating in the Heads of Government meeting in Bali\r\n\r\nlast  month, the events of the last 12 months  can  be\r\n\r\nsaid to contain a silver lining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to what I have said, we constitute a not\r\n\r\ninconsequential  grouping  of  people  and  resources.\r\n\r\nPopulation-wise, our combined  total  of  almost  250\r\n\r\nmillion  exceeds that of the United States, is  double\r\n\r\nthat  of Japan and almost five times that of the three\r\n\r\nIndo-Chinese  states.  In  area,  we  are  double  the\r\n\r\ncombined  area  of  the nine EEC countries.  Resource-wise,  we  have  petroleum in abundance.  98%  of  the\r\n\r\nworld's abaca fibre, 90% of the tropical hardwood. 85%\r\n\r\nof  the  natural rubber and palm oil. 80% of  coconuts\r\n\r\nand  62%  of  tin. Poor countries we may be  now,  but\r\n\r\npoverty is not our heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while it is true that ASEAN countries are\r\n\r\nencountering  insurgency problems, it  is  worthwhile\r\n\r\nremembering  that  in  almost  every  case   we   have\r\n\r\nexperienced  and defeated Communist threats,  each  in\r\n\r\nour  own way. If the Indo-Chinese Communists have been\r\n\r\nstrikingly  successful in holding at bay  the  world's\r\n\r\nmightiest   military  power,  it  is  also  worthwhile\r\n\r\nremembering  that  they  were fighting  a  nationalist\r\n\r\nstruggle  on  their own soil, which the Americans  and\r\n\r\ntheir  allies  were  not.  Any  crossing  of  national\r\n\r\nfrontiers by foreign soldiers today escalates that war\r\n\r\nand precipitates predictable responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons of our recent history have been taken to\r\n\r\nheart,  and  our  Heads of Government at  Bali  firmly\r\n\r\nreiterated  their commitment to economic  growth  with\r\n\r\nsocial  justice to overcome the challenge of  domestic\r\n\r\ninsurgency threats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, let us not mislead ourselves to think that\r\n\r\nproblems  are  our  monopoly. It is just  that,  being\r\n\r\nclosed societies, less is known about the problems  of\r\n\r\nthe  Indo-Chinese states. They have fought a long  and\r\n\r\nagonizing   war   which  has  just   ended,   National\r\n\r\nreconstruction  will  be a herculean  task.  An  Indo-Chinese  friend in days gone by used to tell  me  that\r\n\r\nhis country suffered from having two mothers-in-law  - the  Chinese  and the Russian. It appears  that  other\r\n\r\nCommunist  parties  in the region are  also  similarly\r\n\r\nafflicted,  Needless to say, these  mothers-in-law  do\r\n\r\nnot see eye-to-eye with each other to the discomfiture\r\n\r\nof the long-suffering daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all this said and done, we in ASEAN cannot\r\n\r\nbe  accused  of not proffering friendship to  the  new\r\n\r\nregimes  in  their task of rebuilding their  shattered\r\n\r\neconomies.  Nor should we be provoked  to  respond  in\r\n\r\nlike  manner  when Hanoi calls for a new confrontation\r\n\r\nin South-east Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our very name. Association of South-east Asian\r\n\r\nNations, means that membership is not limited for  all\r\n\r\ntime  to  only  our five states. But new members  must\r\n\r\nhelp  strengthen the association and not weaken it  by\r\n\r\nencouraging subversion and disruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our continued social well-being and political\r\n\r\nstability  are  founded  on  our  people's  faith   in\r\n\r\nthemselves  and our commitment to work for  our  long-term  future.  We have all chosen the free  enterprise\r\n\r\nsystem,  although  modified  to  suit  our  particular\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  We  regard it as the  most  rapid  and\r\n\r\nleast   painful  path  to  economic  growth   of   our\r\n\r\nrespective countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This economic growth depends on a climate of\r\n\r\nconfidence which will lead investors to invest capital\r\n\r\nand  enterprise. The view on the ground  in  ASEAN  is\r\n\r\ninfinitely more promising, than that from the board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrooms  of  Europe, United States, Japan and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOnly  here in South-east Asia does the investor get  a\r\n\r\nfeel  for the men and women who make this place  work.\r\n\r\nOnly  here  in  South-east  Asia  can  he  sense   the\r\n\r\nexcitement of societies in transition, gearing-up  for\r\n\r\nthe  breakthrough which will uplift them from  poverty\r\n\r\nto the abundance that is their heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic Bali meeting has taken place. The Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur follow-up has also produced concrete proposals.\r\n\r\nWhat more can we do as a group?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to national investment and trade\r\n\r\npromotion  missions  abroad, let us  also  send  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmissions, Other people and groups overseas such as the\r\n\r\nEEC,  the  United States, Australia and  New  Zealand,\r\n\r\nthink  of  ASEAN  as a group. So, let us  also  \"sell\"\r\n\r\nASEAN as a group. When many projects are attracted our\r\n\r\nway, various projects must inevitably end up in  each\r\n\r\nof our laps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, when overseas economic missions visit\r\n\r\none  of our countries, let us encourage them to  visit\r\n\r\nas  many  of  the other ASEAN countries as well.  Last\r\n\r\nweek,  a  Canadian mission did just that.  This  trend\r\n\r\nshould also be encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all means let us compete, within limits to make\r\n\r\nASEAN  an  even  more attractive place to  invest  in,\r\n\r\ncompared  with other places. We are, after all, named\r\n\r\nas one of the world's fastest developing regions. With\r\n\r\nthese  cooperative actions we will  draw  even  closer\r\n\r\ntogether, generate  greater investor  confidence  and\r\n\r\ninvestment opportunities, to realise the opportunities\r\n\r\nin ASEAN for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We each contribute our individual strengths. For\r\n\r\nexample. Singapore has a ready source of financing  in\r\n\r\nthe Asian Dollar market. When it originated in 1968 it\r\n\r\nsiphoned off floating US dollars to Tokyo and  London.\r\n\r\nToday the flow has been reversed and such dollars flow\r\n\r\nprincipally from Europe to finance development in  the\r\n\r\nAsian  region, including ASEAN.  Today  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nrated  as  the seventh in a list of ten top  financial\r\n\r\ncentres  of the world, the second in Asia after  Tokyo\r\n\r\nand ahead of Hongkong. Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  also  encouraged  the  financing  of  development\r\n\r\nprojects  in the region by reducing the tax earned  on\r\n\r\nprofits  from  offshore  investments.  We  have   also\r\n\r\nrecently   liberalized   our   exchange   rules    and\r\n\r\nregulations  to treat ASEAN as part of  the  scheduled\r\n\r\nterritories,  thereby  permitting  free  and   liberal\r\n\r\ntransfer of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister in his Budget Statement has\r\n\r\nmade  further  tax  concessions to develop  the  Asian\r\n\r\nDollar  market.  We  have done  these  things  without\r\n\r\nnegotiating   with  our  colleagues   for   reciprocal\r\n\r\nadvantages.   Our  Government  has  demonstrated   its\r\n\r\nearnest desire to build upon the achievements of ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now have a permanent secretariat for ASEAN.\r\n\r\nWe  should  now  be even better able to cooperate  and\r\n\r\ncoordinate  our efforts to build a strong,  prosperous\r\n\r\nand  resilient region in which our people can live  in\r\n\r\namity and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pleasure in supporting the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  join Hon. Members of  this  House  in\r\n\r\ncongratulating  the  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance  for\r\n\r\npresenting another fair and reasonable Budget  on  1st\r\n\r\nMarch  1976 for the financial year 1st April, 1976  to\r\n\r\n31st March, 1977,  which would  encourage  local  and\r\n\r\nforeign investors to proceed with their investment  on\r\n\r\nvarious industrial projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for Finance in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  did  mention  that  there  should   be   an\r\n\r\nadjustment  in  the  present  wage  policy.  He   also\r\n\r\nindicated  that  the National Wages Council  ought  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether it should not include all  forms  of\r\n\r\nwage increases, including annual increments, incentive\r\n\r\nallowances  and  bonuses, in the  computation  of  the\r\n\r\nannual  NWC  wage supplements, to arrive at  a  single\r\n\r\ntotal annual wage increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should there be an adjustment of wage policy, I\r\n\r\nwould request that there should be a thorough study on\r\n\r\nthis  important matter. There should not  be  a  hasty\r\n\r\nconclusion. The NTUC and the Employers' Groups  should\r\n\r\nbe  fully  consulted and to arrive at a fair solution.\r\n\r\nWhatever  recommendations the NWC would  give  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on adjusting the wage policy, they  should\r\n\r\nnot  be detrimental to the welfare of the workers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  take-home  pay  should  not  be  reduced.   All\r\n\r\nnecessary  fringe benefits enjoyed by the workers  now\r\n\r\nshould not be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers are fully aware that the cost of labour\r\n\r\nshould not be too high or else investors would  go  to\r\n\r\nother countries where labour cost is cheaper. If  this\r\n\r\nhappens, there   will   be   further   increase   of\r\n\r\nunemployment  in  Singapore. On the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  must get adequate wages to meet  the  present\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of living due to the global inflation  and\r\n\r\nthe  high  prices of essential commodities, foodstuffs\r\n\r\nand manufactured products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey on labour force last year\r\n\r\ncompiled  by  the Ministry of Labour and the  National\r\n\r\nStatistical   Commission,  the  total  work-force   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  was 873.000 workers and about 75%  of  them\r\n\r\nearned  less than $400 a month. The unemployment  rate\r\n\r\nreached  4.5% last year with 39.500 people unemployed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am glad to know that the service sector  is\r\n\r\nstill  providing  new  jobs  for  the  workers.  Also,\r\n\r\nemployment  in  the  commerce,  financing, insurance,\r\n\r\nbusiness   services,  social  and  personal   services\r\n\r\nsectors is increasing as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my calculation of the expenses incurred by a\r\n\r\nworker  to  support  a family of  five  persons, i.e.\r\n\r\nhimself,  his  mother, his wife and  two  school-going\r\n\r\nchildren  for  a  month, will be as follows.  Assuming\r\n\r\nthat  his  salary is $400 a month and after  deducting\r\n\r\n15% for CPF contribution, i.e. $60, the net balance is\r\n\r\n$340.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  a.

Also, you will notice  there\r\n\r\nis  no provision for entertainment, like going to  the\r\n\r\ncinema,  or for ordinary medical bills if one  of  his\r\n\r\nfamily is down with flu or fever, There is nothing for\r\n\r\nhim  to provide for unforeseeable financial needs such\r\n\r\nas  when  he is temporarily out of job; or someone  in\r\n\r\nhis  family  is seriously ill requiring  admission  to\r\n\r\nhospital, or even a sudden bereavement in the  family.\r\n\r\nThis  clearly  shows that a worker earning  a  monthly\r\n\r\nsalary  of  $400 and with a family of five persons  to\r\n\r\nsupport, after deducting his CPF contribution will not\r\n\r\nbe able to meet his monthly family expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. Sir, when the NWC gives recommendations\r\n\r\nto  the  Government on adjustment on wage  policy,  it\r\n\r\nshould  bear in mind that annual bonus or annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement  together  with some  fringe  benefits  are\r\n\r\nstill  necessary for the workers to help them to  make\r\n\r\nboth ends meet in their monthly family expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should there be a review on the fringe benefits\r\n\r\nby  the  NWC covered by collective agreements for  the\r\n\r\nbargainable  employees, it should also look  into  the\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits given to local and foreign  executive\r\n\r\nand  managerial staff. The NWC should know what is the\r\n\r\ntotal cost of fringe benefits given to them and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactual cost for the bargainable employees, believe the\r\n\r\npayment of fringe benefits is part 36.00 and parcel of\r\n\r\nlabour cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote the transport allowance\r\n\r\ngiven by the Caltex (Asia) Limited follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) All foreign managerial staff are provided with a\r\n\r\ncar and a chauffeur at the expense of the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All Departmental Heads are given the same\r\n\r\nprivilege as No. 1 above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All Senior Executives are given a transport\r\n\r\nallowance of $420 a month and they can still  claim\r\n\r\nmileage   allowance  for  using   their   cars   on\r\n\r\nCompany's business beyond a certain mileage limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) All Junior Executives are given $150 transport\r\n\r\nallowance.  They have now abolished it,  but  have\r\n\r\ncompensated it with a payment of $180 added into their\r\n\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The bargainable employees, such as labourers,\r\n\r\nclerks, technicians, supervisors, are given either $50\r\n\r\ntransport allowance a month or to use the Company's\r\n\r\ncontract bus transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Now a few new bargainable employees are not\r\n\r\ngiven  any  transport allowance. They  also  cannot\r\n\r\nuse the Company's transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Union's transport grievance with the Company has\r\n\r\nnot been resolved and our Union will have to bring the\r\n\r\nmatter to the Ministry of Labour for settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what I have just said, you will agree that\r\n\r\nmanagerial  and  executive staff  are  getting  better\r\n\r\nfringe benefits than bargainable employees. So  it  is\r\n\r\nunfair  to say that the fringe benefits given  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers have caused labour costs to go up. In fact, a\r\n\r\ngood  portion of the costs of fringe benefits is  also\r\n\r\ngiven   to  the  local  and  foreign  managerial   and\r\n\r\nexecutive staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not angry or jealous of the local and\r\n\r\nforeign managerial and executive staff getting  better\r\n\r\nfringe benefits than the bargainable workers, We agree\r\n\r\nthey deserve to enjoy such fringe benefits. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  the  NWC  review the fringe  benefits  of  the\r\n\r\nbargainable  workers, it should look  into  the  total\r\n\r\ncost  of  the  fringe benefits given to the  following\r\n\r\nthree categories of employees: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Foreign managerial and executive staff,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Local managerial and executive staff, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) All the bargainable employees covered by a Collective Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>After a careful and thorough study of the actual total\r\n\r\ncost  of the fringe benefits given to the above  three\r\n\r\ncategories  of employees, then only will  the  NWC  be\r\n\r\nable  to  give a fair and proper recommendation  on  a\r\n\r\nreview of all the fringe benefits given by a company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family planning is a necessary practice for all\r\n\r\nmarried  workers  in Singapore. They must  accept  the\r\n\r\nreality  of  life that the world does not owe  them  a\r\n\r\nliving. They must agree to have a small family of  two\r\n\r\nchildren  only, irrespective of whether they are  boys\r\n\r\nor girls. When they have two children, they must stop.\r\n\r\nEarning  a salary of $400 a month, a worker is  really\r\n\r\nasking  for trouble if he has many children. He cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to give his family a fair standard of  living.\r\n\r\nThere  is  every  possibility that he will  frequently\r\n\r\nworry  over  financial  problems,  resulting  in   his\r\n\r\nfalling  sick, in poor health and inefficient  at  his\r\n\r\nwork. A wise worker will have a family of two children\r\n\r\nonly. He will continue with higher studies, especially\r\n\r\non  technical  subjects, to improve his knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskill  in  order  to get a better salary  and  quicker\r\n\r\npromotion or for better jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crime rate has been increasing in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I think  it\r\n\r\nis  not  fair  to deprive the bachelors and  spinsters\r\n\r\nfrom  buying  HUDC  flats, After all,  they  also  pay\r\n\r\nincome  tax like other married couples. Also,  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of them would like to stay with their parents.\r\n\r\nbrothers  and  sisters, In fairness to them,  I  would\r\n\r\nrequest  the  Government to allow  them  to  buy  HUDC\r\n\r\nflats,   just  like  other  married  couples,  without\r\n\r\nfurther  delay. Or else, the Government is  indirectly\r\n\r\nforcing them to get married as quickly as possible  in\r\n\r\norder to qualify for purchase of HUDC flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HUDC flats, especially those with prices ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  $55,000 to $80,000, are most popular and in  big\r\n\r\ndemand,  May  I urge the HUDC to build more  flats  of\r\n\r\nthis  type and to cut down the building of the higher-priced flats which cost more than $80,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many applicants on the waiting list\r\n\r\nfor HDB and HUDC flats. I hope the Government will  do\r\n\r\nits  best  to build more flats to meet the  demand  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  private  developers will not  increase  the\r\n\r\nprices  of their flats or houses to fantastic  levels,\r\n\r\nas  had  occurred during the last economic boom.  They\r\n\r\nhave already made enough profit and they should not be\r\n\r\nallowed to enjoy it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to HDB flats, the purchasers have been\r\n\r\ncomplaining  of  the low standard of the  construction\r\n\r\nwork. A lot of money and inconvenience is involved  in\r\n\r\nrepairs  or  renovation.  The  purchasers  are   quite\r\n\r\nwilling  to  pay a little more for the flats  provided\r\n\r\nthe  building quality of the flats is good and  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  standard.  I hope the HDB will rectify  the  poor\r\n\r\nconstruction of the flats and exercise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncareful  supervision  over  the  construction  of  new\r\n\r\nblocks of HDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Bus Service has improved a lot.\r\n\r\nThere  are more buses running the various routes;  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  time  for  buses has been lessened.  One  can\r\n\r\nhardly  find  any rude behaviour on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nconductors, the driving standard of the bus drivers is\r\n\r\ngood.  I  am quite satisfied with the present standard\r\n\r\nof service. I think the female conductors are doing  a\r\n\r\ngood  job. They perform their duties just as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  male conductors. There is still room for  further\r\n\r\nimprovement, however, especially the following: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Most of the windows of buses are damaged and need\r\n\r\nconstant repair. The window frames and glass are very\r\n\r\ndirty and require cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The bus deck needs regular sweeping to keep it\r\n\r\nfree of used tickets and other accumulated rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Something must be done for the students,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the evenings when they  are  on  their\r\n\r\nway  home. During, this period most of the buses  are\r\n\r\ncrowded  and  the  students have  no  chance  to  get\r\n\r\naboard. More buses should be put on the road  in  the\r\n\r\nevenings  so  that the tired and hungry students  can\r\n\r\nget home earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Some bus drivers have the bad habit of not\r\n\r\nstopping at the bus stop to pick up commuters who have\r\n\r\nsignalled them to stop, especially when two  or  three\r\n\r\nbuses arrive together. In such instances the driver of\r\n\r\nthe  second or third bus will drive away even the  bus\r\n\r\nhas only a few commuters in it. This bad habit must be\r\n\r\nstopped  immediately  to avoid  inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure the workers and the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will accept the advice given by  Mr  C.  V.\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair, the Secretary-General of  NTUC, in  his\r\n\r\naddress  to  the Second Triennial Delegates Conference\r\n\r\nof  the PIEU and SILO at the Singapore Conference Hall\r\n\r\non  Saturday, 28th February, 1976.  With  the  present\r\n\r\nglobal   inflation, slow   industrial   growth   and\r\n\r\nunemployment, it  is necessary  to  have  a  new  pay\r\n\r\nstrategy  for  the workers so as to attract  investors\r\n\r\nhere and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngradually achieve full employment. Belt-tightening  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  all  categories of  workers  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  and public sectors. In order to achieve  full\r\n\r\nemployment  in  1976 and 1977, a total of  84.000  new\r\n\r\njobs   have  to  be  created.  So  far,  there  is   a\r\n\r\npossibility of achieving about 40,000 new jobs in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  construction,  transport  and   public\r\n\r\nservice's  sectors  in 1976 and 1977,  which  are  far\r\n\r\nbelow our target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, investors will only invest in a country where\r\n\r\nthere  is political and economic stability, industrial\r\n\r\npeace, and workers who are willing to learn  and  are\r\n\r\nhard-working,  wages  are  fair  and  with  reasonable\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits, prices  of  goods  for  export  are\r\n\r\ncompetitive   with   other   countries, manufactured\r\n\r\nproducts  are  of a good quality, and where  they  can\r\n\r\nmake substantial profits out of their investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the sake of long-term national interest and\r\n\r\nfor  the  good  of our present young  people  and  the\r\n\r\ncoming new generation, the workers of Singapore should\r\n\r\naccept the wisdom and guidance of NTUC on the new  pay\r\n\r\nstrategy   as  well  as  wage  policy  in   collective\r\n\r\nbargaining including fringe benefits. Again,  we  have\r\n\r\nto make a further self-sacrifice and to put reasonable\r\n\r\nclaims to employers for new collective agreements.  We\r\n\r\nhave   to  cooperate  with  the  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nEmployers'  Groups  in a mutual  tripartite  drive  to\r\n\r\nattract  local  and  foreign investors  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for the benefit of all. The workers get jobs\r\n\r\nwith decent wage and good condition of service and the\r\n\r\ninvestors get substantial profits in return for  their\r\n\r\ninvestment here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to be selfish and refuse to\r\n\r\ntake  steps  to  tackle  the present  slow  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth  and unemployment situation. We must not  allow\r\n\r\nthe  present unemployment figure of 39,500 to increase\r\n\r\nfurther. We must all be united and do our very best to\r\n\r\nachieve  full  employment  as  soon  as  possible   by\r\n\r\nencouraging  the investors to build more factories  or\r\n\r\nplants so that our young school leavers can get jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has already been said about the necessity\r\n\r\nto increase productivity, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfortunately nothing has been said about the  formula\r\n\r\nfor  incentive  payment to the workers  for  increased\r\n\r\nproduction, not only in the manufacturing  sector  but\r\n\r\nalso  the  administrative sector  as  well.  Sir,  all\r\n\r\nemployers  are  in support of increasing  productivity\r\n\r\nbut  very few are willing to pay the incentive payment\r\n\r\nto  the  workers for the good job they  have  done.  I\r\n\r\nsubmit  that  employers who refuse  to  pay  incentive\r\n\r\npayment  to the workers for having achieved  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity,  are shamefully exploiting  the  workers\r\n\r\nand  this  should be stopped. Sir, employers not  only\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  pay incentive payment to the  workers  for\r\n\r\ntheir effort in increasing productivity, they are also\r\n\r\nnot  interested to form a joint Productivity Committee\r\n\r\nwith the Unions. I understand there are only a handful\r\n\r\nof Joint Productivity Committees in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to prove my point, our Union has already\r\n\r\nsubmitted  claims to the Shell Group of  Companies  on\r\n\r\n20th November, 1975,  including  a  clause  for  the\r\n\r\nformation of a Productivity Committee, which reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Company and the Union shall form Productivity\r\n\r\nCommittee comprising members from Management and Union\r\n\r\nto  monitor  productivity and  introduce  productivity\r\n\r\nschemes  in  the  Company The Company  shall  disclose\r\n\r\nfully  the  results of productivity  and  shall  share\r\n\r\nequitably  the  fruits  of  productivity  with   their\r\n\r\nemployees'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final reply from the Shell Management on\r\n\r\n23rd February, 1976, as follows -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Productivity Committee\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejected, as matter within ambit of\r\n\r\nDepartment/Worksite Committee'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Union disagrees with the Shell Management's\r\n\r\ncontention that a joint Productivity Committee to deal\r\n\r\nwith  policy  matters, especially on  the  formula  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  productivity and the quantum of  payment,  is\r\n\r\nwithin  the  ambit of Departmental/Worksite Committee.\r\n\r\nThese  policy  matters should be  dealt  with  at  the\r\n\r\nUnion's Branch and Executive Council level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Union's stand is simple. If employers are\r\n\r\nreluctant to form a Joint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProductivity  Committee  in  order  to  disclose   the\r\n\r\nresults  of Productivity and to introduce productivity\r\n\r\npayment  schemes,  then they cannot  expect  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity from the workers. Perhaps the NTUC should\r\n\r\ntake  up  this matter with the Government to  consider\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement of a Joint Productivity Committee and\r\n\r\nProductivity Payment Scheme through legislation in due\r\n\r\ncourse.  Employers  should appreciate  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  free  in this world. If they  want  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity  from the workers, they  must  compensate\r\n\r\nthem accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with what the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nNational Productivity Board. Mr G C. Thio, had said in\r\n\r\nhis   address   to   the  Symposium  on   Productivity\r\n\r\nAgreements. Worker Motivation and Sharing the Gains of\r\n\r\nProductivity,  held  at  Hotel  Equatorial   on   16th\r\n\r\nFebruary. 1976, and I quote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We should, therefore, give due attention towards\r\n\r\ndeveloping   team  spirit,  cooperation  proper   work\r\n\r\nattitudes   and   efforts,   worker   motivation   and\r\n\r\nincentives  which are part and parcel of a  successful\r\n\r\nscheme  in  maximising productivity movements  in  all\r\n\r\nSectors  and  to  sharpen our  competitive  edge  over\r\n\r\nothers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers felt they are not getting a fair share of\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of higher productivity, they  would  see\r\n\r\nlittle reason for exerting themselves for giving their\r\n\r\ncooperation and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of apportioning the gains from increased\r\n\r\nproductivity  equitably  by  a  spirit   of   goodwill\r\n\r\nunderstanding and willingness to give and take.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers fully understand the importance of\r\n\r\nincreasing productivity, to better the quality of  the\r\n\r\nproducts,  to  see  that  the  prices  of  goods   are\r\n\r\ncompetitive to other countries, and to accept the fact\r\n\r\nthat  investors  want substantive  profits  for  their\r\n\r\ninvestment.  Commonsense tells us that if  we  achieve\r\n\r\nall these qualities, consumers in other countries will\r\n\r\nbuy  more  of  our Singapore-manufactured  goods.  The\r\n\r\ninvestors will get better profit and will expand their\r\n\r\nbusiness and there will be job security and more  jobs\r\n\r\nfor the younger people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of ASEAN countries are very happy\r\n\r\nthat  their leaders have met recently at Bali  and  at\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur to foster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  understanding and to establish  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic cooperation.

The latest  shock  was\r\n\r\ndelivered on last New Year's Eve, Perhaps it might  as\r\n\r\nwell be so, because intentional or not, the timing  of\r\n\r\nthe  announcement  of  the new taxation  measures  for\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicles  provided  excellent  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nactive  exchanges  of  dismay and disgruntlement  over\r\n\r\ndinner tables at numerous New Year's Eve parties.

For our citizens, the sooner we\r\n\r\nget  ourselves  out of the euphoria of  the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears  and get down to appreciating the hard facts  of\r\n\r\nlife,  the  better  we  will be  prepared  in  gearing\r\n\r\nourselves for the lean years ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years of plenty have gone. There is little we\r\n\r\ncan do to alter the course of the ups and downs of the\r\n\r\nworld's  economic  order. But we  are  not  completely\r\n\r\nhelpless.  There  are  a number  of  ways  within  our\r\n\r\ncontrol which we can positively exploit. One of  these\r\n\r\nis to increase our productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of higher productivity has been the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  frequent exhortations by  many  concerned\r\n\r\nquarters.  Ironically, whilst both the  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers   are   agreed   on  the   need   for   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity, neither party seems to be able to  offer\r\n\r\nany tangible solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways of measuring the level of\r\n\r\nproductivity.    An    economist    would    determine\r\n\r\nproductivity by the value added per man-hour: that is,\r\n\r\nthe  gross  value  of output minus the  value  of  all\r\n\r\nintermediate  input, such as the  cost  of  materials,\r\n\r\nwages  and  overheads, and divide it by the number  of\r\n\r\nman-hours  put in. This method of measurement  appears\r\n\r\nto  be  rather impersonal and does not consider  other\r\n\r\nfactors  like  the sources of input,  quality  of  the\r\n\r\nproducts, prices, and markets for the output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the employer's point of view, the practical\r\n\r\ngauge  for productivity lies, of course, in the margin\r\n\r\nof profits. The employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  naturally  ever conscious of the  need  to  reduce\r\n\r\ncosts  in  terms  of  materials and  wages,  and  when\r\n\r\nopportune,  through increase in the  prices  of  their\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the workers, the question of whether higher\r\n\r\nproductivity  will mean that they will  have  to  work\r\n\r\nharder,  or  if  they will enjoy the fruits  of  their\r\n\r\nlabour, is uppermost in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economist's definition of productivity is the\r\n\r\nsum  total of all the rational considerations  for  an\r\n\r\nefficient order of things. However, in a society  like\r\n\r\nours,  where monetary rewards and returns  become  the\r\n\r\nonly incentive for one's effort, the attitudes of  the\r\n\r\nworkers and the employers naturally prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Survey has pointed out that the\r\n\r\nincrease  in our GNP was only about 3% to 4%.  Various\r\n\r\nattempts   have   been  made  to  rectify   the   poor\r\n\r\nperformance, but all efforts seemed to centre on  what\r\n\r\nhave  been  mistakenly  considered  as  the  two  most\r\n\r\nimportant factors, that is to say, the various ad  hoc\r\n\r\nmodifications  to  the system of  production  and  the\r\n\r\namount of effort put in by the workers. Unfortunately.\r\n\r\nthe entire exercise has been no more than skimming the\r\n\r\nsurface without knowing the root causes that have  led\r\n\r\nus to this sad state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhortations on harder work find little reception in\r\n\r\nour  workers and these are only effective, if at  all,\r\n\r\nduring  the time they are being lectured to. In short,\r\n\r\nthis  is  nothing  more  than a  half-hearted  salvage\r\n\r\noperation of a situation which is unacceptable  to  us\r\n\r\nbut which we had helped to create for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of the matter lies in the work ethic - values such as job satisfaction and pride of\r\n\r\nemployment. These are precisely the very values  which\r\n\r\nour  education system, or more correctly a combination\r\n\r\nof  many  short-lived systems have failed to inculcate\r\n\r\nin the minds of our present generation of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have enough courage to face up to this painful\r\n\r\ntruth. A young worker of today,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay,  between  the  age of 23 and  25  years, is  the\r\n\r\nproduct of our education policy and system. He is  the\r\n\r\nshow-piece  of our education planners' fantasies.  But\r\n\r\nothers  may  even look upon him as a social liability;\r\n\r\nhe  has a soft mind, supported by a heart which easily\r\n\r\nfalls  prey to the temptations of the good things;  he\r\n\r\nis  not  even proficient in his first language, being\r\n\r\nthe   victim  of  our  so-called  bilingual  education\r\n\r\npolicy.  He  shuns meaningful jobs which  draw  better\r\n\r\npay,  opts for more cosy employment, and he  wants  to\r\n\r\nstart  life at the top. Further probe into his profile\r\n\r\nreveals an equally sad picture. He has been trained in\r\n\r\nthe technical skills to meet the needs of the economy,\r\n\r\nbut  he  has  not been taught in his school  days  the\r\n\r\ncorrect attitudes and values of work. The syllabus  in\r\n\r\nschool  provides  the  skill  training  but  not   the\r\n\r\nassociated  work  values.  He  might  even  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  the moulding mill in National Service,  where\r\n\r\nhe  was posted to a Hokkien platoon, having found that\r\n\r\nhis  bilingual  education was of no  help  to  him  in\r\n\r\nunderstanding his sergeant. May I remind Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nat  this  stage that most of us in this House are  the\r\n\r\nproducts  of a primarily mono-lingual education,  many\r\n\r\nare  today  effectively bilingual or even tri-lingual.\r\n\r\nThose who are not, as yet, are extremely proficient in\r\n\r\nat least one language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for these people, they have been spared\r\n\r\nthe agonies of the Playway Method or the Primary Pilot\r\n\r\nProject (PPP), the Multiple-Level Teaching Method, the\r\n\r\nGroup-Teaching  Method,  the  still-born  Restructured\r\n\r\nEducation  System, or the new Restructured  Education\r\n\r\nSystem,  which  is a reversion to the  old  vocational\r\n\r\nschool  system. Gentlemen, we are back to  square-one.\r\n\r\nHad   we   been   exposed  to  all  these  conflicting\r\n\r\nexperiments, our educationists would have  come  close\r\n\r\nto    producing   their   first   \"Frankensteins\"   in\r\n\r\nfrighteningly great numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they may yet succeed finally, if they persist My\r\n\r\nfear is not unfounded and it has been confirmed by the\r\n\r\nHon.  Senior  Minister of State  for  Education.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will remember his announcement in this  House\r\n\r\nthat he intended to incorporate the Primary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPilot Project into the formal education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Trial-and-error\" has been a convenient excuse for\r\n\r\nfailures, but in the case of our educationists, it has\r\n\r\nbecome a practised virtue, The Playway Method (PPP) is\r\n\r\nnothing new. It was introduced many years ago and  was\r\n\r\nthen known as \"The Activities Method\". This scheme was\r\n\r\nsubsequently dropped, I suppose, for good reasons, The\r\n\r\ndeparture  was  temporary, however, as  it  re-emerged\r\n\r\nunder a new name, but care was taken this time to call\r\n\r\nit  a  \"Pilot Project\" in case of another failure.  In\r\n\r\nthe event, it too became a failure. I congratulate the\r\n\r\nSenior   Minister  of  State  for   his   courage   in\r\n\r\nincorporating   a  \"Tried  failure\"  in   the   formal\r\n\r\neducation system. The Chinese language has an idiom to\r\n\r\ncater for this kind of situation, it says: \"change the\r\n\r\nsoup but not the medicine\" (huan tang bu huan yau). In\r\n\r\nmodern  medicine, it means: change the flavour of  the\r\n\r\npill's coating, but not the medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to subject the House to detailed\r\n\r\nillustrations of the multiplicity of systems  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  enumerated. Hon. Members who are in the teaching\r\n\r\nprofession  will  no  doubt be able  to  enlighten  us\r\n\r\nbetter.  But  I must remind the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nthat it is about time that it gets out of the twilight\r\n\r\nzone  and  begin  to distinguish between  fantasy  and\r\n\r\nreality. PPP and other educational novelties may  well\r\n\r\nserve  the needs of those countries from which we  had\r\n\r\ncopied  the  systems. We cannot afford the  luxury  of\r\n\r\nexperimenting to satisfy the whims and fancies of  the\r\n\r\nidealistic  educationists,  who  had  presented  these\r\n\r\nimported systems as their own innovations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no time for trial and error. We have only\r\n\r\ntwo   million  digits  to  juggle  with   whilst   the\r\n\r\noriginating  country of these ideas  has  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nmillions   from  which  to  choose  their  leadership,\r\n\r\nexecutive personnel and workers. We cannot afford  the\r\n\r\nhigh casualty rate in experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in this debate we may hear from the Minister\r\n\r\nhis  views  as to why everyone else - the  principals,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers, the parents and the students,  but  not\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education - must be blamed for this  sorry\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs. It has never occurred to  the  top\r\n\r\nhierarchy  in the Education Ministry the  need  for  a\r\n\r\nthorough   examination   of   their   own   proposals,\r\n\r\nmanagement  system, the contents of the  syllabus  and\r\n\r\nmost important, the whole purpose of education itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be unfair for me to say that the education\r\n\r\nsystem  as  a  whole  has failed altogether.  We  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in   producing  the   professionals,   the\r\n\r\nmanagerial personnel, and the skilled workers. But  it\r\n\r\nis  important  that  in  the  process,  we  must  also\r\n\r\ninculcate   the  night  kind  of  values  and   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility which provide the cultural ballast,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has often said, for any community\r\n\r\nto move on to higher planes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the need for some changes when a new\r\n\r\nleadership  takes command of a situation,  because  if\r\n\r\nthe  system  left behind by the previous incumbent  is\r\n\r\nallowed to continue, then he fears accusation of being\r\n\r\ndeficient in innovative thinking. But to change simply\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of changing can be disastrous.  Let  me\r\n\r\nquote two minor examples: Hygiene was removed from the\r\n\r\ncurriculum to save time for other subjects; but it had\r\n\r\nto  be  reintroduced later under the  name  of  Health\r\n\r\nScience  after the outbreak of a number of  infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases; Civics was regarded as a complete  waste  of\r\n\r\ntime  but suddenly someone rediscovers its value,  and\r\n\r\nof late it has also acquired a new name -Education for\r\n\r\nLiving. Sometimes I mistake it for \"Education for  the\r\n\r\nLiving\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This on-off-on-off merry-go-round must stop. May I\r\n\r\nliken  to  a  little  note which I wrote  recently  to\r\n\r\ndescribe  a  certain  situation,  It  says:  `Re   the\r\n\r\ncancellation of the last order, please note that  this\r\n\r\ncancellation has now been cancelled.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has gone wrong? It is easy to attach blame on\r\n\r\nothers,  but let us examine the following to  see  how\r\n\r\nour educationists fared in exonerating themselves:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (1): Are not the principals to be blamed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: This generation of principals are put\r\n\r\nthere  in  their  places by our own administration.\r\n\r\nThey  are  often  only  the executors  of  policies\r\n\r\ndecided by the Ministry headquarters. They are  not\r\n\r\nconsulted  in the policy formulation process.  This\r\n\r\nsituation  is  compounded by  having  to  implement\r\n\r\nwithout detailed guidelines on the new policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (2): Are the teachers to be held\r\n\r\nresponsible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: The bulk of the teaching profession are\r\n\r\ngraduates of our own Teachers' Training College  or\r\n\r\nwhat  is  now  known as the Institute of  Education\r\n\r\n(another   `change   soup   no   change   medicine'\r\n\r\nexercise). If they failed in their job, is  it  not\r\n\r\npossible that we have not trained them properly and\r\n\r\nadequately?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (3): Is this generation of students hopeless and helpless?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: There is now better living and study\r\n\r\nenvironment,  HDB  flats  are  going  up  every  30\r\n\r\nminutes  or  so, better nutrition, better  teaching\r\n\r\naids,   educational  television,   extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities, better syllabus (so it is claimed)  and\r\n\r\nbetter text books. Why and how come?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (4): The parents have not done their bit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: This generation of parents are better\r\n\r\neducated  than  the previous generation.  They  can\r\n\r\noffer  better help and guidance in their children's\r\n\r\nwork, But what happens to the other half of the day\r\n\r\nwhen the child is not in school and supposed to  be\r\n\r\nat  home?  Both of his or her parents are  at  work\r\n\r\ncontributing  to  the GNP, What  about  a  full-day\r\n\r\nsession  to  keep them off the streets and  confine\r\n\r\nthem to an environment more conducive to study?  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, a number of schools are running  on  a\r\n\r\none-session  basis and below the normal  enrolment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, this is one pilot project the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation can attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (5): Once out of school, the children\r\n\r\nwill  revert back to their dialects, how can  they\r\n\r\nimprove  their  literacy? This is  a  very  common\r\n\r\nquestion being asked all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: This has been so for the last 1 50 years\r\n\r\nsince the first school was built in Singapore. Did\r\n\r\nnot the Ministry take this into consideration when\r\n\r\nthey   decide  on  the  contents  of  the   school\r\n\r\nsyllabus?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (6): Are we going through a\r\n\r\ntransitional    period    in    our    educational\r\n\r\ndevelopment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: In a recent informal conversation with an\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Ministry luminary, I was told that our\r\n\r\neducational system is going through a transitional\r\n\r\nperiod,  I salute him for his courage in defending\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry, but after 17 years since 1959, are\r\n\r\nwe   still  in  transition?  I  wonder  when  this\r\n\r\ntransition will end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion: As in Mathematics, the Q.E,D, to\r\n\r\nthese  questions  is  obvious.  The  Ministry   of  Education stands indicted,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are still in doubt that the Ministry\r\n\r\nis  actually in such a bad shape, further  evidence\r\n\r\nis  herewith provided. SBS was in such a mess  that\r\n\r\nwe  had  to move in a Government Team of Officials.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Education has  just  received  a\r\n\r\nGovernment Team of top Administrators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this injection of new vigour and fresh blood,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  Hon.  Members in this  House  and  all\r\n\r\nparents will share with me the hope, even that vain\r\n\r\nhope, that the Senior Minister of State, who by his\r\n\r\npublic  confession is an administrator  and  not  a\r\n\r\npolitician,  will have the stamina to continue  his\r\n\r\ngood  work  in clearing up the mess,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nparents, teachers, principals and the students  can\r\n\r\nbe  spared  the agony of being guinea-pigs  for  so\r\n\r\nmany  years  to  the  fantasies  of  the  arm-chair\r\n\r\nidealists, May I conclude on this lighter note:  `A\r\n\r\nnew broom sweeps clean, but the old one knows where\r\n\r\nthe dirt is,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker. Sir, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement this year, as expected,  is  a  mild\r\n\r\none.  There is only one item of tax increase, and that\r\n\r\nis on cigarettes and tobacco. This is also interpreted\r\n\r\nas  a  further step to frustrate smokers, in the  hope\r\n\r\nthat they will be reminded that smoking is bad and  to\r\n\r\ngive up smoking. The intention, of course, is good. To\r\n\r\nthe  general  citizenry, the budget is no  longer  the\r\n\r\nonly  document for the pronouncement of tax  increases\r\n\r\nor  the introduction of new taxes. As everybody knows,\r\n\r\nthe  month  of  March is not the  only  time  for  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of tax increases or the introduction  of\r\n\r\nnew  measures. Notwithstanding all these  remarks,  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture  when we are not very  certain  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  future, this Budget which on the whole  does\r\n\r\nnot propose any tax increases is welcome by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking back over the past decade, since our\r\n\r\nindependence we have done a great deal in the field of\r\n\r\nbuilding  construction for everyone to  see.  We  have\r\n\r\nskyscrapers  and factories mushrooming  all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace.  We  have a busy port. There has  been  general\r\n\r\neconomic  prosperity. Singapore has become a servicing\r\n\r\nand  financial  centre, an Asian Dollar Market  Centre\r\n\r\nand an oil-prospecting centre for South-east Asia.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, as a country lacking in natural resources, our\r\n\r\nsurvival   depends  on  our  economic  viability   and\r\n\r\nstability.  There  have  been  indisputable   economic\r\n\r\nachievements over the past decade and we were able  to\r\n\r\ncreate thousands of jobs not only for our own citizens\r\n\r\nbut  also for foreigners to fill the gap in our labour\r\n\r\nforce.  In  battling  the oil  crisis,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nproved  that she has the economic capacity to  survive\r\n\r\nand  recover, and not allow herself to be put  in  the\r\n\r\nposition as in other countries where they are  saddled\r\n\r\nwith  large scale unemployment. This is something that\r\n\r\nwe should be proud of,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a country to stress certain aspects of\r\n\r\ndevelopment neglecting the others will lead to  social\r\n\r\nimbalance  and  aberration.  The  obvious  result   of\r\n\r\nstressing  only on economic development is evident  in\r\n\r\nsome  Government departments being mercenary - minded,\r\n\r\nwhere junior officers try to please their superiors by\r\n\r\nmaking more money for their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartments  and where senior officers try  to  please\r\n\r\ntheir  Minister  by  the same means  in  the  hope  of\r\n\r\ngetting  promotion or even double or treble promotion.\r\n\r\nTo the public, Government departments become a Yar Men\r\n\r\ninto  which  they cannot enter without money.  As  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jalan  Kayu  had  said  here  last  year,\r\n\r\nnowadays  public servants seem to have forgotten  that\r\n\r\ntheir   primary  function  is  to  serve  the  people.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  think of making more money  for  their\r\n\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret to say that from my own observation,\r\n\r\nthere  is an increasing tendency on the part of  civil\r\n\r\nservants to glorify themselves by making more and more\r\n\r\nmoney, and there is no abatement in this tendency. For\r\n\r\nexample, the  Housing  and  Development  Board   has\r\n\r\nabolished  the  half-hour parking rate.  Instead,  the\r\n\r\nmotorist has to pay a minimum of 40 cents for an entry\r\n\r\ninto  the  car park. This has resulted in  the  social\r\n\r\nvogue of money-worship in the society. Everybody wants\r\n\r\nto  get  rich, and quick for that matter, Deceits  and\r\n\r\nmutual  fooling abound. So friends can be turned  into\r\n\r\nstepping stones for one's uplift. There is a  lack  of\r\n\r\nhumanity in our society. When you have money you  have\r\n\r\nfame and status, and you will be respected. Those good-for-nothing idle flatterers will attach themselves  to\r\n\r\nyou.  Whatever  means by which you obtain  your  money\r\n\r\ndoes   not   really  matter,  be  it  theft,  robbery,\r\n\r\nsmuggling  or illegal lottery, nobody cares. Graduates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  universities will ask these questions  when\r\n\r\nthey  apply for a job: How much salary will I be paid?\r\n\r\nHow  many  days' leave in the year, and what  are  the\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits? Workers are not contented with  what\r\n\r\nthey  get.  They are all the time on the  lookout  for\r\n\r\nbetter  paid jobs and greener pastures. They will  hop\r\n\r\nover for such new jobs, if available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are so fond of aping Western styles\r\n\r\nthat  they must wear cowboy jeans, go to the cabarets,\r\n\r\nbars  and  coffee houses and even to the gay quarters,\r\n\r\nand  worse  still, take to drugs. After wasting  their\r\n\r\nmoney  on these luxuries, when they do not have enough\r\n\r\nmoney, they turn to crime, robbery and theft. In spite\r\n\r\nof  the stringent laws that we have, the crime rate is\r\n\r\nstill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmounting.  What  has gone wrong with  our  society?  I\r\n\r\nthink   this   is  a  matter  that  deserves   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the country that we want to build is\r\n\r\nnot   one   that  puts  on  a  false  facade,  veiling\r\n\r\nhypocrisy, where everyone goes under a mask,  instead\r\n\r\nof  showing his true face, with empty form but without\r\n\r\na  soul.  The quality of the citizen that we  want  to\r\n\r\nmould  is not one who is selfish and self-centred.  If\r\n\r\nour country consists of only a group of passengers who\r\n\r\nare  money-worshippers, then the future of our country\r\n\r\nwill  be  bleak and that is something for us to  worry\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this points to one important aspect, that is we\r\n\r\nhave   so   far   only  emphasised  on   the   visible\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  our country and we  have  done  very\r\n\r\nlittle, if at all, about the invisible construction of\r\n\r\nnation-building. The moulding of a national character.\r\n\r\nthe  soul, the quality and character of our  people  - all these constitute the invisible construction that I\r\n\r\nhave  referred to. Invisible construction is  achieved\r\n\r\nmainly  through  education and culture.  We  inculcate\r\n\r\npatriotism  and  correct human behaviour  through  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  education in our schools.  Students  stay\r\n\r\nlonger  at home and outside schools. Parents are  busy\r\n\r\ndoing their business or making money and so they  have\r\n\r\nlittle  time at home for their children's studies  and\r\n\r\nthought-formation, In a society there is bad influence\r\n\r\nall  around,  The little things that they have  learnt\r\n\r\nabout life in school is inadequate to counter the evil\r\n\r\nand  greater influence that they have been  confronted\r\n\r\nwith  in  society.  In other words, the  students  are\r\n\r\ninfluenced  more by society than by the  teachings  of\r\n\r\ntheir  teachers, So perhaps extending the school hours\r\n\r\nmay  help,  but  at the present moment  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem does not permit this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reversal of the social ethos depends on the\r\n\r\ncultural  strength of our country, and this cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone overnight. So far we have done very little in the\r\n\r\ncultural field. The Ministry of Finance has allotted a\r\n\r\nvery  small  sum of money for the Ministry of  Culture\r\n\r\nfor cultural activities. It seems to be rather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstingy. This year there seems to be an increase in the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  funds,  and  this  amounts   to   only\r\n\r\n$105,000.  With such a meagre sum of money,  what  can\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture do? Perhaps the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance   thinks   that  culture  is  a   money-losing\r\n\r\nproposition  and so there is no point in spending  too\r\n\r\nmuch  money  on it. Of course, we admit that  cultural\r\n\r\nwork  requires money but this is money well  spent  on\r\n\r\ninvisible construction for our national good which  we\r\n\r\nmay  not see immediately but over the long time we can\r\n\r\nsee the benefits,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that economically we have the capacity\r\n\r\nto  survive. In defence, we have various land, sea and\r\n\r\nair  forces  to look after our security. In education,\r\n\r\nevery child has an equal opportunity. But in terms  of\r\n\r\nculture.  I  do  not  think  we  have  placed   enough\r\n\r\nemphasis.  We  have  travelled ten years  towards  the\r\n\r\nconstruction   of  a  republic.  We  have   laid   the\r\n\r\nfoundation for nation building. We have done  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  in physical and visible construction but in  the\r\n\r\ninvisible  aspect we have done little. The next  stage\r\n\r\nin  our nation building should lay stress on invisible\r\n\r\nconstruction.  Otherwise,  as  I  have   pointed   out\r\n\r\nearlier,   our   nationals  will  all   become   \"ugly\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\".  If  we have to live  among  the  \"ugly\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\",  then  I  am  afraid,  life   will   be\r\n\r\nmeaningless and survival will be pointless, because we\r\n\r\nmay all become \"ugly Singaporeans\" I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a first step I would like\r\n\r\nto  propose  that  the  Government  should  set  up  a\r\n\r\nNational   Academy  of  Arts  to  enable  considerable\r\n\r\nnumbers  of our children with special artistic talents\r\n\r\nto   receive  proper  training.  What  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nadvancement will they have without such an academy? We\r\n\r\nhave  some private academies, but these academies have\r\n\r\nnot  at  the present moment received adequate  support\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Government.  So,  they  have  to   charge\r\n\r\nexorbitant fees and as a result of such high fees only\r\n\r\nthe  rich  can afford to send their children to  these\r\n\r\nacademies for artistic training and pursuit.  Children\r\n\r\nof  poor families will have no chance. So how  can  we\r\n\r\npromote cultural and artistic activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with a National Academy of Arts, we shall on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand be able to promote interest in  culture\r\n\r\nand  art  and  on  the  other hand,  provide  training\r\n\r\nopportunities for our talented youths, irrespective of\r\n\r\nwhether they are rich or poor. The National Academy of\r\n\r\nArts   will   become  the  centre  for  our   cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I think this is a pressing need which  we\r\n\r\nmust  look  into. It is my hope that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance will consider this proposal seriously,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  despite difficult times in 1975 Singapore's real\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  4.1%  is a credit to the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But much has to be engineered to  maintain\r\n\r\npresent  growth rates in more difficult  times  ahead.\r\n\r\nOur  strategies need to be more sophisticated,  taking\r\n\r\ninto  consideration our better standard of living  and\r\n\r\nquality  of  life  when compared to the  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial challenges we faced in 1959. 1965 and 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to attract new investments, expand present\r\n\r\nones  and increase productivity. Productivity  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  the responsibility of workers. It has to  evolve\r\n\r\nfrom  the  board  room  with the  enthusiasm  that  is\r\n\r\nexpected of the shop floor. Improved work methods must\r\n\r\nbe  formulated and better machines designed to improve\r\n\r\nwork output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very closely linked with productivity is quality and\r\n\r\ntendencies  to  inspect quality must  be  obliterated.\r\n\r\nQuality  must  be  built into  our  products  and  not\r\n\r\ninspected.  A desirable work ethic must be  inculcated\r\n\r\nto  enable us to compete effectively in world markets.\r\n\r\nMiddle management quality consciousness leaves much to\r\n\r\nbe  desired  and unless this is enhanced, improvements\r\n\r\nin production cannot be anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that needs to be dealt with\r\n\r\nurgently  in  order  to increase productivity  is  the\r\n\r\nbetter  utilisation of leisure. Leisure is that period\r\n\r\nof  non-working  time of an individual.  This  accrues\r\n\r\nafter  deducting working hours, time taken for  travel\r\n\r\nto and from work, time spent at home preparing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeals,  eating,  recuperating, time  spent  on  family\r\n\r\nmatters  and so on. The apportionment will, of course,\r\n\r\nvary  with sex and age. For shift workers, this  is  a\r\n\r\nspecial  problem. Much has to be done to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nworkers'   leisure  is  usefully  spent  by   creating\r\n\r\nopportunities  for the useful utilisation  of  leisure\r\n\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisure provides a balance, eliminating the fatigue\r\n\r\ncaused   by  work  and  increasing  productivity.   It\r\n\r\nprovides  a contrast, encouraging workers to  seek  in\r\n\r\nsport,  tourism, hobbies and so on, some  compensation\r\n\r\nfor physical or psychological fatigue. It makes for  a\r\n\r\nbetter balance between life and work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisure should not merely help to maintain a\r\n\r\nworker's   health   and  thereby   conduce   to   high\r\n\r\nproductivity. It should, in addition, be a  factor  in\r\n\r\nsocial  adaptation, compensating for the isolation  of\r\n\r\nthe  worker in present-day industry, and even lead  to\r\n\r\nthe  advancement of a worker's career. To  a  steadily\r\n\r\nincreasing degree, leisure activities are being looked\r\n\r\nupon as a cultural duty and a symbol of social status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss in productivity is also a result of accidents\r\n\r\nat  work.  Greater stress on occupational  health  and\r\n\r\nsafety  will  result  in a safer working  environment,\r\n\r\nGreater emphasis must be placed on accident prevention\r\n\r\nand   not  injury  prevention.  More  scientific   and\r\n\r\nsystematic  systems  must be evolved  to  be  able  to\r\n\r\npredict accidental occurrences. A comprehensive  early\r\n\r\nwarning system developed can look at the total pattern\r\n\r\nof accidental happenings in each workplace, whether or\r\n\r\nnot  they  cause injury or damage. From data obtained,\r\n\r\nan  effective  system of accident  prevention  can  be\r\n\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our tourist industry has\r\n\r\ngrown  favourably, and for our own good it  must  grow\r\n\r\nfurther.  This  can  only be ensured  if  we  enhanced\r\n\r\nSingapore's image among tourists. The present state of\r\n\r\naffairs  in  unethical trade practices, if  continued,\r\n\r\nwill be a negating factor for our tourist trade. These\r\n\r\nunethical practices, needless to say, spill  over  and\r\n\r\naffect Singaporeans as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with public transport initially, not the\r\n\r\nSBS,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker. Sir. There  has  been  some\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the  buses;  they  break  down   less\r\n\r\nfrequently, cause less traffic congestion and seem  to\r\n\r\nhave  employed more congenial staff, but the Singapore\r\n\r\nTaxi   Service.   Tourists   and   Singaporeans   have\r\n\r\ncomplained  of  overcharging and blatant  cheating  by\r\n\r\nsome recalcitrant taxi-drivers who blemish the others.\r\n\r\nCommuters  wanting to ride into the CBD  pay  for  the\r\n\r\ndaily area licence. $3 before but now $4, and the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister knows how much more later on, which had  been\r\n\r\npaid  for  earlier in the day over and over  again  by\r\n\r\nprevious passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of overcharging. Extra\r\n\r\ncharges are sometimes levied for going short distances\r\n\r\ndue to, as is claimed by some taxi-drivers, a possible\r\n\r\nloss  of a more lucrative fare. Extra charges for also\r\n\r\nlonger   distances  to  compensate  the  tedious   and\r\n\r\nmonotonous  long  drive. Extra charges  too  from  the\r\n\r\nairport  and  the  port to any destination, for  more\r\n\r\nillogical reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another grave problem is the traumatic wait on the\r\n\r\nstreets frantically waving at every empty taxi, to  no\r\n\r\navail.  The  seemingly contented look of  these  taxi-drivers  give  the  impression of an  excellent  day's\r\n\r\ntakings  in their coffers. Here, the semaphore-sending\r\n\r\nfigure  is  usually a Singaporean who is considered  a\r\n\r\nless   lucrative  fare,  However,  those   `look-like-Singaporean'  tourists, and our  multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nincludes many, due to their `not-tourist-like'  attire\r\n\r\nbecause of their lack of interest in photography, have\r\n\r\nmany-a-time turned signallers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these unethical practices\r\n\r\nexist  also  in many of our shops. Being  a  shopper's\r\n\r\nparadise   for   tourists  as  well  as  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nhundreds  go  on  shopping sprees daily  and  a  large\r\n\r\nmajority  are  swindled. The honest  trader  finds  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to survive in this atmosphere.  Redress  in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of a claim in court can be both  unpleasant\r\n\r\nand  unrewarding. This is all the more aggravated when\r\n\r\nthe claim is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelatively  small. As such, these retailers  get  away\r\n\r\nwith their sins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, therefore. Sir, to establish a\r\n\r\nSmall  Claims  Court, a  people's  court  where   the\r\n\r\naggrieved can sue someone without paying money  for  a\r\n\r\nlawyer. Much can be achieved for the consumer, whether\r\n\r\ntourist  or  local, to ensure  his  fair  and  honest\r\n\r\ntreatment at the hands of the entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Government's anti-inflationary and anti-profiteering measures in 1975\r\n\r\nwere  successful,  NTUC, CASE and other  organisations\r\n\r\nhelped  tremendously to ensure this success,  However,\r\n\r\nalthough greater consumer awareness has been achieved,\r\n\r\nthrough  consumer information and services,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill exploitation of the consumers by sales persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few of us do not depend to some degree on the\r\n\r\nreliability  of  callers  to  our  door  such  as  the\r\n\r\nbreadman,  the newspaperman, the grocer, the gardener,\r\n\r\nthe  meter  reader and many more. Similarly,  a  great\r\n\r\nmany  people depend to varying degrees on door-to-door\r\n\r\nsellers  of  other goods. In fact, door-to-door  sales\r\n\r\npersons  have been a part of the commercial scene  for\r\n\r\nsome  years.  Over  the years, many organisations  and\r\n\r\nindividual  sales persons have provided  reliable  and\r\n\r\nvaluable  service to householders. These sellers  have\r\n\r\nbeen of very great assistance to those who, because of\r\n\r\nphysical handicap or age, have been unable to  venture\r\n\r\ninto the market place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, door-to-door selling or direct\r\n\r\nselling,  as  it  is often called, has  attracted  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  some  unscrupulous high-pressure  sales\r\n\r\npersons who, using unethical methods and, after a high\r\n\r\ndegree  of  practiced skill, will try  to  sell  goods\r\n\r\nwhich  the consumer neither needs nor wants  or  which\r\n\r\nthe consumer can ill-afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative safeguards are therefore needed to\r\n\r\nensure  that  consumers, who cannot afford  the  time,\r\n\r\nmoney  or  otherwise  for  themselves  to  be  skilled\r\n\r\nthrough  practice  and learning to  combat  such  high\r\n\r\npressure sales techniques, are properly looked after,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If goods are bought on credit, for instance, this\r\n\r\npiece of legislation could provide for a \"cooling-off\"\r\n\r\nperiod  to  enable  the consumer to  think  about  his\r\n\r\npurchase  and,  if  so decided, change  his  mind  and\r\n\r\ncancel the sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n1975 was a year of world-wide recession with the major\r\n\r\nadvanced industrial countries suffering on the average\r\n\r\na decline in growth of 2\u00ac%. In such bad circumstances,\r\n\r\nSingapore, an island nation without natural resources,\r\n\r\ncan  still  maintain a real growth in  gross  domestic\r\n\r\nproduct  of 4.1%, It is indeed a fair performance  and\r\n\r\nconsiderable  achievement. The 1976  Budget  Statement\r\n\r\npresented  by  our Hon. Minister for Finance  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  on  1st  March 1 976 clearly shows  that  our\r\n\r\npolitical,  economic and social situations are  sound,\r\n\r\nstable  and steady. But, Sir, how long can we maintain\r\n\r\nand  enjoy  this  sound situation  in  this  turbulent\r\n\r\nworld?  I  am  sure  nobody will be able  to  predict.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think we all agree that we cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto take things for granted. We should not relax and be\r\n\r\ncomplacent about our achievement, We should unite  and\r\n\r\nwork doubly hard so that we can continue to enjoy good\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming year, foreign investments in\r\n\r\nSingapore may be gradual and slow. Factors that  bring\r\n\r\nabout   a   slow  down  and  a  decrease  in   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments are beyond our control. For instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The economic recovery of the advanced industrial\r\n\r\ncountries takes time. Therefore, foreign investments\r\n\r\nin Singapore are expected to be slow and reduced;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The increasing acts of insurgency in the North-East and South of Thailand and in Malaysia have caused\r\n\r\nhesitancy in the minds of foreign investors and cause\r\n\r\nthem  to  adopt a more cautious or a wait-and-see\r\n\r\nattitude. Therefore, we can foresee that, except for\r\n\r\nshort-term investment, there is unlikely to be any\r\n\r\nhope of large-scale, long term investments before the\r\n\r\nentire political and economic situation of the region\r\n\r\nbecomes clear and stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as we all know, high wages and low\r\n\r\nproductivity  will further discourage investments  and\r\n\r\naggravate the unemployment problem. Though this factor\r\n\r\nis  very  complicated and difficult, it is within  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, considering these circumstances, we can foresee\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore in the coming year will face a serious\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. The Minister for Finance has  in\r\n\r\nhis  Budget  Statement touched on  the  adjustment  of\r\n\r\nwages  policy.  This  is  a  useful  reminder  to  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans. If we want to avoid the surging wave  of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  we  should,  besides  exercising  self-restraint  and  not asking for higher wages,  redouble\r\n\r\nour    efforts,   be   more   hardworking,    increase\r\n\r\nproductivity  and be prepared to accept  heavier  jobs\r\n\r\nwith lower wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure we all agree that we should attract\r\n\r\nforeign investments if we are to provide jobs for  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Regarding those investments which  Government\r\n\r\nhas  substantial  equity participation.  I  think  our\r\n\r\nGovernment has a duty to see:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That our people at all levels of work in these\r\n\r\nindustries   are  genuinely  given  opportunities   to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills, both technical and  managerial,\r\n\r\nand  to  acquire  the  know-how  of  these  industries\r\n\r\nbrought in by foreign investors;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That after a period of time, by systematic\r\n\r\nphasing, some of the more important posts at the upper\r\n\r\nechelons  should  be \"localised\" by  appointing  local\r\n\r\nincumbents to be groomed for these key posts.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  found  in practice that in some of the  existing\r\n\r\nindustries foreign expatriates have tenaciously  clung\r\n\r\non  to their posts by making all sorts of excuses  and\r\n\r\nruses to remain as long as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not want foreign investors to take too\r\n\r\nmuch  advantage by giving all sorts of excuses and  we\r\n\r\ndo  not also want to be the economic slaves of foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through ASEAN cooperation and as a group, I\r\n\r\nbelieve that we have a better investment climate  than\r\n\r\nLatin America, the Middle East or Africa. Therefore, I\r\n\r\nbelieve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  our future investments from foreigners are still\r\n\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget Statement is not perfect. I am\r\n\r\nafraid that the per capita income distribution is  not\r\n\r\nideal  as  the  trend is not directed towards  equity.\r\n\r\nThis  may create a wider gap between the rich and  the\r\n\r\npoor. Therefore, I would like the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nto look into this matter seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, though I have made certain\r\n\r\ncomments.  I  still support the 1976 Budget  Statement\r\n\r\nbecause  it is meant to achieve greater viability  for\r\n\r\nthe  Republic, to make it a financial centre,  and  to\r\n\r\npromote the Asian Dollar Market, and to make Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  centre  of export-oriented and more sophisticated\r\n\r\nindustries with scientific and higher technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  now before the House is as reasonable  as\r\n\r\ncan  be  expected in the circumstances  prevailing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  in  the world. Of course,  if  one  is\r\n\r\ndetermined to find fault with the Budget as  presented\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Finance, it is conceivable  that\r\n\r\none  may  be able to criticise with justification  the\r\n\r\nBudget  on some ground especially the failure to  give\r\n\r\nmore tax relief in respect of personal incomes. But  I\r\n\r\nmyself  am not particularly inclined to criticise  the\r\n\r\nBudget on any such ground, and I am personally of  the\r\n\r\nview  that we all should be thankful for a Budget that\r\n\r\ndoes not seek to increase taxes, particularly on basic\r\n\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that, while we have every reason to be\r\n\r\ngrateful  that  the  present Budget  proves  the  past\r\n\r\npolicies  and  leadership  of  our  Government  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrect,  we  may get into the habit of thinking  that\r\n\r\nour  Government  can be relied upon to  do  everything\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  proper  for our  future  interest  and\r\n\r\nwelfare.  Such an attitude of mind, coupled  with  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  participation by  the  Government  in  the\r\n\r\nsocio-economic   activities,  may   cause   individual\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto become complacent as to their own role in promoting\r\n\r\nthe well-being of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad to say, such complacency is becoming more\r\n\r\napparent  among  some Singaporeans. If  anything  goes\r\n\r\nwrong in Singapore, these people simply blame or curse\r\n\r\nthe Government for not preventing the thing from going\r\n\r\nwrong. If the Government does something to prevent the\r\n\r\nsame  thing  from  going  wrong  they  criticise   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for not doing so in a different way. It  is\r\n\r\nall  very  well  and  easy to put  the  blame  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  it  must not be forgotten  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not a miracle worker and that there  are\r\n\r\ndefinite limits to the power of the Government  to  do\r\n\r\nall  the  things which the Government wants to  do  or\r\n\r\nought to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my point clear, let me illustrate the matter\r\n\r\nwith  a reference to a noticeable trend among some  of\r\n\r\nthe professional and the elite classes of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho indulge themselves in a form of escapism. While it\r\n\r\nmay  be  exaggerating  to  describe  the  trickle   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans seeking to emigrate to other countries as\r\n\r\na   brain-drain,   the  fact  remains   that   certain\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  consider  themselves  to  be  completely\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  the socio-economic  conditions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as to have the desire to start a new life in\r\n\r\na strange country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they leave it at that, that would be the end of\r\n\r\nthe  matter  as far as I am concerned, But  they  have\r\n\r\nseen   fit   to  blame  the  Government  for  creating\r\n\r\nconditions  which are intolerable to  them  and  which\r\n\r\nhave  forced  them to emigrate from Singapore.  In  so\r\n\r\nblaming  the Government, they seem to have the support\r\n\r\nand  sympathy  of their friends and acquaintances  who\r\n\r\nbelong  to the same professional and elite classes  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, their grievances seem to be that Singapore\r\n\r\nis too highly disciplined a society for them and their\r\n\r\nchildren,  They do not seem to care that without  such\r\n\r\ndiscipline  Singapore  would not  have  been  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be a viable, independent Republic.  They\r\n\r\nalso  seem  to  forget that they also enjoy  far  more\r\n\r\nprivileges and perks than most Singaporeans  and  that\r\n\r\nwith such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater   privileges   come  correspondingly   greater\r\n\r\nobligations towards the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My purpose in referring to the few Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nseek greener pastures rather than face up to realities\r\n\r\nis   to  draw  attention  to  the  attitude  of   mind\r\n\r\nunderlying  the  whole matter. On the  one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  blamed by the emigrating  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfor  not allowing them to lead a way of life which  is\r\n\r\nprejudicial  to the interest of the other Singaporeans\r\n\r\nby reason of Singapore's socio-economic circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, the Government is also blamed  by\r\n\r\nthe   stay-put  Singaporeans  for  not  imposing  more\r\n\r\nrestrictions on the emigrants so as to force  them  to\r\n\r\nlive up to their obligations to the society from which\r\n\r\nthey have benefited so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an attitude of mind, the Government makes\r\n\r\na   very   handy  scape-goat  for  every   conceivable\r\n\r\ngrievance. Either the Government is blamed  for  doing\r\n\r\ntoo  much or doing too little. Those who are aggrieved\r\n\r\nthat they cannot lead what they consider a fashionable\r\n\r\nway  of life choose to blame the Government for  being\r\n\r\nunduly restrictive rather than adapt themselves to the\r\n\r\nsocioeconomic  circumstances of Singapore.  Those  who\r\n\r\nare  angry  with  the Government for appearing  to  be\r\n\r\nunduly liberal towards the former group of persons  by\r\n\r\nnot making them do their duties to Singapore choose to\r\n\r\nignore  what  they themselves can or ought  to  do  to\r\n\r\npromote   greater  self-identification  with  national\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, most Singaporeans seem to have fallen into\r\n\r\nthe habit of expecting the Government to do everything\r\n\r\nfor them. Thus, for them the Budget Statement seems to\r\n\r\nrepresent  not  a  comprehensive  statement   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of what the Government intends to do or not\r\n\r\nto  do  in respect of the economy of the nation  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole but as a specific refusal or omission to do what\r\n\r\nrespectively  concern  them  most  during   the   next\r\n\r\nfinancial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is most undesirable and unhealthy to have\r\n\r\nan  attitude of mind which views the Budget solely  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the Government's obligations to the  people\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nignore  the  question of personal obligations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  themselves to the Republic.

My point briefly is that the success  of  any\r\n\r\nBudget   is  ultimately  dependent  on  the   personal\r\n\r\ninitiative  and capacity for sacrifice of  the  people\r\n\r\nfor whose benefit the Budget has been drawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It testifies  also  to  the\r\n\r\nforesight   which   went   into   the   planning   and\r\n\r\nimplementation of the economic strategy that  provided\r\n\r\nthe  framework which has happily helped  us  withstand\r\n\r\nthe  shocks of the past few years. The problem now  is\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the same framework and to  enhance  the\r\n\r\neconomic security of not only Singapore, but of South-east Asia as well. If we have saved Singapore once, we\r\n\r\nshall  now have to bend our energies, in concert  with\r\n\r\nlike-minded people and leaders in ASEAN, to make ASEAN\r\n\r\nsecure as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has, characteristically,\r\n\r\ndefined  the  formula  adopted to  meet  our  economic\r\n\r\nproblems  as  \"the  tried and  tested  mixtures\".  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the public sector are to  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide the necessary facilities and services required\r\n\r\nto  sustain  growth. The private sector is  given  the\r\n\r\ntask  and  the  opportunity to increase and  diversify\r\n\r\nproduction and secure new markets. It is a mesh and  a\r\n\r\nmixture  that has hitherto succeeded in releasing  the\r\n\r\ncreative and productive energies of the people without\r\n\r\nundue  regimentation. In political terms it  has  also\r\n\r\nenabled  us to keep extremist and adventurist politics\r\n\r\nat bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no absolutes in practical politics and\r\n\r\nthere  is no such thing as a social framework  perfect\r\n\r\nfor   all   time.  Everything  is  relative  and   all\r\n\r\nprogressive societies are in a constant state of flux,\r\n\r\nchange  and evolution for the better, Some new  states\r\n\r\nare lucky in having leaders who have the knowledge and\r\n\r\nthe   skill   to   bring  about  social   change   and\r\n\r\nmodernisation peacefully; others have leaders who  can\r\n\r\nonly  move  with  violence and repression.  For  these\r\n\r\nlatter,  politics  is  more a matter  of  passion  and\r\n\r\nbelief than one of scientific precision.

Some  Members  have  expressed  this\r\n\r\nsupport  without reservations, while others have  been\r\n\r\nperhaps  less  uninhibited in  suggesting  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  reservations to this support. In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nexpected  more brick-bats to be thrown  at  me.  After\r\n\r\nall,   in   a  world  of  rising  expectations, when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have become accustomed to  double  digit\r\n\r\ngrowth rates, even a real growth rate of 4.1% must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered a come-down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose to deal with the comments of Members\r\n\r\nby  subject rather than by individual representations.\r\n\r\nI  must  thank  Members for their views and  comments,\r\n\r\nespecially   those  with  particular   insights.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the Member for Ulu Pandan, with his academic\r\n\r\ntraining   and  former  profession  in   History   and\r\n\r\ndiplomacy,  is  able  to  see  ASEAN  in  very   broad\r\n\r\nperspectives  of  time  and  of  distance,  whereas  I\r\n\r\nconfess  I  find some difficulty in seeing  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nwood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  trees  of inter-ministerial discussions  and\r\n\r\nnegotiations. At the same time. I also  envy  him  for\r\n\r\nthe  very keen eye that his new profession of  banking\r\n\r\nhas  given  him  on  the practical  use  that  greater\r\n\r\ncooperation  and new economic opportunities  of  ASEAN\r\n\r\nwill  have  for  him as a banker. As a  former  banker\r\n\r\nmyself,  I  join  him  in the  hope  that  ASEAN  will\r\n\r\nproduce,  and fairly soon, beneficial development  not\r\n\r\nonly  for  Singapore  but  also  for  the  very  large\r\n\r\neconomic unit that he has described as ASEAN. I  think\r\n\r\nthat the recent meeting of Economic Ministers in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur gives us great cause for this hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other Member who mentioned ASEAN was the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Whampoa.  I  think  he  was  under   some\r\n\r\nmisapprehension  when  he referred  to  the  attention\r\n\r\nwhich  we  gave  to industrialisation rather  than  to\r\n\r\nagriculture in ASEAN. I am of the opinion that he  was\r\n\r\nnot  correct.  The  emphasis,  even  among  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nindustrial projects chosen, was on fertilisers to help\r\n\r\nin  agricultural  development.  Nevertheless,  he  was\r\n\r\ncorrect in thinking that for Singapore the project  we\r\n\r\nhave  chosen is more concentrated on industry than  on\r\n\r\nagriculture,  although the diesel engine is  eminently\r\n\r\nsuited  to  the  use  of agriculture  as  part  of  an\r\n\r\nagricultural factor or other implements such as pumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to go on to the comments on growth\r\n\r\nand  prospects for Singapore. I always listen  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Whampoa with interest when he speaks  with\r\n\r\nhis  usual expertise on economic subjects. I think the\r\n\r\nMember  commented on the poor growth and analysed  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  unemployment which he gave as 6%,  and  he\r\n\r\nwent  on  to speak of the poor growth in a  number  of\r\n\r\nsectors.  I agree with him that we cannot be satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the performance of Singapore in 1975 and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat, in fact, the growth in 1976 will be better.  In\r\n\r\nmy  Budget Statement. I have not given any figures for\r\n\r\nmy   estimate  of  growth  in  1976  because  so  many\r\n\r\neconomists,  not  to speak of Finance Ministers, have\r\n\r\ngone  wrong in their economic forecasts that I do  not\r\n\r\nthink that this has any great value, But for those who\r\n\r\nare  interested in looking at crystal balls,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  figure  which  the Ministry of  Finance  computer\r\n\r\ncomes out with after making a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of  assumptions is nearer 8%. But, of  course,\r\n\r\nwith  qualifications  that  if  shipbuilding  and  the\r\n\r\npetroleum  refining  industries  do  not  come  up  to\r\n\r\nexpectations, then we may get a growth of 6%,  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, there are other figures which  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven by the Monetary Authority of Singapore which are\r\n\r\nmore optimistic. In fact, in these matters perhaps  it\r\n\r\nis  very  easy to pick on any figure you want and  you\r\n\r\ncan  have  it justified on the computer by making  the\r\n\r\nappropriate assumptions. Nevertheless, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nnot incorrect to say that we could expect to be better\r\n\r\noff this year than last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Whampoa also made a number of\r\n\r\ncomments  and queried the reasons for the deflator  in\r\n\r\nthe services sector. I do not have the explanation for\r\n\r\nthis,  but  if he likes I will write to  him  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also enjoyed the Member's comments on\r\n\r\ninternational   problems  such  as  the  international\r\n\r\nmonetary arrangements at Rambouillet and elsewhere.  I\r\n\r\nmay  say  that his remarks on the inflationary effects\r\n\r\nof the international money and gold discussions strike\r\n\r\na responsive chord in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong was dismayed by the Member for\r\n\r\nWhampoa's  forecast.  He  was  in  favour  of  a  more\r\n\r\noptimistic  outlook because of our success in  meeting\r\n\r\nprevious adverse economic conditions in the past  such\r\n\r\nas the rundown of the British forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> That is not the impression that I\r\n\r\ntried to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> But that was the impression I\r\n\r\nreceived  on  hearing the Member's speech.

I hope our  young\r\n\r\npeople  will listen to his exhortations. I also  agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  should deplore the tendency that we have  of\r\n\r\nextolling our achievements in the press. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeplore also with him the effect on our youth of these\r\n\r\nrather  vainglorious assertions  of  our  high  growth\r\n\r\nrates  and other matters. The Singapore ego is  pretty\r\n\r\nwell developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member for Katong on the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  character in  our  people,  not  only\r\n\r\nbecause  I  believe, like many people  concerned  with\r\n\r\neconomic  development, that the work ethic is  a  much\r\n\r\nenvied advantage of certain societies but also because\r\n\r\nof the intrinsic value of character-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Member who spoke on growth and prospects\r\n\r\nwas  the Member for Moulmein who was inclined to  take\r\n\r\nthe sombre aspects of our future prospects. I hope the\r\n\r\nyounger generation was listening when he urged them to\r\n\r\nface  the challenge and accept the hardships that  the\r\n\r\nolder  generation did in the past. I think most of  us\r\n\r\nhere are members of the older generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable number of other speakers spoke on\r\n\r\nthis   particular  topic.  The  Member  for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens was, I believe, satisfied with the performance\r\n\r\nof  4,1%  in  1975  and  hoped that  it  will  inspire\r\n\r\nconfidence.  I certainly hope that this  will  be  the\r\n\r\ncase.  The  other Members I have got  down  as  having\r\n\r\nspoken on his subject are the Members for Jalan  Kayu,\r\n\r\nAnson.  Boon Teck, Jurong and Potong Pasir. I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave full details of what they have said. In any case.\r\n\r\nI do not have the time to reply to them in view of the\r\n\r\nlimited time I have at my disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next topic. I listened with pleasure to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Potong Pasir when he spoke on his  special\r\n\r\nsubject,  the  consumer and consumer prices.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  commend CASE on its recent work in  bringing\r\n\r\ndown  the consumer prices in hawker foods, as well  as\r\n\r\nother  Members in this House who have also  been  very\r\n\r\nactively concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another topic which I have written down here is\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and this appeared to have caught the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  many  Members.  The  need  for   further\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our industrialisation programme appears\r\n\r\nto  be generally agreed. I appreciate the analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Telok Blangah of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem  now facing Singapore. He calls it, and  quite\r\n\r\nrightly.   \"another   crisis\".   He   spoke   of   the\r\n\r\nretrenchment and the unemployment in 1975 and even  in\r\n\r\n1976,  although I must say that we have had a somewhat\r\n\r\nmore  optimistic report for February this year.  This,\r\n\r\nhe  thought, should be met by all the  manufacturers,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, civil  servants  and  workers  getting\r\n\r\ntogether to overcome this problem. He called for every\r\n\r\nsector  of  our nation to come together. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  he thought the industrialists should be assisted\r\n\r\nby  being given tariffs and also preferential  trading\r\n\r\narrangements,  perhaps  in ASEAN,  At  the  same  time\r\n\r\nmanufacturers also must be tough in trying to get  new\r\n\r\nmarkets. I cannot agree more with this message because\r\n\r\nin  my  Budget  Statement I also  indicated  the  same\r\n\r\nattitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same message was also given by the Member for\r\n\r\nWhampoa  who  suggested the need for  the  economy  to\r\n\r\nstand up to the rigours of the changing conditions and\r\n\r\nof  workers and management to redouble their  efforts.\r\n\r\nHe  spoke  also of the decline in investment  and  the\r\n\r\nneed to stimulate this, The Member for Jalan Kayu also\r\n\r\nagreed  to the need for managerial and entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nimprovement  but he also emphasised the need  for  the\r\n\r\ncivil service to do likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the Members spoke on topics related to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. For example, the Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nHo  Swee  spoke  of  increasing  productivity  through\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes; the Member for Potong Pasir  spoke\r\n\r\nof  the  need  for  investment and  productivity;  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Thomson  spoke  of  the  prospects   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation by the fact that  there  were  lower\r\n\r\ninvestment, greater instability  in  the  region  and\r\n\r\nother difficulties, including wages policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members spoke on the manpower unit and\r\n\r\nmanpower  training. The Member for Kim Seng  suggested\r\n\r\nthat there should be a Central Manpower Research Unit.\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  the Member that the manpower  research\r\n\r\nwhich  is needed for such planning is centred  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance, but we of course always  welcome\r\n\r\nwhatever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassistance  we  can  get from any quarter.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  needs  for  manpower planning  in  the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries (of course, in the University also) such as\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Ministry  for  their  own  purposes;  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour, for unemployment statistics, would\r\n\r\nof  course  have  their own unit. But all  statistical\r\n\r\ndata are coordinated by the Statistics Department  and\r\n\r\nour Statistical Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens spoke of the need\r\n\r\nfor  adequate manpower planning as well as of manpower\r\n\r\ntraining.  He  displayed  some  disquiet  on  manpower\r\n\r\ntraining in the Industrial Training Board, and he also\r\n\r\nspoke  of  the  reluctance  of  our  young  to  accept\r\n\r\nemployment  in industry. The Member for  Thomson  also\r\n\r\nspoke   of  a  systematic  encouragement  of  training\r\n\r\nskills,  As  can be seen from my Budget  Statement,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with most or all of these statements.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  pursued  by my Ministry  in  promoting\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more controversial item is the subject of wages\r\n\r\npolicy.   The  Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  disputed   my\r\n\r\nstatement  that  the  Budget  Statement  was  not   an\r\n\r\nexciting  statement; especially  in  regard  to  wages\r\n\r\npolicy  it  would cause some feeling. He endorsed  the\r\n\r\npolicy  which I think has been agreed by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour, myself and the Secretary-General of NTUC,\r\n\r\nHe  suggested the need for keeping inflation down  but\r\n\r\nwarned against higher taxes and its effect on the cost\r\n\r\nof living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck also spoke very strongly.\r\n\r\non  this  policy  and the need of  training  in  skill\r\n\r\nintensive  projects  and praised the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers towards Government. He referred to my comments\r\n\r\non  the proliferation of non-wage items and the effect\r\n\r\non competition. With regard to funeral benefits, among\r\n\r\nother  things,  he suggested that this  was  desirable\r\n\r\nwhere  wages are inadequate. I accept that  allowances\r\n\r\nand  benefits  must be considered with  the  wages  in\r\n\r\njudging whether the whole is adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee also spoke on wages\r\n\r\npolicy  and  suggested that a full study  and  a  full\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  workers should  be  made  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter. I accept that the NTUC should be consulted and\r\n\r\nI think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  been, but the National Wages  Council  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  a channel for such consultation. In  such  a\r\n\r\nforum  the  figures he quotes on jobs and on  workers'\r\n\r\nincome  can  be studied as to adequacy.  In  the  same\r\n\r\nforum also, the comparison with executive benefits can\r\n\r\nalso be discussed with regard to its effect on cost. I\r\n\r\nam  glad,  however, that all Members are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider the need for examination of the wages  policy\r\n\r\nin   order  to  ensure  the  competitiveness  of   our\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to industrialisation were a number of\r\n\r\ntopics.  One was exports. Only one Member,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nquite sure which, spoke on our Export Credit Insurance\r\n\r\nCorporation, although quite a number of other  Members\r\n\r\nappreciated  the  need for more export  markets  being\r\n\r\nfound,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir spoke of an unrelated\r\n\r\nsubject,  which  is that of tourists in  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment   programme.   He   mentioned    unethical\r\n\r\npractices.  May I assure him that the problem  is  one\r\n\r\nwhich  has  engaged our close attention, as  are  the\r\n\r\nmalpractices by taxi drivers and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied touched upon the problem of\r\n\r\nbrain-drain from Singapore. I do not think  that  this\r\n\r\nparticular  problem is at present  of  a  sufficiently\r\n\r\nserious  nature  for  us  to  discuss  it  as  in  our\r\n\r\nfinancial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the comments on expenditure. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan  Kayu spoke of the shortfall in expenditure\r\n\r\nagainst  amounts  voted,  and  suggested  that'  there\r\n\r\nappeared  to be an urgent need for a machinery  to  be\r\n\r\nadequately  geared for this work, This is, of  course,\r\n\r\none  of  my  daily  concerns  -  how  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure for anti-recessionary measures\r\n\r\ncan  be  stimulated. He commented also on the dominant\r\n\r\nposition  of  the  public sector  and  said  that  the\r\n\r\noriginal objective of not to compete with the  private\r\n\r\nsector  was  being forgotten. I myself  would  welcome\r\n\r\ngreater  activity in the private sector,  particularly\r\n\r\nin  these recessionary times. In fact, the stimulation\r\n\r\nof public expenditure has been made mainly because the\r\n\r\nresponse from the private sector has been inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I will cut short the remarks on various\r\n\r\nother  matters and come to the main topic of interest,\r\n\r\nwhich  was taxes. Many Members appeared to prefer  the\r\n\r\nagony  of  taxes  to  be imposed  on  definite  times,\r\n\r\nparticularly during the time of the Budget.  I  cannot\r\n\r\ngive  any assurance that Budget time will be the  only\r\n\r\ntime when taxes will be imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a fairly full reply to the Member for Punggol\r\n\r\non  the necessity for not giving further allowances in\r\n\r\npersonal and earned income and also on CPF allowances.\r\n\r\nI think these are really the strategies of a financial\r\n\r\npolicy  and I am sure there is another opportunity  to\r\n\r\ndebate this question. The main reason is that,  as  he\r\n\r\nhas already anticipated, a small increase of $1,000 in\r\n\r\npersonal  or  earned  income relief  would  cause  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to sacrifice about $26 million per annum in\r\n\r\nrevenue. I am afraid I am unable to spare that kind of\r\n\r\nmoney.   Our  objective  should  be  an  increase   in\r\n\r\nindividual income so that the tax burden for  all  our\r\n\r\nsocial  and  security services are borne  by  as  many\r\n\r\npeople as possible to spread the load. As it is,  only\r\n\r\n236,000  or  26% out of a work-force of about  900.000\r\n\r\nworkers  pay personal income tax, but the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  services  are enjoyed  by  all.  In  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  for example, the United States,  a  higher\r\n\r\nproportion of the workforce pays tax. In the US, there\r\n\r\nare 84 million taxpayers, or 90% out of a workforce of\r\n\r\nabout  93 million. In Australia there are 5.6  million\r\n\r\ntaxpayers,  or  95% out of a workforce  of  about  5.9\r\n\r\nmillion.  In Japan there are 31 million taxpayers, or\r\n\r\n60% out of a workforce of about 52 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the financial year 1st April, 1976  to\r\n\r\n31st March, 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn-[Mr. Hon Sui Sen]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Four minutes past</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1976/19760315/19760315-HA-0350317.pdf\"\">Committee of Supply - Main and Estimates of Expenditure for the Financial Year 1st April 1976 to 31st March 1977(Cols. 317-320)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
