It is now\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  give  legislative  approval  to  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of the sums shown in these  Estimates,\r\n\r\nand  the  Appropriation Bill tow before Members  is\r\n\r\nintended so to provide. Under section 97 (1) of the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, an\r\n\r\nAppropriation  Bill containing,  under  appropriate\r\n\r\nheads  of  expenditure, sums  of  money  which  are\r\n\r\nrequired for the several services of the Government\r\n\r\nshall be introduced to the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appropriation Bill sets out all the amounts\r\n\r\napproved  by  the  Assembly  in  the  Estimates  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  and  arranged  under  the   heads   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  shown on pares 35 and  36  of  Command\r\n\r\nPaper  14 of 1963. Once the Appropriation Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen   approved,  I  will  be  empowered  to  issue\r\n\r\nwarrants  authorising expenditure up to the  amount\r\n\r\nunder  each  head in the Appropriation Bill  to  be\r\n\r\npaid out of the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nduring the course of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Budget Estimates, some  surprising\r\n\r\nfacts  and  statements of principle have come  out.\r\n\r\nYesterday  the  Minister for Culture  claimed  that\r\n\r\nonce  the  People's Action Party was  elected,  its\r\n\r\npolicy  became  national policy and  therefore  the\r\n\r\nParty  in  power could spend money as it liked  for\r\n\r\npropaganda  purposes  using  government  machinery.\r\n\r\nSir,I  think  that concept of  democracy  is  not\r\n\r\nreally  parliamentary  democracy  but  totalitarian\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  Let mc explain, Sir. They were  elected\r\n\r\non the basis of 54 per cent of the votes. They have\r\n\r\nthe  right, as the majority Party in control of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  pass  on  their  views   for   the\r\n\r\nacceptance  and obedience of the people.  But  they\r\n\r\nhave  no right to say that they therefore claim  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  100 per cent of the people. If  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  policy  accepted by the nation, in that  case,\r\n\r\nthere  would have to be a national coalition.  Then\r\n\r\nonly you could say that those are the views of  the\r\n\r\nnation and then you could implement it on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe nation. But when it is only a majority Party in\r\n\r\ncontrol,  they can say they are doing it on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  nation and on behalf of the  people  as  a\r\n\r\nmajority Party. But they cannot on that basis \r\n\r\nover-ride  the rights of the Opposition, because if they\r\n\r\ndo,  then,  I  think, the concept has been  wrongly\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  parliamentary democracy.  It  should\r\n\r\nreally be described as a totalitarian democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was for this reason that we said the\r\n\r\nGovernment machinery for propaganda like television\r\n\r\nand  radio should be used in such a way that  there\r\n\r\ncould  be a division. People could say, well,  this\r\n\r\nis  being  done  by  the Party  in  power  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  That is all right. But when  they  are\r\n\r\ndoing  it  in the interests of the Party  preparing\r\n\r\nfor an election, the people are not deceived. There\r\n\r\nhas  been  confusion here. When I asked  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he was going round as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  or the Secretary-General of the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party, he said that he considered it  right\r\n\r\nto  use the opportunity to attack another political\r\n\r\nParty.  Sir,I  think that principle  is  not  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  could be applied to  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that came out is this. We are not\r\n\r\ndefending the rights of the United People's  Party.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  heard in this Chamber  the  possible\r\n\r\ncancellation  of the symbol of the United  People's\r\n\r\nParty ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

That is a matter of detail\r\n\r\nwhich has been and should have been debated and was\r\n\r\ndebated in the Estimates. It is a matter of detail.\r\n\r\nLet us go on general principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The other point is this. We are\r\n\r\nvoting  money for the Government to spend  for  the\r\n\r\nremaining half of the year. We hope this  will  not\r\n\r\nbe  their  aim:  of increasing the surplus  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Treasury at the end of the year. We hope\r\n\r\nthat  is  quite clear and that the Government  will\r\n\r\nmake sure that the money will be spent, because  if\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of the year again they report  a  big\r\n\r\nsurplus,  then  we  think  there  has  been \r\n\r\nunder-expenditure at the expense of the people's  welfare\r\n\r\nor  that too much money has been extracted from the\r\n\r\npeople  which would mean that there should be  more\r\n\r\nrelief  or  that there should have been more  money\r\n\r\nspent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Sir, in the Education Ministry, time\r\n\r\nand again the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas said that he could not do this or do that\r\n\r\nbecause there was no money in the Treasury and ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> I\r\n\r\nnever said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- there must be strict\r\n\r\neconomy;  a deficit was being faced. The result  is\r\n\r\nthat  the schools are understaffed, whereas if they\r\n\r\ncould   spend  more  money  there  would  be   more\r\n\r\nemployment.  Therefore, Sir, we trust that  knowing\r\n\r\nthere  are  big reserves, the Government would  use\r\n\r\nthe chance to engage more teachers and provide more\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, money is an important weapon and the Party in\r\n\r\npower  during  election time has an  advantage.  We\r\n\r\nonly  hope  that the money will be used fairly  for\r\n\r\nthe  people without unfairness to the other Parties\r\n\r\nduring and before an election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe 1963 Budget is a part of the Four-Year Plan and\r\n\r\ndove-tails  into  the P.A.P.'s  Four-Year  Economic\r\n\r\nPlan  for the betterment of Singapore. But when  we\r\n\r\ncome  to the Appropriation Bill today, we are being\r\n\r\nasked to vote for a further supply of $373 million.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, there is little  doubt  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of the people that the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\nmaking full use of public funds for party purposes.\r\n\r\nBy  denying  it,  the Government has  made  matters\r\n\r\nworse  by creating more doubts in the minds of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister believes that by propaganda alone his Government can deceive us. No, Sir. There must be something\r\n\r\nto \"propaganda\" about, and  for\r\n\r\nthat,  the  Government  has  little  to  advertise.\r\n\r\nMaking  empty Press statements, hurling abuses  and\r\n\r\ncynical  remarks  at Opposition Members  could  not\r\n\r\nhelp the P.A.P. very much. Last-minute dressings by\r\n\r\nany   government  could  not  help  to  save   that\r\n\r\ngovernment  from collapse. It is now  widely  known\r\n\r\nthat  elections  are coming as  prophesied  by  our\r\n\r\nParty  organ, Bersatu, more than two weeks ago.  If\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave its way, elections may be held in July, anyhow\r\n\r\nbefore 31st August, 1963. After that date elections\r\n\r\nto  the  Federal States will come under the control\r\n\r\nof  the Federation Elections Commission. Sir,\r\n\r\nlast-minute  dressings as what the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\ndoing  now in its rural visits, its so-called rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme, are nothing but  to  capture\r\n\r\nthe  votes in exactly the same way as the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government  did during  its  last  months  of\r\n\r\noffice. The people cannot be deceived by all  these\r\n\r\nelectioneering  stunts.  The  people  now  do   not\r\n\r\nbelieve  what the P.A.P. Government says. See  what\r\n\r\nhappens to the Four-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will pardon me if I\r\n\r\ndwell  a little bit more in detail on the Four-Year\r\n\r\nPlan.

And  unless  I\r\n\r\ngloss over it, I will not go into cents. I will  go\r\n\r\ninto  tens  of  millions of dollars of  development\r\n\r\nprojects.

The Four-Year  Plan\r\n\r\npromises  us  a  radical  transformation   in   our\r\n\r\neconomy, a new life to the people, a ray of hope to\r\n\r\nmany of the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Government said that it is an attainable plan.\r\n\r\nThen  why  was the Four-Year Plan not accomplished?\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?

When  I\r\n\r\npass  through it, I am basing it on things which  I\r\n\r\nknow,  as  I  could  not get any  information  from\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  In other countries when the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  a  plan,  what  it does is to  submit  regular\r\n\r\nprogress  reports  to  the  people  on  details  of\r\n\r\ntargets under-fulfilled and over-fulfilled. That is\r\n\r\nwhat  I  was doing when I was in the City  Council.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Four-Year Plan gives us a new vision  of\r\n\r\na   new  Singapore,  albeit  it  was  a  false  and\r\n\r\ndeceptive vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$871 million was to be used to achieve the target.\r\n\r\nBy  the  end of 1963 $650 million should have  been\r\n\r\nspent. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will only comment on the\r\n\r\nmajor  item  of  the plan. We can  knock  out  $270\r\n\r\nmillion earmarked for 1964 because it will  not  be\r\n\r\nspent,   for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, even if it wants to, cannot  last  till\r\n\r\n1964.  One  obvious reason is that more chaps  will\r\n\r\nfollow   the   example   of  the   ex-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture, and more  so\r\n\r\nafter  31st  August  when the P.A.P. has  no  more\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Special Branch and the C.I.D. Again,\r\n\r\nonce Malaysia is pushed through, the PAP, which  is\r\n\r\nneither  Left nor Right but capable of placing  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  the British at the same  time - and,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,I was told an  iguana  has  two\r\n\r\ntongues - will  be scratched out from  the  political\r\n\r\narena despite their great ambition of a free middle\r\n\r\nschool  education system which will be  used  as  a\r\n\r\npropaganda  weapon 10 win support in the Federation\r\n\r\nand   the  Borneo  territories  through  their  new\r\n\r\nproposed powerful short-wave radio transmitters. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, Sir, a P.A.P. Prime Minister of Malaysia is\r\n\r\nonly a conceited fancy - a dream. The P.A.P should be\r\n\r\nhappy  if  in the next elections they are  returned\r\n\r\nwith  just  a  few  seats to keep the  P.A.P. flag\r\n\r\nflying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second reason why the money earmarked\r\n\r\nunder  the  Four-Year Plan for 1964  would  not  be\r\n\r\nspent is that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

First  of  all,\r\n\r\ntheir scheme of land and agricultural developments.\r\n\r\nFour  thousand  acres  of  swamp  land  are  to  be\r\n\r\nreclaimed  costing $4 million.

As far as I know,  none  of\r\n\r\nthe  projects  has been started and  completed.  By\r\n\r\n1963  the  Government promise to build $20  million\r\n\r\nworth  of rural roads, bridges, markets, amenities,\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  water, drainage and  other  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I do not know how much has been spent,\r\n\r\nbut I think it is only a small fraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then their scheme for industrial development. The\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board has been set up to  take\r\n\r\nthe   place   of  the  Labour  Front's   Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board, The difference  is  only  in  the\r\n\r\nchange  of  names. Time and energy  was  wasted  to\r\n\r\ndraft  and  pass the legislation of the new  Board.\r\n\r\nWhen  the P.A.P. want to do something, they  always\r\n\r\nwant  a  new  name  so that others or  predecessors\r\n\r\ncannot  share any credit. This inability  to  think\r\n\r\nand act big has cost them a heavy price. The people\r\n\r\nare  only interested in seeing new factories coming\r\n\r\nup,  which means more jobs. The P.A.P. can  set  up 100  Economic \r\n\r\nDevelopment Boards with fat  salaries\r\n\r\nfor sycophants and time-servers, but what for? What\r\n\r\nbenefit  do the people get? The Government  intends\r\n\r\nto  spend  nearly $140 million by the end of  1963.\r\n\r\nwhich this Budget covers, on the various industrial\r\n\r\nprojects. But, Sir, if you go to Jurong - and this is\r\n\r\nafter  four years of P.A.P. bungling - where are  the\r\n\r\nfactories?  The P.A.P. used to condemn the.

The  P.A.P. grandiose\r\n\r\nscheme  of  building five projects to  augment  our\r\n\r\nwater supply has been a complete flop. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance wants to use me as a scapegoat. He puts\r\n\r\nthe  blame on me, I was Minister in charge of water\r\n\r\nsupply  for only three months, and I was told  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister wants to take  over  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  He  thinks he can run it better.  He  has\r\n\r\nfour  years to himself. Why should he blame me?  He\r\n\r\nhas  four full years with a Deputy Secretary,  with\r\n\r\nspecial duties, to assist him. And, Sir, this\r\n\r\nFour-Year  Plan was presented to the people in 1961 when\r\n\r\nI  was  no  more in the Government.,when the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had  more than one and a  half  years  of\r\n\r\nexperience  in  running the Water  Department,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  he  knew that the Johore water agreement  had\r\n\r\nnot   yet  been  signed.

But the\r\n\r\nGovernment is unable to solve all these problems in\r\n\r\n1963,  and  is  unable  to create  more  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities in 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if at all the Minister for Finance wants to bring the livelihood of the people of Singapore to\r\n\r\na  higher  level  of  security   and\r\n\r\nstability, then he should have paid more  attention\r\n\r\nin  this  Budget to the creation of more employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  than to extending the propaganda  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reorganisation of the various Government departments was supposed to have taken place sometime\r\n\r\nduring the last  four  years,  but\r\n\r\nduring  the course of this period it has  not  been\r\n\r\ndone  with  any satisfaction. That is why  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget before us, there are many, many points which\r\n\r\nare confusing and ambiguous.

He thought we had changed. But we thought we\r\n\r\nwere  on the right track all the time, that he  had\r\n\r\nadvanced  in political knowledge to get the  truth.\r\n\r\nNow   I   am   afraid  he  has  somewhat  reverted.\r\n\r\nRetrogression has set in in a matter of a few days.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

His main point is this, if I got him  right\r\n\r\nand  I  am trying to get him right: he objected  to\r\n\r\nour  policy,  particularly to the monies  that  are\r\n\r\nallocated  to the Ministry of Culture,  because  he\r\n\r\nsays  that it is wrong of the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nto  claim  that what he is propagating through  the\r\n\r\nmass  media is national policy. He still  maintains\r\n\r\nthat  the  propaganda that is carried  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture is propaganda in the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  Party.  He  does  not  accept  that  if  a\r\n\r\nGovernment is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelected to a particular policy and during its  term\r\n\r\nof office it tries to get the policy understood and\r\n\r\naccepted  on  a larger scale of the electorate;  he\r\n\r\nsays  that is still not national policy. I  have  a\r\n\r\nfeeling that if I were to try to debate this  point\r\n\r\nat  length, we should really be quibbling over  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  words - what  is  \"national\",  what   is\r\n\r\n\"Party\",  what is \"in the interests of the  Party\",\r\n\r\nand  so  on  and  so forth. But I thought  that  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Culture, did  make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that there are certain basic and fundamental\r\n\r\nobjectives  on  which we were elected:  (1)  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation of Malaya. I think  even  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin will accept that reunification\r\n\r\nwith the Federation of Malaya is a national policy,\r\n\r\nin  the  sense that all Parties accept that - there\r\n\r\nare  differences  of  opinion  on  the  details  of\r\n\r\nmerger - but  certainly that will be accepted.  Then,\r\n\r\nSir,  we stated that it is our objective to improve\r\n\r\nthe    living   conditions   of   our   population,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  working  class  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nrestricted  economic  situation  allows.  We  build\r\n\r\nhouses,  schools,  roads, and  other  services  for\r\n\r\nthem.  And I think it is quite legitimate that  the\r\n\r\nachievements  of  the Government  in  this  respect - fulfilment  of  its election promises -   should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  publicity. Whether we call it \"national\"  or\r\n\r\nhe calls it \"Party\", we can differ as to the tag we\r\n\r\nput  on  it,  but  I  think he will  accept  it  as\r\n\r\nlegitimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So apart from these two objectives, the third, of\r\n\r\ncourse, is the great objective of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  - getting   people  of  different  races, different\r\n\r\nreligions,  different cultures to see  eye  to  eye\r\n\r\nwith  one  another, to give and take  and  to  work\r\n\r\ntowards  an integrated Malayan or Malaysian culture\r\n\r\nof  the  future;  I think that he would  accept  as\r\n\r\nlegitimate, and is not in the interests  of  either\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. or the S.P.A. or the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, these are the three important\r\n\r\nclasses  of propaganda emanating from the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture.  Apart from these, I  think  there  is\r\n\r\nhardly  any  other. I will show  you.  These  three\r\n\r\ncategories would have exhausted all the activities.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   to   say  that  we  were   using   the\r\n\r\ninstruments  of  State  for the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nParty,  I  somehow feel that it is an  uncharitable\r\n\r\ninterpretation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite unworthy of the Member for Tanglin in his now\r\n\r\nprogressive frame of mind.

Jurong is pressing on. But\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member says that he has not seen factories\r\n\r\nthere.  That  is an obvious untruth.  We  are  very\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with untruths whenever we  have  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  what the Member for Hong Lim says. The  power\r\n\r\nstation  is  carrying  on: the  loans  are  in  the\r\n\r\npocket:  the airport runway is being extended:  the\r\n\r\nairport  terminal building will he completed  in  a\r\n\r\nfew  months'  time; one school is  being  completed\r\n\r\nevery  three  weeks;  T.V. is  now  an  established\r\n\r\nservice in Singapore, and a second channel will  be\r\n\r\nset  up  soon - all  this to the great  consternation\r\n\r\nindignation  and  demoralisation  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to say we have little to show is obviously a\r\n\r\npoint unworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second untruth, he says, is that the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board is exactly the  same  as\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Promotion Board, and that the  only\r\n\r\ndifference is that a new Ordinance has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  passed by this Assembly, but that except  for\r\n\r\nthe  parts  of the Ordinance and the difference  in\r\n\r\nname,  it  is exactly the same. Sir, in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement, I went to great lengths to explain  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  now  a  new and powerful  agency  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to promote industrial growth,  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  now no less than six international experts  in\r\n\r\nvarious  lines  as  well  as  more  than  30  local\r\n\r\nexperts.  The  results  of  their  endeavours   are\r\n\r\nbecoming  more and more apparent day by day.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  the  work of the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard is showing results which are apparent day  by\r\n\r\nday.  In  fact, now when a new factory or  a  major\r\n\r\nindustrial  venture is established,  it  no  longer\r\n\r\nhits the headlines. For instance, in the Malay Mail\r\n\r\nof two days ago, there was a small paragraph tucked\r\n\r\nsomewhere to say that an oil refinery was to be set\r\n\r\nup  in  Jurong. On another page, there was  another\r\n\r\nsmall item to say that a new pipe factory was to be\r\n\r\nset  up  in  Jurong  and that the first  polyvineal\r\n\r\nchloride pipe factory in Singapore was to be set up\r\n\r\nthis  year with a 30-ton output. Then there  was  a\r\n\r\nreference to five more secondary technical  schools\r\n\r\nto be set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members have maintained that there\r\n\r\nhas  been no improvement in the economic situation.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  some  of  them  say  there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ndeterioration. For example, at page 10 of the Malay\r\n\r\nMail  dated  13th  June -  two days ago - we  have  the\r\n\r\nviews  of an international expert - one of the United\r\n\r\nNations  experts  - who was here in 1960 and who  has\r\n\r\ncome  back  here  again. I think the  views  of  an\r\n\r\ninternational   expert   - completely  disinterested,\r\n\r\nunbiased  in Singapore carry more weight  than  the\r\n\r\nviews of certain Members of the Opposition. He said\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore's  economic  position  had   shown\r\n\r\nconsiderable improvement since his first  visit  to\r\n\r\nthe  State in 1960. And he said. \"Today, I see that\r\n\r\nemployment  is  going  up.\"  Now  there  are  other\r\n\r\nreferences in the newspaper, and if you will  allow\r\n\r\nme  some time to get to the right page, I think  it\r\n\r\nwill he here. Well, I have not got the actual date.\r\n\r\nI think it might be here. Anyway. I am not going to\r\n\r\nwaste  the  time of the House in going through  the\r\n\r\npapers because the items are all tucked away, as  I\r\n\r\nhave said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  odd corners. But I remember distinctly that  on\r\n\r\nthe  day I delivered my Budget speech, there was  a\r\n\r\nreference  to no less than six industrial  projects\r\n\r\nthat  are due to go up in Singapore this year.  One\r\n\r\nwas  the  oil  refinery,  there  were  three  major\r\n\r\nfactories   to  be  established  by  a   group   of\r\n\r\nindustrialists  from Formosa - a plywood  factory,  a\r\n\r\nchemical   plant  and  a  plastics   plant;   three\r\n\r\nfactories  which  will  give  employment   to   900\r\n\r\npersons.  There were also references to some  other\r\n\r\nindustrial ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these are the direct results of the\r\n\r\nefforts of the Economic Development Board,  and  to\r\n\r\ndismiss  their  activities as being of  no  account\r\n\r\neither  shows  a  state  of mind  that  refuses  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge  the  truth,  or  betrays  a   colossal\r\n\r\nignorance  of what is really going on in the  State\r\n\r\ntoday of the enormous progress that we have made in\r\n\r\nthe last 18 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Third Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading.

M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we were, in addition  to\r\n\r\nbeing  asked to consider the revision of the salary\r\n\r\nscales  of  the  Assembly  Staff,  also  asked   to\r\n\r\nconsider a proposal that the four topmost posts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  service should be removed  from  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, and he placed in a closed  Assembly\r\n\r\nService. The main reason for this proposal  is  the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  placing such  posts  outside  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the Executive Government to  avoid  any\r\n\r\npossibility  of  their  being  brought  under   the\r\n\r\npolitical  control of the Executive  Government  in\r\n\r\norder  to maintain the independence and dignity  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly in accord with similar arrangements in\r\n\r\nthe  English  House of Commons. Sir,  in  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  the  equivalent of  an  independent\r\n\r\nPublic   Service   Commission  which   is   outside\r\n\r\npolitical  control and entrusted with the  duty  of\r\n\r\nrecruiting, promoting, transferring and  exercising\r\n\r\ndiscipline generally over the civil service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere.  There  the  Civil Service  Commission  only\r\n\r\nrecruits  to the civil service and has  no  control\r\n\r\nover promotions, transfers or discipline. Promotion\r\n\r\nto the top posts in the civil service in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom   depends  on  recommendations   from   the\r\n\r\nPermanent   Head   of   the  Treasury,   but   such\r\n\r\nrecommendations first receive ministerial  approval\r\n\r\nbefore they are implemented. As the kind of service\r\n\r\nwhich  officers  appointed to serve  the  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons  renders  is entirely different  from  that\r\n\r\nrendered  by the rest of the civil service  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, and as promotions to  the  topmost\r\n\r\ncivil  service  posts there depend  on  ministerial\r\n\r\napproval,  there  was  therefore  good  reason  for\r\n\r\nplacing  these  appointments in  a  closed  service\r\n\r\noutside  the ordinary civil service; but conditions\r\n\r\nhere,  Sir, are not similar. In Singapore  we  have\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service Commission  which  is  outside\r\n\r\npolitical   control,  exercising   authority   over\r\n\r\nrecruitments, transfers, promotions and  discipline\r\n\r\nin  the civil service. Under section 46 (2) of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Constitution)  Order  in  Council,  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of the Clerk is made by the  Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara acting in his discretion but  after\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the  Speaker  and  the   Public\r\n\r\nService   Commission;  and  the   recruitment   and\r\n\r\npromotion of other staff of the Assembly  are  made\r\n\r\nby the Public Service Commission. They are also not\r\n\r\neligible  for  promotion or transfer to  any  other\r\n\r\nappointment  in  the  public  service  without  the\r\n\r\nconsent of the Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these provisions in themselves ensure that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  possibility of any of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nstaff  being  brought  under  the  control  of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Government. While we pay due  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  dignity and authority of this Assembly, we are\r\n\r\nat   the  same  time  realists,  and  are  able  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that there is a great deal of difference\r\n\r\nbetween  our Assembly and the United Kingdom  House\r\n\r\nof  Commons, which has developed in the  course  of\r\n\r\ntime to be a world forum. It is true that the Clerk\r\n\r\nof  the House of Commons enjoys the same salary  as\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretary of a large United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nMinistry, but it does not follow that because  this\r\n\r\nis so, the Clerk of our Assembly who has control of\r\n\r\na staff of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly 41 and serves an Assembly of 51 Members should\r\n\r\nreceive  emoluments of a local Permanent  Secretary\r\n\r\nwho has control of a staff of many Divisions with a\r\n\r\nnumber  of Deputy Heads and a total staff amounting\r\n\r\nto a few thousands ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Registration is necessary in  order\r\n\r\nto   protect   the   public  from   untrained   and\r\n\r\ninexperienced,   persons.   A   controlling    body\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the accountancy  profession  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  maintain the standards of  accounting\r\n\r\nskill and the integrity of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now refer to the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  which, are incorporated  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Much anxious thought was given to the matter\r\n\r\nof  unqualified accountants who are now  in  public\r\n\r\npractice. The Bill in' its original form would have\r\n\r\nput au of them out of business. It is, however, not\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Bill to deprive any person  of\r\n\r\nhis  livelihood. So the Select Committee reached  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  solution  in  the  initial   stage   of\r\n\r\nlegislation,  which  is to bring  such  unqualified\r\n\r\npersons  into  the  ambit of  the  Bill.  The  most\r\n\r\nsuitable nomenclature to adopt for these persons is\r\n\r\n\"licensed  accountants\". Some  people  are  unhappy\r\n\r\nover  this  name  which has been taken  after  much\r\n\r\nthought   and  without  any  intention   of   being\r\n\r\nderogatory  to  anybody.

Many of the undisposed money orders relate\r\n\r\nto  disputes  between landlord and  tenant  in  the\r\n\r\npayment of rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 54 (2) of the Post Office Ordinance (Cap.\r\n\r\n105) provides two conditions to be fulfilled before\r\n\r\nan unpaid money order may be credited to revenue  :\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that neither the payee nor the remitter can\r\n\r\nbe found; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that no claim is made within the period of\r\n\r\nthe one year from the date of issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  first condition that neither the payee nor the\r\n\r\nremitter can be found prevents the Department  from\r\n\r\ncrediting the order to revenue as in most instances\r\n\r\nboth the payee and remitter can be found but cannot\r\n\r\nbe  persuaded or obliged to claim payment. It  has,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  been necessary to amend section  54  of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides that the amount payable on a\r\n\r\nmoney  order  is  to be paid into the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund  where no claim is made within the  period  of\r\n\r\none year from the date of issue of the money order.\r\n\r\nThe    Postmaster-General   is,   however,    given\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to pay the amount .of any  claim,  even\r\n\r\nthough  made after the period of one year  but  not\r\n\r\nlater  than  three years, if he is  satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthere  is reasonable cause for the delay in  making\r\n\r\nthe claim or if hardship would otherwise result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel legislation was introduced in the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya on 29th November last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while sympathising\r\n\r\nwith the Postmaster-General in his difficulties and\r\n\r\nhis  inability  to  dispose of  these  embarrassing\r\n\r\namounts,  there  seems to be a point  of  principle\r\n\r\ninvolved   in   this,  which,  if  not   determined\r\n\r\nproperly,  might lead to adverse property  results.\r\n\r\nSir,  the position is this. If I owe Mr X $250,  I\r\n\r\ntake  a money order out and I send it to him. Under\r\n\r\nthe  present regulations, there is imposed  on  the\r\n\r\nPost  Office  an  obligation  to  search  out   the\r\n\r\nremitter.  It is only when the remitter  cannot  be\r\n\r\nfound  that  the one-year period begins to  operate\r\n\r\n[Interruption]. Yes, if within one  year  from  the\r\n\r\ndate of issue no claim is made by such payee or the\r\n\r\nremitter.  If  the  remitter  can  be  found,   the\r\n\r\nobligation is to give it to the remitter, it cannot\r\n\r\ngo  into  the State coffers. So that the obligation\r\n\r\nat  the  moment now is on the State, where a  money\r\n\r\norder  is  not paid, to look in the first  instance\r\n\r\nfor  the  payee; and if the payee cannot be  found,\r\n\r\nthen  to  look  for the remitter. If he  cannot  be\r\n\r\nfound,  then it goes into the State coffers.  There\r\n\r\nis  a  switch now. The State is now saying,  \"I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to divest myself of this responsibility,  to\r\n\r\nlook either for the payee or the remitter.\" They do\r\n\r\nnot  want to take any responsibility in this matter\r\n\r\nat all. They also say that if, within one year from\r\n\r\nthe  date of such order, nothing is done, then  the\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General may in any case, where the claim\r\n\r\nis  made  after one year but not later  than  three\r\n\r\nyears from the date of issue, pay the amount to the\r\n\r\npayee  or  remitter.  If it is not  claimed  within\r\n\r\nthree years, under no circumstances will either the\r\n\r\npayee or the remitter get the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently had an amendment to the\r\n\r\nLimitations Ordinance which said this:  that  where\r\n\r\npreviously you could only pursue a debt  for  three\r\n\r\nyears, now you can pursue it for six years.  So  if\r\n\r\nI, a debtor, pay my creditor through a money order,\r\n\r\nafter  three years I lose my money, but my creditor\r\n\r\ncan still pursue me. That, I think, is not fair. It\r\n\r\nis  not right at all. Because after all, the  State\r\n\r\nhas agreed to act as my agent to convey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   money  to  my  creditor,  and  they  get   a\r\n\r\ncommission  for  this. It is not  a  free  service.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think, to put the matter  completely\r\n\r\nbeyond  objection, the period of  three  years,  it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me,  should be extended. Otherwise,  the\r\n\r\npresent obligation of the Government to search  out\r\n\r\neither   the  payee  or  the  remitter  should   be\r\n\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nbrought   out   one  very  interesting   point   in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the payment of rent.  Payment  of\r\n\r\nrent  is made by money orders. The Postmaster knows\r\n\r\nthe  remitter, the Postmaster can trace the  payee.\r\n\r\nBut  then  the Postmaster cannot force  either  the\r\n\r\nremitter  or the payee to go and claim  the  money.\r\n\r\nThat  is why in order to obviate that dilemma, this\r\n\r\namendment is being passed. I would rather  see,  if\r\n\r\nan amendment is necessary, that where you can trace\r\n\r\nthe remitter or the payee, a time limit be given to\r\n\r\nhim.  If he does not take it, then it is forfeited.\r\n\r\nWill  the Postmaster go and tell the remitter,  \"If\r\n\r\nyou  do  not take out this money, you are going  to\r\n\r\nlose  it\"?  That is not written into the amendment.\r\n\r\nIs  it  the intention that the Postmaster,  knowing\r\n\r\nwho  the  remitter or the payee  is,  will  give  a\r\n\r\nnotice,  saying,  \"You either come  and  take  your\r\n\r\nmoney within a year, or your money is forfeited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I do not think it is the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Postmaster-General to profit  out\r\n\r\nof  this amendment to the Post Office Ordinance. It\r\n\r\nis quite obviously a heavy burden on the \r\n\r\nPostmaster-General that he should have accumulated in his safe\r\n\r\na very large number of unclaimed money orders. I am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  that  the  Post Office  will,  through\r\n\r\nadministrative  action, seek to find  out  who  the\r\n\r\nremitter is and who the payee is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park about application of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis  the  Limitations  Ordinance,  I  have   been\r\n\r\ninformed by the Legal Department that by virtue  of\r\n\r\nsection 3 of the Limitations Ordinance, it is there\r\n\r\nprovided  that  where the period of  limitation  is\r\n\r\nprescribed by any other written law, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Limitations Ordinance  shall  not\r\n\r\napply  to  such  action. Therefore, the  period  of\r\n\r\nlimitation  prescribed by this  proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nwill  apply to the recovery of money payable  on  a\r\n\r\nmoney order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, I would like to add that it is\r\n\r\ndesirable  we should have uniform legislation  with\r\n\r\nregard to pan-Malaysian or pan-Malayan Departments.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that such legislation is\r\n\r\nalready  in force in the Federation of Malaya,  and\r\n\r\nafter  31st August when our Post Office  will  come\r\n\r\nunder the control of the Central Government, I have\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that the Post Office here will  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow similar legislation.

The provision of subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection  12  of the principal Ordinance  has  given\r\n\r\nrise  to  an accounting difficulty, insofar  as  it\r\n\r\nrequires that the repayment of loans received under\r\n\r\nthe  local Treasury Bills Ordinance to be made from\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated Revenue Account where  the  money\r\n\r\nreceived  as loans are credited to the Consolidated\r\n\r\nLoan  Account,  with the result  that  the  credits\r\n\r\nremain  uncleared in the Consolidated Loan Account.\r\n\r\nClause  3  of  the Bill amends section  12  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance so that such repayments can  be\r\n\r\ncharged to the Consolidated Loan Account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty encountered in the operation of\r\n\r\nthe  principal Ordinance stems from the requirement\r\n\r\nthat  the refunds of taxes over-collected have been\r\n\r\ntreated  as  expenditure by providing  votes  under\r\n\r\ndifferent  departmental Heads of Expenditure.

The reasons given by the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs that the 1962 registers were not able\r\n\r\nto   be  completed  in  time  was  because  of  the\r\n\r\nReferendum and the desire of the Government to  see\r\n\r\nthat  those who had not voted in the Referendum  to\r\n\r\nhave  their  names inserted in the 1962  registers.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, the Referendum was held on the\r\n\r\n1st  September, 1962. Under section 15,  subsection\r\n\r\n(1) , the obligation on the Registration Officer  is\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Registration Officer shall in each year\r\n\r\nfollowing the year 1958 complete a revision of  the\r\n\r\nregisters on or before the 15th day of September or\r\n\r\nsuch  later  date in that year as the Minister  may\r\n\r\nappoint  for the purpose by notification  published\r\n\r\nin the Gazette.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If the Government were sincere in its desire to see\r\n\r\nthat  those  who  had not voted in  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nshould  have their names registered, the  procedure\r\n\r\nshould  have  been such that the defaulting  voters\r\n\r\nwould be enabled to get their names on to the  1962\r\n\r\nregisters. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMinister could quite easily have extended the  date\r\n\r\nafter the 15th of September to some time before the\r\n\r\n31st  December for certification. As far as  I  can\r\n\r\nremember, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing was done  for\r\n\r\nthe  compilation of the 1962 registers until  after\r\n\r\nthe lapse of the year 1962 and sometime in February\r\n\r\n1963.  That  is the factual position.  Nothing  was\r\n\r\ndone.  Nothing  was done before December,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  had  plenty  of  time  from  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  to  the 31st December, 1962.  The  total\r\n\r\ntime  for the compilation of the electoral register\r\n\r\nrequired under the Ordinance, I think, is about two\r\n\r\nto    three   months.   Within   two   months   the\r\n\r\ncertification can take place, having regard to  the\r\n\r\ntime  limits  set  by the various sections  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. I  rather\r\n\r\nthink,  at  least the most charitable  construction\r\n\r\nthat one can put on this matter, is that either the\r\n\r\nMinister  forgot  about the 1962 registers  or  his\r\n\r\nofficials,  who  should have reminded  him  of  it,\r\n\r\nforgot to remind him of it. That is about the  most\r\n\r\ncharitable  construction that I  can  put  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter,   because  it  is  certainly  a  lapse.   A\r\n\r\nstatutory  obligation imposed on  the  Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer  has  not  been complied  with.  He  is  in\r\n\r\ndereliction  of  his duty and if  the  Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer does not give a satisfactory explanation to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, I think he should be up  for  severe\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister now seeks to rectify the position by this Bill, and he has told the House, in the most categorical terms,\r\n\r\nthat the registers will be ready\r\n\r\nbefore  the 30th June this year. That is, in  about\r\n\r\nfifteen  days'  time. But Mr Deputy  Speaker,  you\r\n\r\nwill  notice  that the provisions of the  Bill  are\r\n\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)\r\n\r\nof section 15 of the Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance the revision of the  registers\r\n\r\nof electors for the year 1962 shall be completed on\r\n\r\nor before the 30th day of June, 1963'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>As promised by the Minister in this House. But here\r\n\r\nagain,   in   case   either  he  forgets   or   his\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer forgets, he wants to be on the\r\n\r\nsafe  side, he puts in a clause \"or such later date\r\n\r\nin the year as the Minister may appoint for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose  by notification published in the Gazette.\"\r\n\r\nSo  what the Minister is now asking the House to do\r\n\r\nis  to  give him complete carte blanche so that  he\r\n\r\ncan  extend the date right up to the 31st December,\r\n\r\n1963, and yet be within the provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one difficulty\r\n\r\nwhich  I  wish  to  bring to the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge of this Bill and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law. Under this Ordinance, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the whole of the registration process must  be\r\n\r\ncompleted within the year of registration. What the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants  to do now, what  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nasking  the  House to do rather, is to  extend  the\r\n\r\ntime  to the 30th June in order to enable the  1962\r\n\r\nregisters to be completed. I understand that  steps\r\n\r\nhave already been taken by the Registration Officer\r\n\r\nsometime towards the end of February this  year  to\r\n\r\nstart the compilation of the 1962 registers. To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  all  those  steps\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has now taken are ultra vires, null  and\r\n\r\nvoid,  of  no legal effect, so that all the  claims\r\n\r\nand  objections which have been registered, all the\r\n\r\ntentative  registers which he has put up  (Lists  A\r\n\r\nand B) are illegal and have no effect. That is the\r\n\r\npresent  position. All that the Minister is  asking\r\n\r\nthe  House  to  do is to extend the  time  for  the\r\n\r\ncertification  of the registers. The  certification\r\n\r\nof  the  registers on the steps now  taken,  to  my\r\n\r\nmind, will be an illegality without the sanction of\r\n\r\nthe  law.  I do not see how, even if this  Assembly\r\n\r\npasses  the Bill in the form in which it is framed,\r\n\r\nany  certification resulting from the steps already\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the Registration Officer can make  these\r\n\r\nregisters  valid.  That is  my  view  which  I  put\r\n\r\nforward to this House. If the Minister carried this\r\n\r\nBill  through, it could well be that somebody could\r\n\r\ncontest  the  validity  of  these  registers,   and\r\n\r\nelections held on the 1962 registers might well  be\r\n\r\nnull and void and of no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister whether he has taken the\r\n\r\nadvice of the State Advocate-General on the present\r\n\r\nposition  on  this specific proposition - that  steps\r\n\r\nalready  having been taken to compile the registers\r\n\r\n(which  steps  are illegal at the moment)  and  the\r\n\r\nBill drafted in the way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it is without further provisions to cover  the\r\n\r\nillegal  steps  already taken by  the  Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer, whether this Bill would, in law, enable  a\r\n\r\nproper  valid  legal  register  for  1962   to   be\r\n\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise is this. The 1963\r\n\r\nregisters  must be compiled. I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer is doing anything about  that.\r\n\r\nIf  he  is,  in fact, going to bring out  the  1963\r\n\r\nregisters  before the 15th of September,  1963,  he\r\n\r\nshould  be taking steps now which, in fact, he  has\r\n\r\nnot  done. Is the Minister then going to extend the\r\n\r\ndate  for the 1963 Registers to beyond the 15th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember? If the Minister is going to keep to  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  date provided in section  15,  then  the\r\n\r\nfirst   steps  should  have  been  taken   by   the\r\n\r\nRegistration  Officer by now. But  they,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nhave not been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare  now  only  three matters which will  stop  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore from having a new  government\r\n\r\nand  which  will  restore the  confidence  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.

Now,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park has  said,  the  Election\r\n\r\nOfficer  would be busy not with the 1962 Registers,\r\n\r\nbut the 1963\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregisters.

Government to\r\n\r\nhave  a  snap election, giving us as short a notice\r\n\r\nas possible. For instance, in clause 3, what is the\r\n\r\nnecessity of this date \"30th day of June, 1963\"? We\r\n\r\nare  told that the register \"shall be completed  on\r\n\r\nor  before  the 30th day of June, 1963\",  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, another two weeks. It is a \"shall\" assurance\r\n\r\ngiven by the Government in this amending Bill,  but\r\n\r\nthere is an a1ternative \"or\". The \"or\" is \"or  such\r\n\r\nlater  date in the year as the Minister may appoint\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose by notification published  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette\". In other words, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government is still not sure;  when  it\r\n\r\nchanges  its  mind it can defer the 1962  Registers\r\n\r\nto,  as  the Member for Farrer Park has  said,  the\r\n\r\n31st  of  December, 1962, at 12 midnight.

We are prepared to accept\r\n\r\nthe arguments advanced by the Government if it does\r\n\r\nnot   mean   losing  confidence  in   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important Bill, as it means\r\n\r\nupholding  a  democratic government.  Let  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   exploit  its  tenure  of   office   by\r\n\r\nindulging  in  unhealthy  practices.  As  has  been\r\n\r\npointed out by the Member for Farrer Park, the year\r\n\r\n1962  has  passed and we are now in the  middle  of\r\n\r\n1963,  and we are still faced with problems. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of 1hz Government to have the  registers\r\n\r\nprepared,  or to take steps for the preparation  of\r\n\r\nthe electoral registers for 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver  six  months have passed and many events  have\r\n\r\ntaken  place  and constituents have  changed  their\r\n\r\nplaces  of abode - and in the year 1964 we  shall  be\r\n\r\nfaced  with  another  general  election  under  our\r\n\r\nConstitution.  If  the  preparation  of  the   1963\r\n\r\nregisters is linked up with the 1964 registers, and\r\n\r\nif the 1963 electoral registers are not ready, then\r\n\r\nit may be that when elections are due, a motion may\r\n\r\nbe   moved  for  the  purpose  of  using  the  1962\r\n\r\nelectoral  registers. Therefore, it is proper  that\r\n\r\nthis question of registers of electors, as has been\r\n\r\nsaid  by  the Member for Tanglin, be put under  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of an independent commission. I  think\r\n\r\nit is a good move, so that there will be no grounds\r\n\r\nfor  suspicion. For instance, in the past we  heard\r\n\r\nallegations  that  certain  political  Parties  had\r\n\r\ncaused  some  voters  to be  transferred  from  one\r\n\r\nconstituency  to  another. It was  done  with  such\r\n\r\nsecrecy  that it was impossible for this allegation\r\n\r\nto be proved. But the time has now come for matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to elections to be put under the  control\r\n\r\nof  an independent commission, as has been done  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation   of  Malaya.   This   independent\r\n\r\ncommission  will he free from control, pressure  or\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  the  Government. I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge to declare his stand and further\r\n\r\nclarify the points raised by Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nis  another  case of Government trying to  rig  the\r\n\r\nelections.

Then\r\n\r\nthose who did not vote in the General Elections  in\r\n\r\n1959  and  have not as yet got their names restored\r\n\r\nto the registers, and those who had come of age and\r\n\r\nhaving  reached  21  years  of  age,  were  already\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member take some time\r\n\r\non this subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A little while more. These\r\n\r\npeople  had applied for their names to be  inserted\r\n\r\nin the electoral registers, but their names had not\r\n\r\nbeen  inserted in the electoral registers.  If  you\r\n\r\nwill remember, Sir, the Referendum was held on  the\r\n\r\n1st  of September, whereas by the 15th of September\r\n\r\nif  only  the Government had extended the date  for\r\n\r\nanother  two weeks, those who had come of  age  and\r\n\r\nwould have been certified by the 15th of September,\r\n\r\n1962  would have become voters. I list all this  to\r\n\r\ntell  you  that  the total number who  should  have\r\n\r\nvoted in the referendum but had not been given  the\r\n\r\nvote,  exceeded many tens of thousands. Every  year\r\n\r\nabout  60,000 babies are born. Let us  go  back  20\r\n\r\nyears and assume that the figure is just half that,\r\n\r\n30,000  say.  Therefore, in 1962  at  least  30,000\r\n\r\nnames  would  have been added to the  registers  if\r\n\r\nonly  the Government had allowed those names to  be\r\n\r\ninserted in the 1962 electoral registers. Added  to\r\n\r\nthat,  you  have 1,000 voters in Hong Lim,  another\r\n\r\n1,000 voters in Anson, plus more than 20,000 voters\r\n\r\nwho did not vote in 1959. The total number that did\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  chance  to  vote  in  the  referendum\r\n\r\ntherefore  exceeded  60,000.  It  might   even   be\r\n\r\n100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Referendum on the 1st of September, according\r\n\r\nto   the  P.A.P.,  was  favourable  to  them   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they think that if they wanted  to  hold\r\n\r\nan  election in future, they would prefer  to  have\r\n\r\nthe election based on those same registers. But now\r\n\r\nthey  are forced to include the 1962 lot of  people\r\n\r\nwho have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  of  age,  that  is age 21, and  automatically\r\n\r\nbecoming voters by the 15th of February. 1962,  and\r\n\r\nwho  should  have been certified by 15th September,\r\n\r\n1962,  as  electoral voters. The figure  is  fairly\r\n\r\nhigh.  These  citizens are young  men.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntoday  is very afraid of young men because all  the\r\n\r\nyoung  people  of Singapore, especially  those  who\r\n\r\ncome  from  Chinese schools, are very much  against\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Therefore, if a new batch of  would  be\r\n\r\nvoters of 1963 could be excluded from the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters,  then,  of  course,  it  would  be  more\r\n\r\nadvantageous to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the very reason why we are asked to allow\r\n\r\nthe Government to fix a date as and when the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nlikes   for  the  certification  of  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters. They want to exclude the 1963 lot of new\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  voters  who constitute  a  very  big\r\n\r\nnumber. This number together with the new voters of\r\n\r\n1962  can  easily knock the P.A.P. out. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould prefer not to give this large number of young\r\n\r\nmen  their  opportunity to vote in the  forthcoming\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not trust the P.A.P. at all. They\r\n\r\nrigged the referendum and they hope to rig a future\r\n\r\nelection. That is why they have refused to agree to\r\n\r\nthe proposals from the Opposition - that there should\r\n\r\nbe   a   neutral  commission  to  look  after   the\r\n\r\nelections. We oppose this new rigging of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting until 5.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>5.05 p.m. until 5.35 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.35 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I\r\n\r\nstressed  the  need  for  an independent  Elections\r\n\r\nCommission for Singapore. Today, Sir, this Bill has\r\n\r\nconfirmed  that need. If we had had an  independent\r\n\r\nElections  Commission, the electoral registers  for\r\n\r\n1961 would have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nbeen  ready in time, because nobody would have told\r\n\r\nthem  that  they must slow down for  this  or  that\r\n\r\nevent.  And if they had seen the need for a slowing\r\n\r\ndown, they would have approached the Government  to\r\n\r\nhave  some  Bill  here so that  it  could  be  done\r\n\r\nlegally.  Sir, all of a sudden the Party  in  power\r\n\r\ndecides  that it wants to speed up the  thing.  And\r\n\r\nthey  have  put  forward a  Bill  to  legalise  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  the  Registers of  Electors  on  or\r\n\r\nbefore  the  30th day of June. Not only that,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  give to themselves even wider powers. If they\r\n\r\nsee  fit,  they can extend the date to the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, or such later date in the year  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  may appoint. They are asking  really  for\r\n\r\nvery   wide   powers.   An  independent   Elections\r\n\r\nCommission would make sure that the conditions  for\r\n\r\nan   election   should  be  fair  to  all   parties\r\n\r\nconcerned. But here, I am sorry to say,  the  Party\r\n\r\nin  power  want to make sure that they win  and  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure also that they win with handicaps  given\r\n\r\nto themselves. Sir, what is the significance of the\r\n\r\n\"30th  day  of  June\"? We used to  think  that  the\r\n\r\nformer  Mayor of Singapore, the present Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim, was exaggerating when he said that he had\r\n\r\na  great deal to do with the training of men of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. top cadre. Now, Sir, we must give him credit\r\n\r\nfor  having  been  able  to see  that  the  Federal\r\n\r\nelections, instead of, as had been expected before,\r\n\r\nbeing  held after 31st August, 1963, may be  rushed\r\n\r\nthrough very much earlier, after this magic date of\r\n\r\n30th  June, 1963. This, of course, is to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  all the other Parties are caught by surprise.\r\n\r\nWhy  the  long postponement of the by-election  for\r\n\r\nSembawang? Now why the sudden rush?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we say, Sir, the Party in power are so\r\n\r\nkeen  on  their  winning a victory  that  at  times\r\n\r\nnational interests become secondary. I am  sure  if\r\n\r\nthey  say  they  have no intention of  playing  any\r\n\r\ntrickery,  why  cannot they say they  agree  to  an\r\n\r\nindependent   officer  being  the   Supervisor   of\r\n\r\nElections  so  that there can be no suspicion  that\r\n\r\nthey are going to indulge in anything that would be\r\n\r\nimproper?   Sir,  we  feel  that   this   Bill   is\r\n\r\nunnecessary,  that the registers for  1963  can  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  according  to the present  Ordinance  by\r\n\r\n15th September, 1963, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  this  Bill is not necessary, then why  push  it\r\n\r\nthrough at this time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the P.A.P. Government have been boasting that\r\n\r\nthey  are the champions of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\nBut  the  amendment moved by the Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  has disclosed their face, and has  exposed\r\n\r\nthem  as trying to destroy parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment, although it consists of three short\r\n\r\nclauses,    nevertheless   has   greatly   affected\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy,  and  its  content.   The\r\n\r\nexplanation of the Minister for Home Affairs cannot\r\n\r\ncover  up  their intention of trying to play  party\r\n\r\npolitics  and  cannot cover up their wrong  doings.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  Elections Ordinance,  the  1962\r\n\r\nRegisters of Electors should have been completed by\r\n\r\nthe 15th September. But the Government has wasted a\r\n\r\nlot  of  time  without being able to  complete  the\r\n\r\nrevision and printing of the Registers of Electors.\r\n\r\nDoes  this mean that the vote in the 1961 Estimates\r\n\r\nfor the revision has been reduced, or is it because\r\n\r\nthe  staff of that Department has been reduced,  so\r\n\r\nthat  this job has not been completed? In the  1961\r\n\r\nas  well  as the 1962 Budgets, we can see that  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the Elections Office for each  year\r\n\r\nis  the  same. How is it that this Office  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen able to complete its work of revising the 1962\r\n\r\nRegisters of Electors? The Minister a little  while\r\n\r\nago  has  said  that it is because of the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum. On this Referendum the Government spent\r\n\r\nabout  $400,000. Therefore, this cannot be  a  good\r\n\r\nreason  for  not having been able to  complete  the\r\n\r\nrevision  of the Registers. From the facts  we  can\r\n\r\nsee clearly that the inability to complete the work\r\n\r\nis  not  due  to the inefficiency of the  Elections\r\n\r\nOffice  but  to  the  fact that  the  whole  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  intend to delay this work in  order  to\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of it to benefit themselves in  the\r\n\r\nfuture elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the beginning of 1963 I visited the Elections Commissioner on three occasions regarding\r\n\r\nthe revision of registers of voters.  He\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  the work was about to complete  and\r\n\r\nthat on completion the Government would notify  the\r\n\r\npublic. At that time, I told him that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording   to   the  Elections   Ordinance   every\r\n\r\npolitical  Party has a right to receive  a  set  of\r\n\r\ncopies  of  the  Registers of  Voters  for  the  51\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  On 18th March, on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, I wrote a letter to the Elections\r\n\r\nCommissioner requesting him to send us quickly  the\r\n\r\nwhole  set  of the 1962 registers of voters.  After\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks, I received a very short reply from  him\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the present registers  had  not  been\r\n\r\ncompleted  and that on completion of this  work  he\r\n\r\nwould be sending to the Barisan Sosialis a complete\r\n\r\nset   of  the  registers  of  voters  for  the   51\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are very concerned about the\r\n\r\nprinting  of  the registers of voters, because  the\r\n\r\nexistence of parliamentary democracy depends on the\r\n\r\nregisters   of  voters.  It  is  the  backbone   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy.  Without  them,   it   is\r\n\r\nimpossible  to elect the 51 Members of this  House.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  it  will mean  the  collapse  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. Let us see what the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  doing today. The Minister for Home Affairs  has\r\n\r\nnow  come  to this House to legalise their  illegal\r\n\r\nact.  The  intention  of  the  Government  is  very\r\n\r\nobvious. The Government is trying to exclude  those\r\n\r\nwho should be included in the Registers by the 15th\r\n\r\nof   February,  1963.  By  this  amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we can see clearly that for  the  1964\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections the registers will not be  based\r\n\r\non  the  1963  registers but on the  registers  for\r\n\r\n1962.  What  is  the difference? The difference  is\r\n\r\nthis:  in  1963, there will be at least 40,000  new\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore who will have the  right  to\r\n\r\nvote  in  1964 and to be included in the  registers\r\n\r\nfor 1964, but after this amending Bill is passed by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, these 40 000 odd citizens will  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  their  voting  rights.  Why  is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment afraid of an increase in the  number  of\r\n\r\nvoters?  If  the  Government is really  sincere  in\r\n\r\nprotecting parliamentary democracy, it should allow\r\n\r\nmore  citizens to exercise their rights and  duties\r\n\r\nto  cast  their  votes. But the Government  is  now\r\n\r\nintentionally depriving them of their legal rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these citizens of 1963 who should have the right to vote were born in 1941 or 1942. These are\r\n\r\nyoung  men who have just  left  school.\r\n\r\nAccording  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Labour Department Annual  Report  and\r\n\r\naccording to the census of population. We  can  see\r\n\r\nclearly  that the youths who have left  school  are\r\n\r\nall   unemployed.  In  1959  during   the   general\r\n\r\nelections,  these youths pinned high hopes  on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  solve their unemployment  problem.  But\r\n\r\nfrom  this amending bill of the Government, we  can\r\n\r\nsee  that,  in  fact, the Government is  unable  to\r\n\r\nsolve their unemployment problem. That is why these\r\n\r\npeople are not contented with the P.A.P. I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  1964 general elections these  people\r\n\r\nwill not vote for the P.A.P. Therefore, in order to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  strength  of forces  against  it, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now seeking to pass  this  amending\r\n\r\nBill  in  order  to deprive these people  of  their\r\n\r\nvoting  rights. This is the first reason to explain\r\n\r\nwhy  the Government is now trying to introduce this\r\n\r\namending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's past actions\r\n\r\nare  causing  the people much anxiety, worry,  and\r\n\r\ndoubt.  If the Government wants this House to  pass\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  then, undoubtedly, it will be  telling\r\n\r\nthe   people   that  the  system  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is, in fact, intended for  the  interest\r\n\r\nand  purpose of the Party in power and not for  the\r\n\r\ninterest and welfare of the people. This will  only\r\n\r\ngive  the  impression to the  people  that  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  general  elections the Government  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  transfer a group of pro-P.A.P. people  to\r\n\r\ncertain  constituencies in order to  elect  certain\r\n\r\nMembers.   That   is  obviously  the   Government's\r\n\r\nintention.   If  the  Government's   intention   to\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  Bill is not  based  on  these  two\r\n\r\nmotives,   then  I  believe  it  would   not   have\r\n\r\nintroduced this Bill into this House today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the staff in the Elections Office\r\n\r\nare  very  efficient.  But the  Government  is  now\r\n\r\ntrying  to  put  the blame on them for  not  having\r\n\r\ncompleted the registers earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wants to push through this Bill\r\n\r\non  the strength of its majority, it will only show\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore that  it  is  destroying\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are\r\n\r\nagainst this Bill, and my colleagues have explained\r\n\r\nthe reasons why we are against it. They are not  on\r\n\r\npolitical grounds but on legal grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister, in moving the Bill, drew\r\n\r\nattention  to  section 15 (1)  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  Elections Ordinance. He did say that  the\r\n\r\ndate  of the revision could be extended beyond 15th\r\n\r\nSeptember if the Minister so appoints. But  he  was\r\n\r\nrather  quiet, deliberately so; he did not tell  us\r\n\r\nwhy  he did not so appoint when he considered  that\r\n\r\nthe revision of the electoral registers by the 15th\r\n\r\nSeptember  was  not  suitable or  was  not  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the electorate. Perhaps he  overlooked\r\n\r\nit, or perhaps his officers in the Elections Office\r\n\r\noverlooked  it.  We do not like to be  uncharitable\r\n\r\nand say that perhaps this is a deliberate political\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre,  but  the Government, of course,  cannot\r\n\r\navoid criticism even on that ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister says that it was because of the\r\n\r\nReferendum  on 1st September and of the  desire  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  not to confuse the electorate  and\r\n\r\nbecause  those  electors who did not  vote  at  the\r\n\r\nreferendum could have their names deleted, that the\r\n\r\nrevision did not take place in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  If  it  had been his intention not  to  bring\r\n\r\nconfusion into the minds of the electorate in  that\r\n\r\nthe  electors  who did not vote at  the  referendum\r\n\r\ncould  have their names deleted from the  revision,\r\n\r\nsurely  he could have appointed a date in 1962  for\r\n\r\nthe  revision.  The Referendum took  place  on  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember.  He  could  have chosen  31st  December,\r\n\r\n1962,  as  the  date so appointed by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nunder the law. He was silent, and no doubt he  will\r\n\r\nexplain now why he was silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is this opposition on political grounds\r\n\r\nbecause  of the by-election that should have  taken\r\n\r\nplace  in  Sembawang.  The  late  Inche  Ahmad  bin\r\n\r\nIbrahim   died  in  August  1962,  and  while   the\r\n\r\nreferendum meetings were going on, this by-election\r\n\r\nwas  also  the topic of the day. So when the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was questioned as to when the by-election\r\n\r\nin Sembawang would be held, he said,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh,   after   the   revision  of   the   electoral\r\n\r\nregisters.\" Even that answer was given .a few  days\r\n\r\nback  to  a question by the Member for Anson:  When\r\n\r\nwould  the  Government  hold  the  by-election   in\r\n\r\nSembawang? \"Oh, after the revision of the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters.\" When they knew that there could not  be\r\n\r\nany  legal  revision until this  amending  Bill  is\r\n\r\napproved by the Assembly, surely the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncould  have said - and if there had been no intention\r\n\r\nto  play a political game in this thing, \"Sorry, it\r\n\r\ncould have been held as early as March, but because\r\n\r\nthe  revision  of  the electoral registers  is  all\r\n\r\nwrong  in accordance with the law, we cannot do  it\r\n\r\nand that is why we have tabled an amending Bill. We\r\n\r\nwill  have the thing adjusted, and as soon as  that\r\n\r\nis  adjusted, we can hold a by-election.\" But  now,\r\n\r\nboldly   he  said,  \"Until  the  revision  of   the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers\" when he knew that the revision\r\n\r\nof the electoral registers could not be legal until\r\n\r\nthis amending Bill is passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even making the referendum as an excuse for\r\n\r\nthe delay in the revision of the 1962 registers  is\r\n\r\nrather  weak.  If  the  Elections  Office  or   the\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer had taken due note of the  law\r\n\r\nand had properly discharged his duty, he would have\r\n\r\nset in operation as early as June 1962 the revision\r\n\r\nof the 1962 registers in order to get them ready by\r\n\r\nthe 15th of September. At that time, no doubt there\r\n\r\nwas  a  lot  of  hot exchanges of  harsh  words  on\r\n\r\nmerger,  but because the Elections Office was  tied\r\n\r\nto  ministerial control, that is why the  Elections\r\n\r\nOffice  too got confused. That is why I would  like\r\n\r\nto  bring  up  again the fact that it is  desirable\r\n\r\nthat an independent Elections Commission should  be\r\n\r\nset  up. I do not urge this on the ground that what\r\n\r\nhad  been  done before was wrong and that elections\r\n\r\nhad  been  rigged  and all sorts  of  other  unfair\r\n\r\ncriticism.  Elections have been done  in  the  best\r\n\r\nmanner.  No possibility of rigging, everything  was\r\n\r\nclean  and  honest. But the fact that the Elections\r\n\r\nOfficer  or  the Office comes under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe Executive Government makes people wonder as  to\r\n\r\nthe   honesty   of   that  particular   department.\r\n\r\nTherefore. I would urge upon the Government to give\r\n\r\nserious consideration to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsetting up an independent Elections Commission.  If\r\n\r\nthis  Elections  Office  had  been  an  independent\r\n\r\ncommission, it would have done its duty soberly and\r\n\r\nwithout taking into its calculation the exchange of\r\n\r\npolitical  warfare. It would have just  carried  on\r\n\r\nits  work - June, all right. They would have  started\r\n\r\nthe   thing  going  without  worrying  whether  the\r\n\r\nBarisan had been trying to shoot down the P.A.P. or\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. wanted another three months  to  shoot\r\n\r\ndown  the  Barisan. All that would not  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very important point brought up by my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member for Farrer Park,  is  this.\r\n\r\nUnder  the law, the 1963 revision will have  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  by  the  15th of September,  or  at  the\r\n\r\nlatest by the 31st of December, if the Minister  so\r\n\r\nappoints.  But  if  it  is  the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nElections  Office - I  do not say  the  Government - to\r\n\r\nhave  the  1963 revision completed by the  15th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember,  that Office would have  to  begin  work\r\n\r\nright  now. And if it has to begin work right  now,\r\n\r\nwhat is the value of legalising this 1962 revision?\r\n\r\nIt will be just a waste of time, a waste of effort,\r\n\r\nand will cause a lot of heartburn. Forget this one.\r\n\r\nLeave it. In fact, if the criticism is levelled  at\r\n\r\nthe  Government that in this way they need not have\r\n\r\nto  hold  the by-election in Sembawang, they  could\r\n\r\nhold  it on the 1961 electoral registers. If  there\r\n\r\nhad been no revision in 1962, all right, let us use\r\n\r\nthe  1961  registers. If there had been accusations\r\n\r\nlevelled that the Government is doing this now,  in\r\n\r\norder  to say, \"Well, we want to have the Sembawang\r\n\r\nby-election quickly; therefore, we must have it  by\r\n\r\nthe 30th June,\" go ahead, we can have a by-election\r\n\r\nin  July.  \"Without this, there  could  be  no\r\n\r\nby-election.\"  I say they still can. You can  use  the\r\n\r\n1961  electoral registers. Let us not  waste  time.\r\n\r\nLet us not waste money. Let the Elections Office go\r\n\r\nahead  with  the  1963  revision  because  of   the\r\n\r\nimminent general elections in 1964. There should be\r\n\r\nno  further delay in the 1963 revision.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow.  I  hope  the  Government will  give  serious\r\n\r\nthought to this very important issue. Do not  press\r\n\r\non with something that might turn out to be a legal\r\n\r\nproblem, as pointed out by the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFarrer Park. Let us say we have the by-election  in\r\n\r\nSembawang  based on these 1962 electoral registers.\r\n\r\nWhat is to prevent any candidate who lost in the\r\n\r\nby-election to file a petition on the ground that  the\r\n\r\n1962  electoral registers are illegal  and  not  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the law? I would  urge  upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reconsider its stand on this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a\r\n\r\ntemporary  provisions Bill seeking  the  Assembly's\r\n\r\napproval to extend the time for the revision of the\r\n\r\nregisters  of  electors  which  should  have   been\r\n\r\ncompleted in 1962. This Bill was drafted and vetted\r\n\r\nby  the State Advocate-General, and so far as I can\r\n\r\nsee,  the legal aspect of it would have been  taken\r\n\r\ncare of by the State Advocate-General's Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 1962 registers could have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed in 1962 but for the two  reasons  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier when I moved the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill.  Firstly, it is to avoid  confusion.\r\n\r\nBecause  it is not possible for the 1962  registers\r\n\r\nto  be  completed  and certified in  time  for  the\r\n\r\nnational referendum, and so the 1961 registers will\r\n\r\nhave to be used. If we were to exhibit Lists A  and\r\n\r\nB for public inspection round about the time of the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  it  would give rise  to  confusion  on\r\n\r\npolling  day, because many of the persons  eligible\r\n\r\nto  become voters in 1962 would feel that they were\r\n\r\nentitled  to vote during the referendum,  and  they\r\n\r\nwould  go  to the polling stations, and that  would\r\n\r\ncreate a lot of difficulties for the polling staff.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in order not to confuse the people,  we\r\n\r\ndecided that the inspection of these Lists A and  B\r\n\r\nshould be held after the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that we want to give those\r\n\r\nwho did not vote in the Referendum a chance to have\r\n\r\ntheir  names restored in the 1962 registers. If  we\r\n\r\nproceeded with the certification of the 1962\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregisters  after  the Referendum, then  those  \r\n\r\nnon-voters would not have a chance to have their  names\r\n\r\nrestored   in  the  registers,  because  the   next\r\n\r\nrevision  would  be in 1963. It is  for  these  two\r\n\r\nreasons that we decided that the best thing was  to\r\n\r\ndefer  the  revision of the registers  until  early\r\n\r\n1963  when the list of non-voters could be compiled\r\n\r\nand  exhibited  for public inspection,  allowing  a\r\n\r\nreasonable period for the non-voters to  apply  for\r\n\r\nrestoration  of  their names in the registers.  The\r\n\r\nlists of non-voters were completed only towards the\r\n\r\nend  of January. So it was exhibited for inspection\r\n\r\ntogether with List A and List B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in the Amendment Bill that the\r\n\r\nregisters  of electors for the year 1962  shall  be\r\n\r\ncompleted on or before the 30th day of June or such\r\n\r\nlater   date  in  the  year.  But  I  have  already\r\n\r\nindicated  to  the  House just now  that  the  1962\r\n\r\nelectoral  registers will be certified before  30th\r\n\r\nJune,  and  I  can  give  an  undertaking  to   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  that the 1962 registers, in fact,  will\r\n\r\nbe certified before June 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> June 1962?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I am sorry. June 1963. Just now\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill said, why waste  all  the\r\n\r\ntime  and  effort  on the 1962  registers  when  we\r\n\r\nshould  proceed  with 1963? 1 wish  to  inform  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill that  time  and  effort  has\r\n\r\nalready been wasted. They are all ready and waiting\r\n\r\nfor this Bill to be approved before certification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the revision of the 1963 electoral\r\n\r\nregisters, I wish to inform the House that work has\r\n\r\nalready  been set in motion. In fact,  revision  of\r\n\r\nthe  1963  registers  is  being  carried  out  now,\r\n\r\nbecause  normally  revision  of  registers  in  any\r\n\r\nparticular year would have to take place from about\r\n\r\nthe month of March onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with Malaysia, except for the\r\n\r\nfirst  election  to the Central Parliament,  future\r\n\r\nelections to the Central Parliament will come under\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Elections Commission. As far as  State\r\n\r\nelection is concerned, it is provided in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  that  it will be a State Government  matter.\r\n\r\nWith our existing machinery of elections and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanner in which elections are carried out, there is\r\n\r\nno possibility of any rigging of elections. So I do\r\n\r\nnot see that it is necessary to have an independent\r\n\r\ncommission for elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown mentioned that\r\n\r\nmany  of the non-voters in the 1959 elections,  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election and the Referendum - many of the\r\n\r\nnon-voters  in these elections - have not  had  their\r\n\r\nnames  restored in the registers. Now, if the  \r\n\r\nnon-voters refused to take any step to have their names\r\n\r\nrestored in the electoral registers, what could the\r\n\r\nGovernment  do? It is their right, and they  should\r\n\r\ntake  some  interest in looking after their  rights\r\n\r\nand their own interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang just now argued that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  withdraw  this  Bill   as\r\n\r\notherwise   the  Government  would  be  guilty   of\r\n\r\ndestroying  democracy. I just fail to see  how  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  this Bill would destroy  democracy.\r\n\r\nDoes  it  mean that by excluding those  voters  who\r\n\r\nwould  be  eligible to have their names entered  in\r\n\r\nthe  1962 registers democracy will be preserved  or\r\n\r\nstrengthened?  If the Government were  to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  it  would  mean  that  those  who  are\r\n\r\neligible  to have their names entered in  the  1962\r\n\r\nelectoral  registers  would be  deprived  of  their\r\n\r\nright as voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has said that he has no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  elections  conducted  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  that he believes  that  elections\r\n\r\nwere  rigged.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Queenstown and his colleagues\r\n\r\ndo  not believe in elections. If they had a chance,\r\n\r\nshould they be in a position to capture power,  not\r\n\r\nonly  would there be no elections, but there  would\r\n\r\nbe  no  parliamentary democracy. In place of  that,\r\n\r\nwhat we would have is dictatorship of the minority.\r\n\r\nNaturally  we  have  no doubt  that  they  have  no\r\n\r\nconfidence in any election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes 23; Noes, 20; Paired, 2;\r\n\r\nAbsent, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n        Ayes.

The   police\r\n\r\nofficer may also examine orally any person supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  acquainted with the facts and circumstances\r\n\r\nof the case under investigation and shall reduce in\r\n\r\nwriting  any  statement  made  by  the  person   so\r\n\r\nexamined; and such person shall be bound  to  state\r\n\r\ntruly the facts and circumstances of the case  with\r\n\r\nwhich  he was acquainted concerning the case,  save\r\n\r\nonly  that  he may decline to make, with regard  to\r\n\r\nany  fact or circumstance, a statement which has  a\r\n\r\ntendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a\r\n\r\npenalty or forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, owing to the lack of sufficient\r\n\r\nexperienced  civilian senior special  investigators\r\n\r\nor   special  investigators,  a  number  of  police\r\n\r\nofficers   have  been  seconded  to   the   Corrupt\r\n\r\nPractices  investigation Bureau as  senior  special\r\n\r\ninvestigators or special investigators, and in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of their duties with the Bureau, they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to conduct investigations by making  use\r\n\r\nof  the  powers under sections 119 and 120  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure  Code  which  they  possess  as\r\n\r\npolice officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondment of police officers to the Corrupt\r\n\r\nPractices   Investigation   Bureau,   however,   is\r\n\r\nintended  to  be  a  temporary measure,  since  the\r\n\r\nintention  is  that eventually the Bureau  will  be\r\n\r\nstaffed  entirely by civilian officers. There  are,\r\n\r\nat  the  moment, ten civilian special investigators\r\n\r\nemployed in the Bureau. These special investigators\r\n\r\nundergo   the   same  training  as   cadet   police\r\n\r\ninspectors  and  are  required  to  pass  the  same\r\n\r\nprescribed  examinations, but because of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they are not police officers, they do not have\r\n\r\nthe   powers  of  their  police  colleagues   under\r\n\r\nsections 119 and 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code\r\n\r\nwhen  carrying  out investigation work.

This  section\r\n\r\nprovides that whenever it appears to any magistrate\r\n\r\nor to the Director of C.P.I.B. upon information and\r\n\r\nafter  such  inquiry as he thinks  necessary,  that\r\n\r\nthere  is reasonable cause to believe that  in  any\r\n\r\nplace there is any document containing evidence  of\r\n\r\nthe   commission   of   an  offence   relating   to\r\n\r\ncorruption,  the  magistrate or  the  Director  may\r\n\r\nempower a police officer or an investigator of  the\r\n\r\nBureau  to enter such place by force, if necessary,\r\n\r\nand  there to search for, seize and detain any such\r\n\r\ndocument. It has been found by experience that, for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of investigations by the Bureau, it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  this provision to  be  extended  to\r\n\r\ncover also any article or property involved in  the\r\n\r\ncommission  of  an offence relating to  corruption,\r\n\r\nunder either the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance\r\n\r\nor  sections 161 to 165 or sections 213 to  215  of\r\n\r\nthe  Penal Code, and the Bill accordingly  includes\r\n\r\nan amendment to this effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PORT OF SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now  read\r\n\r\na Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the recommendation of His Excellency the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara to proceed with this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, the Commission of Inquiry into the Port\r\n\r\nof   Singapore,  whose  report  was  presented   in\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. S 10 of 1957, made a number  of\r\n\r\nrecommendations  among which  were  that  a  single\r\n\r\nauthority  should be set up to be  responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole port area. Members are aware that at the\r\n\r\nmoment  the administration of Singapore harbour  is\r\n\r\ndivided between the Singapore Harbour Board and the\r\n\r\nMaster Attendant. It is recommended in this Report,\r\n\r\nnow  better known as the Millbourn Report, that the\r\n\r\nPort  Authority  should take  over  the  functions,\r\n\r\nstaff and premises of the present Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard together with certain functions performed  by\r\n\r\nthe   Marine  Department  and  the  P.W.D.   Marine\r\n\r\nSection.  The Commission also recommended  hat  the\r\n\r\ndocks  and ship repair organisation of the  present\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board should be  separated  from\r\n\r\nthe   new  Authority  and  become  a  wholly  owned\r\n\r\nsubsidiary of the Port Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations have been considered\r\n\r\ncarefully and it is now proposed that some  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations be adopted for the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe Port Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the Authority will be to provide and\r\n\r\nmaintain   adequate  and  efficient   services   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and to promote the use, improvement  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  port.  The  officers  of  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  will  be responsible for the  regulation\r\n\r\nand  control of navigation within the limits of the\r\n\r\nport and the provision of pilotage services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as is practicable, the Authority will be\r\n\r\nrequired  to form a private limited company  to  be\r\n\r\nknown  as  the \"Singapore Drydocks and  Engineering\r\n\r\nCompany, Limited\", the shares of which will be held\r\n\r\nby  the Authority and the company will take over as\r\n\r\na going concern all the dockyard undertakings which\r\n\r\nI   have  earlier  referred  to.

The majority of the recommendations  in\r\n\r\nthat  Report, particularly those pertaining to  the\r\n\r\nlabour  situation in the Harbour  Board,  were  not\r\n\r\nacceptable  by  the trade unions in  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and subsequently, in 1960, a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry into the system of contract labour  was\r\n\r\nappointed  under the chairmanship  of  Dr  Charles\r\n\r\nGamba.  That  Report  also  made  specific  remarks\r\n\r\nregarding the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard  and  also  the  formation  of  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formation of the Port of Singapore Authority\r\n\r\nwill  be  a great advantage in improving  the  port\r\n\r\nfacilities and also in making improvements  of  the\r\n\r\nport's  workings. It also includes the roads  which\r\n\r\nare  not under the present Singapore Harbour Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore rivers are also included. That is  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  start. We will support it. But  certain\r\n\r\npoints - I believe this Bill will be going to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee - will  have  to he looked  into.  In  this\r\n\r\nBill,  Government employees can be seconded to  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  or  the  Port  Authority.  In  that\r\n\r\nparticular clause, it does not define clearly  what\r\n\r\ntype  of  employees are going to be transferred  or\r\n\r\nseconded  to  the service of the Port of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority.  If  they are technical staff  or  staff\r\n\r\nwhich  cannot get in the present Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,  it is worthwhile. But if the Port Authority\r\n\r\nconsiders   that   certain   employees   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment service are to be seconded to  the  Port\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  Authority, then what may  happen  is\r\n\r\nthis.  These  employees so seconded may  be  placed\r\n\r\nabove  the existing employees of the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nand  they  may  be  deprived of  their  chances  of\r\n\r\npromotion  or  going up. If the Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority is going to be a statutory body,  and  if\r\n\r\nGovernment employees can be seconded into the  Port\r\n\r\nof  Singapore Authority, what we may want is  this.\r\n\r\nWe should try to bring the Harbour Board employees'\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service  and  pay  in   line   with\r\n\r\nGovernment employees, and then it will  be  in  the\r\n\r\ndepartmental  way of transfer and  secondment.  The\r\n\r\nSelect Committee can look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part I want to mention here is in so\r\n\r\nfar   as   the  present  Harbour  Board   is   only\r\n\r\nresponsible for the areas controlled by the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,   and  the  \"Port  of  Singapore  Authority\"\r\n\r\nextends  its  function  into  the  Roads.  On  that\r\n\r\nparticular aspect, we have made recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote, Mr Speaker, Sir, from Paper Cmd. 6\r\n\r\nof  1960 - Report of the Commission of  Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nthe System of Contract Labour in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As we all know, there are malpractices,\r\n\r\nvictimisation, abuse and also irregularities in the\r\n\r\nemployment of labour in the Roads. Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nit.  With  a view to clearing that, this Commission\r\n\r\nwas   appointed  and  submissions  were  made  with\r\n\r\nspecific  references to that effect.  In  page  68,\r\n\r\nparagraph  7  (b)  Drafting  Committee:   \"if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  accepts  the  recommendations  of  this\r\n\r\nCommission,   it  should  immediately   appoint   a\r\n\r\nDrafting  Committee  of  its  own  representatives,\r\n\r\ninterested   parties  and  experts   to   draw   up\r\n\r\nappropriate  legislation  on  the  lines   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission's recommendations.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations are these, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Report of the Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  the  System of Contract Labour in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd.  6  of  1960. The  recommendations  are\r\n\r\nthese,  Sir.  They  are  on  page  vii  -  Summary   of\r\n\r\nRecommendations. This is specifically regarding the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Establishment of a Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) We recommend that there should be established\r\n\r\na single Port of Singapore Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It should have two Labour Departments:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Dock Labour Department; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Stevedoring Labour Department (Roads).'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>When   the   Port   of   Singapore   Authority   is\r\n\r\nestablished, the persons working in the Roads  will\r\n\r\ncome under the Port of Singapore Authority. If  the\r\n\r\nPort  of Singapore Authority is going to be a  mere\r\n\r\nclearing  agent for steamers, what  may  happen  is\r\n\r\nthat   the   same  system  will  prevail  there - the\r\n\r\ncontract   labour  system    -  and   there   will   be\r\n\r\nexploitation of workers, avoiding payment under the\r\n\r\nvarious Ordinances, irregularity of work and so on.\r\n\r\nWith  that intention, this recommendation has  been\r\n\r\nspecifically   made,  and,  as  the  Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has said, certain parts of the  Millbourn\r\n\r\nReport  have  been  included in it.  But  from  the\r\n\r\nworkers' point of view, the important aspect of  it\r\n\r\nhas not been included. That is one point, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the First Schedule on page 57 - \"The\r\n\r\nEmergency Powers of the General Manager of the  new\r\n\r\nPort  of Singapore Authority.\" It seems to me  that\r\n\r\nthe  powers  given to this new General Manager  are\r\n\r\ntoo high and they need to be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I go on to page 49, paragraph 119? This is\r\n\r\npowers  of  arrest.  Any  Police  Officer  or   any\r\n\r\nemployee of the Authority authorised in writing  by\r\n\r\nthe General Manager generally, or in any particular\r\n\r\nplace  may arrest any person committing within  his\r\n\r\nview,  or  who,  he  has  reason  to  believe,  has\r\n\r\ncommitted   an   offence  punishable   under   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and so on, if the Port Authority or  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Manager were to give in writing a  warrant\r\n\r\nof  arrest. Actually you cannot expect them to give\r\n\r\nthat power to an ordinary daily-rated employee or a\r\n\r\nmonthly-rated  employee. Naturally,  the  power  of\r\n\r\narrest  will  be  vested in officers.  We  have  an\r\n\r\nefficient  Police  Force in the  Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard which has looked after the Port very well and\r\n\r\nthey  are doing their duty very well. According  to\r\n\r\nthis,  we have the Police Force who have the powers\r\n\r\nto  arrest  anybody.  Also the  Port  Authority  is\r\n\r\ngiving Authorisation Letters to its employees  that\r\n\r\nmay  include Police personnel of officer grade  and\r\n\r\nalso  civilian  employees who  have  the  power  to\r\n\r\narrest anybody. In other words, an employee - when\r\n\r\nI say an employee, I mean a daily-rated employee or\r\n\r\na  monthly-rated  employee - will  have  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  because, on one side, the Police have  the\r\n\r\npowers to arrest, then also there are officers  who\r\n\r\nare  authorised by the Port of Singapore Authority,\r\n\r\nthe Chairman or the General Manager, in writing.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is very unfair to the workers  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, Sir Eric Millbourn recommended the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of a Port of Singapore Authority,  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently Dr Gamba recommended also on the same\r\n\r\nlines,  particularly  on the part  of  labour.  The\r\n\r\nintention,  at that time and now is, by setting  up\r\n\r\nthis  Port Authority, one thing we must  do  is  to\r\n\r\nimprove the Port facilities so that more ships will\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore, and by improving  that,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more employment in the Port of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if you want more efficient work, then by\r\n\r\nmerely - if  you  will go through the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nSchedule No. 2, on page 58, paragraph 3 - \"Powers  of\r\n\r\nthe Authority\" ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide services within the limits of the port\r\n\r\nand the approaches to the port ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in berthing, towing, mooring, moving,\r\n\r\nslipping or docking any vessel;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in loading or discharging any vessel;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) in sorting, weighing, measuring, ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will read the whole of this thing, there is\r\n\r\nnot a single clause which has been inserted here to\r\n\r\nprovide some sort of machinery for the employees of\r\n\r\nthe  Port  cI Singapore Authority to be dealt  with\r\n\r\nfor  matters which the Port of Singapore  Authority\r\n\r\nmay  think,  for hi order to improve the facilities\r\n\r\nof  the Port, they have to do this, but it may  not\r\n\r\nbe  accepted  by  the workers as a whole.  In  that\r\n\r\ncase,  what the worst probably can happen is, under\r\n\r\nthe pretext of improvement to the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority, and according to the new constitution or\r\n\r\nnew Ordinance, they can do many things which may be\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the few points I want to bring to the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  this House, which, o course the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee will look into when the Bill is  referred\r\n\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The purpose of this Bill is to\r\n\r\nbring  into existence the Singapore Port Authority.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not so much the purpose of this Bill to  go\r\n\r\ninto   details  of  the  terms  of  employment   of\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the  Singapore Port  Authority.  The\r\n\r\nterms  of  employment  of any statutory  body  must\r\n\r\nnecessarily come under the Labour Ordinance.

There is no danger  that  there\r\n\r\nwill be an overlapping or repetition of services on\r\n\r\ntheir  transfer.  The final terms of  transfer,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, must be discussed with the unions, but I do\r\n\r\nnot think it will be correct to include them in the\r\n\r\nBill, which only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseeks  to  define the limits within which the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority will have jurisdiction, and will formally\r\n\r\nbring  into  existence this Port  Authority.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure that in Select Committee we will be able\r\n\r\nto  consider all petitions or memoranda which  will\r\n\r\nbe submitted for consideration, and I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthat interested parties will have no hesitation  in\r\n\r\nstudying   this   Bill   and   giving   us    their\r\n\r\nrecommendations, and the Select Committee will  act\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all I would like to say here is that this\r\n\r\nBill  seeks to bring this Port Authority into being\r\n\r\nand  does  not seek to interfere or spell  out  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service of employees  in  the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority.  As I have stated previously, conditions\r\n\r\nof service between employers and employees are best\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  the  Labour Ordinance.  It  would  be\r\n\r\ninvidious  indeed  if  we have different  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies having in their respective enactments  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions of their employees. In fact, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible to do so because terms and conditions\r\n\r\nvary  from  time to time according to the  economic\r\n\r\nconditions of the country.

Government. The physical integration of  the\r\n\r\nCity   Council,   other  than  the  three   trading\r\n\r\ndepartments,  has  been  in  progress   since   1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,   1961,   by  means   of   the   Financial\r\n\r\nIntegration  Ordinance.  By  means  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Ordinance, 1963, which was passed at  the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting,  the three trading departments  were\r\n\r\nincorporated  into a Public Utilities  Board  which\r\n\r\nwas appointed with effect from 1st May this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These major administrative reforms are in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the pledge of the Party  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout smoother and more efficient public service to\r\n\r\nserve  the  people of the State.  In  the  process,\r\n\r\nduplication  of  functions  which  previously   had\r\n\r\nexisted  has been removed, and it is expected  that\r\n\r\nin  the  long  run economies would be effected  and\r\n\r\nefficiency raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House is complementary to\r\n\r\nthe  Public Utilities Ordinance, already mentioned,\r\n\r\nand  provides  for the transfer to  the  Government\r\n\r\nwith  retrospective effect from 1st January,  1961,\r\n\r\nof  all assets as well as liabilities and employees\r\n\r\nof the City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the  Rural  Board  other  than  those\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the Public Utilities  Board.  This\r\n\r\ntransfer and integration is spelt out in Part I  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. It also enacts in Parts II to VII and  IX\r\n\r\nall  provisions of the Local Government  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1957, relating to streets, sewerage, public health,\r\n\r\netc. - matters  which hitherto have been  within  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  the City Council  and  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard - and  vests  the various statutory  powers  in\r\n\r\nGovernment officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII, which establishes District Offices and\r\n\r\ngives  certain powers to District Officers, is  the\r\n\r\nonly  new  provision  in the  Bill.  The  principal\r\n\r\nfunction  of  District Officers is  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nadequacy  of  various  services  provided  in   the\r\n\r\ndistricts to receive representations, and generally\r\n\r\nto  act  as liaison officers in the districts  with\r\n\r\nrespect    to    matters   coming   within    their\r\n\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this Bill will formally complete\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  policy  of  integrating   Local\r\n\r\nAuthorities  into  a central administration.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory Statement gives the objectives and\r\n\r\nreasons for the Bill, I shall confine my remarks to\r\n\r\nthe  personnel and finance aspects of the Bill  and\r\n\r\nto  some  of those changes which have been made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  since it lay on this Table.  The  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  deliberating  upon  the  original   Bill\r\n\r\nreported back with two amendments -  one to clause  2\r\n\r\nand  the other one to clause 12 - as found in columns\r\n\r\n543  and  544  in the Select Committee's  published\r\n\r\nReport No. 10 of 20th September, 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that all employees of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  who  are  not transferred  to  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board shall be transferred to the service\r\n\r\nof  the  Government at the same rate of pay  or  as\r\n\r\nnear  as  may be the same conditions of service  as\r\n\r\nthose  on  which  they were employed  by  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Upon  the coming into operation  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   these  employees  will  become   civil\r\n\r\nservants and will be legally governed by Government\r\n\r\nregulations and by the Constitution. But it is  our\r\n\r\nintention,  in  so far as salaries  are  concerned,\r\n\r\nthat   all   serving  officers  on  the   permanent\r\n\r\nestablishment of the City Council shall be allowed,\r\n\r\nif they so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoose,  to  retain  their  existing  salaries  and\r\n\r\nsalary  scales on their transfer to the  Government\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice,  it  is  hoped, in consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nStaff  Unions concerned, to bring about  a  set  of\r\n\r\nconditions of service that would be acceptable  and\r\n\r\nwhich   would  be  patterned  on  the   terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions  now  applicable  to  Government   civil\r\n\r\nservants.  It  is  expected  that  in  the  process\r\n\r\ncertain  minor  adjustments  and  changes  may   be\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of representation from Staff Unions to\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee, a Board of Inquiry has  been\r\n\r\nset up by the Minister for Labour under section  70\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance  under  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of Mr Eu Cheow Chye. This  Board  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  held  its first session on  1st  February,\r\n\r\n1963, and to date has held 14 sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that persons transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  the  City Council who are already members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Municipal  Provident  Fund  will  continue  in\r\n\r\nmembership of that Fund. In addition, such  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are eligible for membership of the Fund at the\r\n\r\ntime  of  transfer to the Government  service  will\r\n\r\nretain that eligibility if they so choose. Officers\r\n\r\nof  the  City  Council who are not members  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Provident  Fund  nor  are  eligible  for\r\n\r\nmembership thereof will be governed by the Pensions\r\n\r\nand  Central  Provident Fund  Ordinances  in  every\r\n\r\nrespect   as  they  are  applicable  to  Government\r\n\r\nservants.  Persons appointed after the coming  into\r\n\r\nforce of this Bill will, of course, be governed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Pensions  Ordinance and the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Ordinance.  The management of  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nProvident   Fund   will  be  transferred   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   together  with  all  its  assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities, and the accounts thereof will be  kept\r\n\r\nby   the   Accountant-General.   The   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities connected with the public loans of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, including the sinking fund for these\r\n\r\nloans,   are  to  be  transferred  to  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities   Board   under  the   Public   Utilities\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  but the Government will  contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe   Board   in  respect  of  those  portions   of\r\n\r\noutstanding public loans which were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nused  to  buy  assets  to  be  transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment under this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been both in Select Committee and\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of subsequent deliberations  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself various changes and amendments to\r\n\r\nthe  original draft. I do not propose to deal  with\r\n\r\nthese  amendments here in extenso because it is  my\r\n\r\nintention  that  this  Bill should  be  once  again\r\n\r\ncommitted to Select Committee for consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when\r\n\r\nthe   original   Bill  was  committed   to   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, one of the curious things that  happened\r\n\r\nwas  the almost complete absence of representations\r\n\r\nfrom  the public to the Select Committee. I do hope\r\n\r\nthat on this second occasion members of the public,\r\n\r\npersons,  organisations and associations, who  will\r\n\r\nbe  affected by the provisions of this  Bill,  will\r\n\r\nmake their views felt before the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will involve the Government in\r\n\r\nextra  financial  expenditure  in  the  payment  of\r\n\r\nsalaries  and operational expenses in various  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  departments integrated with those  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. These expenses were formerly chargeable\r\n\r\nto   the   Municipal  Consolidated  Fund  and   the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Provident Fund. These amounts cannot  at\r\n\r\npresent  be fully ascertained but will be dependent\r\n\r\non  the  services  to be provided  and  improvement\r\n\r\nworks to be carried out by the Government under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

Members will recall  that  on  the\r\n\r\nabolition  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  in\r\n\r\nFebruary 1960, about 89 employees of the Trust were\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the  Planning  Department  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  and  the  remainder  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. The employees of the\r\n\r\nTrust   who   were  transferred  to  the   Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment were members of the staff engaged in the\r\n\r\nplanning  functions of the Trust. Their  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions    of    service,    including     their\r\n\r\nsuperannuation, were governed by the same rules  as\r\n\r\napplied  to employees of the City Council.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  intention that the staff of  the  Trust,\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the Planning Department,  and  the\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the City Council  who  will  not  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Government as a consequence  of\r\n\r\nthe  integration, should enjoy the same  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of transfer and superannuation. In order\r\n\r\nthat these former employees of the Trust would also\r\n\r\nenjoy  similar  superannuation  benefits  as  those\r\n\r\napplicable to employees of the City Council who are\r\n\r\nabout  to  be  transferred to the Government  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of integration, it is necessary to amend the\r\n\r\nPlanning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance to provide for identical provisions  with\r\n\r\nthose contained in the Local Government Integration\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the benefits of the Government's\r\n\r\npension  scheme  to former Trust employees  in  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Department will involve the Government  in\r\n\r\nsome  small  expenditure.  In  a  few  cases  these\r\n\r\npersons  will  find  that  the  benefits   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Pensions Scheme are greater than those\r\n\r\nto  which  they  were entitled  in  their  previous\r\n\r\nemployment with the Trust. May I mention here, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  these persons will find-as a result of  their\r\n\r\nown  calculations  which may not be  mathematically\r\n\r\nand objectively correct, but it is a fact that when\r\n\r\npeople do make decisions on these matters-that  the\r\n\r\nattraction  of  larger  sums of  immediate  payment\r\n\r\nweighs  more  heavily  upon  them  than  continuous\r\n\r\npayment  of smaller prospective sums over a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod.  So  when  I say that they  will  find  the\r\n\r\nbenefits   greater  than  the  Government  Pensions\r\n\r\nScheme  I  am not at all stating that that  is  the\r\n\r\nactuarial  position  but  the  position  as   these\r\n\r\npersons  themselves assess. It is, therefore,  most\r\n\r\nprobable that in these few cases they would  choose\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of the Government's Pension  Scheme.\r\n\r\nThe  exact  cost cannot be ascertained until  their\r\n\r\nfinal retirement, but in all probability there will\r\n\r\nonly  be  a few cases, and it is unlikely that  the\r\n\r\nadditional cost will be very large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committal to Select Committee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage now?

As matters stand, such a person  would\r\n\r\nbe  eligible on his retirement to benefits  on  his\r\n\r\nown  superannuation  scheme as well  as  retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits under the Government Pensions Scheme. This\r\n\r\nis   clearly   contrary   to   the   principle   of\r\n\r\nsuperannuation.  It  is, therefore,  necessary  for\r\n\r\nprovision   to   be   made  to   enable   employees\r\n\r\ntransferred  from the City Council, the  Trust  and\r\n\r\nthe  Tan  Tock Seng's Hospital to choose to receive\r\n\r\nbenefits    either   from   their   own    previous\r\n\r\nsuperannuation   schemes   or   those   under   the\r\n\r\nGovernment pensions scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the aspect of death benefits. The\r\n\r\nGovernment pensions scheme requires payment  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  year's salary in the form  of  a  death\r\n\r\ngratuity  to  dependants of a deceased officer.  On\r\n\r\ntheir  transfer  to the service of the  Government,\r\n\r\nemployees  of the City Council, the Trust  and  the\r\n\r\nTan   Tock   Seng's   Hospital  become   Government\r\n\r\nofficers, and their dependants would be entitled to\r\n\r\na  death gratuity of one year's salary should  they\r\n\r\ndie  in  harness. The existing provisions  for  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  a  death gratuity  do  not  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration death benefits to which a transferred\r\n\r\nperson may be eligible under his own superannuation\r\n\r\nscheme.  If this situation is allowed to  continue,\r\n\r\nthen  transferred persons would be better off  than\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants  who only  have  the  pensions\r\n\r\nscheme  to  rely on for benefits. For this  reason,\r\n\r\nprovision Ms been made in the Bill for the  quantum\r\n\r\nof  death  gratuity  payable under  the  Government\r\n\r\npensions  scheme  to be reduced to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\ncontributions paid to the superannuation scheme  to\r\n\r\nwhich a transferred person belonged by his previous\r\n\r\nemploy in Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are four clauses - clauses 1 to 4.

This clause requires an officer to  pay\r\n\r\nGovernment's share of whatever Government has  paid\r\n\r\ninto the Central Provident Fund before he gets  his\r\n\r\ngratuity and pension. What I want to point  out  is\r\n\r\nthis.  Especially in the case of women, this  would\r\n\r\naffect  them  more,  because  women  retire  at  an\r\n\r\nearlier  age.  Now, Miss A and Miss B are  working.\r\n\r\nMiss B has been in Government service for 20 years.\r\n\r\nMiss  A  has been in the City Council or a  similar\r\n\r\norganisation for 20 years and has been paying to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  fund,  the  C.P.F. or  whatever  retiring\r\n\r\nbenefits fund it is. This would also apply to women\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the transition into the  equal  pay\r\n\r\nscheme. That is why I felt that this phrase here is\r\n\r\nso  broad that it is necessary to bring it  up.  In\r\n\r\nthat  case, the one who has done 20 years'  service\r\n\r\nwhere  she has paid towards another fund,  but  not\r\n\r\nthe  pensionable one and has become pensionable  in\r\n\r\nthe last 10 years of the service, when she retires,\r\n\r\nshe  will  have to pay back Government's  share  of\r\n\r\nthat  fund,  let us say, for argument's  sake,  the\r\n\r\nC.P.F.  If  she has contributed $20,000, Government\r\n\r\nhas  contributed $20,000 and when she  retires  she\r\n\r\nhas  to  make good Government's $20,000 before  she\r\n\r\ncan  become  pensionable, before she  can  get  her\r\n\r\ngratuity  and  her pension. The $40,000  is  frozen\r\n\r\nuntil  she is 55. She can draw it. Not only is  her\r\n\r\nown $20,000 which has been paid frozen until she is\r\n\r\n55,  but Out of her gratuity that she gets, she has\r\n\r\nto pay Government's share of $20,000 and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nfreeze that money if she retires at 45. She has the\r\n\r\ndouble sum of money frozen till she is 55. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I felt that since this clause of having to pay\r\n\r\nback  the Government's share before one can  become\r\n\r\npensionable or draw a gratuity will affect not only\r\n\r\nthis  but  also  other schemes  where  there  is  a\r\n\r\ntransition  from  a temporary or  from  a  gratuity\r\n\r\nscheme  to a pensionable scheme, I thought I  would\r\n\r\ndraw  Government's attention to  the  anomaly  that\r\n\r\nwill   be   discriminating  against  those   people\r\n\r\nentering the pensionable scheme at a later stage of\r\n\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  was  really raising a point  connected\r\n\r\nwith  equal pay for women. So far as these  persons\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  they have their  choice.  If  they\r\n\r\nthink    opting   into   Government    scheme    is\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous, they stay on the previous scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have got the point, which is this. Let\r\n\r\nus  say, we take Miss A. Because she is married  or\r\n\r\nfor other reasons, she has been contributing to the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund, say for 10 years. Then  the\r\n\r\nbenevolent   P.A.P.   Government   comes   in   and\r\n\r\nintroduces  equal  pay.  So  she  goes  on  to  the\r\n\r\npermanent establishment and qualifies for  pension.\r\n\r\nThen  the  Member  for Mountbatten  says  when  she\r\n\r\nretires, the Government's contribution for these 10\r\n\r\nyears  has got to be refunded to the Government.  I\r\n\r\nmean that is fair enough because we are giving her,\r\n\r\nin  this instance, credit for 10 years' service  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government. If she does not want to refund  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  she can, but  she  will  lose  10\r\n\r\nyears'  service. On a simple calculation, the  gain\r\n\r\nto  the officer will be so tremendous that I cannot\r\n\r\nimagine anyone not agreeing to this proposal to opt\r\n\r\nfully   into   the   Government  Pensions   Scheme.\r\n\r\nApparently the Member for Mountbatten thinks that I\r\n\r\nmisunderstood her. If so, I am willing to give  her\r\n\r\na hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, Mr Speaker, it does not\r\n\r\napply  to  equal  pay alone. In this  too,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said, the officer has the option.  He\r\n\r\ncan  choose. But it is Hobson's choice.  They  want\r\n\r\nthe pension because it is a better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme.  I  am not talking about paying back.  Yes,\r\n\r\nthey do not want Government's share and their share\r\n\r\nand  the pension. Nobody would expect that. But the\r\n\r\nfact that if she has to pay back Government's share\r\n\r\ninto  the C.P.F. -  she does not draw it. She has  to\r\n\r\nwait  till  10 years or whatever it is,  until  she\r\n\r\nreaches the age of 55, before she can draw it.  And\r\n\r\nif she retires at 45, she has to wait for ten years\r\n\r\nto  get her previous contribution plus Government's\r\n\r\ncontribution, which she has to refund.  Instead  of\r\n\r\ngetting  her  own money back when she retires,  she\r\n\r\nhas  to add on to what she has already paid another\r\n\r\nsum  equivalent  to what she has  already  paid  on\r\n\r\nretirement.  So  instead of getting  money  on  her\r\n\r\nretirement she pays out money on her retirement!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am advised by my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Health and  Law,  that\r\n\r\nwhere a woman officer retires at the age of 45, the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund will be willing to pay  the\r\n\r\naccumulated contribution.

The latter contains provisions\r\n\r\nfor  the  appointment  of trustees  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nmoneys  payable on the death of an employee of  the\r\n\r\nBoard out of any superannuation scheme to which  he\r\n\r\nbelonged.

If  I\r\n\r\nmay  reiterate, it is that Trust employees were  on\r\n\r\nterms   and   conditions  of   service,   including\r\n\r\nsuperannuation,  identical  with  those   of   City\r\n\r\nCouncil   employees.

But because  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfeared  exposure and defeat, unjustifiable  excuses\r\n\r\nwere put forth to guillotine the debate. The debate\r\n\r\non the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech was cut down\r\n\r\nto  one and a half days, and my two motions on  the\r\n\r\nFebruary  arrests and on the inhuman  and  barbaric\r\n\r\ntreatment   of  detainees,  matters   of   national\r\n\r\nimportance, Sir, were not given an opportunity  for\r\n\r\na full and frank debate. After an all-night debate,\r\n\r\nhardly  anything of my six-hour speech appeared  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  the following  morning.

The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters today regard British troops as troops  of\r\n\r\ntheir own. They forget that British troops are here\r\n\r\nnot  to  protect  the  people of  this  region  but\r\n\r\nBritish  vested  interests.

Agents provocateurs are  employed  to\r\n\r\ncreate  incidents so as to allow the Government  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to crush political opponents.

Sir, in order to gain mass support,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has postured as a  Leftist  and  a\r\n\r\ndemocrat, and therefore as an anti-colonialist. But\r\n\r\nhe  has been unmasked and he now openly adopts  all\r\n\r\nthe colonialist and imperialist tactics in order to\r\n\r\nimpose a Fascist dictatorship on the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last Confidence motion in this House in\r\n\r\nJuly  1962,  much  has happened in Singapore  which\r\n\r\nclearly  shows  that  under the  P.A.P.

You  will  remember  the\r\n\r\npassing  of the National Referendum Bill which  was\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  deny  the people of  Singapore  their\r\n\r\ndemocratic  right  of dissent.  The  injustice  and\r\n\r\ndishonesty of the undemocratic Bill so aroused  the\r\n\r\nantagonism of the people in Singapore that protests\r\n\r\nagainst the Bill came from political Parties, trade\r\n\r\nunions,  journalists,  universities,  cultural  and\r\n\r\nother    civic   organisations,   and   progressive\r\n\r\nindividuals.

I  have\r\n\r\nalready touched very lightly on some. More  can  be\r\n\r\nfound on every page of the Hansard and in the Press\r\n\r\nsince our break with the P.A.P., and for some  time\r\n\r\neven  before that. For example, it is quite obvious\r\n\r\nthat the promotion of television and the programmes\r\n\r\nin  Radio  Singapore serve only party and sectional\r\n\r\ninterests  and the interests of foreign capitalists\r\n\r\nand the colonial powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Budget debate of the last few days\r\n\r\ntells  us  exactly  where the  P.A.P. stands.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  also  done  nothing  to  prevent   the\r\n\r\nattempts  of  Western  films  and  literature  from\r\n\r\npromoting propaganda for the colonialists and  from\r\n\r\nundermining   the  development  of   the   national\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the vast majority of  the  people.\r\n\r\nNeither has the P.A.P. done anything to prevent the\r\n\r\nundermining of the morals of our youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Very\r\n\r\nlittle  has  been  done for the national  language;\r\n\r\nvery  little has been done for the Tamil  language.\r\n\r\nThe number of students attending Chinese schools is\r\n\r\ndwindling  and  the  Nanyang  University   question\r\n\r\nremains unsettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aims of the P.A.P. policy, in fact, are to\r\n\r\nanglicise the whole population of Singapore and  so\r\n\r\nto   strengthen  the  colonial  influence  in   the\r\n\r\ncountry, paving the way to a cultural subversion by\r\n\r\nWestern films, newspapers and so-called literature.\r\n\r\nI  will not go into great details, Sir, but I  wish\r\n\r\nbriefly  to summarise some of the main pro-colonial\r\n\r\npolicies of the P.A.P. as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the merger negotiations. It helps to divide\r\n\r\nand   rule  the  people.  It  helps  only   British\r\n\r\ninterests. The financial negotiations have revealed\r\n\r\nenough that Singapore has been sold lock, stock and\r\n\r\nbarrel  to  the  Federation. All  this,  Sir,  only\r\n\r\nprofits  ultimately the colonial power  that  rules\r\n\r\nthe whole area from behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, their active support and promotion of the\r\n\r\nBritish-sponsored Malaysia Plan. This is  the  most\r\n\r\nobvious  example, Sir. The whole world  knows  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is a neo-colonialist plan. The  President\r\n\r\nof  the  Philippines, the President of Indonesia  -\r\n\r\nthe closest neighbours of Malaya and Singapore - have\r\n\r\ncondemned  Malaysia  as  neo-colonialism.  Yet  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government glorifies Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, their suppression of the fundamental rights\r\n\r\nand freedoms of speech and publication, association\r\n\r\nand  assembly.  The P.A.P. abuses State  power  for\r\n\r\nprivate  and sectional interests. I do not need  to\r\n\r\ngive  many  examples. Just one or two - the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nconference was banned; a convention was also banned\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, their frequent and unjustifiable attempts to\r\n\r\ndivide the people by deliberate rousing of communal\r\n\r\nsentiments and fears on national issues. One of the\r\n\r\nmost  blatant  examples  is  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nconstant  harping  on  the communal  arithmetic  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   Recently,  he  talked  of  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nelecting   only  a  Chinese  leader  to  head   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government and the  Federation  electing\r\n\r\nonly a Malay to head the Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Yet, not so very long ago  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhad  been telling the people that Malay Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwere   elected  in  predominantly  Chinese   areas.\r\n\r\nAnother example, Sir, is the way the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nthreatened the Chinese in British North Borneo into\r\n\r\nsupporting Malaysia following the Brunei uprising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 5. Their use of the police and troops against\r\n\r\nthe  workers and the deliberate division of workers\r\n\r\nand   non-implementation  of   their   promise   of\r\n\r\nunification of the trade union movement. They  talk\r\n\r\nof  industrial peace with justice. But, of  course,\r\n\r\nwhenever they talk of justice, they talk of justice\r\n\r\nonly  to  the  employers and the imperial  masters.\r\n\r\nThey  never  talk  of justice to the  workers.  The\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  has said that  Hong  Kong  is  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  industrial State  because  the  workers\r\n\r\nthere  have no unions. From this, you can see  what\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance has in mind concerning the\r\n\r\nreunification of the trade union movement  and  the\r\n\r\nunions of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 6. The P.A.P. support of the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  in the arbitrary arrests and detention  of\r\n\r\nanti-colonial stalwarts. Everybody knows  that  the\r\n\r\nI.S.C. is an imperialist organ, an instrument  for\r\n\r\nthe  imperial  power  to  suppress  the  hopes  and\r\n\r\naspirations of the people in the region. Yet we see\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government fully supporting the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  in  arresting  people  who   are\r\n\r\nfighting for the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 7. Their denial and revocation of citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  and  the  threatened  banishment  of \r\n\r\nanti-colonial stalwarts. We have a sorry spectacle of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment that was elected by the people now going\r\n\r\ncompletely against the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who have obtained our citizenship\r\n\r\nafter such difficulties are now in great danger  of\r\n\r\nlosing that citizenship. The funny thing about  the\r\n\r\nso-called national Government of Singapore is  that\r\n\r\neven  Malay nationals, born in the Federation,  are\r\n\r\nhaving their citizenship taken away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 8.

I do not need to enlarge on this because\r\n\r\nwe have had a good debate on it only last night and\r\n\r\nit  is  quite  clear  that  the  P.A.P.

The P.A.P. is not pursuing a policy of\r\n\r\nhelping  local  businessmen and  industrialists  to\r\n\r\ndevelop    a   national   industry.   The    P.A.P.\r\n\r\nconcentrates on promoting the interests of external\r\n\r\nimperialist  businessmen  like  those  from  Japan,\r\n\r\nAustralia and other imperialist countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 10. They are doing nothing to prevent the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base from being used for the suppression  of\r\n\r\nthe nationalist and popular liberation movement  in\r\n\r\nBrunei and Kalimantan Utara. It is recognised  that\r\n\r\nthe   Brunei  uprising  is  a  national  liberation\r\n\r\nuprising, and yet the P.A.P. Government wants  this\r\n\r\nliberation  movement  to  be  suppressed  and  does\r\n\r\nnothing  whatsoever  to prevent  the  British  from\r\n\r\nusing  the Naval Base in Singapore as a lumping-off\r\n\r\nground   in  its  suppression  of  the  nationalist\r\n\r\nuprising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 11.

The P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncelebrated   National  Day  two  weeks   ago,   but\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  still  a  colony.  National  Day  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  serves  to remind the  people  of  toast\r\n\r\nsacrifices in blood and toil in order that they may\r\n\r\nhave   today  limited  self-government.  But   more\r\n\r\nimportant,  National  Day reminds  us  of  the  yet\r\n\r\nuncompleted  tasks ahead. The tasks  ahead  in  the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial struggle. This struggle must lead  us\r\n\r\nto  complete independence and to the restoration of\r\n\r\nall  our  basic and fundamental democratic  rights.\r\n\r\nOnly  then will the people have the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ngo one step further in the struggle towards freedom\r\n\r\nin  order that they may solve the basic problems of\r\n\r\npoverty, disease, ignorance and want, and towards a\r\n\r\nsociety with no exploitation of man by man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was elected to office in 1959 on an\r\n\r\nanti-colonial policy. The object then was  to  lead\r\n\r\nthe people to genuine independence and freedom. But\r\n\r\nfor selfish interests, the P A.P. Ministers now try\r\n\r\nto retard the progress of the people in their march\r\n\r\ntowards  freedom. In so doing, the P.A.P. Ministers\r\n\r\nally   themselves   with   the   imperialist    and\r\n\r\ncolonialists  and  pursue pro-colonial  policies  I\r\n\r\nhave just outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses no confidence in the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party  Government  for  its \r\n\r\npro-colonial polices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise to second the motion standing in  the\r\n\r\nname of the Member for Queenstown and myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about the pro-colonial policies\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Government. I would like to stress\r\n\r\nonly one or two points. The P.A.P. came to power on\r\n\r\nan  anti-colonial platform, but the  P.A.P.'s \r\n\r\npro-colonial  policies  during  their  short  four-year\r\n\r\nreign  have exposed their deceit of the people  and\r\n\r\nhave  openly  shown their tolerance, adulation  and\r\n\r\nsupport  of  colonial polices. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\ntheir  support for all anti-colonial struggles  has\r\n\r\nbeen next to nil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of making use of the country's surpluses\r\n\r\nto   solve  our  problem  of  unemployment  and  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise  our country, the P  A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhas  followed  in  the footsteps  of  the  previous\r\n\r\ncolonial   Government  by  investing  millions   of\r\n\r\ndollars  abroad, especially in the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nDuring  the  general elections in 1959, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npromised  the people of Singapore that  they  would\r\n\r\nrecall  all local capital invested abroad  for  the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation of the country.  But  since  they\r\n\r\ncame  to  power,  more  and  more  money  has  been\r\n\r\ninvested  abroad, nearly twice the amount in  three\r\n\r\nyears,  and these large sums of money which  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  used for the benefit of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are being used to provide employment  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have never come out in the open to give\r\n\r\nwholehearted  and  sincere support  for  any \r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle.  Most  Afro-Asian  leaders  and\r\n\r\npolitical Parties condemn the apartheld policies of\r\n\r\nthe  Verwoerd Government in South Africa.  To  show\r\n\r\ntheir disapproval of this apartheid policy, many of\r\n\r\nthem, including the Federation of Malaya, imposed a\r\n\r\nboycott  on South African products. But the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  which profess to be anti-colonial  have\r\n\r\nnot  done  anything of the sort. Their  silence  on\r\n\r\nthis issue could only mean support and tolerance of\r\n\r\nthe  racial  and colonial policies of the  Verwoerd\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the struggle of the Indonesian people to\r\n\r\nliberate  West Irian, the P.A.P. as a ruling  Party\r\n\r\nfailed  to  show any vigorous support. It  was  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis who organised the people to  show\r\n\r\ntheir support for their brothers and neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Brunei revolution broke out, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nopenly  condemned  it,  just  as  the  British  had\r\n\r\ncondemned it and sent troops to suppress it. But in\r\n\r\nthe   eyes   of   the  Afro-Asian  countries,   the\r\n\r\nrevolution  was  a  national  revolution  aimed  at\r\n\r\nending   British  colonialism.  The  P.A.P. stand\r\n\r\ncondemned  in the eyes of the Afro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\nThis  could not be better illustrated than by  what\r\n\r\nhad happened to their delegation at the Third \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian Solidarity Conference at Moshi recently  when\r\n\r\nthe P A.P. delegates had the door of the Conference\r\n\r\nslammed in their faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a semi-colonial country with no control in\r\n\r\nforeign  affairs, even then the P.A.P. as  a  local\r\n\r\npolitical Party can come out and show their support\r\n\r\nfor  anti-colonialism. But the P.A.P. dare  not  do\r\n\r\nso,  for they arc entirely dependent on the British\r\n\r\nGovernment for their survival. They depend  on  the\r\n\r\nBritish  for aid, especially military aid,  in  the\r\n\r\nform   of  troops,  to  wipe  out  their  political\r\n\r\nopponents.  This is best illustrated  by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister has, during a world  tour,\r\n\r\nstopped at London to ask the British Government  to\r\n\r\nfinance another battalion in the Singapore Military\r\n\r\nForce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the Malaysia Plan is not\r\n\r\noriginated from the Tunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only been made use of by the British to\r\n\r\nbring  out  this  Plan. It is  a  British-sponsored\r\n\r\nplan,  a plan by which the British hope to withdraw\r\n\r\nfrom political control of the territories of Borneo\r\n\r\nand Singapore, leaving them in the \"safe\" hands  of\r\n\r\ntheir stooges, thus maintaining their economic  and\r\n\r\nmilitary  interests  in this region.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nusual  design  in  the grand tradition  of  British\r\n\r\ncolonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nThe British only let the Tunku announce the plan to\r\n\r\nallay  suspicion. The Prime Minister of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nin  fact, who knew of this plan before, instead  of\r\n\r\nopposing  it  as  a  true anti-colonialist  should,\r\n\r\nwelcomed  it  as  a  means of saving  himself  from\r\n\r\npolitical  bankruptcy.  He  thought  that   through\r\n\r\nMalaysia   he   could  deceive  the  people   about\r\n\r\nachieving  merger with the Federation, an objective\r\n\r\nadvocacy by every political Party in Singapore. He,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  came out in full support of  the  plan.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. who  call themselves anti-colonialists\r\n\r\nnow   become  purveyors  of  non-colonialism.   The\r\n\r\nBritish  now have, therefore, in Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  two stooges to carry out  their  grand\r\n\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I would like to stress another\r\n\r\npoint  which  is  quite important in  parliamentary\r\n\r\npractice, as the P.A.P. have always pretended to he\r\n\r\nthe  protector of the parliamentary system.  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that if in the House of Parliament or in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  whenever  there  is  a  motion   of   no\r\n\r\nconfidence, the Government, if they have  guts,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  serious, and if they have confidence  in\r\n\r\nthemselves,  should push aside all matters  on  the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper and debate the motion of no confidence.\r\n\r\nBut  instead  the  P.A.P.  Government  decided   to\r\n\r\npostpone  this motion which we have tabled  at  the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting and forced us to have it  debated  at\r\n\r\ntoday's  sitting.  Even then  our  motion  was  not\r\n\r\ndebated  first but was left till the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nsitting.  If the P.A.P. Government and  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nFront  benches  are  really the protectors  of  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system, and if they  have  guts  and\r\n\r\nconfidence in themselves, they should have  debated\r\n\r\nour motion first instead of now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is\r\n\r\na  saying that those whom the gods wish to  destroy\r\n\r\nthey first make mad. The Barisan Sosialis have been\r\n\r\nrepeating themselves so often that we on this  side\r\n\r\nare   often  constrained  to  repeat  our   counter\r\n\r\narguments. Perhaps it would be best to start off by\r\n\r\nasking what they mean by anti-colonialism. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  essence  of the motion, that we are  following\r\n\r\npro-colonial policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand anti-colonialism, its purpose is\r\n\r\nto  get  rid  of  foreign  rule,  foreign  control,\r\n\r\npolitical  or  otherwise. The method  by  which  we\r\n\r\nintended to get rid of colonialism was laid out  in\r\n\r\nthe  fixed  political objectives of the Party,  the\r\n\r\npolicy statement by the Central Executive Committee\r\n\r\nof  the People's Action Party in 1960, contained in\r\n\r\nthe book, The Battle for Merger, a statement issued\r\n\r\nbefore  the  election and signed  by  every  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblyman.  It  indicated  how  to  get  rid   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we made it quite clear that fighting to get\r\n\r\nrid  of  colonialism did not mean fighting  for  an\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore. It was made quite clear that\r\n\r\nwe   said  that  an  independent  Singapore,   once\r\n\r\nestablished, cannot lead to merger by  consent.  If\r\n\r\nmerger  ever  came, it would be by the conquest  of\r\n\r\none  by  the  other. For an independent  Singapore,\r\n\r\nonce established, even for an interim period, would\r\n\r\ncreate a situation whereby vested interests with  a\r\n\r\nChinese  appeal  would become  permanent.  If  once\r\n\r\nindependence were achieved in this island city,  75\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  whose  population  is  Chinese,  the\r\n\r\nlogical  consequence would be  that  those  Chinese\r\n\r\nchauvinist  sentiments which are at  present  being\r\n\r\nmuted and slowly dissolved because of the objective\r\n\r\nof  independence through merger, would  openly  and\r\n\r\naggressively  come  to  the  fore.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nobjective was independence through merger, and that\r\n\r\nwas  the basis of our anti-colonial struggle signed\r\n\r\nby everyone of the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was 1959, four years ago. I think exactly 77\r\n\r\ndays  from  today, we will be getting  merger.  The\r\n\r\ngentlemen over there will get into trouble on  31st\r\n\r\nAugust.  But  we  have  fulfilled  our  mandate  of\r\n\r\nsecuring independence through merger. Can they  say\r\n\r\nthat  we have not kept faith with our anti-colonial\r\n\r\npolicy,  the major platform of our election promise\r\n\r\nsigned by all the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a pro-colonialist? A pro-colonialist is\r\n\r\none  who  wants  to  sell the  country  to  outside\r\n\r\nforces, who has to rely on outside forces. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to convince you, within this short period  of\r\n\r\ntime - I do not want to take up too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  time - that it is the Barisan Sosialis and  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   who   are  today  following   a   \r\n\r\npro-colonialist  policy. You will remember,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  question  of merger was  sprung  on  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, what did they do? It was revealed  here\r\n\r\nthat  the  first person they ran to was the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom Commissioner in order to make a deal.  \r\n\r\nPro-colonialists? Anti-colonialists running to the U.K.\r\n\r\nCommission to have tea. They were led up the garden\r\n\r\npath into taking a dangerous and disastrous course,\r\n\r\nwhich they did. Anti-colonialists never tried to do\r\n\r\na  deal with the U.K. Commissioner. What was  their\r\n\r\ndeal?  We  said  independence  through  merger.  By\r\n\r\ngetting  merger we, in Singapore, will become  part\r\n\r\nof  a  national Government which will have  control\r\n\r\nover  foreign affairs and defence. We have internal\r\n\r\nself-government; now we want control  over  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  and  defence. What was the deal  that  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in the Barisan Sosialis put forward  to\r\n\r\nthe  British? They said, \"Please give  us  internal\r\n\r\nself-government  in  return  for  which  you,   the\r\n\r\nBritish,  can keep control of defence  and  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs.\" Who are the pro-colonialists? Who are the\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists?  I can tell  you,  Sir,  it  was\r\n\r\nsometime  in  August last year, I think,  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis sent a delegation to  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  to  try to interest the Russians  and  the\r\n\r\nPoles  to  take up their cause. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwas  there. When their representation was made, the\r\n\r\nRussians and the Poles thought the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nwere  Communists.  They took a  firm  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstand.  The Prime Minister said. \"Yes, but  do  you\r\n\r\nknow  the  Barisan's  stand is against  merger,  as\r\n\r\nproposed  by  us,  and  that they  will  allow  the\r\n\r\nBritish  to  keen defence and the  Naval  Base  and\r\n\r\nforeign    affairs?\"   The   Russians    were    so\r\n\r\nflabbergasted. They thought the Prime Minister  was\r\n\r\nputting  on  a  fable. So they asked Mr  Woodhull,\r\n\r\n\"Surely,  Mr  Woodhull,  that  is  not  so?\"   Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull said, \"Well, I have no authority  to  make\r\n\r\nany  statement on that point.\" \"But is it  so?\"  He\r\n\r\nsaid.  \"Yes,  at the moment.\" He had  already  said\r\n\r\nthat  under  their arrangements the  British  bases\r\n\r\nwould be retained. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish  could  have control over their  bases  and\r\n\r\nover foreign affairs and defence. Pro-colonialists?\r\n\r\nWho   are  the  pro-colonialists?  After  that  the\r\n\r\nRussians and the Polish delegates decided  to  call\r\n\r\nthe whole thing off. They were so embarrassed. Here\r\n\r\nwere  Communists  coming  before  other  Communists\r\n\r\ntaking what appeared to be an active anti-colonial\r\n\r\nline,  but  which in fact turned out to be  a\r\n\r\npro-colonial line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, we have fulfilled our\r\n\r\nmandate. The political objective, which, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,   was  signed  by  them  also,  is   to   get\r\n\r\nindependence through merger. In 77 more  days  that\r\n\r\nmandate will be carried out to the hilt. And  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen first went to the U.K. Commission to do a\r\n\r\ndeal!  They even embarrassed the Russians  and  the\r\n\r\nPoles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in the issue of the Plebeian Express No.\r\n\r\n6, ten cents, published by the Barisan Sosialis - I\r\n\r\nbelieve the Petir is a bit more expensive. But this\r\n\r\nis  ten  cents; and what is it? Here  they  try  to\r\n\r\nprove - \"Malaysia on 31st August???\"  Three  question\r\n\r\nmarks.  They  try to convince here, and  demoralise\r\n\r\nand  rather frighten their followers that  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill  not  come about. Why? Because they  have  the\r\n\r\npeople  behind them? No. They give the reasons  why\r\n\r\nMalaysia will not come about. Perhaps, Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter to quote. \"First, a lot of difficulties  for\r\n\r\nthe Tunku.\" The Tunku is not a foreigner. He is one\r\n\r\nof  us. He is a Malayan, a Malaysian. But they  are\r\n\r\nnot  referring to the Tunku, \"First, that  guerilla\r\n\r\nwarfare  is  spreading in the Borneo  territories.\"\r\n\r\nWho  is  spreading guerilla warfare'? Mr  Azahari.\r\n\r\nWhere is Mr Azahari?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Mr  Azahari, who is in  Indonesia,  now\r\n\r\nsays, \"We must oppose Malaysia to save it from  the\r\n\r\nChinese.\" Kalimantan Utara Radio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroadcasts  it  every day. Pro-colonialists? \r\n\r\nAnti-colonialists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is the other alternative? What are\r\n\r\nthe  other  reasons why they believe that  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill  not  come about? They say, \"It is because  of\r\n\r\nthe  sham  referendum.\" 70 per cent of  the  people\r\n\r\nvoted  for  it. Is it a sham? They know  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot rely on the people of Singapore te break  up\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  So,  therefore, they  have  to  rely  on\r\n\r\nBrunei. Azahari? That also fizzled out. Today  they\r\n\r\nsay,  perhaps  it is not Azahari - this gentleman  is\r\n\r\nnow  a  little bit as desperate as the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - but  because there  are  other  reasons.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the  greatest of the other  reasons?  The\r\n\r\ngreatest  is that a strong and vehement  opposition\r\n\r\nhas   come   from  Malaya's  immediate   neighbour,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   and   Malaya's   ASA   partner,    the\r\n\r\nPhilippines.  Great anti-colonialists, nationalists\r\n\r\nnow  saying, \"We cannot get the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto  oppose Malaysia. But this is all right, friends\r\n\r\nand  comrades.  Indonesia and the Philippines  will\r\n\r\nhelp  break up Malaysia.\" 70 per cent of the people\r\n\r\nvoted  for Malaysia, but the Barisan Sosialis,  the\r\n\r\ngreat   anti-colonialists,  say,  \"Do  not   worry;\r\n\r\nIndonesia and the Philippines will help us to break\r\n\r\nup Malaya.\" Anti-colonialists? Pro-colonialists?  I\r\n\r\nsay.  Sir, that a pro-colonialist is one who  sells\r\n\r\nhis  country to foreigners and outside forces.  Who\r\n\r\nare the pro-colonialists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Barisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Further, they say \"Malaysia will\r\n\r\nnot  come  about???\" Three question marks. \"Because\r\n\r\nit   will   mean   the   intensification   of   the\r\n\r\nconfrontation policy with a greater flare-up in the\r\n\r\nfighting  in  the Borneo territories.\" That  simply\r\n\r\nmeans  that foreign forces are going to invade  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories and we will  be  saved  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, the great anti-colonialists.  We\r\n\r\nwill be saved not by the people of Malaysia, but by\r\n\r\npeople from outside. Again I ask you, Sir, who  are\r\n\r\nthe   anti-colonial's  and   who   are   the  \r\n\r\npro-colonialists? People who sell out the country,  who\r\n\r\ndepend on foreign forces, who tell the British that\r\n\r\nthey are prepared to give them their foreign bases,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nask them to keep their defence and foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nThey are the colonialists ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

At least\r\n\r\nthey can say that it is in the spirit of Afro-Asia.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Member for Queenstown has new  allies  to\r\n\r\nhelp  break up Malaysia. Not in Afro-Asia.  Because\r\n\r\nhe  goes  on to say, \"Britain too ---\", page 4.  This\r\n\r\nwas  all written before recent events. This was 7th\r\n\r\nJune,   1963.   \"Britain   too   recognises   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties    and    the   Under-Secretary    for\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Relations, Sir  Saville  Garner,  was\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the attitude of  Indonesia,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, tells the British that if they go  ahead\r\n\r\nwith this, they are going to get into trouble.\"  In\r\n\r\nother  words, they now hope that even  the  British\r\n\r\nwill come to their aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will remember, Sir, that a few months ago\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Queenstown,  having   lost   the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  when 70 per cent of the  people  voted\r\n\r\nfor  merger and Malaysia, said, \"Better get rid  of\r\n\r\nBung. Let me go and enlist new friends.\" So he said\r\n\r\nhe  was  going to visit Afro-Asia. But he  went  to\r\n\r\nLondon - the  heart of colonialism - to enlist  support\r\n\r\nfrom  amongst M.P.s. And we know three M.P.s turned\r\n\r\nup.  These three M.P.s came at his request, though,\r\n\r\nas  you know, Sir, when they came, the first  thing\r\n\r\nthey   said  was,  \"We  are  coming  here  at   the\r\n\r\ninvitation of the Prime Minister.\" But, in fact,  I\r\n\r\ndid  suggest  to the Finance Minister that  if  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown kept on insisting  that  the\r\n\r\nthree M.P.s came at his request, he should send all\r\n\r\nthe  bills  to him. But, I think, since  the  M.P.s\r\n\r\nsaid  that they were coming here at the request  of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Who is paying the bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The interesting thing is that even\r\n\r\nif   the  three  M.P.s  had  come  at  the  express\r\n\r\ninvitation of the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, his treatment of the three  M.P.s.\r\n\r\nhis  three  guests, was even more  deplorable.  You\r\n\r\nwill  remember  - in the newspapers, he  invited  the\r\n\r\nthree  M.P.s  to go to the Happy World rally.  They\r\n\r\nalways  go to the Happy World because they  are  so\r\n\r\ndepressed  that that is the only place  where  they\r\n\r\nthink they can feel a certain amount of elation  at\r\n\r\nwhat  is  going to happen. They invited  the  three\r\n\r\nM.P.s  and  insisted that they should  speak.  They\r\n\r\nrefused  to  speak,  and then they  went  off.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown then got up and made a  long\r\n\r\nspeech  in  which he denounced the three M.P.s  Who\r\n\r\nhad  invited their guests, Sir? They invited  them.\r\n\r\nThe M.P s did not want to go to their meeting. They\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"We  have  not  come here  to  address  mass\r\n\r\nmeetings,  having addressed bigger meetings.\"  They\r\n\r\nmade their case and they went away. So he denounced\r\n\r\nthem.  He said, \"The three M.P.s were Labour M.P.s.\r\n\r\nThe  Labour  Party  is a Party of  monopoly  vested\r\n\r\ninterests.\" Then three paragraphs later there is  a\r\n\r\nnew  trend in the argument. He said, \"On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the Barisan Sosialis had a big reception  at\r\n\r\nthe Airport, one of the biggest receptions.\" So  it\r\n\r\nall  boils  down  to  this.  The  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\norganised  a big reception at the Airport  to  meet\r\n\r\nthree Labour M.P.s who were the representatives  of\r\n\r\nmonopoly  capitalism.  How silly  can  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  get,  that they should now  confess  that\r\n\r\nhere  is  an  anti-colonial  Party  inviting  three\r\n\r\nLabour M.P.s from the heart of colonialism to  help\r\n\r\nbreak  up  Malaysia, and, at the  same  time,  they\r\n\r\norganised   a   reception  for  what  amounted   to\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of monopoly capitalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why. Sir, I earlier prefaced my remarks by\r\n\r\nsaying  some  epithet about the  Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthat  those  whom  the gods wish to  destroy,  they\r\n\r\nfirst  make  mad. And this is madness, Sir.  First,\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists  who  rely  on  foreign   forces,\r\n\r\nending  up  with British monopoly vested interests;\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  monopoly vested  interests  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  out of their predicament. Anyway,  Sir,\r\n\r\nnow they have come to this point. You will remember\r\n\r\nthese great pro-colonialists.

But  you\r\n\r\nwill  have read that the Workers' Party has  pulled\r\n\r\nout.   Why?  Because  they  know  that  by  tagging\r\n\r\nthemselves on to the united front, they  are  going\r\n\r\nto  get into real trouble. So, like rats which know\r\n\r\nhow  to desert a sinking ship, they have pulled out\r\n\r\nfirst.

Sir, I will leave it to our  Chairman\r\n\r\nto rebut the balderdash uttered by the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture.  I  will  now  only speak  on  some  other\r\n\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the Party in power\r\n\r\nthat  they have deviated from their original  \r\n\r\nanti-colonialist  stand,  because in  one  of  the  past\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  declarations, they said that the  economy\r\n\r\nof  Malaya existed only for British interests. They\r\n\r\nalso  said  at  the same time that under  the  then\r\n\r\neconomic  system  the thought of getting  political\r\n\r\npower  through constitutional reform was  something\r\n\r\nof  a  deception, that the various reforms  carried\r\n\r\nout  in  Malaya  after the war by the  colonialists\r\n\r\nwere  all  meant  to consolidate the  interests  of\r\n\r\nBritish  colonialists  and  that  before  achieving\r\n\r\npolitical  freedom it was impossible to change  the\r\n\r\nthen economic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the past P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\ndeclaration,  it  was  necessary  to   change   the\r\n\r\neconomic  structure first. You  will  remember  the\r\n\r\nother  day  in this House, I criticised the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy.  When  I insisted on changing the  economic\r\n\r\nstructure at the time when I was in the P.A.P., the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  accused  me  of   being   a\r\n\r\nCommunist. From this, you can clearly see that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  deviated  from their  original\r\n\r\nanti-colonial stand to their present pro-colonial stand.\r\n\r\nFurther in February 1959, the then Chairman of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  in a Hong Lim mass rally, said that  there\r\n\r\nwere three forces existing. The first force was the\r\n\r\nbanking compradore class, the second force was  the\r\n\r\nBritish and American imperialists, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  third  force was the Ministers such  as  Inche\r\n\r\nJohari of the Federation. Now, this was uttered  by\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. before  they  came  to  power.   They\r\n\r\ndescribed  the  then  situation  as  one   of   the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  three  forces. At  present,  we  are\r\n\r\nwitnessing the P.A.P. competing with the M.C.A. of\r\n\r\nMalaya  for the role of compradores. They no longer\r\n\r\ncriticise the British and the Americans because the\r\n\r\nU.K., the U.S.A. and all Western countries are  now\r\n\r\npraising the P.A.P.'s new approach as wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Prime Minister has, on a few\r\n\r\noccasions,  attacked  a  certain  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  yet he has been playing  golf  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I would also like to point out\r\n\r\nthat we Barisan Assemblymen left the P A.P. in 1961\r\n\r\nmainly  because  we saw through the P.A.P.'s  stand\r\n\r\nwhich   was   pro-colonialist.  In  January   1962,\r\n\r\nsometime  before the referendum was held, not  only\r\n\r\nwe  in the Barisan Sosialis knew that the P.A.P was\r\n\r\npro-colonialist but that the political Parties from\r\n\r\nthe   five   territories  which  held  a  socialist\r\n\r\nconference  in Kuala Lumpur knew it  too.  At  that\r\n\r\nconference  the  P.A.P. was  expelled   from   the\r\n\r\nsocialist camp. After the national referendum ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Now,  the  Member for Upper  Serangoon  is\r\n\r\nraising new issues which will probably have  to  be\r\n\r\nreplied to by the Government side.

Three  years\r\n\r\nafter 1954 the Federation of Malaya in 1957 on 31st\r\n\r\nAugust  became  an  independent nation,  while  the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore were still separated from  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Malaya  and such  separation  was  even\r\n\r\nadvocated.  In fact, Singapore not even  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya, and  Singapore  itself\r\n\r\ncould  not  possibly become independent.  It  could\r\n\r\nonly achieve self-government in the following year,\r\n\r\nand  so  to review our position and to explain  our\r\n\r\npolicies  and aims the time has come for us  to  do\r\n\r\nall these things!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like him to refer to this paragraph again.\r\n\r\nSir,  before he stood for the election, he endorsed\r\n\r\nour  aims  and policies.

They keep on  repeating\r\n\r\nthe  slogan  of independence through  merger.  They\r\n\r\nalso say independence through Malaysia. But one  of\r\n\r\nthe  most pro-Malaysia politicians in Sarawak today\r\n\r\nhas   come  out  and  said  that  this  slogan   of\r\n\r\nindependence through Malaysia is a myth. Sir, we in\r\n\r\nthis House have debated ad nauseam and explained to\r\n\r\nall the Ministers how the so-called merger will not\r\n\r\ngive  the  people  of Singapore  independence.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Upper Serangoon has already informed the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the  P.A.P. has such a bad  reputation\r\n\r\namongst  genuine  anti-colonialists  that  it   was\r\n\r\ndriven  out  of the socialist conference  in  Kua1a\r\n\r\nLumpur in January 1961 and was debarred from  entry\r\n\r\nto the conference at Moshi, Tanganyika, in spite of\r\n\r\nall  the sponsoring by friendly governments  hoping\r\n\r\nto   smuggle   the  P.A.P. candidates   into   the\r\n\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Havelock, has also\r\n\r\nmentioned  the fact that the P A.P.

Are these troops to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfight the British? To borrow money from the British\r\n\r\nto fight the British?

This is a new and funny way  of\r\n\r\nfighting  against colonialism. Today our troops  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  not trained to fight  the  external\r\n\r\nenemy.  They  cannot fight against Indonesia;  they\r\n\r\ncannot  fight  against  the Philippines;  and  they\r\n\r\ncannot  fight against anybody outside.  The  troops\r\n\r\nare  only  good  for suppressing the people  inside\r\n\r\nSingapore  in their struggle for freedom and  their\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights. That is all that the  troops  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  good for. Is this what  the  troops\r\n\r\nmeant  to do? These troops definitely are not meant\r\n\r\nto  fight against the colonial masters.

But  in his trying  to  emphasise  the\r\n\r\nimportance of Singapore, he only talks of Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a base -  a base for the defence of whom and  for\r\n\r\nwhose  interests?

The base in Singapore is to act  as  the\r\n\r\nspringboard for the protection of British interests\r\n\r\nin  the  Far  East, and stretching as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nIndian  Ocean  and into the Arabian Sea.

Our stand is very  simple,\r\n\r\nSir.  The present plan and the present concept both\r\n\r\nembrace the Borneo territories, Singapore, and  the\r\n\r\nFederation. As far as we are concerned, the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  should  have self-determination.  They\r\n\r\nhave  asked  for independence, and they should  get\r\n\r\nindependence. Moreover, already there is Kalimantan\r\n\r\nUtara.  On our side, we ask for reunification  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. That is all. To keep talking about\r\n\r\nthe  concept will allow certain people who are\r\n\r\npro-Malaysia to distort the anti-Malaysia stand of  the\r\n\r\npeople  by  quoting non-opposition to the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nconcept  as  non-opposition to  the  Malaysia  plan\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very clear example is seen in Mr Narasimhan's\r\n\r\nstatement  recently.  He went  to  Borneo  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Because some of the Parties  have  said\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  opposed  to  the  concept,  so  Met\r\n\r\nNarasimhan  told  the  world  that  there  was   no\r\n\r\nopposition to Malaysia when, in fact, all  of  them\r\n\r\nare  opposed to Malaysia. Therefore, to prevent all\r\n\r\nthese  distortions and confusion, it is much easier\r\n\r\nthat  we  say we oppose the Malaysia plan  and  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  concept.

The Members opposite  keep\r\n\r\ntalking   about   their  1958  Fourth   Anniversary\r\n\r\nSouvenir.   But   I  remember,  Sir,   we   started\r\n\r\ncomplaining  about the implementation of  the \r\n\r\npro-colonial policy of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  early  as September, or even August  1959.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had  a  meeting in a  special  bungalow  in\r\n\r\nChangi  and  we Assemblymen and other  cadres  were\r\n\r\nasked  to attend. As early as 1959, we had  already\r\n\r\npointed  out to the leaders that they were pursuing\r\n\r\na  policy  which  was entirely different  from  the\r\n\r\npledges  given to the people before the  elections.\r\n\r\nSince  that time, there had been frequent  meetings\r\n\r\nand   every  time  the  cadres  complained  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters.  But later on, because of  what  is  now\r\n\r\ncalled the Ong Eng Guan incident, these differences\r\n\r\nwere  put  aside  until the time  when  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nopenly   supported   the  Malaysia   plan   without\r\n\r\nconsultation  of party cadres. So to  say  that  we\r\n\r\nsupported the P.A.P. from the beginning is entirely\r\n\r\nwrong.  Our quarrel with the Ministers and  leaders\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. started as early as 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. always talks about the Communists\r\n\r\nbecause   they  want  to  use  the  Communists   as\r\n\r\nscapegoats. They want to crush the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nby  smearing  us as Communists. They want  frighten\r\n\r\naway  supporters of the Barisan Sosialis. And  when\r\n\r\nthey  make mistakes and commit blunders, they  hope\r\n\r\nto  blame  the  Communists for  such  mistakes  and\r\n\r\nblunders. Everything undemocratic that they  do  is\r\n\r\nblamed on the Communists. I think the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  did  on  one occasion say that  he  needed\r\n\r\nundemocratic measures to protect P.A.P. democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And because of that, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  had  clause  29  of  the Referendum  Bill.  And\r\n\r\nbecause  of  that also, I and many of  us  suffered\r\n\r\nloss  of  individual freedom in the police  station\r\n\r\nlock-up. Sir, democracy is dead in Singapore today.\r\n\r\nI  would  advise the P.A.P. to correct  its  policy\r\n\r\neven  in  the short time left to them. The  correct\r\n\r\npolicy  is  to  pursue  the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\ncorrectly and try to raise the living standards  of\r\n\r\nthe people. Colonialism exploits the people in many\r\n\r\nforms. Even if political domination has been  taken\r\n\r\naway,   the   country   can  still   be   dominated\r\n\r\neconomically  and  militarily,  and  economic   and\r\n\r\nmilitary domination constitutes neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  is what Malaysia is, and if the P.A.P. wants\r\n\r\nto  get away from this pro-colonial policy, I would\r\n\r\nask  it to immediately stop supporting Malaysia and\r\n\r\nto go back to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That this House expresses no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the People's Action Party Government\r\n\r\nfor its pro-colonial policies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 16; Noes, 23;\r\n\r\nAbstentions, 6; Absent, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    Ayes.
