To qualify for this,  he  will\r\n\r\nhave  to complete a length of service of 33 1/3 years.\r\n\r\nSince  most  Government  officers  join  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice for a career, most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers  will,  on retirement,  have  completed  a\r\n\r\nlength  of  service  fairly  close  to  the  number\r\n\r\nnecessary to qualify for the maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether such pension is\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  see a pensioner through  his  daily\r\n\r\nneeds  can best be assessed by comparing his income\r\n\r\nand commitments before and after his retirement.  A\r\n\r\nserving  officer will have to meet from his  salary\r\n\r\nhis  personal expenditure, the expenditure  of  his\r\n\r\nfamily,   and   to  have  a  small  saving.   After\r\n\r\nretirement,  his personal expenditure should  fall.\r\n\r\nHis family expenditure should also fall since some,\r\n\r\nif  not all his children would by then be grown  up\r\n\r\nand  be  no  longer dependent on  him.  He  is  not\r\n\r\nexpected  to  save  from  his  pension.  Thus,  his\r\n\r\nexpenditure  should fall by at least  one-third  or\r\n\r\nmore.   As   already  explained,  his   income   on\r\n\r\nretirement  will  be  reduced by  about  one-third.\r\n\r\nSince this fall is matched by a corresponding  fall\r\n\r\nin  his expenditure, a pensioner is expected to  be\r\n\r\nno worse off than before his retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some officers who opt to commute a\r\n\r\nquarter of their pension for a lump sum payment  as\r\n\r\ngratuity  on retirement. In such cases, the  amount\r\n\r\nof  pension  payable will be reduced by a  quarter.\r\n\r\nThe  reduced  amount payable monthly will  then  be\r\n\r\nabout half his last drawn salary. This may then  be\r\n\r\nfound  insufficient. Officers who require a  higher\r\n\r\nmonthly   income  from  their  pension,  therefore,\r\n\r\nshould  not  opt  for  a gratuity.

There is, however, no provision  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance to detain undesirable publications  which\r\n\r\nhave evaded these check points or smuggled into the\r\n\r\nRepublic  through the Causeway or other clandestine\r\n\r\nchannels.

Because  of\r\n\r\nthis, these publishers are doing business with very\r\n\r\nundesirable  motives. They resort to all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nnames  to  canvass for advertisements from  various\r\n\r\ncommercial  houses.  After the advertisements  have\r\n\r\nbeen canvassed, there are only enough copies of the\r\n\r\npublications    for    distribution    among    the\r\n\r\nadvertisers.  Members of the public, including  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself, will not be able  to  read  such\r\n\r\npublications.  This  kind of publication  is  often\r\n\r\nused  to  deceive businessmen in Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\nswindle  them  of their money. So if  there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision in this Bill to restrict or control  such\r\n\r\nillegal or unlawful activities, then those who  are\r\n\r\ndesirous  of advertising in good publications  will\r\n\r\nmeet with sonic trouble in future and will hesitate\r\n\r\nto  advertise.

However   well   laws   against    such\r\n\r\npublications,  that  is,  obscene  or  pornographic\r\n\r\npublications,  may be framed, they will  always  be\r\n\r\nopen  to  abuse  by  reactionary  authoritarianism,\r\n\r\nfanatical   puritanism,  official  stupidity,   and\r\n\r\nsensationalism of the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of films, there is a safeguard\r\n\r\nagainst  such  abuses, as there is a  Film  Appeals\r\n\r\nCommittee which can review, on appeal, films banned\r\n\r\nor  cut by the Film Censor. But for books there  is\r\n\r\nno  Board of Appeal, although this Bill allows  for\r\n\r\nan  appeal to be made against the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nController of Publications to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity should now be taken to review and\r\n\r\nimprove  the legislation so that the final decision\r\n\r\nis  not left to one man, but can be made by a Board\r\n\r\nof   Appeal   which   should  take   into   account\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  special needs  of  libraries  or\r\n\r\nrestricted  classes of persons  who  need  to  have\r\n\r\navailable  certain publications in the interest  of\r\n\r\nscholarship or research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, propose that a Board of Appeal be\r\n\r\nset  up  to  review, on appeal, publications  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  declared  morally  undesirable  by  the\r\n\r\nController   of  Publications.  It  may   also   be\r\n\r\nadvisable  to  give the Board power to  review  the\r\n\r\ncategories  of undesirable publications,  that  is,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are undesirable on political  or  on\r\n\r\nmoral   grounds.

I  am  also  of  the  opinion  that  this\r\n\r\nUndesirable  Publications  Bill  is  belated.   The\r\n\r\nreason  for my saying so is that undesirable events\r\n\r\nhad  already  occurred in 1964. We have  made  this\r\n\r\nannouncement so that our people can live  in  peace\r\n\r\nand   can   make  progress.  We  know   there   are\r\n\r\npublications which are trying to destroy the  unity\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  I do not wish to  identify  these\r\n\r\npublications as we already know them.  The  reports\r\n\r\nin  these  publications are not  truthful  and  are\r\n\r\ndesigned    to   mislead   their   readers.    This\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation may lead to the readers having no\r\n\r\nfaith  in  them.  If this Bill had  been  submitted\r\n\r\nbefore  1964,  I believe the undesirable  incidents\r\n\r\nwhich  occurred in 1964 would not have taken place.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I gave my views on this subject  when\r\n\r\nwe  debated on the Budget. The reports or  articles\r\n\r\nin  these publications are not true. We do not wish\r\n\r\nthem  to  be misrepresented or twisted so that  the\r\n\r\npeople  may  be  misled and thus a misunderstanding\r\n\r\ncan  arise. It is our duty to safeguard  the  well-being of our people. Therefore, every article  that\r\n\r\nis  published  must be truthful in order  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout healthy and constructive criticisms from  the\r\n\r\npeople for the progress of our own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I congratulate the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nand  Social  Affairs  on the introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nBill. With the stringent control exercised by  this\r\n\r\nBill,  our  people  will be able to  read  articles\r\n\r\nwhich  can  bring  about healthy  and  constructive\r\n\r\ncriticisms in the interests of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  for  his\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and observations on the Bill.  As  you\r\n\r\nare   aware,   Sir,  in  the  original  Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications  Ordinance,  the  appeal  was  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and it is not our intention to change  it\r\n\r\notherwise.  In  other  Ordinances,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Ordinance, the  Women's  Charter,  the\r\n\r\nWomen's and Girls' Protection Ordinance, the appeal\r\n\r\nis to the Minister and not to the court. There are,\r\n\r\nof  course,  Boards  that make the  final  decision\r\n\r\nwithout   further  reference  to  the  court,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  the decision of the Committee  of  Appeal\r\n\r\nunder  the Cinematograph Films Ordinance.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  final  authority,  after  which  there  is  no\r\n\r\nfurther appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undesirable Publications Ordinance is\r\n\r\ndifferent. As in the case of films, all the members\r\n\r\nof  the  Appeal Committee can view the film at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  but in the case of publications.  Each\r\n\r\nmember of the Appeal Committee must go through  the\r\n\r\nbook  individually. This will result in long delays\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not  desirable. We  are  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nCommittee to advise the Minister on whether certain\r\n\r\nbooks  should be banned, and this should serve  the\r\n\r\npurpose.  It is proposed that the committee  should\r\n\r\ncomprise  five  persons who are  experts.  When  it\r\n\r\noperates, I can assure the hon. Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang  that  it  will  look into  and  consider  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions he has made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform him that great\r\n\r\nliterary  classics are never banned, even  if  they\r\n\r\nare  on  sex.

As  stated\r\n\r\nin  the  Explanatory Statement, the main object  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  to make it unlawful for any  workmen\r\n\r\nengaged  in the very important essential  services,\r\n\r\nnamely, water, gas and electricity services, to  go\r\n\r\non strike at all, and similarly for the employer to\r\n\r\nlock-out any workmen engaged in these services. The\r\n\r\nprohibition by itself would appear to hon.  Members\r\n\r\nto  be  a drastic step in curtailing the rights  of\r\n\r\ntrade unions to go on strike, but recent experience\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  it  necessary  for  the  Government  to  take\r\n\r\npositive measures to ensure that the public are not\r\n\r\nheld to ransom by a few irresponsible elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will recall that in 1961,  when  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  public utility services  went  on\r\n\r\nstrike, British and Singapore Army technicians  had\r\n\r\nto  be brought in to man the essential services, as\r\n\r\nany  failure  in  the  water, electricity  and  gas\r\n\r\nsupplies would not only mean a serious breakdown in\r\n\r\nthe   essentials  of  life,  but  also  result   in\r\n\r\ndangerous  and  serious damage to public  property.\r\n\r\nThe  inexpert handling of electrical machinery  and\r\n\r\nwater  pumping  equipment  and  explosions  by  air\r\n\r\ngetting  into  the  gas main  can  cause  extensive\r\n\r\ndamage  and  havoc  to  the community.  Further,  a\r\n\r\nstrike in these essential services would mean  that\r\n\r\nthe overall economic situation of Singapore and its\r\n\r\neconomic future would be jeopardised. No government\r\n\r\ncan  allow any section of the population  to  cause\r\n\r\nsuch serious and irreparable damage to the country.\r\n\r\nAs these services are part of the vital services of\r\n\r\nthe  country, no strikes will be permitted in these\r\n\r\nareas  which  are already designated  as  protected\r\n\r\nplaces under the security laws of Singapore. For  a\r\n\r\nstrike  must mean that the Government  has  to  use\r\n\r\ntroops  to  carry out the duties of these  workers,\r\n\r\nwhich would, in fact, mean the assumption of powers\r\n\r\nto  break  a  strike through the use  of  uniformed\r\n\r\npersonnel. Members will agree that this  is  highly\r\n\r\nundesirable. Government is not unsympathetic to the\r\n\r\ngenuine  grievances of the workers and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nany  future disputes in the public utility services\r\n\r\nwill  be  resolved by the established machinery  of\r\n\r\nnegotiation, conciliation and arbitration under our\r\n\r\nindustrial relations laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another special feature of the Bill is that no\r\n\r\nstrike  or lock-out shall take place in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  essential services, unless a notice  is\r\n\r\ngiven  at least 14 days before such strike or lock-out,  and such notice will expire at the end of  30\r\n\r\ndays  from  the  date of the notice.  The  existing\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the law are not clear in  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe notice period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the proposed amendments clarify the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Explanatory Statement, the\r\n\r\nproposed amendments provide that no strike or lock-out  shall take place before the date of the strike\r\n\r\nor  lock-out specified in the notice or during  the\r\n\r\npendency   of   certain   proceedings   under   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance, 1960.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, by this Criminal Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  submitted to Parliament today, I observe that\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the trade unionists have been eroded\r\n\r\nby  the  pro-labour government. Before the  present\r\n\r\nruling  Party came to power, we, together with  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement, struggled to put up  a  pro-labour  government.  As  a  result  of  our  common\r\n\r\nstruggle,  we  were  successful.  During  the  1959\r\n\r\nadministration, with the support of the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement,  including that of the nationalist  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement,  we managed to  isolate  the  pro-Communist trade union movement. The members of  the\r\n\r\nnationalist pro-labour movement are those who  work\r\n\r\nin   the  Public  Utilities  Board  and  who   have\r\n\r\nstruggled  hard  to  isolate the  front-line  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement. But now, Mr Speaker, the  workers\r\n\r\nof  the  P.U.B, are not permitted to go  on  strike\r\n\r\nwhen this Bill becomes law. I know the difficulties\r\n\r\nfaced  by  the  Government in their  responsibility\r\n\r\ntowards  the  people when essential workers  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike, because they are responsible for the  well-being  and  livelihood of the people. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  I do not think that the P.U.B, workers  will\r\n\r\ngo  on strike on a matter which is not serious.  If\r\n\r\nit  is on a minor matter, I feel sure they will  be\r\n\r\nprepared to come to a compromise rather than go  on\r\n\r\nstrike. But if it is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious  matter, the Government has power to  refer\r\n\r\nit  to the industrial Arbitration Court which  will\r\n\r\ngive  its findings, in this honourable way, strikes\r\n\r\ncan  be  avoided and this amendment to deter P.U.B.\r\n\r\nworkers from going on strike is not necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some time ago the Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone Board was confronted with a strike by the\r\n\r\nUnion  because the employers refused  to  negotiate\r\n\r\nwith  the Union on its claims for better wages  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service. But before  the  14  days'\r\n\r\nnotice  of strike expired, the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nreferred  the matter to the Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  in  order  to prevent a strike  from  taking\r\n\r\nplace.  If he could avert a strike by the employees\r\n\r\nof   the   Singapore  Telephone  Board,  which   is\r\n\r\ndischarging an essential service, I do not see  why\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of Defence requires these  amendments\r\n\r\nto prevent the essential workers of the P.U.B. from\r\n\r\ngoing on strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  proposes to amend, among other  things,\r\n\r\nsection   23   of   the  Criminal  Law   (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Ordinance, 1955, by stipulating that no\r\n\r\nworkman   employed  in  the  water  services,   gas\r\n\r\nservices  and  electricity  services  shall  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike  or be locked out. The Government  also,  by\r\n\r\nGazette  Notification,  require  workers  who   are\r\n\r\nemployed  in  banking  services,  broadcasting  and\r\n\r\ntelevision services, public bus transport  and  air\r\n\r\nservices, to give 14 days' notice before  they  can\r\n\r\ngo  on  strike. Up to now, there has been  no  such\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I contend that such an\r\n\r\namendment  is uncalled for in view of the  adequacy\r\n\r\nof  the  existing law which provides the Government\r\n\r\nwith   the   right  to  refer  trade  disputes   to\r\n\r\narbitration  if  strike action  in  these  services\r\n\r\nharms   the  interest  of  the  community.  It   is\r\n\r\nappreciated  that the employer of all  the  workers\r\n\r\nengaged  in  the water services, gas  services  and\r\n\r\nelectricity services is the Public Utilities Board,\r\n\r\nwhich is a statutory Board, and which is subject to\r\n\r\npublic control. It may be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nargument  of  the  Government,  in  advocating  the\r\n\r\nabolition  of  strikes  in  these  three  essential\r\n\r\nservices, that the employer of the workmen  engaged\r\n\r\ntherein  is  not likely to exploit the workers  who\r\n\r\nare  so rendered defenceless. While I do agree that\r\n\r\nthis House possesses the means of ensuring that the\r\n\r\nemployer  of  the workmen, from whom the  right  to\r\n\r\nstrike   is  taken  away,  does  not  take   unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the situation, the fact remains  that\r\n\r\nthe  right  to strike has in the past served  as  a\r\n\r\npsychological deterrent to the Board and its senior\r\n\r\nemployees  from  being  too  complacent  in   their\r\n\r\ndealings with their employees. While the Government\r\n\r\nmay justify its proposal by claiming that the right\r\n\r\nto   strike   has   been   abused   and   exercised\r\n\r\nirresponsibly   by  workers  in  the   three   said\r\n\r\nservices,  this  by itself is no justification  for\r\n\r\nthe  total  ban  on strike by the workers  in  such\r\n\r\nservices,  if  the  Government is really  concerned\r\n\r\nwith the possibility that in the future, if it were\r\n\r\nnot  for such proposed ban on strike, the right  to\r\n\r\nstrike   would   be  abused  or  be   irresponsibly\r\n\r\nexercised  by  the workers in the  three  services,\r\n\r\nsuch  a  fear  on  the part of  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nadequately  safeguarded by the relevant  provisions\r\n\r\nof the Trade Disputes Ordinance of 1960; section  3\r\n\r\n(1) thereof reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A strike shall be illegal if -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it has any other object than the furtherance\r\n\r\nof  a  trade  dispute  within  the  trade  or\r\n\r\nindustry  in which the strikers are  engaged;\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it is in furtherance of a trade dispute of\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Industrial Arbitration Court  has\r\n\r\ncognizance; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) it is designed or calculated to coerce the\r\n\r\nGovernment  either directly or by  inflicting\r\n\r\nhardship on the community.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I would have thought  that  the\r\n\r\nprovision of paragraph (c) of section 3 (1) of  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Disputes Ordinance would have taken care  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  fear that the workers  in  these\r\n\r\nthree essential services would utilise the right to\r\n\r\nstrike  by coercing the Government either  directly\r\n\r\nor  by inflicting hardship on the community. If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does really intend to ban strikes  from\r\n\r\nthese three services,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  it  should, as a matter of necessity, provide\r\n\r\nsome more effective system of arbitration than  has\r\n\r\nbeen   provided  under  the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance to resolve disputes which would otherwise\r\n\r\nhave found expression in the form of a strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to say that the present industrial\r\n\r\narbitration  machinery  is not  effective  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of solving industrial disputes effectively\r\n\r\nor  expeditiously. Even in the private sector, with\r\n\r\nfree  recourse to the right of strike, the workers'\r\n\r\nexperience  is that the machinery of the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Courts does not confer on them adequate\r\n\r\nprotection  against  an unscrupulous  employer.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I am not saying that the Government  is  an\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employer, but I must  emphasise  that\r\n\r\nworkers  and management personnel are human  beings\r\n\r\nand that industrial disputes are bound to arise  at\r\n\r\nany   time   in   the   course  of   their   mutual\r\n\r\nrelationship. It must also be remembered  that  the\r\n\r\nstrike weapon, while it serves to lend force to the\r\n\r\nworkers' demands on the employer, also serves as  a\r\n\r\nmeans   of   focusing  attention  on  the  workers'\r\n\r\ngrievances,  whatever they may be. By  taking  away\r\n\r\nsuch a means of bringing the workers' grievances to\r\n\r\nthe  notice of the relevant authorities, it becomes\r\n\r\nmore  imperative  that  the  Government,  which  is\r\n\r\nproposing  this ban on strikes, should  provide  an\r\n\r\nadequate and effective machinery to take the  place\r\n\r\nof  strikes  as  a means of bringing  the  workers'\r\n\r\ngrievances to the attention of such authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest that the Government\r\n\r\nprovide  a more effective system of arbitration  to\r\n\r\nresolve  industrial disputes arising in a situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the  workers have no recourse to the  strike\r\n\r\nweapon.  It  is by no means to be assumed  by  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  I am in favour of the ban  on  strikes\r\n\r\neven  though the ban is limited to the  workers  of\r\n\r\nthe  three  essential services. As  the  Secretary-General  of  the N.T.U.C., my stand is  clear,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  I oppose in principle any ban on  strikes\r\n\r\nexcept in a situation of national emergency when,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the interest of the State and of the citizens as\r\n\r\na  whole,  it  is necessary to ban any strike.  But\r\n\r\nsuch  a  situation  of national  emergency  is  not\r\n\r\npresent  here  today  and I cannot  see  any  other\r\n\r\njustification for the Government's proposal to  ban\r\n\r\nstrikes in these three essential services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support  the  amendment\r\n\r\nBill  which  mainly seeks to prevent any  employees\r\n\r\nfrom  going on strike in the essential services  or\r\n\r\nany  employer from locking out the workers. If  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  essential services have any  disputes,\r\n\r\nthey  must  give 14 days' notice of any  industrial\r\n\r\naction to be taken. No lightning strike or lock-out\r\n\r\nwill be allowed. The essential departments, such as\r\n\r\nthe  Water Department, the Gas Department  and  the\r\n\r\nElectricity  Department of  the  P.U.B.,  are  very\r\n\r\nimportant to the people. So it is necessary to have\r\n\r\nthese provisions set out in the amendment Bill,  as\r\n\r\nthese   essential  services  must  be  manned   and\r\n\r\nmaintained continuously because they are  essential\r\n\r\nto   the   lively-hood  of  the  people   and   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the activities of the industrial and\r\n\r\ncommercial sectors. They are important to  the  two\r\n\r\nmillion people of Singapore. So both the management\r\n\r\nand  employees  must not take any  reckless  action\r\n\r\nagainst the interests of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also in support of the punishment to be\r\n\r\nmeted  out  to  those  who  have  contravened   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this amendment Bill. It is  only  in\r\n\r\nthis way that we can ensure the enforcement of this\r\n\r\nBill  which is beneficial to the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nnation  as  a  whole. I do not think there  is  any\r\n\r\nprovision in the Bill that is against the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  which  is industrial  peace  with\r\n\r\njustice,  and  it does not cast any  doubt  on  the\r\n\r\nsincerity  of  the Government as a  fair  and  just\r\n\r\nemployer and that it is a pro-labour government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a worker wants to go on strike, he should give\r\n\r\n14  days' notice. This does not negative his  right\r\n\r\nto go on strike. One must be very clear about this.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whatever chaos that may arise out  of  a\r\n\r\nlightning strike will affect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  whole nation. It is something like pulling one\r\n\r\nhair and your whole body will quiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel that the introduction of this Bill is\r\n\r\nnot a measure aimed at suppressing the workers.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  those anti-national unions  will,  by  all\r\n\r\nmeans,  try to distort the intention of this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  is not surprising, of course. But in the case\r\n\r\nof  the democratic labour movement, in the form  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Trades Union Congress, we  must  make\r\n\r\nthem  realise the true intention of the  Government\r\n\r\nthat is embodied in this Bill. They must understand\r\n\r\nthat it is introduced to safeguard the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  nation  without  any prejudice  to  the  basic\r\n\r\nrights of the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that this Bill will not be abused\r\n\r\nand  that the Minister will assure this House  that\r\n\r\nthe   Government   will   be   very   cautious   in\r\n\r\nimplementing its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nobject  of  this  Bill  is  certainly  to  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that if employers want to  have  it  out\r\n\r\nwith  the workers, the workers will not suffer.  If\r\n\r\nit  is  really the intention of the Bill to protect\r\n\r\npublic  safety, the Government has already provided\r\n\r\na building wherein the N.T.U.C. is housed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly. I regret to say that I am obliged to\r\n\r\nmention  my  friends who are in  the  N.T.U.C. and\r\n\r\nwhose responsibility is to educate the workers,  to\r\n\r\nmake  them understand the Bill thoroughly,  and  to\r\n\r\nadvise the Government. If the N.T.U.C. cannot  give\r\n\r\nits  co-operation to the management,  who  are  the\r\n\r\nemployers,   and  the  workers,  a   dispute   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  arise  between them.  The  role  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. is  to educate the workers  so  that  the\r\n\r\nstrike  weapon  is  used only against  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers,  and  not to use it  to  cause  hardship\r\n\r\namong  the  community or to make unfair demands  on\r\n\r\nemployers or the Government. This is the weapon  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of the workers. An example is the police\r\n\r\nofficer.  He is given a weapon but not to shoot  at\r\n\r\nwrong-doers if his own life is not in danger.  This\r\n\r\nweapon is for self-defence, and, as the hon. Member\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid, the strike weapon should be similarly used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Government is pro-labour. We\r\n\r\nhave  always implemented this policy. When  we  say\r\n\r\n\"pro-labour\", we must ponder awhile and  look  back\r\n\r\nto  1959. Since then how many labour disputes  have\r\n\r\nbeen   resolved  by  establishing  two   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration    Courts,   in   addition    to    the\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers exercised by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and also the advice of the N.T.U.C.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to labour this point, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nbut  what I wish to say is that the leaders of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Daily-Rated Employees' Union, who are my own\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  are sincere in their struggle.  But  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the leadership of the N.T.U.C. is  not\r\n\r\npositive  enough to say whether this can or  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  done.  When the N.T.U.C. receive  a  complaint,\r\n\r\nthey must convene a general meeting or refer it  to\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court. If we  allow  an\r\n\r\naffiliated union to accuse us, then it follows that\r\n\r\nthe  other  affiliated  unions  will  take  similar\r\n\r\naction.  I  think that is not the proper course  of\r\n\r\naction to take. Before an issue is settled, we must\r\n\r\nbe  certain  that that issue will help the  workers\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been allegations that the Government\r\n\r\nis  anti-Indian and that the N.T.U.C. is also anti-Indian.  These  are very serious  allegations.  The\r\n\r\nfact  could be that the N.T.U.C. could not  give  a\r\n\r\nproper  picture  to  its  affiliates  of  what  its\r\n\r\nstruggle  is. If the responsibility of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nis  really to guide the workers in order to  uplift\r\n\r\ntheir  living  standard, I am quite sure  that  its\r\n\r\nstruggle will be a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the problem of raising the living\r\n\r\nstandard  of  the members of the Public Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees'    Union   arose    two    years    ago.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am not a member of  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  the  N.T.U.C. The N.T.U.C. has  not\r\n\r\nresolved  this problem. It has not used its  powers\r\n\r\neffectively  so  that the living  standard  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers in the Public Daily-Rated Employees'  Union\r\n\r\ncan  be  improved. The leaders of the N.T.U.C. and\r\n\r\nthe   affiliated  union  leaders  have  failed   to\r\n\r\ndischarge their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduties to see that this issue could become a bigger\r\n\r\nissue so that whatever increase the Government  has\r\n\r\nto  pay  would  be commensurate with the  work  the\r\n\r\nworkers  perform. If I am allowed to speak on  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  I can go on speaking for two days and  two\r\n\r\nnights, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the trade union movement there are\r\n\r\nthree  problems  as  explained  by  the  Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To use the strike weapon in good faith;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To use it as a threat;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To use it to topple the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be able to distinguish between these\r\n\r\nthree  factors.  If  we choose to  use  the  strike\r\n\r\nweapon to raise the living standard of the workers,\r\n\r\nwe can use it by all means, no matter what happens.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to fear because the action we take\r\n\r\nis  in  line with our own principles. That is  all,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this Bill has been brought  up  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I  am  doubtful   whether   it   is\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  bring it up  at  this  time.  This\r\n\r\nGovernment  won the elections in 1959  mainly  with\r\n\r\nthe  support  of  the workers.  But  it  is  slowly\r\n\r\ncurtailing their interests. If we want to make this\r\n\r\ncountry prosperous, we will have to look after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the workers. If we go on making  laws\r\n\r\nand  ignoring the workers who are the  backbone  of\r\n\r\nthe country, we cannot bring them to the forefront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not blaming the Government for making\r\n\r\nlaws,  but  we  have to take the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nimplementing  them. We have to bring  in  laws,  or\r\n\r\notherwise  undesirable things will happen.  But  we\r\n\r\nhave to think of ways of how to bring the laws into\r\n\r\nplay. This amendment Bill will make slaves and also\r\n\r\nprisoners  of  the  workers, as the  Government  is\r\n\r\ntaking  away their rights. If we go on doing  this,\r\n\r\nwe will regret it in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  workers are citizens and they are also serving\r\n\r\nthe   country,  and  we  have  to  give  them  some\r\n\r\nprivileges. If we do not give them privileges,  can\r\n\r\nwe  imagine  what they will think  of  us?  Why  do\r\n\r\nstrikes  take place? If the workers are not getting\r\n\r\nthe privileges they want, there will be strikes. If\r\n\r\nthey  get them, there is no need of any strike  and\r\n\r\nthere  is no need for such laws. They will be  more\r\n\r\nangry if we bring in laws like this. They will  not\r\n\r\nbe  happy  at all. There, is a law which says  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be 14 days' notice of a strike.  What\r\n\r\nwill  happen  if  they strike after  the  14  days'\r\n\r\nnotice? What will happen if they go on strike after\r\n\r\nserving  such notice? The Government has to prepare\r\n\r\nfor such an, eventuality. So I think this is not  a\r\n\r\nsuitable time and I am not supporting this Bill at\r\n\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to say a few words in support of the Bill. The\r\n\r\nPublic Daily-Rated Employees' Federation Union,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  the  gas,  water  and  electricity  workers'\r\n\r\nunions  are affiliated, has recently shown  by  its\r\n\r\naction that it is a highly irresponsible union. The\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the union recently called out  workers\r\n\r\nemployed in the Cleansing Department in an  illegal\r\n\r\nstrike in furtherance of certain disputes of  which\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court had already taken\r\n\r\ncognizance, and in spite of the advice given by the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. We cannot allow such irresponsible  unions\r\n\r\nto  call wild-cat strikes in the vital services  of\r\n\r\nthe  country.  Water, gas and electricity  services\r\n\r\nare  vital  to the day-to-day life of  our  people.\r\n\r\nThese services must be provided, and continue to be\r\n\r\nprovided  to the public at all times; I repeat,  at\r\n\r\nall   times.  Without  these  services,  the  whole\r\n\r\ncommunity  will  suffer and  the  survival  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry will be seriously affected. We cannot allow\r\n\r\nsuch  things to happen at this very vital stage  of\r\n\r\nour development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.

As a matter of fact, this  is  well\r\n\r\nknown  to all members of the public, including  the\r\n\r\nunion leaders. The workers were more interested  in\r\n\r\ntreble pay by working on Sundays and holidays,  and\r\n\r\nfor this purpose they absented themselves from work\r\n\r\non normal working days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been instances of workers\r\n\r\nbelonging  to this union who went out to intimidate\r\n\r\nthose   members  of  the  public  who  had   lodged\r\n\r\ncomplaints  against them for malingering.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  union  was fully aware of such happenings,  it\r\n\r\ndid   not  take  any  positive  action  to  rectify\r\n\r\nmatters.  If  the  union were, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nresponsible,  it would have co-operated  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the workers did a fair day's work for a  fair\r\n\r\nday's wage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan has said\r\n\r\nthat the Government, in introducing an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Bill,  has\r\n\r\nbecome anti-union. This cannot be true in the  face\r\n\r\nof  the  Government's contributions to the building\r\n\r\nup  of  a solid and strong trade union movement  in\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Anson, I would say that\r\n\r\nGovernment is definitely not unsympathetic  to  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  workers. But it must be  recognised\r\n\r\nthat a strike is a weapon which should only be used\r\n\r\nas a last resort, when all means of settlement of a\r\n\r\ntrade  dispute has failed. Strikes do  not  resolve\r\n\r\ntrade  disputes.  We  have a system  of  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations in Singapore which ensures a fair deal to\r\n\r\nthe  workers. Our system of voluntary negotiations,\r\n\r\nconciliation and arbitration is provided for in the\r\n\r\nlaws  of  our  land  to ensure that  no  worker  is\r\n\r\nexploited. There should be no reason for workers to\r\n\r\ngo  on  strike  and this is even  more  so  in  the\r\n\r\nessential  and  vital services. The prohibition  of\r\n\r\nstrikes in the public utility services should not,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\ntherefore, adversely affect the rights of  workers.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  workers in these services  will  be\r\n\r\nprotected  so  that  they will  not  be  misled  or\r\n\r\nexploited by irresponsible elements who control the\r\n\r\ndestiny  of their unions. It is the duty  of  every\r\n\r\nloyal  citizen  to  see that our  survival  is  not\r\n\r\nthreatened  by irresponsible elements. We  have  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  not only is our economy kept going,  but\r\n\r\nalso ensure that it expands. Water, electricity and\r\n\r\ngas  are  vital necessities of life, and Government\r\n\r\nhas  to ensure that these basic necessities are not\r\n\r\ndenied to the people. The prohibition of strikes in\r\n\r\nthese  services  is  to  ensure  that  these  vital\r\n\r\nservices  are available at all times and  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  are not held to ransom by the irresponsible\r\n\r\nacts  of  a few union leaders who abuse freedom  of\r\n\r\naction in a democratic society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bras Basah has said that the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  refer disputes to arbitration  under\r\n\r\nthe  present legislation. I would like to ask  him,\r\n\r\ndoes  he not know, as I have mentioned earlier,  of\r\n\r\nthe  recent case of the wild-cat strike  called  by\r\n\r\none  union  even  though the Minister  had  already\r\n\r\nreferred the dispute to arbitration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have included the banking services as an\r\n\r\nessential  service  because  banking  is   a   very\r\n\r\nimportant  financial institution in the economy  of\r\n\r\nthe  country. Of late the Singapore Bank  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  has  shown  signs  of  irresponsibility   by\r\n\r\nsuddenly calling on its members to work to rule, to\r\n\r\nrefuse overtime work and even to go on strike  over\r\n\r\nminor  issues.  These have caused  disruptions  not\r\n\r\nonly  in the bank services but also jammed  up  the\r\n\r\nclearing of cheques, and this gives Singapore a bad\r\n\r\nimage.  This  union has on more than  one  occasion\r\n\r\ntaken  industrial  action to pressurise  the  banks\r\n\r\ninto  giving  in to their demands at  a  time  when\r\n\r\nbanking is doing its best business, such as  before\r\n\r\ncertain festivals like the Chinese New Year.  These\r\n\r\nactions are highly deplorable because they not only\r\n\r\naffect the banks themselves but also members of the\r\n\r\npublic   and  the  economy  of  the  country.   The\r\n\r\ninclusion  of the banking services as an  essential\r\n\r\nservice  does  not  prevent the union  from  taking\r\n\r\nstrike action.

Public  bus  transport  is  very  essential\r\n\r\nespecially to the thousands of school children  and\r\n\r\noffice workers who depend on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards air services, Singapore is at the\r\n\r\ncross-roads    of   international   air    traffic.\r\n\r\nMalaysia/Singapore Airlines is providing ground and\r\n\r\ncatering  facilities for many airlines  and  it  is\r\n\r\nessential that these services are not disrupted  by\r\n\r\nsudden strike action by the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the few\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have participated in the debate  have\r\n\r\nraised  the  point, firstly, that by amending  this\r\n\r\nBill  we  have  gone  contrary  to  our  pro-labour\r\n\r\npolicy,  and,  secondly, that this  amendment  Bill\r\n\r\ndenies  the  workers the right to strike.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if the Government had not devised\r\n\r\na  pro-labour  policy, I am sure there  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen   much   squabbling  between   employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees  during the period while we  are  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Secondly, we know that in the  country\r\n\r\nthe workers constitute a majority of the population\r\n\r\nand  that  they  have  played  their  part  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interests  and they should  therefore  be\r\n\r\nduly  rewarded. In order to do that, the Government\r\n\r\nhas,  together  with  the  trade  unions  and   the\r\n\r\nemployers,  discussed and agreed to  formulate  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Ordinance. Through this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nOrdinance we hope to maintain industrial peace with\r\n\r\njustice.  But, unfortunately, as far as the  Public\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated   Employees   Federation    Union    is\r\n\r\nconcerned, they have not maintained the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  industrial peace  with  justice.  They\r\n\r\nhave  always  tried to hold the whole community  to\r\n\r\nransom  in  order to get something  for  their  own\r\n\r\nselfish  interest.  We  agree  that  if  they  have\r\n\r\ngenuine  grievances there is machinery for them  to\r\n\r\nseek redress. But, unfortunately, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas  you have heard what the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  for Labour has  said,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment try to improve certain services so  that\r\n\r\nthe whole community can benefit from them, they are\r\n\r\nfrustrated  by  the threat of a  strike.  A  recent\r\n\r\nexample of the irresponsibility of the Union is the\r\n\r\nstrike  carried out by the Cleansing Workers Union.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Member for Anson has said just  now,  even\r\n\r\nwith  the  amendment  to the  principal  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nwhich  requires the unions to serve 14 days' notice\r\n\r\nbefore  a  strike can take place,  the  matter  has\r\n\r\nstill  to  be  resolved. That is  exactly  why  the\r\n\r\nconciliation  and arbitration machinery  is  there.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  the  Union is responsible  and  has\r\n\r\ngenuine grievances, I do not see why it should take\r\n\r\nthe  trouble to call a strike as a result of  which\r\n\r\nnot  only the workers have to suffer but the  whole\r\n\r\ncountry  has to suffer. So if it is responsible,  I\r\n\r\nwould say we do not have to make this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the trade unions under the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances should not confine themselves\r\n\r\nto their narrow sectional interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been mentioned that the Government and our\r\n\r\nParty  have  associated with the workers  and  have\r\n\r\nbecome  what  it  is today. But at that  time,  the\r\n\r\nsituation was different. We were not an independent\r\n\r\ncountry. We were still striving for political power\r\n\r\nso  that  we  could  run our own  country  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  our people. In the new situation  now,\r\n\r\nthe  workers have their role to play and they  must\r\n\r\nabove  all  see that they contribute to  the  whole\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Of  course, the Government  can  simply\r\n\r\nmeet the demands of the unions. But we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  trustees of the public and, therefore, we have\r\n\r\nto  look after the interests of the whole community\r\n\r\nand  not a section of it. If we are to appease  the\r\n\r\nunions,  we  can,  of  course, simply  resolve  the\r\n\r\nmatter by conceding to their demands. But there  is\r\n\r\na  limit  to  this. We are a Republic and  have  no\r\n\r\nnatural resources. All of us know that we depend on\r\n\r\nour  human  resources  to  survive.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nindustries do not expand and the economic situation\r\n\r\ndoes not improve, not only will the workers not get\r\n\r\nany  improvement in their terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice, but they themselves will probably have  no\r\n\r\nwork,  or their dependants and friends will not  be\r\n\r\nable  to find jobs too. Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe\r\n\r\nwe are not dictatorial in our labour policy, but  I\r\n\r\nhave  just  mentioned that in order to  refute  the\r\n\r\nallegation  that ours is an anti-labour policy  and\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  denying the workers their  right  to\r\n\r\nstrike.  I  believe no one will swallow  the  false\r\n\r\nallegations made by my few colleagues just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nclause 2 is about essential services such as water,\r\n\r\ngas  and  electricity services. But sub-clause  (2)\r\n\r\nmakes  no  mention of the other essential services.\r\n\r\nIn   Government's  view,  how  many  categories  of\r\n\r\nessential services are there? Perhaps, first, there\r\n\r\nare  the  three  which are mentioned in  sub-clause\r\n\r\n(1), i.e., water, gas and electricity services;  in\r\n\r\nsub-clause (2) are the second category of essential\r\n\r\nservices.  Is  there a third category of  essential\r\n\r\nservices?  Earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour has stated that, because of\r\n\r\nthe wild-cat strike carried out by the Public Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers' Union, the Government  has\r\n\r\nbrought  in  amendments to the Bill  that  we  have\r\n\r\nbefore  us  today. Why is it that  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities Board are victimised on account of\r\n\r\nthe  strike  carried out by the Public  Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nCleansing Workers' Union?

This has resulted from an Agreement\r\n\r\nmade  between the Governments of these territories,\r\n\r\nwhich Agreement also provides that the Board should\r\n\r\ncease  to be the currency issuing authority  should\r\n\r\nanyone of the Participating Governments give notice\r\n\r\nto that effect. In December 1964, the Government of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaysia lodged such a notice and\r\n\r\nas  a result the Board will cease to issue currency\r\n\r\nin  June  this  year.  After separation,  Singapore\r\n\r\nembarked   on   negotiations  with  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  regarding the use of a common  currency\r\n\r\nin  these  two territories. The House  will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  at  a  sitting  on the 26th  August,  I  gave\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the  negotiations and outlined  events\r\n\r\nleading  to  the announcement made on  17th  August\r\n\r\nthat an agreement for a common currency and banking\r\n\r\nsystem  could not be reached between the  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysian  Governments.

I  further  said that  the  new  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar will \"at all times be backed 100 per cent by\r\n\r\ngold  or  foreign exchange assets and  will  remain\r\n\r\nfully  convertible\". The provisions of the Currency\r\n\r\nBill   now  before  the  House  fulfil  both  these\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to take the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill clause by clause and to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House to the more salient  features\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the establishment of a\r\n\r\nCurrency   Board  to  be  called  \"the   Board   of\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Currency, Singapore\". The  purpose\r\n\r\nof  the Board is to issue currency notes and coins.\r\n\r\nIn  clause  4, the Board is made a body  corporate,\r\n\r\nwith  its head office in Singapore, and with  power\r\n\r\nto  appoint  agents  and correspondents.  Clause  5\r\n\r\nenables  the  Board  to  employ  officers  for  its\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Board is given in clause\r\n\r\n6,  which  provides  for a  Board  of  six  members\r\n\r\ncomprising the Chairman, who shall be the  Minister\r\n\r\nresponsible  for Finance, and five  other  members,\r\n\r\nincluding a Deputy Chairman, to be appointed by the\r\n\r\nPresident. The Deputy Chairman will be a  full-time\r\n\r\nofficial   and  will  become  the  chief  executive\r\n\r\nofficer  of the Board. The other four members  will\r\n\r\ninclude representatives of local and foreign  banks\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, so that what we do in the Board will\r\n\r\nbe known not only in Singapore but abroad as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is obliged by law to meet at least once\r\n\r\na  year, and on receipt of a request from at  least\r\n\r\ntwo  members of the Board, the Chairman is  obliged\r\n\r\nto call a meeting as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  quorum for a meeting is three members. It will\r\n\r\nbe  noted that the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman\r\n\r\nhave  two votes each, whilst the other four members\r\n\r\neach  has  one vote. In an equality of  votes,  the\r\n\r\nChairman  would have the casting vote. It  will  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  be  argued that this system of votes  places\r\n\r\nthe  balance  of par in the hands of  the  official\r\n\r\nmembers.  It  is  our  belief,  however,  that  the\r\n\r\nstructure of the Board allowing for appointment  of\r\n\r\nfour  members from the private sector will  provide\r\n\r\nfor the maximum expression and balance of interests\r\n\r\nbefore decisions could be taken. However, when  and\r\n\r\nwhere  there is a genuine difference of opinion  or\r\n\r\nof  judgment  among members of  the  Board,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   for  the  Government,  in   the   wider\r\n\r\ninterests  of the nation, to be able  to  make  the\r\n\r\nultimate  decision with the use of  the  Chairman's\r\n\r\ncasting  vote.  Thus,  it  is  provided  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  members, i.e., the Chairman and  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman,  will together have four  votes  and  the\r\n\r\nother  four  members will together  have  the  same\r\n\r\nnumber  of votes with the Chairman having a casting\r\n\r\nvote in case of an equality of votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8 are listed the conditions under which\r\n\r\nmembers    of    the   Board   are    automatically\r\n\r\ndisqualified. In clause 9 are outlined  obligations\r\n\r\nof  Board  members in deliberations  of  the  Board\r\n\r\nwhere the member has an interest. Clause 10 ensures\r\n\r\nthat members and employees of the Board do not make\r\n\r\nuse  of  information they acquire in the course  of\r\n\r\ntheir  functions for their own private use  or  for\r\n\r\npurposes  other than for the performance  of  their\r\n\r\nduties under this Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 establishes the unit of currency for\r\n\r\nSingapore which will be called the Singapore dollar\r\n\r\nand which will be divided into 100 cents. In clause\r\n\r\n12  is stated the par value of the Singapore dollar\r\n\r\nwhich  will be 0.290299 grammes of fine gold.  This\r\n\r\nis  equivalent to 2s. 4d, in sterling. It  will  be\r\n\r\nseen,   therefore,  that  the  par  value  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar will be the same as the par  value\r\n\r\nof our present dollar. In clause 13, it is provided\r\n\r\nthat   on  and  after  12th  June,  unless  validly\r\n\r\nprovided   for,   all   monetary   obligations   or\r\n\r\ntransactions in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  shall  be  deemed to  be  expressed  and\r\n\r\nrecorded and settled in the Singapore dollar.  This\r\n\r\nis  to  avoid confusion. Clause 14 gives the  Board\r\n\r\nthe sole right to issue currency notes and coins in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The legal tender status of these  notes\r\n\r\nand  coins is any amount for notes; and for  coins,\r\n\r\nup  to  an amount not exceeding $10 in the case  of\r\n\r\ncoins  of denominations of 50 cents and above;  and\r\n\r\nup  to  an amount not exceeding $2 in the  case  of\r\n\r\ncoins of a lower denomination. These provisions arc\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  those  in the present  Currency  Board\r\n\r\nsystem. Sub-clauses (3) and (4) of this clause  are\r\n\r\ntransitional provisions, providing that  the  notes\r\n\r\nand  coins  of  the  present Currency  Board  shall\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be legal tender in Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\namounts as mentioned above until demonetised.  Such\r\n\r\ndemonetisation  will require the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident and has to be published in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill ensures that the new\r\n\r\nSingapore  currency notes and coins are  fully  and\r\n\r\nautomatically  convertible into sterling.  This  is\r\n\r\nidentical  with the provisions to be found  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  Currency Board system. Clause 17  provides\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board may at its discretion  redeem  and\r\n\r\nissue  currency  notes and coins against  gold  and\r\n\r\nother  foreign currencies. In clause 18  are  spelt\r\n\r\nout the details of how procedures of redemption and\r\n\r\nissues  of  currency  notes and  coins  are  to  be\r\n\r\neffected by the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 23, 24 and 25 are detailed the backing\r\n\r\nand  types of assets that will be held by the Board\r\n\r\nas a backing for the currency it has issued. Clause\r\n\r\n23  sets up a Fund to be called the Currency  Fund.\r\n\r\nThe  assets  of the Fund form the backing  for  the\r\n\r\ncurrency  issued  by the Board. The  provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause 25 (3) ensure that the value of the Fund  is\r\n\r\nequivalent to the face value of the currency issued\r\n\r\nby the Board, i.e., there is 100 per cent cover for\r\n\r\nevery  Singapore  dollar  issued.  Further,  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  that  the  Fund  shall  consist  of   all\r\n\r\nexternal  assets, the items of which are listed  in\r\n\r\nclause 24. It will be seen that, apart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  sterling, the Board is also empowered to hold\r\n\r\nother  foreign  assets and therefore  have  a  more\r\n\r\ndiversified portfolio of investments.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  compared  with  the  present  position\r\n\r\nwhere only sterling assets are held. It should also\r\n\r\nbe  noted  that there are no provisions  whatsoever\r\n\r\nfor  a  fiduciary issue. Put simply,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  a fiduciary issue means the issue of currency\r\n\r\nwith Singapore Government securities as backing and\r\n\r\nrepresents Government's borrowing from the Currency\r\n\r\nFund.  This,  I may remind the House,  is  an  even\r\n\r\nstricter  provision  than has  been  found  in  our\r\n\r\npresent  currency system which allows  the  present\r\n\r\nBoard to have a fiduciary issue of $300 million. In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  provisions of  clause  25  (3)  and\r\n\r\nclause  26 guarantee the 100 per cent cover as  any\r\n\r\ndeficiency  in the assets of the Currency  Fund  is\r\n\r\nautomatically  charged  to the  Consolidated  Fund.\r\n\r\nThus  it will be seen that the Singapore dollar  is\r\n\r\nat all times backed 100 per cent by foreign assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 28 to 31 are miscellaneous provisions.\r\n\r\nClause  28 provides for the financial year  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard,  which will be the calendar year. Clause  29\r\n\r\nprovides  that the accounts of the Board  shall  be\r\n\r\naudited  by  the  Director  of  Audit.  Clause   30\r\n\r\nrequires  the  annual accounts and  report  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  to  be  transmitted  to  the  President  and\r\n\r\nthereafter published in the Gazette and laid before\r\n\r\nParliament. The Board is also required to make  Out\r\n\r\nquarterly  returns of its currency notes and  coins\r\n\r\nin  circulation for publication in the Gazette  and\r\n\r\nto   publish  half-yearly  statements  showing  the\r\n\r\nliquid  portion of its Fund and the assets  of  the\r\n\r\nFund. Thus every member of the public will be in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to know and verify for himself the  value\r\n\r\nand worth of the Singapore dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 32 to 35 are transitional and repeal\r\n\r\nprovisions.  Clause 32 gives legal status  to  acts\r\n\r\nperformed by the Government on behalf of the  Board\r\n\r\nprior  to  its establishment. In clause 34,  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  that the notes and coins of  the  present\r\n\r\nCurrency  Board shall be exchanged at par  for  the\r\n\r\nnew Board's notes and coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Mr Speaker, Sir, to add in\r\n\r\nconclusion that the Bill now before the  House  has\r\n\r\nbeen  drafted in consultation with the  Association\r\n\r\nof   Banks   in   Singapore  and   Malaysia.   This\r\n\r\nAssociation  was  formed  when  Singapore  was   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and still represents banks in Singapore.\r\n\r\nMany  of  the Association's suggestions  have  been\r\n\r\naccepted  and  incorporated in  the  Bill.  It  now\r\n\r\nremains   for   me   to  record  the   Government's\r\n\r\nappreciation of the careful and detailed manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich the Association has contributed in finalising\r\n\r\nthe Bill, which continues with a system, albeit old-fashioned  to some, but which has given us  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  strongest and most stable currencies  you  can\r\n\r\nfind  anywhere. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are loath  now\r\n\r\nto  relinquish a method of currency issue which has\r\n\r\nstood us in good stead for so long. But if and when\r\n\r\nwe   find   it  imperative  to  make  changes   and\r\n\r\namendments  to  the law in order to cope  with  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  complexities  and  sophistication  of  the\r\n\r\nmonetary  system, we will not hesitate  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for  the  immediate  future  we   believe\r\n\r\nconfidence in the value of the Singapore dollar can\r\n\r\nand  will  be  retained by a  continuation  of  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Board system with 100 per cent backing and\r\n\r\nwithout any fiduciary issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There are no  precedents  to  fall\r\n\r\nback  upon. When one thinks of what elements should\r\n\r\nbe  taken  into  account in  framing  a  meaningful\r\n\r\ndefence policy for Singapore, one has to begin from\r\n\r\nfirst principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A useful starting point is to ask oneself, why\r\n\r\nbother  about defending Singapore at all? I am  not\r\n\r\nbeing  facetious in asking this question, for there\r\n\r\nare people, laymen as well as experts, who say that\r\n\r\nwe  should  not. They tell you that the  island  is\r\n\r\nquite  indefensible, and if there  is  a  sustained\r\n\r\nmajor  attack upon it, it is unlikely that, without\r\n\r\nmajor  assistance from outside, Singapore can  hold\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, excellent reasons why we\r\n\r\nshould  bother  about defence. I believe  that  the\r\n\r\npeople who hold the contrary view are mistaken. For\r\n\r\nthe  logical  conclusion drawn from  their  premise\r\n\r\nmust be that Singapore should revert to a colony or\r\n\r\na   satellite  of  whoever  wishes  to  afford   it\r\n\r\nprotection.  If you are in a completely  vulnerable\r\n\r\nposition, anyone disposed to do so can hold you  to\r\n\r\nransom  and  life  for you will  then  become  very\r\n\r\ntiresome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it to be wrong to believe that there\r\n\r\nis  nothing we can do or should do about  defending\r\n\r\nourselves,  even though we cannot achieve  complete\r\n\r\ninvulnerability by our unaided efforts. In a sense,\r\n\r\neven the larger countries of the world today, other\r\n\r\nthan  the  nuclear super powers, are  indefensible.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, none of the European States can hope\r\n\r\nto  survive  a  nuclear attack by the Soviet  Union\r\n\r\neither  singly or in combination. Yet this has  not\r\n\r\nprevented them from spending enormous sums of money\r\n\r\nin defence. The two nuclear super powers have found\r\n\r\nthemselves paralysed in a balance of terror and yet\r\n\r\nboth  continue  to  devote  enormous  resources  to\r\n\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot but regret all this - that the keenest\r\n\r\nscientific  minds today are devoted to  discovering\r\n\r\nand  developing  more  effective  methods  of  mass\r\n\r\ndestruction rather than trying to bring about  more\r\n\r\nhuman  happiness and progress -- but  that  is  the\r\n\r\nworld  as  we  find it today, and for small  States\r\n\r\nlike ours, we have to accept the position as it is,\r\n\r\nnot as we would like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not the smallest of the independent\r\n\r\nStates,  nor  is  it  the  poorest.  One   of   the\r\n\r\nunexpected developments of the post-war  world  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  proliferation of small States consequent\r\n\r\non the process if decolonisation. Especially in the\r\n\r\nlast  ten years, large numbers of new States, often\r\n\r\nwith  artificial boundaries, small populations  and\r\n\r\ndubious  economies,  have come into  existence.  If\r\n\r\ntheir  present position is uncertain, their  future\r\n\r\nprospects are even more doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small States are likely to be a great source of\r\n\r\ntrouble  in  this world if they cannot  look  after\r\n\r\nthemselves.  If  the management of  their  domestic\r\n\r\naffairs  is  so  bad  as to invite  civil  war  and\r\n\r\ndisorder,  there  is always the  risk  that  larger\r\n\r\nStates  may  be  tempted to intervene.  Where  this\r\n\r\nhappens  to  a small State situated in a  strategic\r\n\r\narea,  as,  for instance, South Vietnam, the  great\r\n\r\nsuper  powers may get mixed up and the risk  arises\r\n\r\nof  escalation to something more dangerous  than  a\r\n\r\nlocal  conflict. Therefore, unstable, badly managed\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoorly  defended small States pose a threat to  the\r\n\r\nsecurity and peace of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, if small States can manage\r\n\r\ntheir  affairs efficiently and can raise sufficient\r\n\r\ndefence   forces   to  deter  others   from   risky\r\n\r\nadventures  by making them costly, then they  would\r\n\r\nadd  to  the  stability and security of  the  whole\r\n\r\nregion.  The survival of small States within  their\r\n\r\noriginal  territorial  boundaries  has  today  much\r\n\r\ngreater  prospects of success than one  would  have\r\n\r\nthought  from a cursory view of the situation.  For\r\n\r\nthe  two  nuclear  super powers apparently  are  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  freezing  existing  boundaries  as  one\r\n\r\nmethod  of  reducing  the  danger  of  nuclear  war\r\n\r\nbetween themselves by eliminating any temptation to\r\n\r\nbe  involved  in  quarrels  between  other  nation-states.   Where  a  small  State  is  strategically\r\n\r\nsituated, as Singapore is, it is important that  it\r\n\r\nshould  maintain adequate defence forces.  It  goes\r\n\r\nwithout saying that the real security which we want\r\n\r\ncan be found, not by our unaided efforts alone, but\r\n\r\nin  an  alliance  with others. In  the  long  term,\r\n\r\nSingapore should work towards the establishment  of\r\n\r\nsome kind of regional defence arrangement, possibly\r\n\r\nwithin  a larger international framework.  In  this\r\n\r\nkind of regional defence alliance, we are likely to\r\n\r\nbe a more valuable partner and hence can exert more\r\n\r\ninfluence, if we can make a defence contribution of\r\n\r\nsome  significance, rather than if we  were  to  be\r\n\r\nutterly dependent on the arms of other States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect to our defence effort.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  contribution it can  make  to  nation-building.  Nothing  creates  loyalty  and  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  more  speedily and  more  thoroughly\r\n\r\nthan participation in defence and membership of the\r\n\r\narmed forces. This has been the experience of other\r\n\r\ncountries; there is no reason why it will not  hold\r\n\r\ntrue  in  Singapore. The nation-building aspect  of\r\n\r\ndefence   will   be   more   significant   if   its\r\n\r\nparticipation is spread over all strata of society.\r\n\r\nThis  is  possible only with some kind of  national\r\n\r\nservice.  If we were to depend only on  a  standing\r\n\r\narmy  of  professionals, then we would get so  many\r\n\r\nsoldiers and no more. The civilians remain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspectators outside the orbit of  the  defence\r\n\r\nforces except for the small number who take part as\r\n\r\npart-time soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important side to the nation-building process\r\n\r\nis  that  there are not many members of our  monied\r\n\r\nand   intellectual  elite  who  have  grasped   the\r\n\r\nelementary point that their status and position and\r\n\r\nwealth can be justified and maintained only if they\r\n\r\nundertake  a responsibility in the defence  of  the\r\n\r\nnation consistent with their position. In a society\r\n\r\nlike  Britain where class distinctions  are  strong\r\n\r\nand  traditional, you will find  that  up  to  very\r\n\r\nrecently  it has been the ruling class, the  landed\r\n\r\naristocracy,  who  have supplied the  military  and\r\n\r\nnaval commanders, with whose exploits every school-boy  in  our English language schools is  doubtless\r\n\r\nfamiliar.  The  British  ruling  class  has   never\r\n\r\nabdicated its right to govern through unwillingness\r\n\r\nto bear arms on behalf of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours, of course, is a different kind of society\r\n\r\nwith     many    regrettable    weaknesses.     Our\r\n\r\nintelligentsia and wealthy citizens would  do  well\r\n\r\nto  read  that  part of Plato's \"Republic\"  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the inevitable decline of oligarchies of rich\r\n\r\nmen  whose sons are spoilt by easy living and whose\r\n\r\nflabbiness  becomes obvious to  the  citizens  whom\r\n\r\nthey govern, so that they, the citizens, eventually\r\n\r\ndecide  to  take over power from them  and  deprive\r\n\r\nthem  both of their wealth and their positions.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  a  coincidence that sons  of  the  British\r\n\r\nelite, as part of their classical education in  the\r\n\r\npublic schools, are taught not only Plato but also,\r\n\r\namong  other  works,  \"The  Peloponnesian  War\"  of\r\n\r\nThucydides. Only in this way do you create a  breed\r\n\r\nthat can govern an empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our own historical past, ours is a\r\n\r\nsociety  which  is  deficient  in  many  qualities,\r\n\r\nexcelling  only in the ability to get  on  in  life\r\n\r\nwhatever  the regime - Japanese, British or  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the valuable and indispensable  qualities\r\n\r\nsuch  as  social discipline and moral  values  have\r\n\r\nunfortunately  not been instilled in our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  to  the extent that one would have  wished.\r\n\r\nThe  result is a generation of young people who are\r\n\r\nlargely amoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  are  easy  victims of  all  kinds  of  ideas,\r\n\r\npassions   and  fads  -  be  they  the   subversive\r\n\r\ndoctrines  of  the  Communist  underground  or  the\r\n\r\nseductions  of Beatle music and Beatnik philosophy.\r\n\r\nSuch  aberrations in human conduct may be  accepted\r\n\r\nwith equanimity in large and wealthy societies. But\r\n\r\nwhen we are trying to survive in a tight situation,\r\n\r\nthere  is  very  little place for harmful  or  even\r\n\r\nmeaningless   activities.  At   best,   these   are\r\n\r\nirrelevant eccentricities; at worst, they lead  the\r\n\r\nyoung  into a world of fantasy and make them  unfit\r\n\r\nfor the strenuous exertions that may lie ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against the background of such\r\n\r\nconsiderations that our National Service scheme has\r\n\r\nbeen  worked out. A minority of the young men  will\r\n\r\nbe  selected for a two-year full-time stint in  the\r\n\r\nArmy.  Those selected for promotion to the  officer\r\n\r\ngrade  will  do three years. At the  end  of  their\r\n\r\nmilitary service, they will be emplaced in civilian\r\n\r\noccupations   appropriate  to  their  ability   and\r\n\r\nqualifications. Sufficient numbers of such posts in\r\n\r\nGovernment service, the Statutory Boards and  large\r\n\r\nprivate  firms  will  be  reserved  for  discharged\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen. Legislation on this  will  be\r\n\r\npresented  to  Parliament  shortly.  We  intend  to\r\n\r\nselect the pick of our youth, within each education\r\n\r\ngrade,  for  the Army and there is  no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nprospective employers will be very eager to  obtain\r\n\r\ntheir  services as they represent the best  of  our\r\n\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those not selected for the Army will be allocated\r\n\r\nto  the People's Defence Force, the Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nand  the  Special Constabulary. They will do  part-time  training during their off-work  or  off-study\r\n\r\nhours. This means that those who are now engaged in\r\n\r\nhigher   studies  either  in  the   Higher   School\r\n\r\nCertificate classes or in the Universities will not\r\n\r\nhave their studies upset. At the same time, it does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that by being posted now to the  P.D.F.,\r\n\r\nthe Vigilante Corps or the Special Constabulary  to\r\n\r\ndo  part-time  training and  work,  they  will  not\r\n\r\nsubsequently  be  called up for full-time  military\r\n\r\nservice  on completion of their studies.  There  is\r\n\r\nneed  for  quality in the Army,  as  in  any  other\r\n\r\norganisation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the highly educated must do their  duty\r\n\r\nalong with the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the four Branches of National Service -\r\n\r\nthe full-time Army, the People's Defence Force, the\r\n\r\nVigilante   Corps  and  the  Special   Constabulary\r\n\r\n-National  Servicemen will receive, in addition  to\r\n\r\ntechnical   training  specific  to  their   Branch,\r\n\r\ninstruction in moral values. This will  teach  them\r\n\r\nwhat good citizenship means and explain to them the\r\n\r\nnature of their social responsibilities. It  is  my\r\n\r\nintention,  when  the  training  manuals  on   this\r\n\r\nsubject have been drafted, to seek guidance of  the\r\n\r\nInter-Religious  Council of the Republic,  both  on\r\n\r\nthe  content of moral instruction and on the method\r\n\r\nof  implementation.  I  am sure  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial common ground among the great religions\r\n\r\nof  the  world,  whose values, if imparted  to  our\r\n\r\nyouth, will make them better men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a word about the mechanics of this exercise.\r\n\r\nThe names, addresses, ages and other particulars of\r\n\r\nyoung men liable to national registration are known\r\n\r\nto  the Government and, in fact, have been fed into\r\n\r\nthe electronic computer in the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of this month, i.e, in four days' time,\r\n\r\npink  cards  which  we call Registration  Reminders\r\n\r\nwill  be  sent  by  post to  young  men  liable  to\r\n\r\nregistration. These cards will be sent to the  last\r\n\r\nknown  address,  but  some of these  cards  may  go\r\n\r\nastray in the rural areas there is no proper system\r\n\r\nin  the  numbering of houses, many  of  which  were\r\n\r\nillegally constructed; and in the slums anything up\r\n\r\nto  twenty  families may share a house and  letters\r\n\r\noften go astray. Therefore, if a young man does not\r\n\r\nget  his  pink  reminder card in a week's  time  he\r\n\r\nshould  inquire at the nearest community centre.  I\r\n\r\nmay  say,  in passing, that not getting a  reminder\r\n\r\ncard is not a valid excuse for not registering. And\r\n\r\nall  persons  who  do not register  when  they  are\r\n\r\nliable to do so will, of course, be prosecuted.  In\r\n\r\nthe  present exercise we are registering only those\r\n\r\nmale  youths  horn between 1st January,  1949,  and\r\n\r\n30th  June, 1949. There are approximately 9,000  of\r\n\r\nthem.  Those  born after 30th June, 1949,  will  be\r\n\r\nregistered in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  later exercise this year. Sixteen days from 28th\r\n\r\nMarch  to  18th  April - have  been  set  aside  for\r\n\r\nregistration and four registration centres will  be\r\n\r\nin  operation. The Central Manpower Base in Kallang\r\n\r\nwill be open each day during this period from 9 a.m.\r\n\r\nto  9  p.m. The Katong, Serangoon and Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nDistrict Offices will be open each day from 2  p.m.\r\n\r\nto 9 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of May, medical examinations will\r\n\r\ntake place and the final selection of who is to  go\r\n\r\ninto  what Branch of National Service will be  made\r\n\r\nin  July. Enlistment notices informing young men in\r\n\r\nwhich  Branch of National Service they  will  serve\r\n\r\nwill  be  despatched as from the 11th of July.  And\r\n\r\nNational Service itself is scheduled to commence as\r\n\r\nfrom the 26th July this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many complications in this exercise, as\r\n\r\nthere  are bound to be. I do not wish, to  go  into\r\n\r\nall  of  them. The Manpower Division of my Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  prepared a pamphlet which explains what  those\r\n\r\nwho are liable to National Service have to do. Five\r\n\r\nhundred  members  of  the  staff  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation who work in the community centres  have\r\n\r\nbeen  briefed by the Ministry so as to enable  them\r\n\r\nbetter to give guidance and answer questions  about\r\n\r\nNational  Service. The booklet on National  Service\r\n\r\nwill  be available at all community centres in  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  days.  These  pamphlets  will  also   be\r\n\r\ndistributed to schools. Any Association which wants\r\n\r\ncopies  of  these  pamphlets should  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Interior and  Defence,  Manpower\r\n\r\nDivision,  stating  in what language  or  languages\r\n\r\nthey  wish  to  have them. At present,  copies  are\r\n\r\navailable in English and Chinese. Copies  in  Malay\r\n\r\nand Tamil will be available shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the passage of this\r\n\r\nlegislation  and its implementation,  the  Republic\r\n\r\nmoves  into  a  new era. Often in the past,  people\r\n\r\nhave listened to Ministers of the Government urging\r\n\r\nupon  them  the paramount need to build  a  rugged,\r\n\r\nclosely-knit society. Some might have wondered what\r\n\r\nthis  meant and might have dismissed it as so  much\r\n\r\ntalk. Now they know that it is not merely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalk.  Behind the exhortation lies a  concept  -  a\r\n\r\nvision  if you like - of the new society that  must\r\n\r\nemerge in this island if we want to retain all  the\r\n\r\ngood that we have built in the past and move on  to\r\n\r\ngreater achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I rise in full support of this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  introduction  of  this  Bill  is  well  timed,\r\n\r\nparticularly at this juncture when there  are  four\r\n\r\nsignificant points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this is a measure by which an\r\n\r\nindependent country shoulders the responsibility to\r\n\r\nsee  that all its people will perform their  duties\r\n\r\nas citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this Bill will strengthen the defence\r\n\r\nstructure of our Republic. It will also ensure that\r\n\r\nall our citizens in future will be able to shoulder\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of national defence and prepare\r\n\r\nthemselves for this task ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, this Bill will educate and train our\r\n\r\ncitizens   and  future  generations   in   military\r\n\r\nconsciousness   and   preparedness   and    defence\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  so that they will develop  healthy\r\n\r\nand strong bodies and have a sense of discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, this is a measure to ensure that a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society will march into a new era of a\r\n\r\nclosely   knit  society  with  a  new  and   rugged\r\n\r\ngeneration who can defend this country. I feel that\r\n\r\none  should be filled with pride to become a member\r\n\r\nof  our Armed Forces. There is nobody against  this\r\n\r\nwith the exception of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides various forms\r\n\r\nof  military  training on a full-time or  part-time\r\n\r\nbasis. Most of the training will be done on a part-time  basis. Only about 10 per cent of the  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  liable  to  be  called  up  will  undergo\r\n\r\nmilitary  training  on a full-time  basis  for  two\r\n\r\nyears. This is very appropriate and suitable to the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  this  country. As  we  are  a  small\r\n\r\nRepublic,  it  is  the main responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  look  after  the  affairs  of   the\r\n\r\ncitizens. We have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundertake the economic construction of our country,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  limited resources, in order  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our people can live happily. In view of  this\r\n\r\nprerequisite,  we  have  to  look  after  our   own\r\n\r\nsurvival. We have to make friends with all  nations\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, we adopt a neutral foreign policy.\r\n\r\nWe  are unable to set aside large sums of money for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  maintaining a  very  large  armed\r\n\r\nforce.  As  a  matter of fact,  this  would  be  an\r\n\r\nunrealistic and inappropriate measure to adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since this National Service\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill was introduced at the last sitting\r\n\r\nand  publicised  in  the Press,  we  have  received\r\n\r\npopular  support from various quarters and  leaders\r\n\r\nof  the people. They are all of the view that it is\r\n\r\na  very realistic and far-sighted measure to adopt.\r\n\r\nOnly  the  Barisan  Sosialis are  expressing  their\r\n\r\nopposition to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an organisation like the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, which is anti-national, cannot be\r\n\r\nexpected  to  do anything useful and beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthe  country. If we expect this to happen, then  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  something  like  \"fishing  on  a  tree\".\r\n\r\nTherefore, the people of Singapore should not  have\r\n\r\nany  regard  for the Barisan Sosialis. But  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  can  drastically  change   their\r\n\r\npresent outlook and show that they are loyal to our\r\n\r\ncountry, then, of course, we shall treat them quite\r\n\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that the broad\r\n\r\nmasses  of  the people fully support  the  National\r\n\r\nService  (Amendment) Bill. They will take practical\r\n\r\nsteps to respond to the call of the Government, and\r\n\r\nwill  accept either full-time or part-time military\r\n\r\ntraining. In order that the implementation of  this\r\n\r\nBill  will  receive its proper effect, I hope  that\r\n\r\nall  those  organisations which are  loyal  to  the\r\n\r\nnation  -  be  they  civic organisations,  Citizens\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees or any other organisations\r\n\r\nin Singapore --- will put aside some time to assist\r\n\r\nthe  Government by explaining the position  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  at large. Some publicity must be  given  by\r\n\r\nall  these civic organisations, and steps must also\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  to ensure that the Barisan Sosialis  do  not\r\n\r\ndistort the significance and intentions of the Bill\r\n\r\nso that its success will be ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are clauses in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  punishment  for  contravention   of\r\n\r\ncertain provisions, that is to say, those who  fail\r\n\r\nto  register themselves for national service  shall\r\n\r\nbe liable to terms of imprisonment or fine or both.\r\n\r\nThis  punishment is deterrent in nature and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry concerned will properly carry out\r\n\r\nthe publicity through the Press, Radio, Rediffusion\r\n\r\nand  Television, so that nobody will contravene any\r\n\r\nof the regulations out of ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I feel that as a Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nI  have  a  duty  to  support the National  Service\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill and air my views on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill not only concerns the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people of Jalan Kayu but also  the\r\n\r\ninterest of all the people in the Republic.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  matter of life and death and involves  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the nation. As a Member  representing\r\n\r\nthe people of Jalan Kayu, it is with great pleasure\r\n\r\nand pride that I speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that in 1952,\r\n\r\nwhen the National Service Ordinance was introduced,\r\n\r\nit  did  not  receive the popular  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in my constituency or the people at  large.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, it was met with a certain degree\r\n\r\nof  opposition  from the people of my constituency.\r\n\r\nThe  reasons were very obvious. At that  time,  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore were living in a colonial  era.\r\n\r\nThey  were under colonial rule and were not  imbued\r\n\r\nwith  national consciousness. For this reason,  the\r\n\r\npeople of my constituency and our country at  large\r\n\r\nwere  under no obligation nor were they duty  bound\r\n\r\nat  that  time to support national service  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of a foreign or colonial power. It  was  a\r\n\r\nvery understandable argument\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  that  time. Although this happened in Singapore\r\n\r\nonly  ten  years ago, it cannot be denied that  the\r\n\r\npeople  were  right  then  in  advancing  such   an\r\n\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have noticed that the\r\n\r\npolitical   situation  in  Singapore  has   changed\r\n\r\ncompletely  during  the last  ten  years.  We  have\r\n\r\nthrown  off the shackles of colonial rule and  have\r\n\r\nobtained  independence. It is, therefore, necessary\r\n\r\nthat  our own people should defend our sovereignty.\r\n\r\nSo the significance of national service has changed\r\n\r\ncompletely now because it is not in furtherance  of\r\n\r\nthe  interest of any foreign or colonial power.  On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, national service is intended for the\r\n\r\ndefence and protection of the people of a sovereign\r\n\r\nState.  So  this  change in  outlook  and  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  national service is necessary. Our  people\r\n\r\nmust  take  pride  in joining the People's  Defence\r\n\r\nForce,  the  Special  Constabulary,  the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps and other services. These organisations  have\r\n\r\nbeen  set  up  in order to make sure  that  we  can\r\n\r\ndepend   on   our  own  strength  to   defend   our\r\n\r\nindependent country and the property and freedom of\r\n\r\nour people so that our sovereignty and independence\r\n\r\nwill  not be jeopardised by any aggressive  foreign\r\n\r\npower  or anti-national elements. So the good young\r\n\r\npeople  of  our country must take pride in  joining\r\n\r\nthe national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Service (Amendment) Bill is very\r\n\r\nsignificant  in this respect. National  service  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  -  be  it in France or any  independent\r\n\r\ncountry which is neutral or otherwise- is a  matter\r\n\r\nof  necessity.  For instance, in America,  England,\r\n\r\nRussia, China and other countries, national service\r\n\r\nis implemented without any question, and even small\r\n\r\ncountries like the Philippines, Thailand, Laos  and\r\n\r\nneutral   Switzerland  have  made   provision   for\r\n\r\nnational   service.  Generally  speaking,  national\r\n\r\nservice  is  a matter which concerns a citizen  who\r\n\r\nhas  a duty to his own country. As a member of  the\r\n\r\nArmed Forces of an independent country, I say  that\r\n\r\nit  is  the  duty  of all citizens to  protect  and\r\n\r\ndefend the country and the lives of the people.  It\r\n\r\nis  very much a matter of pride for everybody to do\r\n\r\nthis. It is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter of glory, I would say. Today Singapore is  a\r\n\r\nfully  independent, sovereign and  integral  State.\r\n\r\nOur  people,  I am sure, will take great  pride  in\r\n\r\njoining the various units for national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we relied mainly on the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nand other friendly nations for our national defence\r\n\r\nand  safety.  But  after independence  and  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the present international situation,  we\r\n\r\nmust  take note of the particular fact that England\r\n\r\nis  now taking steps to cut down its troops in  the\r\n\r\nFar  East, including the withdrawal of its base  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This reduction will be planned stage  by\r\n\r\nstage, and the time will come when there will be  a\r\n\r\ncomplete   withdrawal   of  British   troops   from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  we  must not  depend  too  much  on\r\n\r\nBritain  for our defence. We cannot deny that,  for\r\n\r\nour  own  security, we must take certain  steps  in\r\n\r\nthis  direction.  Of course, if necessary,  we  can\r\n\r\nalso come to some kind of arrangement with friendly\r\n\r\nnations in the matter of defence. But between us, I\r\n\r\nsay that the main task of looking after the defence\r\n\r\nand  security  of our country is a matter  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore themselves to decide, so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  protect our nation from invasion or  being\r\n\r\njeopardised   by  anti-national  activists.   Every\r\n\r\nresponsible  and  loyal citizen of  Singapore  must\r\n\r\nprotect  his own country and the lives and property\r\n\r\nof the people from subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the old society there was a saying which\r\n\r\ngoes like this: \"Good iron is never used for making\r\n\r\nnails,  and good men are never made into soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nThis  is quite a popular Chinese saying, but it  is\r\n\r\nan old concept. Perhaps in the old days this saying\r\n\r\nhad  some significance. But in the present context,\r\n\r\nits  significance has been completely lost. If good\r\n\r\nyoung  men  are not turned into soldiers,  then  it\r\n\r\nfollows that the nation will have to depend on good-for-nothing people for its defence. So how can  the\r\n\r\nnational security be safeguarded? If good  men  are\r\n\r\nnot turned into soldiers, then who will be there to\r\n\r\ndefend and protect the independence of our country,\r\n\r\nthe lives and property of our people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today to be in the army and fight\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that we fight only with spears  and\r\n\r\nswords.  It also entails the exercise of the  mind.\r\n\r\nSome  brain  work  is  involved.  So  the  task  of\r\n\r\ndefending the nation cannot very well be placed  on\r\n\r\nthe  good-for-nothing people, but it must be placed\r\n\r\non  the  useful citizens of our country,  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  disciplined and well-trained. These  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  people who will defend our country. I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  old concept that good men do not  become\r\n\r\nsoldiers must be discarded in toto. At a time  when\r\n\r\nour  nation  is  in need of people  to  defend  its\r\n\r\nindependence  and security, we must  all  come  out\r\n\r\nbravely    and    accept   this    challenge    and\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  This is the time  when  good  iron\r\n\r\nmust  be made into nails, and good men turned  into\r\n\r\nsoldiers. This is the new concept that must prevail\r\n\r\nin  the  present situation. To join the army  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of glory for everybody. The old concept must\r\n\r\nbe  completely discarded and replaced  by  the  new\r\n\r\nconcept. This is the pre-requisite and spirit which\r\n\r\nwe   must   establish  to  ensure  the   successful\r\n\r\nformation of our defence force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an oasis in South-east Asia, and\r\n\r\nthere  is no place other than Singapore capable  of\r\n\r\ngiving  such  a  high standard  of  living  to  its\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore, it is our good  fortune  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to live in a country like Singapore.  As  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has already said, our young  people\r\n\r\nmust  always  bear  in  mind  that  if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand the necessity of defending our  country,\r\n\r\nthen whatever we do will be in vain and in the  end\r\n\r\nwe  shall lose everything, and others will come and\r\n\r\nstep  into  our  shoes.  This  is  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has said, and it reminds us of the  great\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the youths of  Singapore.  They\r\n\r\nmust  understand  and appreciate the  realities  of\r\n\r\nlife.  So at a time when our country is calling  us\r\n\r\nto  take  up  national service, we  must  come  out\r\n\r\nbravely  and take up the glorious task of defending\r\n\r\nand  protecting our country. We must do  our  level\r\n\r\nbest to shoulder our responsibility as citizens. To\r\n\r\nthose who join the Army, Navy and Air Force, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, the Vigilante Corps, and the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary, great glory goes to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, national service is needed not\r\n\r\nonly  to  defend  our  country  and  deter  foreign\r\n\r\nintervention and suppress internal subversion,  but\r\n\r\nit   also  has  a  more  significant  and  positive\r\n\r\nmeaning.  As  we  all know, our foreign  policy  is\r\n\r\nbasically  a non-aligned one. What we want  is  the\r\n\r\nmaximum number of friends and the minimum number of\r\n\r\nenemies. Therefore, we have no intention whatsoever\r\n\r\nto  invade other countries. But, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nwe  will  not allow any other country to  undermine\r\n\r\nour   sovereignty  or  our  territorial  integrity.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the setting up of the Armed  Forces  is\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to  defending our  country.  We  are\r\n\r\ndefinite about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a young country and we must establish well-trained armed forces. This will take perhaps 10 or\r\n\r\n20  years  to  accomplish. This is what  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said - that it will take about 5 to  7\r\n\r\nyears,  or even 10 years, to complete this training\r\n\r\nprogramme. By that time we will be able to rely  on\r\n\r\nourselves to defend our country. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nwe  will  have  laid down a firm foundation  for  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society, because during the course  of\r\n\r\ntraining the youths of various races will have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  live  together,  understand   one\r\n\r\nanother, and get to know their habits of living and\r\n\r\ntheir  respective strong and weak points.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  a  strong body corporate will be established.\r\n\r\nThis  is  one  of  the main tasks  of  our  nation-building  and  also  one of  the  most  significant\r\n\r\nfeatures in the National Service (Amendment)  Bill.\r\n\r\nIn  the task of nation-building we will be able  to\r\n\r\ntrain  and  bring  up  a  generation  infused  with\r\n\r\nnational consciousness and patriotism. These  young\r\n\r\npeople will be able to understand one another,  and\r\n\r\nso  the  national solidarity of our nation will  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  After our younger generation,  under\r\n\r\nthe  correct guidance of the Government,  has  been\r\n\r\norganised  to  meet the exigencies  of  a  national\r\n\r\nemergency, they will certainly answer the  call  of\r\n\r\nthe nation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  defend our country with pride and glory and  to\r\n\r\nensure our national survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt about the\r\n\r\nneed for this National Service (Amendment) Bill.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve it will receive the enthusiastic support of\r\n\r\nour  people.  In the past few years the  people  in\r\n\r\nJalan Kayu and other constituencies have taken part\r\n\r\nin  all  activities, such as organising  themselves\r\n\r\ninto the Vigilante Corps, and have expressed a high\r\n\r\ndegree   of  patriotism  particularly  during   the\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  I  believe  this  Bill  will   also\r\n\r\nreceive the support of our young people. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  fully  support it. Its successful implementation\r\n\r\nwill certainly ensure the survival of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang has\r\n\r\nsaid  that when we implement this Bill, the Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers would oppose it and would try their best to\r\n\r\nfrustrate  its implementation. This  is  true.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  we have done is correct. If we believe  this,\r\n\r\nwe  can  disregard their opposition. The people  of\r\n\r\nour  country  are well aware of who  their  enemies\r\n\r\nare.  In  the  recent by-election in  Thomson,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis incited the people to cast  blank\r\n\r\nvotes. But the results showed that the people  were\r\n\r\nnot  misled  by  them. There were  only  about  300\r\n\r\nmisguided  people who were deceived by them.  There\r\n\r\nwere  about 11,000 voters, and about 9,000 of  them\r\n\r\ncast  their  votes for the P.A.P. This  shows  that\r\n\r\nwhat  the Barisan Sosialis did in the past was  not\r\n\r\napproved  by  the people. Therefore, this  National\r\n\r\nService   (Amendment)  Bill  will  be  successfully\r\n\r\nimplemented, no matter how the Barisan Sosialis try\r\n\r\ntheir best to sabotage it. I will try to fulfil  my\r\n\r\nobligation  to mobilise all the people within  this\r\n\r\nage group to answer the call of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill confine my remarks to some general aspects and\r\n\r\nleave   the  details  of  the  Bill  to  my   other\r\n\r\ncolleagues.

If you look around\r\n\r\nus,  Mr Speaker, Sir, particularly on the military\r\n\r\naspect, you will find that Singapore is indeed in a\r\n\r\nvery peculiar situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Singapore Infantry Regiment, which was raised\r\n\r\nin  1957,  is almost ten years old and saw  action.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  are  only  beginning to  crawl.  But  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Army is more than two decades  old  and\r\n\r\nhas acquired a fair amount of combat experience. We\r\n\r\ndo  not know much about the Indonesian Navy and the\r\n\r\nAir  Force  because  they  are  unknown  qualities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only experience we think the Indonesian\r\n\r\nNavy  can claim is piracy during the confrontation.\r\n\r\nThere  was  an  occasion when a  disgruntled  pilot\r\n\r\ndirected  his plane and his guns at the President's\r\n\r\npalace; and then, of course, the recent coup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go further north towards Communist China,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  Liberation Army  was  developed  from\r\n\r\nlarge  groups of organised guerrillas into a  well-established  fighting  force  of  more   than   2.5\r\n\r\nmillion. And if you were to mobilise each and every\r\n\r\none  in  Singapore, young and old, you  would  only\r\n\r\nsucceed  in getting 1.89 million. The Chinese  Army\r\n\r\nalone  is  more  than the population of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMore  so,  Sir, the Chinese Communist Army  is  the\r\n\r\nonly  military force in this part of the world that\r\n\r\nhas  the  experience of fighting  in  international\r\n\r\nwars, particularly fighting the Allied Powers.  And\r\n\r\nif  you  come  down a little bit south,  North  and\r\n\r\nSouth Vietnam, they are still building and fighting\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time.  North and  South  Korea,  for\r\n\r\nexample, had similar experience and they were  only\r\n\r\nslightly   better  off  when  compared   with   the\r\n\r\nVietnamese.  Even India, which is a neutral  nation\r\n\r\nand  has a very sizable standing army, is tied down\r\n\r\nto two border disputes with her neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to us, the Malaysian Army is still\r\n\r\nexpanding, and it is said that they will  build  an\r\n\r\ninitial target of at least 35 battalions, with full\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   support.  The  experience   of   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Army during the Emergency was  indeed  a\r\n\r\nhard-earned one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in Singapore going to join in this armed\r\n\r\nrat race? What for? Who will benefit? Can we afford\r\n\r\nto  raise and maintain a reasonably large army  for\r\n\r\nour  security? Or are we expanding the Armed Forces\r\n\r\nto  provide employment opportunities, as some other\r\n\r\ncountry not very far from Singapore is doing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for over a hundred years, under British\r\n\r\nrule, we had been fed with a different language,  a\r\n\r\ndifferent way of life, and, most important of  all,\r\n\r\nand perhaps the most upsetting thing of all, we had\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to evolve a very peculiar  outlook  and\r\n\r\nsocial   assessment  based  on  a  philosophy   and\r\n\r\neducation  system completely foreign to  us.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  were  fortunate were given an education  which\r\n\r\nwas sufficient to serve the colonial administration\r\n\r\nbut  not  good  enough to question  their  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters'  right; except for a few,  of  course,  to\r\n\r\nwhom  the British thought a higher education  could\r\n\r\nbe  given in the motherland, so that they could  be\r\n\r\nequipped  with better knowledge, and then later  on\r\n\r\nbaited  with  high social position and security  to\r\n\r\nserve the colonial interests. But there are many  -\r\n\r\nperhaps  most of the Ministers on the  Front  Bench\r\n\r\n- concerning  whom the British regrettably  admitted\r\n\r\nthat their plans had misfired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, defence was then not our business. We were\r\n\r\nfree  to  make  a  living and go to any  commercial\r\n\r\nenterprises provided the resultant benefits were to\r\n\r\nthe  British interest and in their favour. And none\r\n\r\nat  that  time regarded this place as our permanent\r\n\r\nhome. Very few questioned the rights that were  due\r\n\r\nto  them. The question of security then was not our\r\n\r\nbusiness  too,  because the security  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmeant  the security of the colonial interest  here.\r\n\r\nAnd  so when the Japanese were nearing Singapore  -\r\n\r\nnot  actually in Singapore - the British packed  up\r\n\r\nand Singapore was handed over to the Japanese.

Sir, the lesson taught to us  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  British could pack up and scoot off  and  then\r\n\r\nreturn  at  a time when they felt it most opportune\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were the unfortunate that were left\r\n\r\nbehind  to face the music of three years and  eight\r\n\r\nmonths.  Where  were the British?  The  Australians\r\n\r\nfought  well, the Indian Regiment fought well,  and\r\n\r\nso  did  the  Malay Regiment. Not the British.  Our\r\n\r\nforefathers perhaps and our brothers were the  ones\r\n\r\nthat  fought the Japanese. Sir, the Japanese taught\r\n\r\nus a lesson.

Overnight  we   found\r\n\r\nourselves  masters  of  our own  destiny,  standing\r\n\r\nalone  at  the southern tip of the Asian continent.\r\n\r\nThe   first   step   was  to  establish   ourselves\r\n\r\ninternationally  and make as  many  friends  as  we\r\n\r\npossibly  could. Then came the big  question  mark:\r\n\r\nour  security. Can we handle the job? How? With  or\r\n\r\nwithout  the  British? The position of the  British\r\n\r\nbase here in Singapore is more than one of military\r\n\r\nconsideration. But we cannot forever  be  dependent\r\n\r\nupon a foreign country for cur livelihood, more  so\r\n\r\nour  security. The British are beginning to have  a\r\n\r\nre-appraisal of their defence arrangements east  of\r\n\r\nSuez.  For us, the British base here can be a  very\r\n\r\ndelicate and explosive political issue. And  so  we\r\n\r\ngive ourselves a very thorough examination and post-mortem.  With  the almost immediate  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nMalaysian troops and the Federal Reserve Unit,  who\r\n\r\nforbade  people  singing  Christmas  hymns   during\r\n\r\nChristmas time,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  would  have to more than fill up  our  security\r\n\r\nvacuum.

This will lead us to the question,\r\n\r\nwhat  kind of army do we want to build up? How  big\r\n\r\nshould  the  Armed Forces be? And  most  important,\r\n\r\nagainst  whom are we defending? Sir, let us  tackle\r\n\r\nthe  last  question  first.  Against  whom  are  we\r\n\r\ndefending? The established policy of the Government\r\n\r\non  foreign  policy is non-alignment.  India,  too,\r\n\r\nprofesses  a neutral foreign policy. Yet that  does\r\n\r\nnot  prevent her from military conflicts  with  her\r\n\r\nneighbours,  China and Pakistan. The disputes  with\r\n\r\nPakistan and China have created doubts in the minds\r\n\r\nof  many  as  to the practicability of  neutrality.\r\n\r\nSweden  and  Switzerland, for instance, maintain  a\r\n\r\nsizable  army  even  when their foreign  policy  is\r\n\r\nneutral.  Sir, we cannot take it for  granted  that\r\n\r\nnobody  will harm us, that everything is  well  and\r\n\r\ngood   if   we  adopt  a  neutral  foreign  policy.\r\n\r\nNeutrality is meaningless without safeguards to our\r\n\r\nnational   integrity.  Who   will   guarantee   our\r\n\r\nterritorial integrity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two decades the international\r\n\r\nboundaries of countries have changed and are  still\r\n\r\nchanging. For example, the 38th parallel  in  Korea\r\n\r\nand   the   17th  parallel  in  Vietnam  are   very\r\n\r\nartificial demarcations. The Thai/Cambodian  border\r\n\r\nwas the subject of a World Court decision.

Once you raise an  army,\r\n\r\nyou have to maintain and feed it and even to expand\r\n\r\nit,  for a general cannot be a general if you  have\r\n\r\nnot got an army division. Sir, this is particularly\r\n\r\nso   when  a  country's  independence  is  achieved\r\n\r\nthrough  violent  revolution, and  after  that  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  fighters  form  the  elite  group  of  the\r\n\r\nnation's  army  and  claim the right  of  place  in\r\n\r\nsociety.  After all, they fought for  independence.\r\n\r\nOur  situation in Singapore is unique in the  sense\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  front  line  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nsmallness  of  our Republic. You  cannot  run  from\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang  to Katong. In a nuclear  war  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  one left behind to build a  memorial,\r\n\r\nbecause  there will be no one left to pick  up  our\r\n\r\nbones.  Even in a conventional war, you cannot  run\r\n\r\nfrom east to west. It is a matter of 27 miles -  14\r\n\r\nmiles  by  27 miles. There is no front line.  Every\r\n\r\ninch  of  our territory is, in fact, a front  line.\r\n\r\nWho is going to defend that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to have a soft-kneed new\r\n\r\ngeneration  if  we  are  to survive.  And  we  hope\r\n\r\nthrough  military training that we can build  up  a\r\n\r\ntough and rugged new generation that can make  this\r\n\r\ncountry   tick.  The  situation  has   changed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore over the last decade or so. In  the  mid-l950s,  national  service was the subject  of  very\r\n\r\nviolent  protests  from  such  categories  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation   as  hawkers,  factory  workers,   shop\r\n\r\nassistants  and  students. Today, 10  years  later,\r\n\r\nthese  are  the same categories of people  who  are\r\n\r\nserving  now  in the Vigilante Corps,  the  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  and, most important of  all,  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Defence  Force. The same  categories  who\r\n\r\nprotested 10 years ago\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   the  same  people  who  now  understand   the\r\n\r\nmechanics of survival and they serve diligently  in\r\n\r\ntheir respective arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly before the Japanese occupied Singapore, a\r\n\r\ngreat  number of somewhat questionably  able-bodied\r\n\r\nmen and youths were \"mobilised\", handed with rifles\r\n\r\nand  ordered to go oil to the so-called front.  And\r\n\r\nall  of us know what happened after that. With  due\r\n\r\nrespect  to  the people who fought so well  shortly\r\n\r\nbefore  1942,  we cannot afford to face  a  similar\r\n\r\nkind  of situation - the situation of being  caught\r\n\r\nunprepared. Some of the stories related to  us  now\r\n\r\nby   the  still  surviving  members  of  the   then\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Forces were that they thought they  went\r\n\r\nfor  a picnic - and a \"picnic\" it was, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. Can we afford another such \"picnic\"? Are we to\r\n\r\nbe caught again in a state of un-preparedness? As I\r\n\r\nhave  said, the fact that we cannot and will  never\r\n\r\nattack others does not mean that we do not have  to\r\n\r\ndefend   ourselves.  National  service   has   more\r\n\r\nimportant  aspects  than  military.  As  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and earlier the Minister of Defence  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it is through military training that we  can\r\n\r\nbuild  up a disciplined, well-organised, tough  and\r\n\r\nrugged  new  generation. For if we are to  give  up\r\n\r\nthis  place,  we  had better know to  whom  we  are\r\n\r\ngiving our authority. If we give up ourselves,  and\r\n\r\nthe next generation with soft knees are prepared to\r\n\r\ncompromise under the slightest pressure, then I say\r\n\r\nwe had better pack up now.

After  all, military  service  is  not\r\n\r\npurely military service. In the Army, one can learn\r\n\r\na  trade, the mechanics of repairing a car,  fixing\r\n\r\nup   wires,   and  possibly  repairing  a   bridge.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in our new nation military service  can\r\n\r\nbe  very  important in one other aspect,  i.e.,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  sufficient  trained and,  most  important,\r\n\r\ndisciplined  men  to fill up the vacancies  in  our\r\n\r\nindustrial houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is oui duty to\r\n\r\nexplain to the people that their obligation  is  to\r\n\r\nthese  224 square miles -- 225 square miles at  low\r\n\r\ntide  -  of  territory and not somewhere else,  not\r\n\r\nfurther  north where a certain country exploded  an\r\n\r\natom  bomb. Some of us in Singapore take particular\r\n\r\npride  in  that,  and not in any other  country  to\r\n\r\nwhich  by sentiment or race we feel we are attached\r\n\r\n- Indonesia or India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to end our discussion today, ][ should like\r\n\r\nto  quote a passage from the speech of the Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence made on the 29th of December last  year\r\n\r\nat a passing-cut parade. Dr Goh then said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Throughout man's long history, defence of the\r\n\r\ncommunity has always been regarded as a novel duty.\r\n\r\nIn  the process of integrating the loose collection\r\n\r\nof  peoples  into a nation with a strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nidentity, military service has played a significant\r\n\r\nrole  from the great city states of the 5th century\r\n\r\nB.C, to the 12th century continental super powers.\r\n\r\nWe  have  seen  how  the  development  of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  has  been so  often  centred  around\r\n\r\nservice in the defence forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are not yet a closely-knit\r\n\r\ncommunity.  So  many of our people  are  of  recent\r\n\r\nmigrant  origin. All this goes towards  creating  a\r\n\r\nsense of value which is personal, self-centred with\r\n\r\nanti-social  tendencies  when  a  conflict   arises\r\n\r\nbetween  personal interests and social obligations.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the values of the ruthless  parvenu  of\r\n\r\nsociety.  We cannot hope to remove them over-night.\r\n\r\nBut  in the proces3 of creating a stronger national\r\n\r\nconsciousness among our people, we will  find  that\r\n\r\nmilitary   service   will  play   an   increasingly\r\n\r\nimportant  role as it has played in  other  nations\r\n\r\nand  in other ages. This aspect of military service\r\n\r\nis  at  least  as  important as the purely  defence\r\n\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOMENT OF INTERRUPTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

I wish to place  on  record\r\n\r\nmy   agreement  in  principle  with  the   proposed\r\n\r\namendments to the National Service Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that some form of national\r\n\r\nservice is essential to the well-being and security\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Even if there would never  arise  a\r\n\r\nsituation where the persons who have been called up\r\n\r\nfor   military  training  are  required  to  defend\r\n\r\nSingapore from any threat or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndanger,  whether  externally  or  internally,  such\r\n\r\nperiod  of  national  training  would  stand  those\r\n\r\npersons  in good stead. By reason of such training,\r\n\r\nthey  would be fortunate enough to receive training\r\n\r\nin  leadership  and  responsibility  towards  their\r\n\r\nState.  Thus  Singapore  would  have  at  least   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   number  of  its  citizens   who   are\r\n\r\nphysically  fit  and  mentally  keen  to  give  the\r\n\r\neffective  and  strong leadership required  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture years of our Island Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, have two comments to make in respect\r\n\r\nof the proposed Bill.

I  wish  to\r\n\r\ndraw  the  attention of this House to the  proposed\r\n\r\nnew  section  21A  wherein it is provided  that  an\r\n\r\nemployer  of  any  person placed  in  the  national\r\n\r\nservice  reserve  shall  be  responsible  for   the\r\n\r\ndifference in the emoluments between such  person's\r\n\r\ncivilian  and  service emoluments. It  is  probably\r\n\r\nenvisaged  by  this section 2lA that  the  employer\r\n\r\npays  the difference while the Government pays  the\r\n\r\nservice  emoluments  direct to  such  person.  This\r\n\r\nsection provides for persons who are placed in  the\r\n\r\nnational  service reserve, but I am rather  puzzled\r\n\r\nabout  the position of a person who is in full-time\r\n\r\nnational  service for the duration of the specified\r\n\r\ntwo-year  period. It is likely that such  a  person\r\n\r\nmight already be in the employment of a company  or\r\n\r\nfirm.  I  am  not  sure whether  in  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance any provision is made for the security of\r\n\r\nsuch  person's  employment  and  earnings  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  when they are receiving full-time  military\r\n\r\ntraining.  If  no provision has been made,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink it is essential that some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment  must be made to the principal  Ordinance\r\n\r\nto safeguard the position of such person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I wish to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention of this House is that while the Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovides for the security of jobs of persons placed\r\n\r\nin  the  national service reserve, no provision  is\r\n\r\nmade  to  the effect that no person placed  in  the\r\n\r\nnational service reserve shall be prejudiced in his\r\n\r\nemployment by reason only of the fact that they are\r\n\r\nplaced  on  the  national service reserve  for  the\r\n\r\nduration of such reserve services. I have  in  mind\r\n\r\nthe   possibility  that  a  person  placed  on  the\r\n\r\nnational  service  reserve  may  be  placed  at   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  in respect of promotion opportunities\r\n\r\nas  a result of his military duties.

This   is   a\r\n\r\nmischievous and dangerous act on the part of Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu  against Singapore which has  emerged  as  a\r\n\r\nfree and sovereign nation. The Utusan Melayu always\r\n\r\npublishes news as facts which have been twisted  by\r\n\r\nAhmad Haji Taff to excite communal feelings between\r\n\r\nthe  Malays and the non-Malays. Clarifications made\r\n\r\nby  the  leaders  of the Singapore  Government  are\r\n\r\ninvariably  ignored and receive scant  coverage  in\r\n\r\nthe  columns  of  Utusan Melayu, and  if  they  are\r\n\r\npublished at all, they are twisted about.  This  is\r\n\r\ndone   purposely  by  Utusan  Melayu  for  specific\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, like the Utusan Melayu, know that Ahmad Haji\r\n\r\nTaff   too  acts  as  a  spokesman  of  a   foreign\r\n\r\ngovernment and owes no allegiance to the State, for\r\n\r\nhe  cherishes the same objectives as those achieved\r\n\r\nby  Dato Hamid Jumat and Tun Lim Yew Hock who  have\r\n\r\nbecome  Malaysian Ambassadors. Both  of  them  were\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore and they were Singapore Ministers in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  but they became frustrated  with  their\r\n\r\npolitical  struggle in Singapore. Ahmad Haji  Taff,\r\n\r\ntoo,  is  frustrated  in  the  political  arena  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a result of defeats in  the  general\r\n\r\nelections  in the past - he was defeated  twice  in\r\n\r\nTanglin  and  once in Geylang Serai  in  1963;  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  too experienced severe defeat  in  that\r\n\r\nlast  election. The P.A.P. Government in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntook  pity  on him because of his defeats,  and  in\r\n\r\norder  not  to  cause him further  frustration,  it\r\n\r\nappointed him as a Senator whilst Singapore was  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  It  was  only  then  that  he  had   the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of sampling the cosiness of a  chair  in\r\n\r\nDewan  Negara. But, unfortunately, because  of  his\r\n\r\nown  doings, the appointment of Senator enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nAhmad  Haji Taff through the charity of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  lasted  for  only  two  years,  because\r\n\r\nSingapore became separated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom   Malaysia.  And  now  there   is   no   other\r\n\r\nalternative for him but to act as a spokesman of  a\r\n\r\nforeign government in league with the Utusan Melayu\r\n\r\nand  to  twist  and  distort the  speeches  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  of  the  Singapore Government  with  the\r\n\r\nobject and hope of obtaining a post like the  posts\r\n\r\nobtained by Dato Hamid Jumat and Tun Lim Yew  Hock.\r\n\r\nIt  is  with  this  object  in  view  that  he,  in\r\n\r\ncollusion with Utusan Melayu, is going all  out  to\r\n\r\ninstill  in  the Malays in Singapore a  feeling  of\r\n\r\nhatred   towards  the  leaders  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  through the columns  of  Utusan  Melayu\r\n\r\ndaily.  On  its  part, the Utusan Melayu  purposely\r\n\r\nexaggerates the news, all the more so if such  news\r\n\r\nitems can fan the flames of communalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that we have not yet forgotten the\r\n\r\nincidents  which took place in 1964 as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe publications in Utusan Melayu which then became\r\n\r\nan   instigator   that   fanned   the   flames   of\r\n\r\ncommunalism,   culminating   in   a    number    of\r\n\r\ndisturbances whereby many lives were sacrificed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore was separated from. Malaysia and\r\n\r\nbecame  a  free and sovereign nation, its  position\r\n\r\nbecame more peaceful and prosperous. Be that as  it\r\n\r\nmay,  the Utusan Melayu, which is published outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  allowed  to  circulate  freely   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  did not relent in its efforts  to  find\r\n\r\nways and means to print news which can give rise to\r\n\r\npolitical  tension between Malaysia and  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, in the issue of Utusan Melayu of the\r\n\r\n13th of February, 1967, an article was published in\r\n\r\nbig  headlines  and it was twisted  by  Ahmad  Haji\r\n\r\nTaff.  It  set out the meaning and purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nspeech of Inche Rahim Ishak, the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nfor  Education  in  Singapore, in  order  to  cause\r\n\r\nconfusion among the Malays to the effect that Inche\r\n\r\nRahim Ishak is a Malay leader of the P.A.P, who  is\r\n\r\nanti-Malay  and  anti-Malay Rulers.  Actually,  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of  Inche Rahim Ishak did  not  state  that\r\n\r\npeople  of royal blood look on the Malays as  dogs.\r\n\r\netc.  He  mentioned  the word \"patek\"  which  means\r\n\r\n\"little  dog\". The Utusan Melayu has itself  agreed\r\n\r\nthat the word \"patek\" means \"dog\". In its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissue  of  31st  December, 1966, the Utusan  Melayu\r\n\r\nprinted  an  article in bold headlines saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  meaning of \"patek\" is \"dog\" and it was written\r\n\r\nby  a  language specialist in Malaysia. The heading\r\n\r\nof  the  article  published by  the  Utusan  Melayu\r\n\r\nclearly  states that `patek\" means  \"dog\".  If  the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu  itself agrees  that  \"patek\"  means\r\n\r\n\"dog\", why then did it recently deny the meaning of\r\n\r\nthat  word, and why then did it and Ahmad Haji Taff\r\n\r\nkick  up  a  fuss about the speech of  Inche  Rahim\r\n\r\nIshak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utusan Melayu of 15th February, 1967,\r\n\r\npublished  an  item  in  big headlines  criticising\r\n\r\nInche  Rahim Ishak and the President of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nInche  Yusof  Bin Ishak. Its object  was  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Republic of Singapore is  not  fit\r\n\r\nto  be called \"Paduka Yang Mulia\" because he is not\r\n\r\nof  royal  blood.  It is possible that  the  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu  does not understand or purposely  does  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  understand the terms \"Paduka Yang  Mulia\"\r\n\r\nand  \"Kebawah Duli Yang Mahamulia\". With  the  term\r\n\r\n\"Paduka  Yang  Mulia\"  for  the  President  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Singapore, that  is  the  reason  why\r\n\r\nSingapore does not use the word \"patek\". I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  the name of the President  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic of Singapore was made the object of attack\r\n\r\nby  Utusan Melayu. I have read an editorial  column\r\n\r\nof   Utusan   Melayu   which  mentioned   President\r\n\r\nSoekarno, using the term \"Paduka Yang Mulia\". Is it\r\n\r\nthat  of late this was purposely twisted by  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu  in  a  campaign  so  that  the  Malays   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  not centre their  loyalty  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident   and  the  Ministers  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment? This is a mischievous and dangerous act\r\n\r\nby Utusan Melayu towards Singapore which has become\r\n\r\na  free  and  sovereign nation. The  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should take a serious view of  this  and\r\n\r\ntake  action on the publication of such news items.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  action  should be taken  against  Ahmad\r\n\r\nHaji Taff for, like the Utusan Melayu, he acts as a\r\n\r\nspokesman  of a foreign government for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  inciting political tension between Malaysia and\r\n\r\nSingapore. In the interest of peace, happiness  and\r\n\r\nprosperity of the people of Singapore, I urge  that\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  demand  an  apology  from  both  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu and Ahmad Haji Taff for what they have done,\r\n\r\nand  should  they  fail to do  so,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould take necessary action against both of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to reply to the speech made by the Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai in Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay): At the outset, let me explain to this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  it  is  true that  the  Utusan  Melayu\r\n\r\ndeliberately twisted and perverted the speech  made\r\n\r\nby  Inche  Rahim Ishak, the Minister of  State  for\r\n\r\nEducation.  It was designed to stir up  hatred  and\r\n\r\nenrage the Malays both outside and within Singapore\r\n\r\nagainst  Inche  Rahim Ishak in particular  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government in general. The Utusan  Melayu\r\n\r\nhas  once again attempted to denounce the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   as  being  anti-Malay  and  anti-Malay\r\n\r\nSultans, as, in fact, it did when Singapore  was  a\r\n\r\npart  of  Malaysia.  Under the  circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu deliberately reported Inche  Rahim's\r\n\r\nspeech Out of context and perverted it. However, we\r\n\r\nall  know Inche Rahim's speech did not in the least\r\n\r\noffend  the  position nor the status of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nRulers. What he said in full concerned the progress\r\n\r\nachieved by the Malays in Singapore in the field of\r\n\r\neducation  with  the  various forms  of  assistance\r\n\r\ngiven to them by the Singapore Government since the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. assumed office in 1959. If it was true  that\r\n\r\nInche  Rahim's  speech offended and denigrated  the\r\n\r\nstatus of the Malay Rulers, we would certainly have\r\n\r\nreceived   a  strong  protest  from  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment.  However, to date we have not  received\r\n\r\nany such protest officially. The Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  Tunku Abdul Rahman, when  challenged  by\r\n\r\nMr D. R. Seenivasagam in the Malaysian Parliament,\r\n\r\nstated that he did not wish to send a protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware about Ahmad Haji Taff's tactics.\r\n\r\nHe   is   the   head  of  U.M.N.O.  Singapore,   an\r\n\r\nappointment made in Kuala Lumpur. He was not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelected by members of U.M.N.O. Singapore, as is the\r\n\r\ncase   with   political   parties   that   practise\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  but he was appointed by forces  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore. It naturally follows that he feels  that\r\n\r\nhe  is under a certain obligation to his benefactor\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, he comes Out in  support  of  and\r\n\r\nexaggerates whatever his master says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly there is some truth in what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Geylang Serai has said - that Ahmad Haji Taff  is\r\n\r\naspiring to be an Ambassador, an ambition which his\r\n\r\ncolleagues have realised, i.e., Hamid Jumat and Lim\r\n\r\nYew Hock who have been given high appointments. Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock  has suddenly become a poet recently.  As\r\n\r\nthe  head  appointed by outside forces, Ahmad  Haji\r\n\r\nTaff is apprehensive that, when the day of judgment\r\n\r\narrives, he will be ousted from UMNO. Singapore. So\r\n\r\none  way  out of his dilemma is for him  always  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  sense of uneasiness among the Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  this  way, by fishing  in  troubled\r\n\r\nwaters,  he hopes to cling to his position  for  as\r\n\r\nlong as he can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Malays in Singapore, who have never been\r\n\r\nunder feudalistic rule since 150 years ago, are not\r\n\r\nnarrow-minded. Therefore, they turned a deaf ear to\r\n\r\nAhmad Haji Taff's speech and the articles in Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu  written under a nom de plume. I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  those articles were not, in fact, written  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public but by the staff  of  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu  itself.  I further understand  that  at  an\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O, meeting held in Singapore recently,  Ahmad\r\n\r\nHaji   Taff   condemned  Malay   organisations   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   for  remaining  silent  and   for   not\r\n\r\nsupporting Utusan Melayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  country.  We are  an  open  society.  If\r\n\r\nUtusan Melayu and Ahmad Haji Taff were to live in a\r\n\r\nneighbouring  country, they  would  certainly  have\r\n\r\nbeen  languishing in prison by now, detained  under\r\n\r\nthe  internal security laws. But we will not resort\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  internal  security laws. We  only  invoke  the\r\n\r\ninternal  security laws against the Communists  who\r\n\r\ncannot  be  convicted  in an open  court,  as  they\r\n\r\nthreaten  witnesses  with  bodily  harm.  We   have\r\n\r\ncertain  laws under which action may be  taken  for\r\n\r\nsuch  offences.  I refer to the Sedition  Ordinance\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the Internal Security  Act.  We  are\r\n\r\nconstantly  giving serious attention  to  the  news\r\n\r\nitems  and articles carried in Utusan Melayu  which\r\n\r\naffect  Singapore. When this daily paper runs  foul\r\n\r\nof  the  law, then the Government will not hesitate\r\n\r\nto take firm action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Utusan Melayu representative, in an interview\r\n\r\nwith  the  Prime  Minister, Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew,  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1965, had already been provided  with  a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the  Sedition Ordinance.  Certainly  this\r\n\r\nrepresentative  is not unaware that the  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Sedition Ordinance are still in  force  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  can  be enforced  at  any  time  if\r\n\r\nnecessary. I wish to remind Utusan Melayu  that  in\r\n\r\nan  interview with me on 30th September,  1965,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Culture, Singapore, its  Managing\r\n\r\nDirector;  Dato  Hussain  Bin  Noordin,   gave   an\r\n\r\nassurance to the Singapore Government to the effect\r\n\r\nthat  Utusan  Melayu  would  not  publish  articles\r\n\r\nprejudicial to the peace and security of Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  further  said that Utusan Melayu would  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes   make  positive  contributions  by  way   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining good relationship between Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Dato Noordin also stated that  he  would\r\n\r\naccord  his  full co-Operation to bring  about  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  creation of a just, prosperous,  multi-racial and multi-religious society in Singapore. It\r\n\r\nis  well  and good for Utusan Melayu not to  forget\r\n\r\nthis undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty minutes past Seven o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
