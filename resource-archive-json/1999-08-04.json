Prof. Ho</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, may I take\r\n\r\nquestions 1 to 5 together as they are related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the morning traffic at\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway has always been extremely busy.  In the past,\r\n\r\nbecause  our immigration officers were not able to  conduct\r\n\r\ncomplete checks, illegal immigrants were able to slip  into\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially during peak hours.  In the first half\r\n\r\nof  1999,  more  than  70% of the 5,500 illegal  immigrants\r\n\r\narrested came through the old Woodlands Checkpoint.  It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary to conduct stricter immigration checks\r\n\r\nat  all times. When the new Woodlands Checkpoint opened  on\r\n\r\n18th July this year, Singapore Immigration and Registration\r\n\r\n(SIR) started stricter checks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to prepare travellers for the new Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint,  SIR  conducted trial  runs  over  a  few  days  for\r\n\r\narriving  and departing travellers during the peak-periods.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  media  publicity, pamphlets in the  four  official\r\n\r\nlanguages  were  given to all travellers at  the  old  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three incoming lanes into Singapore and three\r\n\r\noutgoing  lanes  to Johor on the Causeway.   On  the  first  few\r\n\r\nmornings, there was heavy congestion as vehicles were unable  to\r\n\r\nget  into  the correct lanes after leaving the Johor checkpoint.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, huge numbers of motorcyclists jostled for  space\r\n\r\namong cars, buses and lorries.   Lorry traffic was also heavy as\r\n\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Checkpoint, stricter immigration checks were carried\r\n\r\nout  on travellers, taking about 30 to 45 seconds each.  Customs\r\n\r\ntakes   about two to three minutes to clear each lorry.    There\r\n\r\nis  a  red and green lane system for customs clearance  for  all\r\n\r\ntravellers, including lorries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To relieve the congestion, SIR and Traffic Police deployed\r\n\r\nmore  officers  to direct traffic on the Causeway.   One  Johor-bound  lane was converted into a Singapore-bound lane, making  a\r\n\r\ntotal of four incoming lanes to Singapore and two outgoing lanes\r\n\r\nto Johor.  More clearance counters were opened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the current situation? After the first week,\r\n\r\nschool  and factory buses are now generally cleared by 7.00  am,\r\n\r\nwhich is better than before;  cars are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoving  steadily,  also better than before; and  the  motorcycle\r\n\r\nqueue has eased off earlier, at about 8.00 am instead of 9.00 am\r\n\r\nat  the  old  checkpoint.  The lorry queue remains the  same  as\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearance of buses, cars and motorcycles and lorries is\r\n\r\nnow normal.  The situation has stabilised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the departure side, there is a marked improvement in the\r\n\r\ntraffic situation.  Traffic used to stretch right up to the  BKE\r\n\r\nduring  the evening peak-hour.  It is now confined to  near  the\r\n\r\ncheckpoint boundaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR is looking into ways to further improve the clearance\r\n\r\nrate  at the Checkpoint.  There is a smart card clearance system\r\n\r\nat the bus halls.  More regular commuters have applied for these\r\n\r\nsmart  cards and will be encouraged to do so.  There is  also  a\r\n\r\npilot  study  to  clear  motorcyclists through  the  smart  card\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a special pass for lorry drivers who make\r\n\r\n20  or  more trips a month.  These Multiple Journey Visit Passes\r\n\r\n(MJVPs) may be given to more lorry drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the congestion during the first few days of operation\r\n\r\nis  unlikely to be repeated.  As regards Mr Hawazi's question on\r\n\r\nboth  sides  stepping up cooperation, there  are  already  links\r\n\r\nbetween SIR and Customs, and their Malaysian counterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  to  clarify  what  is  meant  by  \"stricter\r\n\r\nimmigration checks\"?  Is this primarily to control the number of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants trying to enter Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Member is correct. As I\r\n\r\nsaid,  for the first half of this year, out of the 5,500 illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants who were arrested, 70% or almost 3,800 said that they\r\n\r\ncame  through  the Woodlands Checkpoint.  One  reason  could  be\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  large number of motorcyclists involved.   What\r\n\r\nthey  did  in the past was to flash their travel documents,  and\r\n\r\nonly  about  12-13% would be checked.  So the  rest  would  just\r\n\r\nflash through.  Because of the constraints at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nold  Checkpoint, we could not check everybody.  So this  is  one\r\n\r\ngap  which  we  feel  we have to plug.   And  so  with  the  new\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Checkpoint, all the  motorcyclists and all the  other\r\n\r\ntravellers are checked.  Their travel documents are given to the\r\n\r\ncustoms officers who will look at the photographs and check  the\r\n\r\nparticulars against the persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the Tuas Second\r\n\r\nLink  is  now  under  utilised.  Would the  Government  consider\r\n\r\nworking  with the Malaysian government in a scheme to popularise\r\n\r\nits  use,  so  as  to  ease  the  congestion  at  the  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the means of regulating the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  Causeway and the Second Link are by means  of  the\r\n\r\ntolls.   And  as  the Member knows, toll amounts  are  not  just\r\n\r\nderived  at  from one side.  They are derived from  both  sides,\r\n\r\ntaking  into  consideration what each side  is  paying  for  the\r\n\r\ntolls.   This  is  something that cannot  just  be  unilaterally\r\n\r\nchanged by ourselves.  In terms of regulating traffic flow, this\r\n\r\nreally   comes   under   the  Ministry  of  Communications   and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology (MCIT).  It is something that  MCIT  can\r\n\r\nconsider.   Like  I  said, it is not just  a  matter  of  simply\r\n\r\nraising tolls to regulate traffic.  I think what we have  to  do\r\n\r\nis  that we have to recognise that the main bulk of traffic will\r\n\r\nstill  come through the Woodlands Checkpoint.  Like I have said,\r\n\r\nthere  were, of course, initial teething problems.  But  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  the  various measures that have been taken, these problems\r\n\r\nhave been largely solved, and the situation has stabilised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have noticed that\r\n\r\nin  the old Woodlands Checkpoint, many of the immigration booths\r\n\r\nwere  not  opened during peak hours.  I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has given instructions for all the booths in  the  new\r\n\r\nCheckpoint to be opened, especially during the crowded periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, like I have said, one of the\r\n\r\nmeasures taken to ameliorate the situation arising in the  first\r\n\r\nfew  days was the opening of more counters.  For example,  as  a\r\n\r\nquick check, in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  old  Woodlands Checkpoint, for motorcycles and cars,  there\r\n\r\nwere  24  counters.  Now, there are 53 counters for  motorcycles\r\n\r\nand  cars  in the new Woodlands Checkpoint.  This is  more  than\r\n\r\ndouble.  For buses, at the old Woodlands Checkpoint, there  were\r\n\r\n10  counters,  and  now  there are 26  counters,  including  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of  some departure counters into  arrival  counters.\r\n\r\nNot  only  has SIR converted one departure lane into an  arrival\r\n\r\nlane  so  that there is better flow, but for the bus  commuters,\r\n\r\nsix  of  the counters, I understand, have also been so converted\r\n\r\nto  accommodate  a  faster flow.  And lorry counters  have  been\r\n\r\nraised from four in the old Woodlands Checkpoint to six.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take Mr Chiam's point that more counters should and\r\n\r\nindeed  have been opened.  I think the basic point is that  what\r\n\r\ncan  be  done have been looked at and have been done.   But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  like I have said, SIR together with the other  agencies\r\n\r\nis  still looking at ways to improve the situation, eg,  getting\r\n\r\nmore  of  the commuters, particularly the bus commuters,  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  the  immigration access card system.   I  understand  that\r\n\r\nsince the new Woodlands Checkpoint opened, about 4,000 new cards\r\n\r\nhave been issued.  So the situation should further improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WOODLANDS CHECKPOINT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Smuggling of illegal immigrants)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nwhether  there has been an increase in the number  of  attempted\r\n\r\nsmuggling of illegal immigrants into Singapore detected  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands Checkpoint; and what measures have been taken to check\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, more cases involving the smuggling of\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  into Singapore have been  detected  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands Checkpoint this year.   For the first half of 1999, 10\r\n\r\ntraffickers and 51 illegal immigrants were arrested, as compared\r\n\r\nto  only  one trafficker and two illegal immigrants arrested  in\r\n\r\nthe corresponding period last year.  In the whole of last year,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n61  foreigners  were  arrested at the Woodlands  Checkpoint  for\r\n\r\nattempting  to  enter  Singapore  illegally.   Sir,  indeed  the\r\n\r\nnumbers have gone up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, more than 14,700 illegal immigrants were caught\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  SIR estimates that about 70% of them came through\r\n\r\nthe  Woodlands Checkpoint.  This illustrates that illegal  entry\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore  through the Woodlands Checkpoint  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nserious  problem.   SIR has thus taken a range  of  measures  to\r\n\r\ncheck the problem at the Woodlands Checkpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of these measures? First, like I have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now, more intensive checks.  SIR has, since  the\r\n\r\nlater half of 1998, intensified checks at the checkpoint.   From\r\n\r\nJuly  1998  to  June  this  year, 19 vehicles  were  seized  and\r\n\r\nforfeited,  as  compared to only five vehicles in  the  12-month\r\n\r\nperiod  preceding  that.  With the recent  opening  of  the  New\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Checkpoint,  SIR  has also  started  conducting  more\r\n\r\ncomplete checks on travellers and vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, enhanced intelligence capability. SIR has also\r\n\r\nenhanced   its   intelligence  capability   against   syndicates\r\n\r\ntrafficking  illegal immigrants.  These efforts have  paid  off,\r\n\r\nwith  more  syndicate operations being crippled.  For the  first\r\n\r\nhalf  of  1999,  10  trafficking  cases  were  detected  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Checkpoint as compared to only one case in the  first\r\n\r\nhalf of 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, more and better trained officers deployed at the\r\n\r\nCheckpoints.  SIR and Police have also deployed more and better-trained   officers  to  intensify  checks  at  both   the   land\r\n\r\ncheckpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, SIR also works with the other Home Team's\r\n\r\ndepartments to jointly tackle the illegal immigrant problem.   I\r\n\r\nam  sure Members must have read in the papers about the  use  of\r\n\r\nSCDF  rescue dogs deployed at the Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints\r\n\r\nto sniff out illegal immigrants\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcealed  in  car  boots  or  secret  compartments  in  tourist\r\n\r\ncoaches, lorries, and `Bas Kilang' buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to rigorous enforcement, we have also\r\n\r\nspread  deterrent messages to potential illegal  immigrants  and\r\n\r\ntraffickers.   Since April 1998, SIR has been issuing  pamphlets\r\n\r\nin four languages to foreigners at the land checkpoints carrying\r\n\r\nmessages  on the tough penalties for immigration offences.   SIR\r\n\r\nhas  also been applying for deterrent sentences to be meted  out\r\n\r\nwhen traffickers are prosecuted in court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, can the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  say whether there have been instances where Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration has apprehended illegal immigrants trying  to  leave\r\n\r\nSingapore by the Causeway?  Second, would the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nagree that if the Malaysian authorities also took tough measures\r\n\r\nto  prevent  such smuggling  from taking place and by  crippling\r\n\r\nthe  ground operations of these syndicates, it will be a win-win\r\n\r\nsituation for both sides?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I take it that the Member is\r\n\r\nreferring  to  illegal immigrants leaving Singapore.   SIR  also\r\n\r\ntakes   a   tough  stand  against  illegal  immigrants   leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Perhaps  he has in mind a recent  incident  at  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  where 35 or so illegal immigrants tried to  come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore from Malaysia, and some of whom, because they were  in\r\n\r\na lorry, were killed.  I think Members know and have read in the\r\n\r\npapers  that  SIR  also  takes  a tough  stand  against  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  trying  to leave Singapore.  I think  it  stands  to\r\n\r\nreason,  because this would add to the deterrence  that  if  you\r\n\r\ncome  into Singapore, even if you come in successfully, it would\r\n\r\nbe  difficult for you to leave.  In any case, these  people  who\r\n\r\nsuccessfully leave may return in future.  And that is why SIR is\r\n\r\nvigilant.  Indeed, just two days ago, it is in the Straits Times\r\n\r\ntoday,  a  small column, page 3, Members can read  about  it,  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian registered vehicle was trying to leave Singapore  with\r\n\r\nfive Thai illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, for example, SIR has apprehended 23 such\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders at the Woodlands Checkpoint.  In 1998, 138\r\n\r\nsuch  immigration offenders tried to leave Singapore  illegally,\r\n\r\nmainly  in  Malaysian registered cars driven by Malaysians.   In\r\n\r\nthe  first  six  months  of this year, 53  such  offenders  were\r\n\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in answer to the Member's second question, indeed, I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that continued vigilance is important  on  both\r\n\r\nsides  of the Causeway and I hope that the measures that he  has\r\n\r\nmentioned would be considered by the Malaysian authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Given that the illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  are  on  the rise and illegal immigrant  trafficking\r\n\r\nseems  to  be on the rise, is there any intention to review  the\r\n\r\npenalties, especially  for the traffickers?  I say this  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of the recent case mentioned by the Minister of State that\r\n\r\nsome  illegal immigrants actually died on the way across in that\r\n\r\nparticular incident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the focus now is to plug\r\n\r\nthis  flow  where in the past they came through the checkpoints.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  focus of our efforts.  In terms  of  the  overall\r\n\r\nnumber  of  illegal immigrants caught, in fact, the  number  has\r\n\r\ncome down.  It has come down by about 30% for the first half  of\r\n\r\nthis year compared to the same period last year.  But the number\r\n\r\nis  still  nevertheless high.  I think there is no need  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  to  enhance the penalties.  Looking at the situation  of\r\n\r\neach case, for example, the case mentioned by the Member, if the\r\n\r\ndriver  is  caught,  one  possibility is  to  charge  him  as  a\r\n\r\ntrafficker, and he would get up to five years' jail.  But  again\r\n\r\nit  is  up to the Attorney-General's Chambers.  If indeed he  is\r\n\r\ncaught,  the  AG may look at the facts and the facts may warrant\r\n\r\nthe  AG  to consider charging him under a more serious  offence,\r\n\r\nperhaps  causing death by a rash act.

In tandem with the pick up  in  economic\r\n\r\nactivities, total employment rose by an estimated 15,400 in  the\r\n\r\nsecond quarter of 1999.  This is the first quarterly increase in\r\n\r\nemployment  after declining for four consecutive quarters.   For\r\n\r\nthe  first  half  of  this year, the total employment  gain  was\r\n\r\n5,800.   In  other  words, jobs created exceeded  jobs  lost  by\r\n\r\n5,800.   This was a sharp contrast to the net job loss of 26,600\r\n\r\nin  the  second  half of 1998 when the impact  of  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn on the labour market was most severe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in the previous quarter, nearly all major sectors\r\n\r\nregistered  increases  in employment in the  second  quarter  of\r\n\r\n1999.  The employment gains came mainly from the real estate and\r\n\r\nbusiness  services with an estimated net job creation of  8,000,\r\n\r\nfollowed by manufacturing at 3,900, financial services at 1,400,\r\n\r\nhotels   and   restaurants   at   1,200,   and   transport   and\r\n\r\ncommunications at 1,000.  Employment also rose by 4,300  in  the\r\n\r\nother services sectors covering education, health,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndomestic and other community, social and personal services.   In\r\n\r\nthe  construction sector, employment continued to  contract  for\r\n\r\nthe  fourth consecutive quarter.  However, the net loss of 4,200\r\n\r\nconstruction jobs was significantly less than the 10,500 in  the\r\n\r\npreceding quarter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary findings from a survey of private sector\r\n\r\nestablishments  with  at least 25 employees  showed  that  about\r\n\r\n3,300  workers  were retrenched in the second quarter  of  1999.\r\n\r\nThis  is  close to the 3,400 displaced in the previous  quarter.\r\n\r\nWith  the  pick  up  in  the  economy,  the  number  of  workers\r\n\r\nretrenched  in  the  first quarter of this year  has  fallen  to\r\n\r\n6,700, less than half of the 14,600 laid off in the second  half\r\n\r\nof 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent economic indicators have been very encouraging.\r\n\r\nManufacturing  output grew by a healthy 10.4% in the  first  six\r\n\r\nmonths of the year compared with the same period last year.  Non-oil domestic exports also rebounded with an increase of 10.3% in\r\n\r\nthe  second quarter of this year.  While the economic  situation\r\n\r\nhas  certainly improved, the recovery can only be  sustained  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  continued strength in the developed economies  and  a\r\n\r\nbenign environment in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economic recovery gathers momentum, this would have\r\n\r\na  positive  impact on the labour market.  We can expect  demand\r\n\r\nfor  workers  to  increase  while  retrenchment  is  likely   to\r\n\r\nmoderate.  Nevertheless, there would still be some retrenchments\r\n\r\nas  companies  upgrade  or restructure  to  remain  competitive.\r\n\r\nLower educated workers who lack the necessary skills will remain\r\n\r\nvulnerable   as  industries  move  towards  higher  value  added\r\n\r\nactivities.  Workers must not be complacent.  They must continue\r\n\r\nto  upgrade themselves to ensure that they are able to  take  up\r\n\r\nnew  jobs that are being created as the economy recovers.

The figures will only be available when we issue  the\r\n\r\nquarterly economic survey probably later this month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the details on the employment creation in the\r\n\r\ncommerce  sector,  I am afraid I do not have the  exact  figures\r\n\r\nwith  me, but I would be prepared to share the information  with\r\n\r\nthe Nominated Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the net employment creation for local workers as\r\n\r\nopposed  to foreign workers, the demand for foreign workers  has\r\n\r\nactually  been  fairly  stable  as  a  result  of  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   In  fact, we saw a dip in demand.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nemployment  creation for foreign workers would have  gone  down.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the recession, many companies, particularly those\r\n\r\nin  the  construction  sector,  had  to  release  their  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.  Therefore, we would expect a decline in the employment\r\n\r\ncreation for foreign workers.

Perhaps, this is\r\n\r\nan  indicator  to  say  that  the  economy  has  not  completely\r\n\r\nrecovered to what it used to be pre-1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's question on discrimination, whether in\r\n\r\nthe   light   of   the  economic  downturn,   there   were   any\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  practices adopted by employers  vis-a-vis  local\r\n\r\nworkers versus foreign workers, I have replied to this point  on\r\n\r\na previous occasion in this Chamber that we have observed during\r\n\r\nthe  recession  that, on average, when it comes to retrenchment,\r\n\r\nemployers,   in  fact,  retrench  their  workers   without   any\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  practices.   In other  words,  the  retrenchment\r\n\r\nreflects  the profile of the workforce in the company.   If  the\r\n\r\ncompany has 50% local and 50% foreign workers in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing sector, then the retrenchment would take  the\r\n\r\nsame  proportion.  There was no evidence to show that there were\r\n\r\nclear  attempts  by  employers to retrench Singaporeans  and  to\r\n\r\nsubstitute them with foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the type of jobs that would be created as the economy\r\n\r\nrecovers,  I  think  this  is a very important  point.   As  the\r\n\r\neconomy  recovers, we will shift into a new area of competition.\r\n\r\nOur neighbours will also recover, just as we are recovering, and\r\n\r\nthey  will  be very much more competitive in some  of  the  more\r\n\r\nlabour-intensive   type   of   businesses,    particularly    in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.  So, as I have said in my main answer,  companies\r\n\r\nwill  have  to restructure their operations, move on  to  higher\r\n\r\nvalue  added  activities, bring in new technology and  introduce\r\n\r\nnew  processes.  In fact, as the economy recovers, the jobs that\r\n\r\nare  going to be created will be quite different from  the  jobs\r\n\r\nthat were available prior to the recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our workers will have to take note of this and\r\n\r\nmake  efforts to upgrade their skills so that they are  able  to\r\n\r\ntake  on  the new jobs that are being created.  If they  do  not\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills,  they will find that  when  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers,  jobs  are going a-begging, but the unemployment  rate\r\n\r\nmay   well   stay  high,  mainly  in  the  form  of   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.   This  is  a serious concern.   That  is  why  my\r\n\r\nMinistry, working together with all the other economic agencies,\r\n\r\nis  putting in efforts to try to address this by providing  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  skills  upgrading  and  retraining  to   our\r\n\r\nworkers,  particularly the older workers and the  less  educated\r\n\r\nworkers who are most vulnerable to structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S.

Many of these older workers  missed\r\n\r\nout  on  the  opportunity for a good education  and  for  skills\r\n\r\ntraining when they were younger.  Now they are in their  mid-40s\r\n\r\nand they become very vulnerable to retrenchment.  In fact, if  I\r\n\r\nrecall correctly, they were over-represented among the groups of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  were  retrenched.  That is why  we  have  to  have\r\n\r\nspecial  programmes to meet their needs.  In the way I responded\r\n\r\nto  the Nominated Member, Mr Simon Tay, we have to put in  extra\r\n\r\nefforts  in this area to help the older less-skilled workers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills.  The Skills Redevelopment Programme is one\r\n\r\nsuch  programme  focused  at meeting  the  needs  of  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers, helping older, less skilled workers to upgrade, refresh\r\n\r\ntheir  skills,  so that they can take on the new jobs  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing  created, in other words, helping them to avoid structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, the newspaper reports show\r\n\r\nthat  Malay  workers  are more prone to retrenchments  and  have\r\n\r\ngreater difficulty in finding new jobs.  Two questions: (1)   Do\r\n\r\nthe  latest statistics from the Ministry confirm this?  (2)  How\r\n\r\nsuccessful  have retrenched Malay workers been looking  for  new\r\n\r\njobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, during the economic downturn,\r\n\r\nnearly  two-thirds  of  the retrenched  workers  came  from  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.  And the vast majority of those  who  were\r\n\r\nretrenched  in  the  manufacturing sector  were  the  production\r\n\r\noperators.   Many  Malay  Singaporeans work  in  the  production\r\n\r\noperation  type  of   jobs in the manufacturing  sector.   Then,\r\n\r\nlogically,  you expect that you will see more Malay Singaporeans\r\n\r\namong  those  who  were retrenched as a result of  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to helping them to find re-employment, we have made\r\n\r\nevery effort to help all Singaporeans who were retrenched  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the downturn.  We have organised many job fairs  with\r\n\r\nthe  support of the various Community Development Councils.  The\r\n\r\njob fair was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  attempt to bring employers who are still recruiting  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, and very often at the community centre itself, and to\r\n\r\nbring  people living in the vicinity of the community centre  to\r\n\r\ncome  down if they need job assistance.  We found the job  fairs\r\n\r\nto  be quite useful in helping unemployed Singaporeans look  for\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also benefited from the support given to us by the\r\n\r\nvarious  community self-help groups.  For instance, MENDAKI  and\r\n\r\neven  AMP  have actively participated in some of our  employment\r\n\r\nexercises.   Likewise, SINDA and CDAC have also participated  in\r\n\r\nhelping   to   act   as  surrogate  employers   for   unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who need to go for further training before they can\r\n\r\ntake  on  new jobs.  So, in the Skills Redevelopment  Programme,\r\n\r\nwe,  in  fact,  were  able to work with the community  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  such  as MENDAKI, SINDA and CDAC whereby  the  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  will  take on the role of employers for  the  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and put them through the SRP programme,  providing\r\n\r\nthe  financial  support  for them,  so  that  they  can  undergo\r\n\r\ntraining to take on new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDISAVE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Contribution rate)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether he will consider lowering the Medisave contribution rate\r\n\r\nfor Central Provident Fund (CPF) members aged 60 years and above\r\n\r\nso  that  they have sufficient funds in the CPF Ordinary Account\r\n\r\nto pay for housing mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nrecognises that as a result of the CPF reduction implemented  on\r\n\r\n1st  January 1999, CPF members who have committed all their  CPF\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account  savings to housing would need  assistance  to\r\n\r\ntide  over  the difficult period.  It is with this in mind  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has introduced the bridging loan  scheme  and  a\r\n\r\nrange  of  HDB assistance measures to help CPF members  who  are\r\n\r\naffected  by the CPF reduction.  These measures help to minimise\r\n\r\nthe impact of the reduction in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account  contributions  on  CPF  members'  ability  to\r\n\r\nservice their housing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th June 1999, 126 CPF members have applied for the\r\n\r\nbridging  loan  scheme.  89 of them are  for  the  servicing  of\r\n\r\nprivate property mortgage loans.  This is less than 0.1% of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number  of  CPF members who are fully or partially  using\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  savings  to service their private property  mortgage\r\n\r\nloans.   The balance 37 CPF members who applied for the bridging\r\n\r\nloan  are HDB mortgagors on market interest rate.  According  to\r\n\r\nHDB  records, from December 1998 to May 1999, slightly less than\r\n\r\n10,000  HDB  mortgagors (about 2% of total HDB mortgagors)  have\r\n\r\nbeen  assisted under the various HDB assistance measures.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures  include the rescheduling of mortgage loan instalments,\r\n\r\nconverting mortgage loans to reduced repayment scheme,  allowing\r\n\r\nworking  family members as joint-owners to help settle  mortgage\r\n\r\narrears  or  requesting  HDB to allow  mortgage  arrears  to  be\r\n\r\nsettled  by  instalment plan.  The CPF cut has thus  not  caused\r\n\r\nsevere difficulties to many CPF members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it will not be appropriate to reduce the Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for CPF members who are aged 60 and above.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  they are the ones who need more savings in their Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount.   The Medisave contribution rate of 6-8 per cent  takes\r\n\r\ninto  account the greater need for CPF members to save for their\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  expenses as they grow older.   The  Member  for\r\n\r\nHougang may wish to know that if a CPF member's Medisave Account\r\n\r\nhas   reached  $22,000,  any  additional  contributions  to  his\r\n\r\nMedisave  Account will overflow automatically into his  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount.   This  will  avoid an excessive build-up  of  Medisave\r\n\r\nbalance  and  allow  the  members the  flexibility  to  use  the\r\n\r\ncontributions for housing or other purposes.  For these reasons,\r\n\r\nwe will maintain the Medisave contribution rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Does the Minister agree that\r\n\r\neven before the economic downturn when the CPF rate was cut, CPF\r\n\r\nmembers who have reached\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  age of 60 and above, their total CPF contribution was  15%,\r\n\r\nand  8%  of the 15% had to be contributed to Medisave,  which  I\r\n\r\nthink  renders  very little money in their Ordinary  Account  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  housing loan?  So for those who are still  serving\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgage loans and have difficulty in paying,  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider allowing these people to temporarily  give  a\r\n\r\nlesser  contribution  to Medisave to help  them  tide  over  the\r\n\r\nperiod?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reduction in the\r\n\r\nCPF contribution for those who are aged 60 and above has been in\r\n\r\nplace  for  some  time  already.  So CPF  members  who  purchase\r\n\r\nproperty  should  have made their calculation on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\ntheir  existing CPF contribution.  When we raised the retirement\r\n\r\nage  from  60  to  62 effective this year, there  was  a  slight\r\n\r\nreduction in CPF contribution for those aged above 60.  But that\r\n\r\nwas a very, very small adjustment only and would not have caused\r\n\r\nadditional  difficulties  to those CPF  members  who  are  still\r\n\r\nservicing their mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my answer, in fact, the 8%\r\n\r\ncontribution for older CPF members is really necessary,  because\r\n\r\nthey  are the ones who are most in need of accumulating  savings\r\n\r\nto meet their medical expenses.  If we were to allow them to use\r\n\r\nthese Medisave savings to finance their mortgage loans, we might\r\n\r\nexpose  them  to other dangers later on if they should  suddenly\r\n\r\nfall  ill and need to be hospitalised.  They would still end  up\r\n\r\nfacing  a problem.  So it is better for us to remain focused  on\r\n\r\nwhat we are trying to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Medisave for? Medisave is for you to save to\r\n\r\nprepare   for  your  hospitalisation  expenses.   If  you   have\r\n\r\nsufficient  CPF  contribution now, even with the reduction,  you\r\n\r\nshould  emphasise on putting aside the amount that you need  for\r\n\r\nyour  medical expenses.  That is first priority.  The  rest,  if\r\n\r\nyou  have  additional savings left over to  service  your  loan,\r\n\r\nfine, by all means.  If you have other difficulties, eg, if  you\r\n\r\nare  in a HDB flat, as I have already explained, there are  many\r\n\r\nmeasures offered by HDB to assist home owners\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho have difficulty paying their mortgage loans.  If you are  in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector, when I look at the figure, it  is  such  a\r\n\r\nsmall  percentage of people who are affected  and  who  have  to\r\n\r\napply  for  the bridging loan.  If they want to, more  can  come\r\n\r\nforward.   They  are welcome to come forward and apply  for  the\r\n\r\nbridging loan, and we will help them through the bridging  loan,\r\n\r\nrather  than erode the savings for medical expenses  which  they\r\n\r\nwould need sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN NEWSPAPER EDITORIALS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Policy)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Information and\r\n\r\nthe  Arts  whether the Ministry's policy is that all newspapers,\r\n\r\nbeing  private  entities, must restrict  opinions  expressed  in\r\n\r\ntheir  editorials  to strictly conform with  Government  policy,\r\n\r\nespecially as regards views expressed on our ASEAN neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MITA does not control the editorial\r\n\r\nline  of our newspapers, which are independent private entities.\r\n\r\nHowever,  editorial independence does not mean complete  freedom\r\n\r\nto  write  as  they desire.

The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation will make school places available, but parents and the\r\n\r\nfamily  must want to send their children to school.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nfamily's  responsibility.   Making  education  compulsory   will\r\n\r\nundermine  the principle of self-reliance and sense of  parental\r\n\r\nresponsibility which undergirds society; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Even if we legislate compulsory education for all\r\n\r\nchildren  of  school-going age, that does not in  itself  ensure\r\n\r\nattendance, much less motivation.  Enforcement becomes  a  major\r\n\r\nissue.   Jailing  or fining parents who fail to  register  their\r\n\r\nchildren,  or  who do not send their children  to  school  after\r\n\r\nregistration,  is unlikely to solve the problem,  and  may  even\r\n\r\nmake  matters  worse  for the child and the family.   Compulsory\r\n\r\neducation does not solve the root problem, and it may merely re-surface in another form, such as absenteeism or truancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great concern that children who do not attend\r\n\r\nschools  will be disadvantaged as Singapore becomes a  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.  This is a concern which my Ministry shares.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to work with MCD and other organisations to  persuade,\r\n\r\nencourage  and help parents to enroll their children in  school.\r\n\r\nThis is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nultimately   a   more  effective  way  than   making   education\r\n\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister  about balancing the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  and the school.

That is a much larger  question\r\n\r\nthat goes beyond compulsory education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am not in favour of compulsory\r\n\r\neducation  either.  But I think that we should be interested  in\r\n\r\nthe  best interest of the child.  Let me ask the Minister  then.\r\n\r\nIn  the question of follow-up in the Annex that is given to  us,\r\n\r\nif I add the figures for items 3, 4, 5 and 6, in item 3 (Parents\r\n\r\nresponded  to  letter but did not specify  very  much),  item  4\r\n\r\n(Addresses  not  available),  item  5  (Parents  could  not   be\r\n\r\ncontacted  at  the  address stated) and  item  6  (Parents  have\r\n\r\ndivorced and whereabouts of child are not known), may I ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister, given that this is over 50% of the figures,  will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry further follow up?  Surely it is possible for  the  SIR\r\n\r\nor  other  Government agencies to update the  addresses  and  to\r\n\r\npursue the parents and the children?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, first, I will comment on the way\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member has added up the numbers.  Item  3  should  be\r\n\r\nadded  to the first two items, ie, items 1 and 2, that is, these\r\n\r\nfamilies  have indicated that their children are attending  some\r\n\r\nform of schooling or other.  So item\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n3  should be added to items 1 and 2 and you will get about  75%.\r\n\r\nFor  items  4,  5  and 6 where the parents'  addresses  are  not\r\n\r\navailable in the record, parents could not be contacted  at  the\r\n\r\naddress stated and parents have divorced and whereabouts of  the\r\n\r\nchild  are not known, we will take whatever measures we  can  to\r\n\r\ntrace  the  children.  As I said, we have a record of all  these\r\n\r\nchildren and we actually go to quite some length to follow up on\r\n\r\neach  of them.  And I think that is a better way of dealing with\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  trying to get as many children as possible  into\r\n\r\nschool  than  some  blanket formula, like compulsory  education,\r\n\r\nwhich looks nice but is not going to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, item\r\n\r\n5  in the Annex says that parents could not be contacted at  the\r\n\r\naddress  stated.   The  Minister  just  now  has  addressed  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   May  I  ask  the Minister whether  he  will  consider\r\n\r\nspeaking  to the neighbours of these people to find out  whether\r\n\r\nthey  could  be contacted because the figure is quite  alarming?\r\n\r\nAt least, other steps should be taken to address this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I leave it to the people on the\r\n\r\nground  to do this.  These are quite dedicated people  and  they\r\n\r\nare  interested in wanting to get the children to go to  school.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  what  we  are doing is that we especially  hire  some\r\n\r\nretired teachers and give them the list and ask them to  go  and\r\n\r\ntry and trace these children.  These people are quite dedicated.\r\n\r\nThey have the interest of the children at heart and they do  try\r\n\r\ntheir best to find them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, despite what the\r\n\r\nMinister has said, I remember not long ago the then Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation said that there were 2,900 students who had  not  been\r\n\r\nenrolled in schools but now the Minister has given the figure of\r\n\r\n1,500.   Why  is there this contradiction?  That  is  the  first\r\n\r\nquestion.   The  other  point is that  the  Minister  says  that\r\n\r\neducation  is a family responsibility.  The fact that the  state\r\n\r\nhas educational\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfacilities for these children, does the Minister not think  that\r\n\r\nthe state is in fact irresponsible by not getting these children\r\n\r\nto  school?   How  can  a child be thrown into  society  without\r\n\r\nlearning how to read and write?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I am unable to answer the\r\n\r\nMember's  first  question because I do not quite understand  it.\r\n\r\nOn the second question that the Member has asked, I have already\r\n\r\nexplained  that.   There should be a balance of responsibilities\r\n\r\nbetween  the  state  and  the family.  The  state  provides  the\r\n\r\nplaces.   The  families  should want to  send  the  children  to\r\n\r\nschool.  And we take quite extraordinary measures to track  them\r\n\r\ndown and encourage them to come to school.  While we want all of\r\n\r\nthem  to  come  to  school,  I do not  believe  that  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation itself is going to solve the problem.  What do  we  do\r\n\r\nif  the parents do not wish to send their children to school for\r\n\r\nsome  reason  or other?  Do we jail them?  Do we fine  them?   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  will  make the problem worse.   You  break  up  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   So  while we want to encourage all these  children  to\r\n\r\ncome  to school, we need something which is more than compulsory\r\n\r\neducation.  Compulsory education is not a magic bullet which, if\r\n\r\nwe   enact,  will  suddenly  see  all  the  children  in  school\r\n\r\nmiraculously.   In fact, what we are doing is quite  a  sensible\r\n\r\nand  reasonable approach, ie, to encourage as many  children  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  come  to  school, I think we have  achieved  quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable success.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that the\r\n\r\nparamount  interest must be the child?  Even if  the  family  is\r\n\r\nbroken up because the state wants the child to be in school  and\r\n\r\none of the parents says no, does the Minister not think that the\r\n\r\ninterest of the child should come first?  If the family is going\r\n\r\nto  be  broken  up,  so be it.  But the child  must  receive  an\r\n\r\neducation, otherwise he will be disadvantaged for the  whole  of\r\n\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I am not sure everyone would agree\r\n\r\nwith the Member's assertion that the family must be broken up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Is the Minister  not\r\n\r\naware that in a great many other areas, compulsion is brought on\r\n\r\nadults to do whatever the Government thinks should be done,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  topping up Medisave.  Licences are not renewed  unless\r\n\r\npeople  go  and top up their Medisave?  Is that not a compulsion\r\n\r\neven when they cannot afford to top up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in some cases, this\r\n\r\nwill  work,  but in other cases, it will not.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\ncompulsion to attend school, I do not think it is going to  work\r\n\r\nbecause  it depends on a larger series of things to be in  place\r\n\r\nfirst.  I  can compel or I can try to compel children to  be  in\r\n\r\nschool,  but  I  cannot compel them to be looked after  properly\r\n\r\nwhen  they are at home for 18 hours.  A lot of things can happen\r\n\r\nduring that period of time.  As I have explained, compulsion  to\r\n\r\nsend children to school will not necessarily mean that they will\r\n\r\nbe  in  school  because there will be other  issues  then,  like\r\n\r\nabsenteeism,  truancy, and so forth, which will  not  be  solved\r\n\r\nmerely by enacting legislation or putting in place the rule that\r\n\r\nsays that all children must be in school.  If we could magically\r\n\r\nsolve that problem, I will be the first to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I am still not convinced by\r\n\r\nthe  rationale.

And  I\r\n\r\nthink many of us feel that children should not be made to suffer\r\n\r\nsimply  because their parents do not send them  to  school.   In\r\n\r\nwhich  case,  if  it  needs legislation to  have  some  sort  of\r\n\r\ncompulsion  to enable the state or the authority to  send  those\r\n\r\nchildren  to  school,  so be it.

If  you  have  irresponsible\r\n\r\nparents  who  have  children  and they  do  not  bring  them  up\r\n\r\nproperly, compulsory education on its own is not going to  solve\r\n\r\nthe  problem.

The\r\n\r\nsupplement  will bring the total provision for EOI  in  FY98  to\r\n\r\n$247 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FY98 provision for expenses on investments was $227\r\n\r\nmillion.

Except for six brokers\r\n\r\nwho are registered under section 36(6) of the Insurance Act (Cap\r\n\r\n142) for the purpose of placing business with Lloyd's in London,\r\n\r\nthe rest of the brokers and agents operate under self-regulatory\r\n\r\nsystems maintained by their relevant trade associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While self-regulation has been satisfactory so far, MAS has\r\n\r\nfelt  the  need to supervise brokers' activities and to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe   quality  and  professionalism  of  insurance  brokers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Licensing  would enable MAS to  have  oversight  of\r\n\r\ninsurance  brokers' activities and conduct, thus furthering  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  policyholders'  interests  and  ensuring  proper\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the insurance industry. Countries like the United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and certain  states  in\r\n\r\nthe United States have, similarly, enacted legislation to govern\r\n\r\ninsurance brokers' activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than incorporating the new requirements for\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  brokers  in  the Insurance  Act,  the  Government\r\n\r\nproposes  the enactment of a separate legislation. The rationale\r\n\r\nis  that  the  activities of insurance brokers are substantially\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  those of insurance companies. In  drafting  the\r\n\r\nproposed legislation, MAS has had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseveral rounds of consultation with relevant trade associations.\r\n\r\nThe  insurance  industry  generally welcomes  and  supports  the\r\n\r\nproposed licensing of insurance brokers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will highlight the key provisions of the Bill. Clause 3\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill makes it an offence for any person to  act  as  an\r\n\r\ninsurance agent for a registered insurer unless he has a written\r\n\r\nagency  contract  with  that  insurer.   Similarly,  clause   12\r\n\r\nprohibits any person from carrying on insurance broking business\r\n\r\nunless it is registered with MAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All licensed insurance brokers are required, under clauses\r\n\r\n17  and  21, to maintain minimum paid-up capital and  net  asset\r\n\r\nvalue  of  50%  of minimum paid-up capital at all times.   These\r\n\r\nrequirements  are  necessary so as  to  establish  the  brokers'\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  operate in Singapore and  to  ensure  that  they\r\n\r\npossess a minimum level of financial assets. Further, to protect\r\n\r\nthe   insuring  public  against  wrongful  advice  and   against\r\n\r\nsuffering  any  financial  loss due to  brokers'  negligence  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  their duties, all brokers are  required  to  have\r\n\r\nprofessional indemnity insurance covers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As insurance brokers are holding clients' and insurers'\r\n\r\nmoneys  in trust, it is imperative that brokers maintain  proper\r\n\r\naccounts  of  these moneys.  Clause 22 requires all  brokers  to\r\n\r\nmaintain separate bank account(s) with a bank(s) licensed  under\r\n\r\nthe Banking Act.  All premium receipts and claim moneys received\r\n\r\nby  brokers  on  behalf of their clients must be duly  deposited\r\n\r\ninto these accounts and only specified withdrawals can be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary for insurance intermediaries to collect\r\n\r\npremiums   from  policyholders  for  payment  to  the  insurers.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  insurance claim payments may be  made  to  claimants\r\n\r\nthrough  the  intermediaries. In order to protect policyholders'\r\n\r\nand   claimants'  interests,  clause  4  stipulates  that  where\r\n\r\npremiums  are  paid by a policyholder to an insurer  through  an\r\n\r\nintermediary, the payment will be considered as a  discharge  of\r\n\r\nthe policyholder's liability to the insurer up to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\namount of the payment. However, where an insurer transmits claim\r\n\r\npayments  to  a  claimant through an intermediary,  the  insurer\r\n\r\nremains liable to the claimant for those moneys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 restricts a registered insurance broker from\r\n\r\nreceiving,  and prohibits insurers from giving, any remuneration\r\n\r\nto  the broker that is tied to the broker's business volume, for\r\n\r\nexample, production bonuses which are paid on achieving  certain\r\n\r\nlevels  of business volume. This clause is to minimise  conflict\r\n\r\nof  interest  between brokers and their clients as  well  as  to\r\n\r\nenable brokers to uphold their independence and professionalism.\r\n\r\nIf  an  insurer offers production bonuses to a broker, this  may\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  broker to place more of its business  with  that\r\n\r\ninsurer,  against  its duty to source for best  covers  for  its\r\n\r\nclients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the control of appointment of\r\n\r\nkey persons, that is, chief executive officers and directors  of\r\n\r\nbroking firms.  Clause 25 requires brokers to seek MAS' approval\r\n\r\nbefore  allowing any interested party to acquire 20% or more  of\r\n\r\nits voting share capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 33 allow MAS to require returns, inspect\r\n\r\ninsurance intermediaries or any persons suspected of carrying on\r\n\r\ninsurance  broking business in Singapore, issue  directions  and\r\n\r\nwind  up  the  affairs  of  a registered  broker.  MAS  is  also\r\n\r\nempowered  under  clause  41 to make regulations  generally  for\r\n\r\ncarrying out the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill carries a transitional provision to deal with\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  employed  in the insurance  broking  business\r\n\r\nbefore  the  enactment of the Act. To ensure that  the  proposed\r\n\r\nlicensing does not pose undue difficulties on existing  brokers,\r\n\r\nthey  would be given six months to seek and obtain the necessary\r\n\r\napprovals from MAS to continue conducting their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of the Bill which would help raise the professional\r\n\r\nstandards  of intermediaries and hence the insurance  sector  at\r\n\r\nlarge. Equally noteworthy are the provisions to be put in  place\r\n\r\nso  that  the  insured,  that is the end-users,  are  adequately\r\n\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains a need to clarify the extent of recourse\r\n\r\navailable to an insurance company in the event of default by  an\r\n\r\nintermediary with specific reference to the broker intermediary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4(1) and (2) effectively discharge the insured\r\n\r\nand  intending  insured  from  any  liability  to  make  further\r\n\r\npayments  to the insurer if moneys, such as premiums payable  to\r\n\r\nthe insurer, have already been paid by them to the intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile these provisions protect the insured, albeit to the extent\r\n\r\nof  moneys  already paid, the insurer is bereft of any  recourse\r\n\r\nunder these provisions for moneys due to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, under clause 4(3), an insurer who pays\r\n\r\nto the intermediary, moneys such as claims or return of premiums\r\n\r\nmeant for the insured party, remains liable to the insured until\r\n\r\nreceipt  by the insured.  Likewise, the insurer has no  recourse\r\n\r\nunder these provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this could imply an assumption of liability by the\r\n\r\ninsurer for which he has little control over, particularly  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  insurance  brokers.  Unlike agents  over  whom  the\r\n\r\ninsurer  can  exercise  some level of  control,  brokers  are  a\r\n\r\ndifferent entity altogether.  Insurers have no jurisdiction over\r\n\r\nbrokers' functions and actions.  Although clause 2(1) gives  the\r\n\r\ndefinitions  of insurance agent and insurance broker,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  silent  on their explicit responsibilities  and\r\n\r\nliabilities vis-a-vis the insurer and the insured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above comments for which I seek the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister's clarifications, I support the intent  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish to refer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspecifically  to clause 23 of the Insurance Intermediaries  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich states in no uncertain terms that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No registered insurance broker shall, in the course of its\r\n\r\nbusiness  as such, negotiate any contract of insurance with  the\r\n\r\ninsurer (whether directly or through an insurance intermediary),\r\n\r\nexcept  with  a registered insurer acting in the course  of  his\r\n\r\nbusiness as such.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References to \"contract of insurance\" are further spelt out\r\n\r\nin  subclause  (3)  as  not applicable  to  the  reinsurance  or\r\n\r\nbusiness  relating to risks outside Singapore.   Notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that Singapore intends to provide local insurers  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  write  business,  the  restriction  creates   a\r\n\r\nposition  where  Singapore shipowners  are  forced  into  paying\r\n\r\nuncompetitive  local  rates for certain  specialised  insurance.\r\n\r\nMarine hull insurance is an example which I will elaborate on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am personally involved in the shipping business and am\r\n\r\nconversant  with the procedures whereby insurance intermediaries\r\n\r\nobtain  quotations on marine hull insurance.  The quotations  by\r\n\r\nthe overseas insurers on marine hull insurance can sometimes  be\r\n\r\nonly  50%  or  one-third of the quotations obtained  from  local\r\n\r\ninsurers  and yet the insurance intermediaries will be bound  by\r\n\r\nclause  23 of the Insurance Intermediaries Bill to engage  local\r\n\r\ninsurers even if their rates are extremely uncompetitive  vis-a-vis  the  overseas  insurers as long as they have  supplied  the\r\n\r\nquotations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subclause (5) does provide for exceptions where the MAS\r\n\r\nwill  grant approval by reason of exceptional nature of the risk\r\n\r\nor  other exceptional circumstances.  However, in practice,  the\r\n\r\nshipping  industry  has not benefited from such  approvals  from\r\n\r\nMAS.    Singapore's  financial  industry  has  been   undergoing\r\n\r\nderegulation and liberalisation with the removal of barriers  to\r\n\r\nfull  foreign  participation  in the  domestic  banking  sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  measures would be taken to liberalise the  insurance\r\n\r\nsector to fully develop Singapore as a regional financial hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Intermediaries Bill does not appear to make\r\n\r\nsufficient provisions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  this.  If local insurers supplying uncompetitive rates  are\r\n\r\ngiven  undue protection under this Bill, Singapore's  shipowners\r\n\r\nwould be greatly disadvantaged.  I believe that it is imperative\r\n\r\nfor  the Singapore shipping community to take advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  competitive rates available worldwide. At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  local insurance intermediaries should be given the  liberty\r\n\r\nto  source quotations from overseas insurers.  It appears to  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  principle  embodied in clause  23  is  tantamount  to\r\n\r\nprotectionism of the local insurers.  Surely, this  is  contrary\r\n\r\nto  the  fundamental tenets of an open economy  which  Singapore\r\n\r\nchampions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to refer to clause 24 of the Bill which relates\r\n\r\nto  the  restriction  of  receipt  and  payment  of  any  gifts,\r\n\r\ngratuities,  benefits or other rewards (however  described)  for\r\n\r\nthe  services of a registered insurance broker.  In other words,\r\n\r\ninsurance   intermediaries,  specifically  registered  insurance\r\n\r\nbrokers, will be prohibited from receiving an \"incentive  bonus\"\r\n\r\nfrom the insurance companies which they deal with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many small and medium-sized insurance broking firms are\r\n\r\nreceiving  such  an  \"incentive  bonus\"  from  the  insurers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Moreover, this form of remuneration  is  acceptable\r\n\r\nand  has  always  formed  part of the remuneration  received  by\r\n\r\ninsurance  brokers.  The incentive bonus paid to  the  insurance\r\n\r\nbrokers has not caused problems to the insurers, neither has  it\r\n\r\nprejudiced  the insuring public.  If clause 24 is  passed,  this\r\n\r\nwould  mean  the  loss of an estimated 20%  of  income  to  each\r\n\r\naffected   insurance   broking  firm,  resulting   in   possible\r\n\r\nretrenchment of their employees and translates into the loss  of\r\n\r\nan important source of revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a regulatory framework is indeed\r\n\r\nnecessary.  However, over- regulation in business practices will\r\n\r\nunfortunately stifle business initiative.  Singapore  businesses\r\n\r\nneed  to  have a certain leeway to survive, thrive and excel  in\r\n\r\nthe  global  marketplace.   Where appropriate,  they  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to operate within a reasonable market practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that MAS conducts a thorough review of the\r\n\r\ninsurance industry and how it is performing its role of  serving\r\n\r\nthe rest of the business community with a view to amending those\r\n\r\nlaws  which  are  no  longer appropriate for  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as an international business hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the exception of clauses 23 and 24,\r\n\r\ngiven   the   foregoing   reasons,  I  support   the   Insurance\r\n\r\nIntermediaries Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  assumption of liabilities of insurers on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nbrokers.  She said that she could understand why insurers  would\r\n\r\nassume  liabilities on behalf of agents, but does  not  see  why\r\n\r\nthey should do so on behalf of brokers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill holds insurers accountable for\r\n\r\nliabilities  of  agents  and  brokers  in  respect  of  premiums\r\n\r\ncollected  from  policyholders by the intermediaries  and  claim\r\n\r\npayments  made  to claimants through intermediaries.   It  deems\r\n\r\npremiums received by an intermediary as having been received  by\r\n\r\nthe  insurer, but the insurer remains liable to the claimant for\r\n\r\nany claims monies made through an intermediary.  Basically, this\r\n\r\nis  a consumer protection measure, because it seeks, firstly, to\r\n\r\nprotect  consumers from paying premiums a second time  where  an\r\n\r\nintermediary  does not pass the money on to the  insurer.   And,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  to  ensure  that  the claimants  will  receive  their\r\n\r\npayments  where  an  intermediary fails to transmit  the  claims\r\n\r\nmoney.  The boundary between the insured and the insurer is  put\r\n\r\non  the  side of the intermediary.  The intermediary is  on  the\r\n\r\ninsurer's side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is applicable to both brokers and agents, as\r\n\r\nit  is also found in the Australian Insurance Agents and Brokers\r\n\r\nAct, 1984.  It is deliberately designed to apply to both brokers\r\n\r\nas well as agents, because whether or not an insurance broker is\r\n\r\nonly the agent of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninsured  depends on the facts and circumstances of a  particular\r\n\r\ncase and the type of the insurance business, and the common  law\r\n\r\nrule is that in some cases, the broker may actually be acting as\r\n\r\nan agent for the insurer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan raised two questions. The first one has\r\n\r\nto  do  with  basically  marine hull insurance.   First,  may  I\r\n\r\nclarify that there is no restriction whatsoever on a person  who\r\n\r\nwishes  to  place  insurance  risk  directly  with  an  overseas\r\n\r\ninsurer.   If the rates are more competitive, you may choose  to\r\n\r\ngo  there, and that includes shipping companies or anybody else.\r\n\r\nBut an overseas insurer is not licensed to operate in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAn unlicensed insurer is not allowed to write domestic Singapore\r\n\r\nrisks.    This   restriction  is  similar  to   that   of   most\r\n\r\njurisdictions, including the US.  So clauses 7  and  23  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  essentially  ensure that neither brokers  nor  agents  are\r\n\r\nallowed   to  assist  unlicensed  insurers  to  write   domestic\r\n\r\nSingapore risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a lack of expertise or capacity in the local\r\n\r\ninsurance industry, MAS will grant exemption for the risks to be\r\n\r\nplaced  directly  with overseas insurers.  And the  majority  of\r\n\r\nrisks  that  have  been granted exemptions are marine  hull  and\r\n\r\nliability  risks.  The statistics for the last three years  show\r\n\r\nthis.   For  example, in 1998, we received 160 applications  for\r\n\r\nexemptions  for lack of expertise or capacity locally.   Out  of\r\n\r\nthese 160 applications, 158 were approved.  For marine hull  and\r\n\r\nliability, we received 49 applications last year, and  all  were\r\n\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the need to develop marine hull and liability\r\n\r\nexpertise  and  to increase the local capacity  so  as  to  help\r\n\r\ndevelop  Singapore's international maritime  hub.   So  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the  lead  to  attract specialist  maritime  insurers  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  we have also provided tax incentives  for  their\r\n\r\noffshore marine and hull liability business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggested that we should undertake an overall\r\n\r\nreview  of  the  insurance industry and  the  legislation  which\r\n\r\napplies to it.  This is indeed what we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  in  the  process of doing.  MAS is currently reviewing  our\r\n\r\nadmission policy on insurers and we hope we will have some clear\r\n\r\nconclusions within a few months.  But even if we are to open  up\r\n\r\nthe  insurance  market  in  Singapore,  no  overseas  unlicensed\r\n\r\ninsurers will be allowed to operate in Singapore unless they are\r\n\r\nregistered  with MAS.  This upholds the principles of  insurance\r\n\r\nregulations of the international regulators, because if they are\r\n\r\nnot licensed and they operate here and something goes wrong, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be responsible.  If they are overseas and you go\r\n\r\nand  look  for them, that is you are taking it on yourself,  but\r\n\r\nthey are not operating in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised a question of gifts, gratuities,\r\n\r\nbenefits  and other rewards from insurance brokers.   I  presume\r\n\r\nthat   when  Mr  Tay  refers  to  \"incentive  bonus\",  he  means\r\n\r\neverything  received by the broker other than the  brokerage  or\r\n\r\nthe  fee.  Clause 24 of the Bill seeks to prohibit brokers  from\r\n\r\nreceiving  any payments from an insurer including gifts,  except\r\n\r\nas  remuneration for services rendered in arranging a particular\r\n\r\ncontract  of insurance or settling a claim.  And the payment  in\r\n\r\nsuch cases cannot vary according to the number of contracts, the\r\n\r\namount  of  premiums  or sums insured that  are  placed  with  a\r\n\r\nparticular insurer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause prohibits the giving of production bonus which\r\n\r\nis  tied solely to the broker's business volume.  This bonus  is\r\n\r\npaid  to brokers for achieving certain levels of business volume\r\n\r\nwith a particular insurer.  The rationale for the prohibition is\r\n\r\nthat when an insurer offers such production bonuses to a broker,\r\n\r\nit is likely to influence that broker to place most, if not all,\r\n\r\nof  its business with that insurer, whereas, in fact, the broker\r\n\r\nhas  a  duty  to  his client to source for the most  appropriate\r\n\r\ncover  and  terms  for his client.  Such a restriction  is  also\r\n\r\nfound  in the Australian Insurance Agents and Brokers Act, 1984.\r\n\r\nAgain,  the objective in the Australian legislation is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  broker's impartiality is not influenced by incentives\r\n\r\nor  volume-based  remuneration and to ensure that  the  broker's\r\n\r\nobligation to his client is not compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, other than volume-based incentive bonuses,\r\n\r\nbrokers  are  not  prohibited  from  receiving  other  types  of\r\n\r\nincentives such as profit commissions and persistency bonuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  -   [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>1.57 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Act was last amended in 1993. With the\r\n\r\npromulgation of the Insurance Intermediaries Bill 1999 which  we\r\n\r\nhave  just dealt with, consequential amendments have to be  made\r\n\r\nto  the Insurance Act.  At the same time, several amendments are\r\n\r\nalso proposed which are aimed at clarifying the scope of present\r\n\r\nregulatory requirements and to reflect current practices in  the\r\n\r\ninsurance industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the provisions in the Insurance Act that relate to\r\n\r\nagents  and  brokers  will  be repealed  and  taken  up  in  the\r\n\r\nInsurance Intermediaries Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (section 5A) of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nrequires the setting up of new insurance representative  offices\r\n\r\nto  be  approved by MAS.  This control measure is  necessary  as\r\n\r\nrepresentative offices can easily underwrite insurance  business\r\n\r\nand  it  is  difficult to uncover such activities.  In addition,\r\n\r\nthe  clause  prohibits,  firstly,   any  persons  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding  staff  of  unregistered  insurers  or  any  of  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, from soliciting direct insurance  business  for\r\n\r\nthe  unregistered insurers; and, secondly, the establishment  of\r\n\r\nan  office  in  Singapore by any person to  solicit  reinsurance\r\n\r\nbusiness for unregistered insurers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 tightens the control of takeovers of insurers to\r\n\r\ninclude direct and indirect acquisition, holding or control  and\r\n\r\nacquisition  of  a right to shares under an option.   While  the\r\n\r\nInsurance  Act provides MAS with the power to control  takeovers\r\n\r\nand substantial changes in shareholdings of locally incorporated\r\n\r\ninsurers,  the power does not extend to holding companies.   The\r\n\r\namendment  widens  the  present  control  to  include   indirect\r\n\r\nshareholdings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard policyholders' interest and to discourage\r\n\r\ninsurers  from granting unsecured credit facilities to directors\r\n\r\nor employees, clause 10 broadens the restriction on the granting\r\n\r\nof  unsecured  loans by insurers to directors and  employees  to\r\n\r\ninclude grant of unsecured advances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 updates the description of Lloyd's. Lloyd's, a\r\n\r\nsociety  of  underwriters in the UK and incorporated  under  the\r\n\r\nLloyd's  Act  1871, is an approved insurer under  the  Insurance\r\n\r\nAct.   In  recent  years,  it  has  undergone  major  structural\r\n\r\nchanges.    Since   1994,  it  has  been   admitting   corporate\r\n\r\nmemberships.   Unlike  the  original  Lloyd's  members  who  are\r\n\r\nindividuals,  the  corporate  members  can  either  be   limited\r\n\r\nliability   companies   or  partnerships.    Consequently,   the\r\n\r\ndescription  of  Lloyd's  in  the Insurance  Act  is  no  longer\r\n\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes, in clause 14, to clarify that where\r\n\r\na registered insurer becomes insolvent, priority of claims would\r\n\r\nbe  granted  to  policyholders on an individual  insurance  fund\r\n\r\nbasis.   Assets of an insurance fund would be used, firstly,  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  claims  of  its policyholders,  secondly,  the  other\r\n\r\ncreditors  of that fund; and, finally, any balance in that  fund\r\n\r\nwould  be released to other policyholders and creditors  of  the\r\n\r\ninsurer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for legal immunity of MAS and its\r\n\r\nemployees   in  the  course  of  carrying  out  its   regulatory\r\n\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 54 of the Insurance Act requires MAS\r\n\r\nto prepare and submit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto the Minister an annual report on the working of the Insurance\r\n\r\nAct  for  presentation to Parliament.  Section 54 is  no  longer\r\n\r\nrelevant and clause 16 seeks to repeal this provision.  Prior to\r\n\r\n1977,  the  Insurance Department (ID) was under the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance   and   its  annual  report  was  intended   to   ensure\r\n\r\naccountability.  The Insurance Department was transferred to MAS\r\n\r\non 1st April 1977, and with effect from 1st April 1998, has been\r\n\r\nbrought  under  MAS'  Financial  Supervision  Group  to   enable\r\n\r\nconsolidated supervision of all financial institutions.   It  is\r\n\r\nno  longer necessary for the Insurance Department to present  an\r\n\r\nindependent  report to Parliament as MAS submits a comprehensive\r\n\r\nannual report, including the same matters required under section\r\n\r\n54, to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXCHANGES (DEMUTUALISATION AND MERGER) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, exchanges are facing new forces of\r\n\r\nchange.   They  must contend with increasing global  competition\r\n\r\nfrom  existing and new players, and investors who  demand  cheap\r\n\r\nand  efficient  channels  for trading.  New  electronic  trading\r\n\r\nsystems  are  executing trades between large market participants\r\n\r\nat  low cost, bypassing the exchanges.  Exchanges themselves are\r\n\r\nseeking  to  link  up  or  forge  alliances,  so  as  to  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive and to offer a wider menu of products to investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the stock and derivative exchanges, the Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  of  Singapore (\"SES\") and the Singapore  International\r\n\r\nMonetary  Exchange  (\"SIMEX\"), have thus  far  performed   well,\r\n\r\ncontributing  significantly to the development of our  financial\r\n\r\nmarkets,  and serving both regional and international investors.\r\n\r\nBut  Singapore's  exchanges must now  urgently  re-define  their\r\n\r\nstrategies  so as to remain viable and relevant,  and  to  serve\r\n\r\ninvestors  as cheaply and efficiently as technology  allows  and\r\n\r\nthe competition demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, I announced that the Government had\r\n\r\naccepted  the recommendations of the Committee on Governance  of\r\n\r\nthe  Exchanges. SES and SIMEX would be merged, and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime be demutualised, in other words, no longer run as a member-owned entity, but as a private, stock company accountable  to  a\r\n\r\nbroad range of shareholders.  These changes are essential if the\r\n\r\nexchanges  are to respond quickly to new challenges  and  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   A  merged exchange would also  be  able  to  reap\r\n\r\nbenefits in the future from a common user interface and  trading\r\n\r\nplatform.   It  would  also  be  able  to  offer  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nintegrated  products and services which cut  across  traditional\r\n\r\ncash and derivative asset classes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since November last year Hong Kong has also announced its\r\n\r\nintention  to  combine  and demutualise its  stock  and  futures\r\n\r\nexchanges.  The two exchanges have just agreed to the plan.  The\r\n\r\nHong  Kong Government has stated that unless the members of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  exchanges  vote  for the plan, the government  will  pursue\r\n\r\nmerger and reform through other means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, the Australian Stock Exchange, which went\r\n\r\npublic  a year ago, is seeking to merge with the Sydney  Futures\r\n\r\nExchange.   The  New York Stock Exchange and  the  London  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  have  both just announced their plans to  demutualise.\r\n\r\nThe  Financial  Times  quoted  one  London  stockbroker  saying:\r\n\r\n\"Running  an  exchange must be like living in  biblical  Jericho\r\n\r\nwith the walls falling down all around you.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transfer Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to demutualise and merge SES\r\n\r\nand  SIMEX.  The first part of this Bill deals with two matters.\r\n\r\nThe  first is the process of demutualising and merging  the  SES\r\n\r\nand  SIMEX.   The  second  is the placement  of  shares  of  the\r\n\r\ncombined  exchange  to  new investors.   The  approach  to  both\r\n\r\nmatters  has  been  endorsed by the  Pro-Tem  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nIntegrated Singapore Exchange (\"PTC\").\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demutualisation and merger of SES and SIMEX will be\r\n\r\neffected  by  a transfer of ownership from existing members  who\r\n\r\nhold  shares  in  SES  and  SIMEX to a  new  transferee  holding\r\n\r\ncompany, or Newco.  On Transfer Date, which is targeted for  1st\r\n\r\nDecember 1999, the existing shares of SES, SIMEX and SCCS  which\r\n\r\nare  currently held by the members will be cancelled.  (SCCS  is\r\n\r\nthe  computer arm of the SES jointly owned by SES itself and its\r\n\r\nSES's  26  local  members.  Since SCCS  is  not  a  wholly-owned\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  of  SES,  its  shares  will  have  to  be  cancelled\r\n\r\nseparately.)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time that these shares are cancelled, the three\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  issue  new shares  to  Newco.   In  return  for\r\n\r\ncancelling  their shares in SES and SIMEX, members  of  the  two\r\n\r\nexchanges will receive a fixed dollar amount of shares in Newco.\r\n\r\nEach  SES member will receive $6 million, and each SIMEX  member\r\n\r\n$170,000  for  every  seat owned and $115,000  for  every  share\r\n\r\nowned.    In aggregate, SES and SIMEX members will receive  $301\r\n\r\nmillion worth of shares.  SES and SIMEX members will thus become\r\n\r\nshareholders of Newco, and Newco will in turn own 100%  of  SES,\r\n\r\nSIMEX and SCCS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining shares of Newco will be placed with new\r\n\r\ninvestors.   The  share  placement will be  implemented  in  two\r\n\r\nsteps:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Newco will issue new shares to a pre-designated\r\n\r\nspecial-purpose company.  The special-purpose company will be  a\r\n\r\n\"shell\"  company  owned by Temasek.  It  will  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nexercise the voting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrights attached to the Newco shares, and will not be allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeal  in  Newco shares without the approval of the  Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge of MAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the special-purpose company will place Newco shares\r\n\r\nwith  new investors.  The proceeds from the sale of shares, less\r\n\r\nthe  par value and certain merger-related expenses, will  accrue\r\n\r\nto the Financial Sector Development Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial advisor to the Pro-Tem Committee (which is\r\n\r\nMerrill  Lynch) will establish a market value for  Newco  shares\r\n\r\nbased  on a book-building process.  The special-purpose  company\r\n\r\nwill,  however,  not  place out all  the  Newco  shares  in  one\r\n\r\nplacement.  It is intended that the first placement to local and\r\n\r\ninternational   financial  institutions,  as   well   as   other\r\n\r\ninvestors,  will  be  completed by Transfer Date.  The  special-purpose  company  will hold back a portion of Newco  shares  for\r\n\r\nsubsequent placements, including to strategic partners with whom\r\n\r\nthe integrated exchange may enter into alliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newco will not be publicly listed immediately. The PTC\r\n\r\nenvisages  an IPO in the medium term.  When Newco is  listed  on\r\n\r\nthe stock exchange, the Bill will provide that MAS will directly\r\n\r\nregulate  the listing and trading of Newco's shares.  This  will\r\n\r\nensure  that Newco will not face a conflict of interest when  it\r\n\r\nlists on its own subsidiary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Regulatory Provisions Governing Newco</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill establishes regulatory\r\n\r\nprovisions which govern Newco.  The exchanges are a key part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  financial  sector  infrastructure.   MAS  currently\r\n\r\nregulates  the SES and SIMEX under the Securities  Industry  Act\r\n\r\n(\"SIA\")  and the Futures Trading Act (\"FTA\"). Since  Newco  will\r\n\r\nown  and  run  the  exchanges, it is  in  Singapore's  strategic\r\n\r\ninterest  for  MAS  to also exercise some degree  of  regulatory\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  Newco.  The Securities Industry Act  and  Futures\r\n\r\nTrading Act will continue to apply to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNewco's   two   subsidiaries,  SES   and   SIMEX,   with   minor\r\n\r\nmodifications which I will mention later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not unduly constrain the new for-profit entity in\r\n\r\nthe  running  of its exchanges and the pursuit of  new  business\r\n\r\nopportunities.  The  regulatory provisions pertaining  to  Newco\r\n\r\ngive  MAS  power to issue directives in the interest of ensuring\r\n\r\nfair  and orderly securities and futures markets, and the proper\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  systemic risks.  This is necessary  for  MAS  to\r\n\r\nperform  its role as securities regulator, but is otherwise  not\r\n\r\nintended  to  impinge  on  Newco's  capacity  to  make  business\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also creates an avenue of appeal by Newco to the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court against any MAS action.  This is consonant with  the\r\n\r\nbroader  recommendation of the Corporate  Finance  Committee  to\r\n\r\nallow parties aggrieved by decisions of the securities regulator\r\n\r\nto have recourse to independent bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first directives that MAS will issue to Newco relate to\r\n\r\nits  corporate  governance.  MAS will require Newco  to  do  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to seek MAS approval for the appointments of both\r\n\r\nthe Chairman and CEO of the exchange.  These are key appointment\r\n\r\nholders  who define the strategic direction of the organisation,\r\n\r\nand its key risk management principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MAS will require Newco to set up a Nominating\r\n\r\nCommittee,  whose  purpose is to recommend appointments  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  and  key  management positions. The  appointment  of  all\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Nominating Committee will require MAS  approval.\r\n\r\nIt  is  common  for  international  exchanges  to  have  such  a\r\n\r\nNominating  Committee.  In Singapore, we have just introduced  a\r\n\r\nsimilar arrangement for the local banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, MAS approval will be required for individual\r\n\r\nshareholdings  that  exceed 5%.  MAS may  approve  shareholdings\r\n\r\nexceeding 5% subject to conditions, such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  requiring  further  approvals for  subsequent  increases  in\r\n\r\nshareholding above specified limits.  The 5% limit on individual\r\n\r\nshareholdings  prevents excessive ownership  by  any  one  party\r\n\r\nwithout  the regulator's knowledge. Its objective is similar  to\r\n\r\nlimits  imposed  on  other demutualised exchanges  such  as  the\r\n\r\nAustralian Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One consequence of these measures is that it will not be\r\n\r\nnecessary to cap foreign  investment in Newco.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These regulations will remain in the Exchanges\r\n\r\n(Demutualisation and Merger) Act until MAS review of  securities\r\n\r\nlegislation is complete in 12 to 18 months time.  The provisions\r\n\r\nfor  the  regulation of Newco could then be  migrated  into  new\r\n\r\nlegislation.   MAS  is currently undertaking  a  review  of  the\r\n\r\nstructure   of   securities   legislation,   to   follow-up   on\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by the Corporate Finance Committee (\"CFC\").\r\n\r\nIt  will  study  the  feasibility  of  integrating  the  current\r\n\r\nsecurities and futures trading legislation into one Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Establishment of the Financial Sector Development Fund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the Bill establishes a new Financial\r\n\r\nSector  Development Fund (\"Fund\") under the purview of MAS.    I\r\n\r\nhad  announced  the  establishment of  the  Fund  last  year  in\r\n\r\nNovember as part of the scheme to demutualise the two exchanges.\r\n\r\nThe  Fund will be the receptacle for the proceeds from the  sale\r\n\r\nof Newco shares to new investors, and monies in the Fund will be\r\n\r\nploughed back into the financial sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill defines clearly the objectives of the Fund. The\r\n\r\nmonies  in  the  Fund  will be used, amongst  other  things,  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and upgrade skills and expertise required by the capital\r\n\r\nmarkets  and  other components of the financial sector;  support\r\n\r\neducational  and  research institutions and R&D programmes,  and\r\n\r\nfund development of infrastructure and projects that support the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund will be administered by the MAS, and its\r\n\r\nactivities will be reported\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannually in the MAS Annual Report. MAS will announce details  in\r\n\r\ndue course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to the Securities Industry and Futures Trading Acts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final part of the Bill contains consequential\r\n\r\namendments  to the Securities Industry and Futures Trading  Acts\r\n\r\narising  from  the demutualisation and merger of the  exchanges.\r\n\r\nAll  references  to  \"member\" companies have  been  adjusted  to\r\n\r\nreflect  the  separation  of  ownership  and  membership.    The\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"securities\" in the Securities Industry  Act  is\r\n\r\nalso  being  expanded to include new instruments such  as  stock\r\n\r\nindex futures.  This will clarify that such new instruments  are\r\n\r\nallowed to be offered and traded on the new exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfully support this Bill.  As the Deputy Prime Minister has said,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will be beneficial to Singapore.  The  restructuring\r\n\r\nand merger of SES, SIMEX and SCCS will help the merged entity to\r\n\r\nbecome  a premier exchange in Asia and make Singapore a hub  for\r\n\r\nfinancial markets in the region.  The trend worldwide is towards\r\n\r\nthe  merger of exchanges, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said.\r\n\r\nWe  find  ourselves in an increasingly competitive  environment.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  compete not only with the other exchanges  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  but also against the major financial centres around  the\r\n\r\nworld.   Therefore,  creativity  and  product  innovations  will\r\n\r\nenable  the integrated Singapore Exchange to stay in  line  with\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, the creation of a single integrated\r\n\r\nprivately-held company through the merger of SIMEX and SES  will\r\n\r\nbe  completed by end 1999.  Then the open access of both SES and\r\n\r\nSIMEX  to qualified foreign investors and financial institutions\r\n\r\nwill  take place within three years by January 2002.  This  will\r\n\r\ncoincide  with  the  freeing of SES  commissions.   The  initial\r\n\r\npublic  offering (IPO) of the merged holding company  may  occur\r\n\r\nwithin five\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyears.   Since the proposed demutualisation and merger  will  be\r\n\r\nvery  beneficial to Singapore, I would like to  ask  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  whether  he  would  consider  speeding  up  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  assuming  the  various parts of  the  merger  exercise\r\n\r\nprogress expeditiously and smoothly and ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting three to five years for the entire process to run\r\n\r\nits  full  course  appears to be a long time.   Since  the  said\r\n\r\nresult  will  strengthen our pole position as  a  top  financial\r\n\r\ncentre  in  this region, it would be worthwhile  to  hasten  the\r\n\r\nprocess.    Moreover,   the  freeing  of  the   commissions   of\r\n\r\ntransactions  on  the  SES will benefit the ordinary  investors,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  small  retailers.   Of  course,  the  speed  of\r\n\r\nimplementation   depends  on  our  ability  to   find   suitable\r\n\r\nmanagement  for the merged entity and conduct training  for  the\r\n\r\nstaff and executives of the merged exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to refer to clause 13 of the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  pertains  to  the  regulatory  functions  of  the  merged\r\n\r\nexchange.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister how  he\r\n\r\nintends  to  separate the regulatory functions  of  this  merged\r\n\r\nentity  with its other interests.  As the entity will eventually\r\n\r\nbe  listed, it will have profit oriented objectives.  Hence,  if\r\n\r\nthe  integrated entity were to be responsible for  some  of  its\r\n\r\nregulatory  functions, areas of conflict of interest may  arise.\r\n\r\nThe  Deputy  Prime Minister has said that the new exchange  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to perform routine regulatory functions, like  listing\r\n\r\napprovals  and  market surveillance.  I am concerned  that  even\r\n\r\nsuch  regulatory functions may on occasions be at conflict  with\r\n\r\nthe  financial interest of the exchange.  As in the case of  the\r\n\r\ncorporatisation  of the Singapore Telecom, the Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard  and  others, when they were corporatised, the  Government\r\n\r\nset  up separate bodies to undertake their regulatory functions.\r\n\r\nIn  this  instance,  therefore,  I  wish  to  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nintegrated  exchange will continue to be a self-regulatory  body\r\n\r\nover the long term, or that the Government intends to ultimately\r\n\r\ntake over all the regulatory functions of this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexchange.   I  think this is important as the exchange  will  be\r\n\r\nlisted  in  about  five  years'  time.   The  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nshareholders, the broking houses, the management and the  public\r\n\r\nmay  not coincide.  Hence, I feel that an independent regulatory\r\n\r\nagency separate from the exchange should play the overseeing and\r\n\r\narbitration role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this merger is one of the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Governance  of  Exchanges.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\naccepted or agreed to study many of the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee.   I would like to take this opportunity  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister whether the MAS is ready to disclose  the\r\n\r\nresults of their study of the various recommendations, and  what\r\n\r\nare  the  further  changes,  if any,  to  be  expected  of  good\r\n\r\ncorporate   governance   practices  or   additional   disclosure\r\n\r\nrequirements of listed companies on the SES.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to clause 10 of the Bill which governs the\r\n\r\nproceeds  from  the  sale  of shares  of  the  holding  company.\r\n\r\nAccording to press reports, the proceeds from the opening of the\r\n\r\nnew  exchange to more new investors could amount to between $350\r\n\r\nmillion and $380 million.  The proceeds are a large sum of money\r\n\r\nwhich  should  be put into a Financial Sector Development  Fund.\r\n\r\nThe  stated usage is for training and upgrading of the financial\r\n\r\nindustry.  This amount of money seems quite substantial.  I wish\r\n\r\nto  enquire whether the Government wishes to, besides having the\r\n\r\nMAS  being involved in the management of the funds, allow  other\r\n\r\nfund managers; or perhaps allow some involvement of the exchange\r\n\r\nin  giving  its views as to how the funds can be used.   And  if\r\n\r\nthese  funds are ultimately not being fully utilised, would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider putting it to other uses, or putting it into\r\n\r\nthe Government Consolidated Fund?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by stating once again that I\r\n\r\nsupport  the Bill.  The questions that I have asked are to  seek\r\n\r\nfurther clarity on the functions and the related issues  on  the\r\n\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me\r\n\r\nthis opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the Bill moved by the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  I wish to make some observations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger of the three entities that has been outlined by\r\n\r\nDPM  is  to be welcomed if we are going to play a major role  in\r\n\r\nthe  financial  market.   Thanks to SingTel  and  to  Government\r\n\r\npolicy, we have got the most shareholders in the region,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  also declare my interest that I am also a shareholder  of\r\n\r\nsome listed companies.  It is very important to have an exchange\r\n\r\nthat  is forward-looking and I am glad the Minister pointed  out\r\n\r\nthe  example of Australia and even Hongkong.  However,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to be much more nearer home, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Stock Exchange, when it is merged, to try\r\n\r\nto  educate the public, because there is this lack of  knowledge\r\n\r\nof  how the Stock Exchange works in Singapore, and everybody who\r\n\r\nhas  got  some spare money wants to make quick bucks, and  their\r\n\r\nmoney  goes into shares.  I am not going to say that  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  should prohibit people from being speculative,  but  I\r\n\r\nhope that some sort of public education will do us some good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, I would like to urge the banks in\r\n\r\nSingapore to take heed of this Bill, that if the banks  were  to\r\n\r\nplay an important role in this country, they should try to think\r\n\r\nof  merging as fast as possible.  Otherwise, we will  be  behind\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which I am a little disturbed in this Bill is\r\n\r\nclause  17.   Clause 17 of the Bill deals with the  question  of\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the District Court.  As hon. Members are  aware,\r\n\r\nif  a  man is convicted in a District Court, his right to appeal\r\n\r\nlies  only to the High Court and no more.  He cannot go  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of Appeal without the leave of the Court of Appeal.   But\r\n\r\nif the matter is tried in High Court, he has got a chance in the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court with one judge; and then in the Court of Appeal with\r\n\r\nthree  judges.   In  view  of  the  seriousness  of  the  issues\r\n\r\ninvolved, I hope, if not now, at least in future, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  consider this position that the High Court should  be  the\r\n\r\nproper forum to hear criminal cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this observation, I am more than glad to support\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, and I think it is a timely Bill.  In fact, when I was\r\n\r\nin  Sydney some months back, I never thought that it would be so\r\n\r\nsoon, but it has in fact come to this House, and I support  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee has\r\n\r\nasked   whether  the  Government  will  consider   speeding   up\r\n\r\nliberalisation of brokerage commissions.  Indeed, the  timeframe\r\n\r\nfor  liberalisation  of  commissions is being  reviewed  by  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Centre Advisory Group which we set  up  with  private\r\n\r\nsector participants, and MAS itself is also studying this issue.\r\n\r\nA  number of factors need to be taken into account, for example,\r\n\r\nthe  schedule of liberalisation of commissions may  need  to  be\r\n\r\ndovetailed  with the timing of various other regulatory  changes\r\n\r\naffecting brokers.  It is a very swift moving industry.   Events\r\n\r\nare happening around the world, and if we are 12 months late, we\r\n\r\nmay  be  out  of  the game.  So we may well have to  revise  the\r\n\r\nschedule.  But there will be other parts of the plan which  also\r\n\r\nwould have to be dovetailed as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the regulatory functions to ensure that shareholders\r\n\r\nare  properly  protected,  the merged  exchange  will  be  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  position  than,  say,  SingTel  or  Singapore  Power,\r\n\r\nbecause SingTel and Singapore Power came out of statutory boards\r\n\r\nwhich both used to regulate as well as to operate.  TAS used  to\r\n\r\nregulate  and  operate the Telecoms industry  and  PUB  used  to\r\n\r\nregulate  and operate the utilities industry (water, electricity\r\n\r\nand  gas).   When they corporatised, they had to  be  split  and\r\n\r\ntheir functions were divided up into the regulatory part and the\r\n\r\noperating  part.   In  the case of the Stock  Exchange  and  the\r\n\r\nFutures  Exchange,  MAS has always been the ultimate  regulator.\r\n\r\nWe  have  always  had oversight, and we will  continue  to  have\r\n\r\noversight and regulate the two exchanges as well as the  holding\r\n\r\ncompany after their merger and demutualisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchanges themselves will always have to do a certain\r\n\r\namount  of  policing  of  their own rules,  but  that  is  at  a\r\n\r\ndifferent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlevel, and MAS will always be in an over-watching position.   We\r\n\r\nhave   to   maintain  a  balance  between  being  hands-on   and\r\n\r\ncontrolling everything and standing back and letting things  run\r\n\r\nperhaps in the wrong direction.  We have to be not hands-on  but\r\n\r\nin  a  position to put things right, if necessary.  And that  is\r\n\r\nwhat MAS will do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Corporate Finance Committee, indeed, they made a\r\n\r\nlarge number of recommendations which we have been following up,\r\n\r\nand we have made progress in many of these.  I think MAS will be\r\n\r\nputting up an update soon within a few weeks to keep the  public\r\n\r\nposted as to the progress of the work so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the Financial Sector Development Fund, what\r\n\r\nshould  the money be used for and can we take views  on  how  to\r\n\r\nspend it?  As Members will know, there is never any shortage  of\r\n\r\nsuggestions on how money should be spent.  In this case, we will\r\n\r\ncertainly take ideas not just from the Stock Exchange  but  from\r\n\r\nthe  industry  and  the Financial Sector  Advisory  Group.   The\r\n\r\npurposes  have  been spelt out very broadly in  the  Bill  -  to\r\n\r\npromote  the  financial  industry  and  the  infrastructure  and\r\n\r\ntraining - and I think there will be many worthwhile avenues  to\r\n\r\nwhich  the  money can be applied.  Of course, what is  done,  we\r\n\r\nwill report annually to Parliament in the MAS' Annual Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked why issues should not be raised in\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court  when  there are appeals against  decisions  of\r\n\r\nNewco, whether these should not be heard at the High Court  with\r\n\r\nan  avenue  of  appeal to three judges at the Court  of  Appeal,\r\n\r\nrather than be heard in a District Court and appeal only to  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court.   It  is a matter of how you want  to  balance  the\r\n\r\njudicial  system and where you want to put the prerogatives  and\r\n\r\nthe  powers of the different levels of the Courts.   It  is  our\r\n\r\njudgement,  and  I  think also the Attorney-General's  Chambers,\r\n\r\nthat  the  offences  can be dealt with by  the  District  Judges\r\n\r\nbecause they have sufficient expertise, skills and experience to\r\n\r\ndo so, and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffences do not attract capital punishment or life imprisonment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at a more fundamental level, there is an appeal allowed\r\n\r\ndirectly to the High Court, because if MAS issues a directive to\r\n\r\nNewco and Newco is aggrieved by this directive, Newco can appeal\r\n\r\nto  the  High  Court, and the High Court will judge the  matter.\r\n\r\nAnd  if the High Court rules against Newco, there is nothing  to\r\n\r\nprevent  further appeal to the Court of Appeal,  which  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant, because it will mean that MAS' directives would  need\r\n\r\nto stand up to High Court's scrutiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act to\r\n\r\ngive  legislative effect to a new scheme announced in  the  FY99\r\n\r\nBudget,  the  Approved Contract Manufacturer and  Trader  (ACMT)\r\n\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have announced the ACMT scheme in the 1999 Budget to\r\n\r\naddress  the  GST  burden  faced by some contract  manufacturers\r\n\r\nwhose  businesses are substantially with overseas clients.   The\r\n\r\nincreasing  complexity of business transactions has  caused  GST\r\n\r\nproblems  for some contract manufacturers.  Instead of exporting\r\n\r\nthe   finished   goods  to  their  overseas  clients,   contract\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  are  increasingly  also  being  asked  by   their\r\n\r\noverseas  clients to deliver the finished goods to the  overseas\r\n\r\nclients'  customers  in  Singapore.   This  local  delivery   is\r\n\r\nconsidered a taxable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupply  under  our  GST law.  In instances  where  the  overseas\r\n\r\nclients  who own the finished goods do not want to designate  an\r\n\r\nagent  in Singapore to account for the GST on their behalf,  the\r\n\r\ncontract  manufacturers might end up having to bear the  GST  on\r\n\r\nlocal delivery and have no recourse to claim it back.  This  GST\r\n\r\nburden   makes  our  contract  manufacturers  less   competitive\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ACMT scheme, the local delivery of the finished\r\n\r\ngoods  by  the approved person to the customers of the  overseas\r\n\r\nclients and the fees for the value-added activities on the goods\r\n\r\nwill  be deemed to be outside the scope of GST and GST will  not\r\n\r\nbe  chargeable.  Instead, the overseas client's local  customers\r\n\r\nwho purchase and receive the goods in Singapore will account for\r\n\r\nGST.   The  scheme is also made available to other  traders  who\r\n\r\nengage  in  value-added  activities substantially  for  overseas\r\n\r\nclients   and  face  the  same  GST  problem  as  the   contract\r\n\r\nmanufacturers on their local deliveries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Goods and\r\n\r\nServices Tax Act:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Amendment of section 12(8) to allow regulations to be\r\n\r\nmade with respect to the time of supply for the purposes of  the\r\n\r\nrecipient accounting for the output tax;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Amendment of section 20(2) to allow the approved\r\n\r\ncontract  manufacturer or trader to be able to claim credit  for\r\n\r\ninput tax attributable to supplies made by him; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Introduction of a new section 37A relating to the ACMT\r\n\r\nscheme  such  that local supplies made by the approved  contract\r\n\r\nmanufacturer or trader on behalf of an overseas client shall  be\r\n\r\nfree of GST and the recipient of the goods would be required  to\r\n\r\naccount  and pay GST for the goods as if he had himself supplied\r\n\r\nthem.

The  Council\r\n\r\napproves  and  regulates bus routes and public transport  fares,\r\n\r\nbalancing the interests of the commuters with that of the public\r\n\r\ntransport operators.  The PTC Act has not been amended since its\r\n\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, various developments have taken place, such\r\n\r\nas  the  deregulation  of  taxi fares  last  September  and  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of types of bus services such as shuttle bus  services\r\n\r\nbetween  private  housing estates and the nearby  MRT  stations.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry and the Council have, therefore, reviewed the  PTC\r\n\r\nAct and are proposing to amend the Act to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) bring it up to date with latest developments;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increase the Council's size to widen its\r\n\r\nrepresentation; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) facilitate the Council's discharge of its functions\r\n\r\nmore efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain these amendments in greater detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we propose to include a new section 24 in the\r\n\r\nAct  to  empower the Council to exempt any person  or  class  of\r\n\r\npersons from all or any of the provision of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Act  or  regulations made.  This amendment  will  give  the\r\n\r\nCouncil more flexibility in the application of its decisions and\r\n\r\noperations.   For  instance, the Council  has  deregulated  taxi\r\n\r\nfares  from  1st  September 1998, hence this  new  section  will\r\n\r\nenable  the  Council to regularise the policy  and  exempt  taxi\r\n\r\noperators  from requiring the Council's approval  for  any  taxi\r\n\r\nfare revisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we are proposing to amend paragraph 1 of the First\r\n\r\nSchedule to increase the number of Council members who  are  not\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of public transport companies by two, from  nine\r\n\r\nto   11.    This  is  to  allow  the  Ministry  to   widen   the\r\n\r\nrepresentation of public members on the Council  so  that  other\r\n\r\nkey  segments  of  the  population may  be  represented  on  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.   This will allow the Council to take into account  the\r\n\r\nviews of a wider segment of population in its deliberations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments, mainly in sections 5, 12, 13, 19,\r\n\r\n21  to 23 and 25, are to regularise the various functions and to\r\n\r\nenable the Council to carry out its role more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 is amended to be consistent with other statutes\r\n\r\non  appointing and employing officers, employees and  agents  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out its functions.  In addition, new sections 5A  and  5B\r\n\r\nhave been drawn up to provide members, officers and employees of\r\n\r\nthe  Council  and  persons acting under the  directions  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil   protection  from  personal  liability  for   functions\r\n\r\nundertaken  in  good  faith  under the  Act.   Likewise,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed that all members, officers and employees of the Council\r\n\r\nbe  deemed to be public servants within the meaning of the Penal\r\n\r\nCode.   These amendments will make the Act consistent with other\r\n\r\nstatutes  where all employees of statutory boards are deemed  as\r\n\r\npublic  officers.   It  will formally give explicit  powers  and\r\n\r\nprotection to PTC officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 is amended to allow security deposits collected\r\n\r\nfor the  issuance of bus service licences to be made to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCouncil instead of the Accountant-General.  Sections 13  and  19\r\n\r\nare  consequential  amendments arising  from  the  amendment  to\r\n\r\nSection  12.  Currently, the security deposits are held  in  the\r\n\r\nAccountant-General's account.  To enable the  Council  to  carry\r\n\r\nout its functions more efficiently, it is better for the Council\r\n\r\nto hold these deposits in trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in section 21 is to provide for the\r\n\r\nprocedures  and  requirements  for  the  application  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport fare revisions to be clearly spelt out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, paragraph 4(3) of the Second Schedule\r\n\r\nrequires   the   Minister  to  present  the  audited   financial\r\n\r\nstatements and auditors' report to Parliament.  The amendment in\r\n\r\nsection 22 is to include this in the main Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 23 empowers the Council to compound any offences\r\n\r\ncommitted  under  the  Act.  This is not  provided  for  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  Act.   This  amendment  will  give  the  Council   more\r\n\r\nflexibility to take action against public transport operators or\r\n\r\ncommuters who flout the rules set by the Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 25 contains the provisions of the existing section\r\n\r\n22   and  further  empowers  the  Council  to  make  regulations\r\n\r\nnecessary  or expedient for carrying out the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nPTC Act.  For instance, the Council may prescribe the procedures\r\n\r\nfor  application  of bus service licences and fees  payable  and\r\n\r\nother  procedures  pertaining to the  hearing  of  appeals,  the\r\n\r\npowers and duties of officers, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also taken the opportunity to update the\r\n\r\nprovisions  on  financial and auditing  matters  in  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule  of  the Act to bring them in conformity with  standard\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Government which had changed over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I speak in support\r\n\r\nof this Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, in general, no questions about the main items\r\n\r\nrelating  to  this Amendment Bill.  But there is one  clause  11\r\n\r\nwhich  refers to section 21 of the principal Act which  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  concerned.   It concerns the  application  for  the\r\n\r\napproval   of  fares.   Under  this  proposed  amendment,   this\r\n\r\napplication  for  the approval of fares should be  supported  by\r\n\r\ndocuments, including certified copies of the balance  sheet  and\r\n\r\nprofit  and loss account, and any auditor's report, relating  to\r\n\r\nthe applicant's undertaking as the Council may require.  And  in\r\n\r\nconsidering  such applications, it is written in the  Bill  that\r\n\r\nthe Council shall take into account the need of the applicant to\r\n\r\nremain  financially  viable as well as the need  of  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.    I  want  to  ask  the  Minister  to  consider   the\r\n\r\npossibility that there should be some efficiency criteria to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  into  this kind of application to review or increase  bus\r\n\r\nfares  or public transport fares.  The reason is that these  are\r\n\r\npublic charter monopolies in a sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals to raise fares in public bus companies or public\r\n\r\ntransport  companies  can be made of course  provided  they  are\r\n\r\njustified.  The justification of it is not necessarily  just  on\r\n\r\nbalance sheet or profit and loss account, but of course the need\r\n\r\nof  the  public.  But there should be also efficiency critieria.\r\n\r\nHow  do  our  public  transport companies,  in  discharging  its\r\n\r\nfunctions and answering to the public, match themselves  against\r\n\r\nother  such  public  transport  companies  in  delivering   such\r\n\r\nservices worldwide?  With this benchmark, at least we know  that\r\n\r\nsuch  fare increases are justified and not just based on balance\r\n\r\nsheet  and  profit and loss account alone.  I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider this point and raise it with the PTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMinister of State, the Public Transport Council is set up by  an\r\n\r\nAct  of Parliament in order to be a watchdog body to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  public interest where public transport is concerned without\r\n\r\ndetriment   to  the  financial  viability  of  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring to the attention of the House three\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTransport  Council.  First, the Council is meant to approve  and\r\n\r\nregulate  bus  routes and bus, taxi and MRT fares.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nlaudable  objective.  However, the First Schedule  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  representatives of  the  major  public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies to sit on the Council as members.  I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State whether the Council finds difficulties  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  its  responsibility in being a watchdog  body  in\r\n\r\nregulating  public  transport fares and  routes  when  the  very\r\n\r\noperators  themselves  are members.  Is  there  no  conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest?   Would it not be more appropriate for the Council  to\r\n\r\nbe  independent of the public transport operators  since  it  is\r\n\r\nmeant to regulate them?  How does it regulate itself because the\r\n\r\npublic transport operators are themselves members?  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nif, in addition, in the event of a fare increase, supposing that\r\n\r\nthe  public  transport  operators would have  to  provide  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  data  and  you have other public transport  operators\r\n\r\nalso  in  the Council sitting at the table, how then can  proper\r\n\r\ndeliberation  be done because these are private  financial  data\r\n\r\nbelonging to a private operator?  So I am a bit puzzled by  this\r\n\r\nparticular clause in the First Schedule and I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nfor clarification from the Minister of State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, since the Bill seeks to increase the Council\r\n\r\nsize,  can the Council not make it a point to include  at  least\r\n\r\none  representative of the handicapped as a member in  order  to\r\n\r\nrepresent them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, assessment of applications for fare increase and\r\n\r\nchanges in bus routes requires a thorough understanding of  both\r\n\r\nthe  demand  and  supply of public transport,  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nfinancial operation of the public transport companies  in  order\r\n\r\nto   assess   the  financial  implications  for  the   companies\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support the new section 21 which gives the\r\n\r\nCouncil  powers to ask for supporting documents such  as  profit\r\n\r\nand  loss  accounts to support an application for the change  of\r\n\r\nfare.   In  addition,  I  believe  that  in  the  event  of   an\r\n\r\napplication  to  increase fares, the Council should  perform  an\r\n\r\nindependent assessment of its implications, both for the  public\r\n\r\nas well as for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noperators concerned.  It should not merely rely on the  analysis\r\n\r\nprovided by the operators themselves.  I would therefore like to\r\n\r\nseek an assurance from the Minister of State that an independent\r\n\r\nassessment is indeed made by the Public Transport Council before\r\n\r\na fare increase is agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarification from the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  as to the resources that the Council has to  do  this\r\n\r\ndetailed  and complicated work and whether this is done  by  the\r\n\r\nsix  staff at present comprising the Council secretariat.  After\r\n\r\nall,  unlike  other regulatory agencies such  as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Authority or the Telecommunications  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the Public Transport Council is not a statutory board\r\n\r\nbut  a  part-time  council, comprising  at  present  13  members\r\n\r\nrepresenting all walks of life.  I also presume that  this  kind\r\n\r\nof  analysis is not done by the Land Transport Authority as  the\r\n\r\nCouncil's  annual report states that the LTA acts as  the  agent\r\n\r\nfor the Council in carrying out its operational decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek clarification with the Minister of\r\n\r\nState regarding the relationship between the Council on the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  and  the  Ministry on the other.  I am  sure  that  close\r\n\r\nconsultation occurs between the Council and the Ministry.  After\r\n\r\nall,  I  believe  that  the  Minister appoints  members  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.   My  question  is:   can the  Council  make  decisions\r\n\r\nindependently  and  if  necessary,  contrary  to  that  of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry's?   Is  it  an  independent  body  from  that  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support Mr Chay Wai Chuen's point that he made just now\r\n\r\nthat  the  need for financial viability should not be  the  only\r\n\r\ncriterion for assessing fare increases.  I think his point about\r\n\r\nincluding an efficiency criterion is a very good one because  in\r\n\r\nall  that  I  know  of  the way the Government  handles  private\r\n\r\ncompanies,  financial viability has not been a  major  criterion\r\n\r\nfor assessing an issue which is of public concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, since public transport has a direct impact on the\r\n\r\nlives of Singaporeans, there is a keen interest in the decisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Council with regard to fare revisions, changes  in  bus\r\n\r\nroutes  and so on.  The new section 22 states the Council should\r\n\r\nsubmit  an  annual  report  to  the  Minister  which  should  be\r\n\r\nsubsequently   presented  to  Parliament.   The  annual   report\r\n\r\nprovides useful information regarding the work of the Council in\r\n\r\nthe preceding year.  I therefore support this new clause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, however, in the interest of providing the\r\n\r\npublic  with information and the reasoning behind the  decisions\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Council, I would like to suggest that the  Council\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond  the publication of an annual report.  The  Council\r\n\r\nshould,  soon after making a major decision such as approving  a\r\n\r\nfare revision, hold a public forum to explain to the public  the\r\n\r\nrationale  for  its  decision. I am sure  that  there  are  good\r\n\r\nreasons  for its decision and such a face-to-face dialogue  with\r\n\r\nthe  public would help clarify doubts and concerns.  This  forum\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  open  to  the media  so  that  the  subsequent\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  which  would include answers to  frequently  asked\r\n\r\nquestions that many of the public may have, would be covered and\r\n\r\npublicised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion, but I would like to\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister of State regarding a number\r\n\r\nof points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  doing  a  lot  of work.   In  fact,  our  transport\r\n\r\nservices,  both the buses and MRT, have improved  by  leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds.  But I would urge the Minister of State to take note  of\r\n\r\nsome of the areas which I am going to address to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I agree that there should be a handicapped\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  Most of the Council members are car users.   We\r\n\r\nshould get a bus commuter to sit on the Council.  I know we have\r\n\r\nan NTUC representative but it is not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, which Dr Lee has mentioned, is to have a\r\n\r\nfeedback unit.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbus  and  MRT  are a very important part of our  industry.   The\r\n\r\npassengers  are the best people to give feedback on the  changes\r\n\r\nof  routes and fares.  On the fares, Sir, I share the concern of\r\n\r\nMembers.  The Council has members from MRT and bus operators and\r\n\r\nthey  are  going  to  decide how much fares should  be  charged,\r\n\r\nsubject   to  the  Minister's  approval.  We  should   be   more\r\n\r\ntransparent.  Whenever decisions are taken, there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nconvention that those who are involved directly in the operation\r\n\r\nof  the bus or MRT should not take part when a decision is taken\r\n\r\nto  raise  fares.  We should make it a point to see  that  these\r\n\r\npeople  do  not  vote.  Otherwise, we will lose our  maxim  that\r\n\r\njustice must not only be done but seen to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to comment is this. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  regulatory power that is given  to  the  Council  is\r\n\r\nlaudable.   It  should be because after all, the Council  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge and clause 25 has laid down all the areas which it has to\r\n\r\ndo and I welcome it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to mention is the\r\n\r\ncomposition of offences.  Why do we restrict ourselves  to  $200\r\n\r\nfor a fine?  Instead of coming back to this House again, what we\r\n\r\ncould  have  done  is  to state $200 or such  a  figure  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister may approve.  That would save us the trouble of  coming\r\n\r\nto  this House, because $200 is a pittance if you really want to\r\n\r\nregulate some of the offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is to have a feedback where the public at\r\n\r\nlarge, the users of public transport, can give its views and the\r\n\r\nCouncil could study them and serve the public better.  With that\r\n\r\nreservation, Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, ever since the Public Transport Council was\r\n\r\nestablished,  I  believe  the public  transportation  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been operating very well.  Fares have been  quite\r\n\r\nreasonable even though from time to time, I have spoken in  this\r\n\r\nHouse regarding the lack of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice  in my constituency but by and large, things  are  going\r\n\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Public Transport Council was established at\r\n\r\na  time  when  the public service providers are very  distinctly\r\n\r\nclassified  - taxi operator, bus operator, MRT operator  and  so\r\n\r\non.   As we look into the future, we already understand from the\r\n\r\nLTA  that the future operators will be different.  The  bus  and\r\n\r\nrail will be merged and the geographic areas will be partitioned\r\n\r\nand  competition will perhaps be restricted whereas  performance\r\n\r\nmeasures will be slightly different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister of State is that, in the future\r\n\r\nregime,  how would PTC play its role, or whether its role  would\r\n\r\nbe changed because of the new public transport scenario.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, allow me to say a few words regarding the\r\n\r\namendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree and support the amendments that are proposed. But\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  few  issues that we need to address.   The  other\r\n\r\nchanges  that  are to be introduced are going to make  commuting\r\n\r\nmore  efficient  and  to allow for greater  input  by  commuters\r\n\r\nthemselves.   That  is  a  basic  question  that  needs  to   be\r\n\r\naddressed.  Are the changes to the composition of members to the\r\n\r\nPTC  going to be a better check to upgrade and improve the  work\r\n\r\nof  the public transport system?  If that is the case, then  the\r\n\r\namendments are worth its salt.  Otherwise, I do not think it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be worth its salt if no changes are going to  be  made\r\n\r\nand  the  interests of the commuters are not going to  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the viewpoint raised by the GPC Chairman for\r\n\r\nCommunications.  He has got a few valid points and I think it is\r\n\r\nworth looking at.  But what I would like to say is that there is\r\n\r\na  need to ensure that a balance be maintained between operators\r\n\r\nand commuters.  I know it is a difficult task. One has to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  public transport remains viable but there is obviously  an\r\n\r\ninterest to ensure that there is no run away price increase.  In\r\n\r\norder that the interest of commuters is looked into, there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis a need to increase the number of people from nine to 11.  Why\r\n\r\nnine  to 11? Why not 15? That is the basic question.  What  type\r\n\r\nof   representations  are  you  going  to  have?  These  members\r\n\r\nbasically  have not even taken a bus ride at all,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nquite a majority of PTC members are not bus commuters.  They are\r\n\r\npeople  who live in ivory towers.  One needs to examine and  see\r\n\r\nthat  there is adequate input.  If that is the objective of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Transport  Council,  you have  to  bring  in  inputs  of\r\n\r\ncommuters  to ensure the quality and efficiency are  maintained.\r\n\r\nYou  may argue that all this is at a price.  I agree that  there\r\n\r\nis a price to be paid but not at the expense of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need for PTC to ensure that there is\r\n\r\nadequate  audit  of  the  different  services  offered  by   the\r\n\r\ncompanies, and at the moment there is a duopoly.  Only two major\r\n\r\ncompanies,  other than SMRT, are providing the  service  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  I  think  it  is  timely that PTC  allows  for  greater\r\n\r\ncompetition.   There  is a need to re-look at  the  current  bus\r\n\r\ntransportation  system  provided by  the  two  companies  alone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, one should look at the possibility of introducing  more\r\n\r\nchanges  for  ordinary travelling commuters,  at  the  new  town\r\n\r\nlevel,  particularly  the  feeder  bus  system.   And  if   more\r\n\r\ncompetition  can  be  brought in,  there  is  a  possibility  of\r\n\r\nimproving  the services provided by the different companies.   I\r\n\r\nam  sure that the Minister of State would agree with me that the\r\n\r\nmore competition we have in public transport, we may be able  to\r\n\r\nincrease  efficiency and allow the commuters  to  have  a  wider\r\n\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that proviso, it is very important that representation\r\n\r\non  the  PTC  be  re-looked  at and a  wider  representation  of\r\n\r\ncommuters  be  brought into the PTC.  The idea is to  allow  for\r\n\r\nbetter inputs and to bring public transport to a greater height.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, there is another point which I\r\n\r\nforgot to mention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, you have already made your speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Could I just add one point that I have\r\n\r\nleft out?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry. Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to speak\r\n\r\non  any particular amendment.  But I do wish to bring up  a  few\r\n\r\npoints  which have already been raised.  I do not wish to repeat\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been said.  But I think a valid point that  has  been\r\n\r\nmade is the over representation on the Council by people who run\r\n\r\nthe  transport  service and people who do not travel  on  public\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how you are going to remedy this imbalance.\r\n\r\nOne  way  may be to form an association of commuters,  encourage\r\n\r\nall  over the island associations of commuters and then ask them\r\n\r\nto  delegate somebody on to the Public Transport Council to look\r\n\r\nafter  their  views.   Alternatively, may  I  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   consider   appointing  an  Opposition   Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament on to the Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> NCMP?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Please do not laugh at this. I am saying it\r\n\r\nquite seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the earlier motions that I moved in this House in\r\n\r\n1997,  I had proposed an all party parliamentary committee,  ie,\r\n\r\nincluding  Opposition  Members and the  Government  Members,  to\r\n\r\nreview any increases in prices for basic services  -  transport,\r\n\r\nutilities and other basic services  -  that are provided for our\r\n\r\npeople.   That, of course, was rejected.  It could not have been\r\n\r\npassed.  But would the Government now consider seriously setting\r\n\r\nup  an  all party parliamentary committee, consisting of Members\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government  and  the  Opposition,  to  consider   any\r\n\r\napplications from the operators for increase in fares?  They can\r\n\r\nthen make their recommendations to the Council.  You may perhaps\r\n\r\nthink  that the Council should not be bound by it, but at  least\r\n\r\nthey will have the views of people who have been elected by  the\r\n\r\npeople, and they can take them seriously.  That is my suggestion\r\n\r\nfor enlarging this Council, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntry and find a way to allow commuters to have representation  on\r\n\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to put forward is the holding\r\n\r\nof  a  public inquiry when any operator or operators  decide  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw any particular service.  In other countries,   when  an\r\n\r\noperator  plans  or announces that he is going to  withdraw  the\r\n\r\nservices,  and  if  there is an objection from  people  who  are\r\n\r\nserved  by that service, the Minister then appoints an inspector\r\n\r\nto  hold a public inquiry to listen to the objections and decide\r\n\r\nwhether the service should be withdrawn or not.  Can we not move\r\n\r\nalong those lines, instead of always having Government appointed\r\n\r\npeople   on  councils?   Let  us  give  our  people  a   greater\r\n\r\nparticipation  in how things are run in this country.   That  is\r\n\r\nthe  whole  idea of democracy.  So, I would ask the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nconsider  these  two  proposals quite seriously,  and  not  just\r\n\r\ndismiss them as coming from the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank all the Members for their support, comments  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, take the question on representation. I\r\n\r\nthink  many  Members  expressed opinions on  representation  and\r\n\r\nasked  whether there is a conflict of interest when  we  appoint\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the public transport companies  on  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.   Sir, I would like to draw Members' attention  to  the\r\n\r\nAct  itself   which  we enacted in 1987.    In  section  21,  we\r\n\r\nexplicitly  listed the objectives of the Council.  Specifically,\r\n\r\nfor  fare adjustments, (a) the need for the applicant to  remain\r\n\r\nfinancially viable; and (b) the need for public interest  to  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the reason why we specifically included the two\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Act is to send a very strong signal,  because\r\n\r\nif  a public transport operator is not viable, then we are going\r\n\r\nto  have  degradation of service and there would be very  severe\r\n\r\nimplications  on  the  public transport service.   Arising  from\r\n\r\nthat, in the  First Schedule, we also listed the composition  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the PTC.  There are two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions   there.    The   first   is   the   appointment   of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from the public transport  companies,  and  the\r\n\r\nsecond is from the other sectors of the population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for appointing public transport representatives\r\n\r\non  the  Council  is  to  allow them to  also  voice  their  own\r\n\r\ninterest.   That is the intent of the Act when we first  enacted\r\n\r\nit in 1987.  This is the way for the PTC to balance the interest\r\n\r\nof  commuters against the financial viability of the  operators.\r\n\r\nAnd  if Members look at the numbers on the Council, we have four\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the  public transport  companies  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.   And  we  have  nine members who  represent  the  other\r\n\r\nsectors  of  the population.  As it is, you will find  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority are from the other sectors of the population, like  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations, unions, community leaders,  academia,\r\n\r\nprofessionals   and   so   on.    So   the   public    transport\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  are  there,  as  I  said,  to  represent  their\r\n\r\ninterests  and to provide inputs to the PTC on their  operations\r\n\r\nand financial situation, and to justify in front of the majority\r\n\r\nof  the  Council  members  who  represent  public  interest  any\r\n\r\nproposal for fare or route adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Council takes into account views from all\r\n\r\ninterested   parties.   This  arrangement   promotes   consensus\r\n\r\nbuilding among its members, and has worked well over the  years.\r\n\r\nIn  a  way, it is not unlike our National Wages Council.  I know\r\n\r\nwhat  Members are thinking of.  They are probably thinking  that\r\n\r\nthe  NWC  provides guidelines, whereas the PTC  approves  fares.\r\n\r\nBut   what  I  am  trying  to say here is  that  it  allows  the\r\n\r\ndifferent parties to argue their case and then come out  with  a\r\n\r\nconsensus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform Members that since the formation of the PTC\r\n\r\nuntil  today, not a single vote needs to be taken at  the  PTC's\r\n\r\ndeliberations.  It is all by consensus, and I think  that  is  a\r\n\r\nfantastic  testimony of how we work in Singapore, ie,  everybody\r\n\r\nlooks  at the overall interest of everyone and comes out with  a\r\n\r\nconsensus that will serve us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for praising our public transport\r\n\r\nsystem.  I think this is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  good  arrangement  and we should continue  with  the  current\r\n\r\npractice.   I  take note of Dr Wang Kai Yuen's point  about  the\r\n\r\nevolution  of the public transport industry.  Yes, we are  going\r\n\r\ninto  a  multi-modal public transport operation.  In  future,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is impossible to get all the public transport operators\r\n\r\nto be represented on  the Council.  In my view, we would have  a\r\n\r\nfuture  situation  where  we  have  a  representation  from  the\r\n\r\noperators as a whole, and then we have representation  from  the\r\n\r\nrest of the Singapore population.  So this is how it is going to\r\n\r\nevolve.   And  it is also our intention to continue  having  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the Council members coming from the other sectors of\r\n\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC Chairman, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, brought up a very\r\n\r\nimportant  point  about the criteria that  the  PTC  takes  into\r\n\r\naccount  when  they  decide on approving  fares.   And  in  this\r\n\r\namendment, we are putting in place, more specifically, the  kind\r\n\r\nof  information  that the Council will ask from  the  operators,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  certified copies of balance sheets,  profit  and  loss\r\n\r\naccount, auditor's report and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the GPC Chairman that efficiency is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  criterion  and, indeed, over  the  years,  when  they\r\n\r\nconsider  applications  for  fare  adjustments,  track   record,\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  efficiency  have  always  been   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  In fact, the reason why we have two  instead  of\r\n\r\none major bus operator is to allow the PTC to also benchmark one\r\n\r\nagainst the other, so that the inefficiency of one operator will\r\n\r\nbe shown up by the performance of the other.  And, of course, we\r\n\r\nare   always   paying  attention  to  overseas  bus   companies'\r\n\r\nperformance and inefficiency, but, of course, it is not so  easy\r\n\r\nbecause  of the different systems, subsidies and so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  But the point is well taken and I assure the House  that\r\n\r\nall  these  criteria are taken into consideration when  the  PTC\r\n\r\napproves fare adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked whether there is independent assessment. Dr\r\n\r\nLee is right that a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthorough  understanding is required in order for the Council  to\r\n\r\nproperly  assess applications for fare revisions and  bus  route\r\n\r\nchanges.   Hence, the Council does not rely only on  the  inputs\r\n\r\nprovided by the operators.  The Council is also assisted by  the\r\n\r\nLand  Transport  Authority, which provides independent  analysis\r\n\r\nand technical advice to the Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Dr Lee were to look at its Annual Report, it does not\r\n\r\nsay  that LTA is an agent to implement operational details only.\r\n\r\nIt  says that it also provides technical advice to the PTC.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  if  you  look at the PTC Act, the PTC has  the  power  to\r\n\r\nappoint  agents,  and  that  is a very  wide  power.   An  agent\r\n\r\nincludes  LTA  and any consultant that they want  to  engage  to\r\n\r\nprovide  inputs, technical advice and analysis for the Council's\r\n\r\ndeliberations.  I would therefore like to assure Members, and Dr\r\n\r\nLee  in particular, that the Council is given full authority  in\r\n\r\nits deliberations and decisions independent of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also suggested that the Council holds public forums\r\n\r\nto  explain  the  rationale  of its major  decision,  and  other\r\n\r\nMembers  have also brought up a related point.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nexplain that it is already a current practice of the Council  to\r\n\r\nhold  a  press conference to announce major decisions,  such  as\r\n\r\nfare  revisions, and explain the rationale.  The  media  usually\r\n\r\nreports  this  extensively.  To my mind, this is more  important\r\n\r\nthan  holding a public forum involving a few hundred  people  to\r\n\r\nexplain  the policy, because once the new measures are announced\r\n\r\nand  the press reported them widely, Singaporeans too will react\r\n\r\nand  give  feedback to the Council.  The Council  then  monitors\r\n\r\nthese    public   responses   closely   and   provides   further\r\n\r\nclarifications, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, there is an on-going process whereby\r\n\r\nthe  Council receives and responds to feedback from  the  public\r\n\r\nthrough   forums,  like  the  Feedback  Unit,   and   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.  So the feedback is on-going and we also  receive\r\n\r\na  lot  of  letters from members of the public,  either  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry or the PTC, and the Ministry will channel them  to  the\r\n\r\nPTC for their consideration.  So this feedback\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmechanism is in place and it is an on-going process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members commented that perhaps many of the PTC members are\r\n\r\nmotorists and not bus commuters.  Let me remind Members that, as\r\n\r\nfar  as possible, we will involve people who can contribute, but\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  it is a prerequisite for PTC  members  to  be\r\n\r\ncommuters  before  they can become members.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nremind Members that all of us are motorists and yet we are  here\r\n\r\ncommenting  on public transport.  How is it?  It is  because  we\r\n\r\ntake  the  trouble  to talk to our residents, our  friends,  our\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders, and we get feedback and  we  are  genuinely\r\n\r\nconcerned.  We can put up a very credible argument.  So I do not\r\n\r\nthink  Members can say that just because most of the PTC members\r\n\r\nare  motorists they are therefore not doing their job.   Let  me\r\n\r\ninform  Members  that  I  know that PTC members,  including  the\r\n\r\nChairman,  take  the trouble sometimes to go and  test  out  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport system. In our review to expand  more  members\r\n\r\nand  have  a  wider representation, we can try to  include  more\r\n\r\npeople,  as suggested by Members, but let me explain to  Members\r\n\r\nthat they have to bear in mind what I have said earlier.  As for\r\n\r\nthe suggestion that the handicapped be represented, we will look\r\n\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai commented that the composition fine of $200 is too\r\n\r\nlow.   If  he  looks at the current Act, there is no composition\r\n\r\nfine  in  the current Act.  If a person commits an offence,  the\r\n\r\nAct  actually allows PTC  to bring him to court and if the court\r\n\r\nfines  him  guilty, then he will be fined up to  $1,000  or  six\r\n\r\nmonths'  jail or both.   So the composition fine is  to  provide\r\n\r\nthat  flexibility  so that, for fare evasion, you  can  exercise\r\n\r\nflexibility.   A  fine  of $200 is in  line  with  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncomposition fines that we have in other  Acts.  So it is not too\r\n\r\nlow.   In  addition  to  that, in the amendment  Bill,  we  also\r\n\r\nprovide for the Council to make regulations and prescribe  fines\r\n\r\nup to $1,000 for different offences.  So the flexibility is also\r\n\r\nthere.  It is sufficient for this composition fine to be $200.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo talks about audits and competition. Yes, every\r\n\r\nyear the Public Transport\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCouncil  audits  the service standards of the  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators.   The PTC has specified the standard  of  service  in\r\n\r\nterms  of frequency and the length of bus route because it  does\r\n\r\nnot  want the route to be too long.  Every year, they do  audits\r\n\r\nto  make  sure  that the bus service standards are within  those\r\n\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for competition, I would like to remind the House that\r\n\r\nour  public transport market is a very small one and we lack the\r\n\r\ncritical  mass to allow free and unbridled competition  in  this\r\n\r\nsector,  as  we  had experienced in the 1970s where  we  had  11\r\n\r\nprivate bus companies competing with one another and the  result\r\n\r\nwas  chaos  and  badly  maintained buses and  a  poor  level  of\r\n\r\nservice.   But  that  is  not to say we are  not  interested  in\r\n\r\ncompetition.  In fact, as I have said, the competition is  there\r\n\r\nin  terms of benchmarking.  In addition to that, for peak  hours\r\n\r\nwhere  the  existing bus companies have got problems in  meeting\r\n\r\nthe  high demand, we allow the Scheme B service to compete  with\r\n\r\nthe bus operators.  This has also worked well.  If any Member or\r\n\r\nany  company or member of the public feels that there is a  need\r\n\r\nfor  such  supplementary services in other routes and areas,  he\r\n\r\ncan put up a case and the PTC will be happy to consider them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer run, as I have mentioned earlier, the public\r\n\r\ntransport industry is being restructured into a multi-modal one.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as  we  can see, we are going to have  two  multi-modal\r\n\r\noperators  by  the year 2002.  When the industry  structure  has\r\n\r\nbecome more established and stabilised, and if there is room for\r\n\r\nmore competition, we will consider introducing new players.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to Mr Jeyaretnam's comments. Again, he\r\n\r\nbrought  up  old  issues.   He wants an All-Party  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommittee to review and recommend price increases, including bus\r\n\r\nfare increases.  Let me remind the Member that his proposal  was\r\n\r\ndebated in the House and it was rejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Because we do not think the House\r\n\r\nis the right forum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  do that.  These are matters that we think should be left  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry, the statutory boards and the Council to do.  We do\r\n\r\nnot think this is something that the House should do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a public inquiry to look into the proposal of, say,\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of services, and so on, again this is the role of the\r\n\r\nPTC.   Whether  it is an addition of services or  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nservices, the PTC is tasked to look into all these proposals and\r\n\r\ndecide.  I do not think we should have a public inquiry just  to\r\n\r\ndo  this.  If we conduct a public inquiry, maybe we would  never\r\n\r\nmove,  and that is detrimental to the development of the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  industry  in Singapore.  So I will  not  support  his\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would just like to say that the Council's\r\n\r\ntask  of  balancing  commuters' interests versus  those  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport  operators  is  not  easy.   It  has  so   far\r\n\r\ndischarged   its  responsibilities,  in  my  view,  fairly   and\r\n\r\neffectively  in  accordance  with  its  charter.   The  proposed\r\n\r\namendments   would   enable  the  Council   to   discharge   its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities even more effectively.  With that, I thank  all\r\n\r\nthe Members for their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By way of clarification, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State, on his statement that the Public  Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil  looks  into  any  proposal to withdraw  any  particular\r\n\r\nservice,  whether the Council invites the people who are  served\r\n\r\nby  that  service  to send in their representations?   Does  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  call  them up and listen to their grievances?   May  we\r\n\r\nhave an answer to that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The Public Transport Council\r\n\r\ngathers  all  the  information,  including  feedback  from  MPs,\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations and bus operators.   Again,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nconsideration involving all interested parties.  So I do not see\r\n\r\nanything wrong with that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You are not answering the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister of State, in his detailed\r\n\r\nreply,  for which I thank him, stated that the public  transport\r\n\r\noperators  sit  on  the  Council in order  to  voice  their  own\r\n\r\ninterest.  I would like to seek clarification from the  Minister\r\n\r\nof State regarding the following related aspects:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the public transport operators not represent their\r\n\r\nown  interest by extensive discussions with the members, but not\r\n\r\nsit on the Council?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Minister of State likened the PTC to the NWC. The\r\n\r\nNWC  is involved in wage negotiations and discussions among  the\r\n\r\nparties  concerned.   It  is  not a  watchdog  body  where  wage\r\n\r\nnegotiation is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Hence, my third point is, therefore, that the PTC is\r\n\r\nnot  really a watchdog body, as mentioned in the annual  report.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  Council to deliberate on fare revisions  and  matters\r\n\r\npertaining  to  public transport.  If so, I can see  why  public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators sit on the Council.  But in that  sense,  I\r\n\r\nthink  further and subsequent annual reports should exclude  and\r\n\r\nrefrain from having this particular description of the Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I think Dr Lee has not understood\r\n\r\nmy point.  I said \"in a way PTC is not unlike the NWC\".  What  I\r\n\r\nmeant  is  the  consensus  part.  We  know  that  NWC  works  on\r\n\r\nconsensus.   I  was on the NWC Council before and  the  Chairman\r\n\r\nalways  said, \"Look, it is always by consensus that we  come  to\r\n\r\nthe  final recommendation.\"  What I am saying is that there  are\r\n\r\nimportant  advantages of having the public  transport  operators\r\n\r\nsitting  on the PTC.  It is not just for them to advocate  their\r\n\r\nown interest, but also to provide opinions on matters concerning\r\n\r\nthe  industry.  I understand her point that we can always invite\r\n\r\nthem  to sit in and ask them questions.  But I do not think that\r\n\r\nis   quite  the  same  as  members  sitting  around  the  table,\r\n\r\ndiscussing   throughout  the  whole  session,   offering   their\r\n\r\nopinions,  and  when one transport operator proposes  something,\r\n\r\nthe other transport operator will be there also to criticise.  I\r\n\r\nthink there are advantages in doing that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  just  want to clarify that that is what I meant when  I  said\r\n\r\nthat  the consensus and the result are quite like the NWC  where\r\n\r\nwe  actually have this close relationship between the  employers\r\n\r\nand the unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr John Chen Seow Phun].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sentosa Cove)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The  reclamation work is  now  in  progress  and  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be completed by the 4th Quarter of 1999.  This  land\r\n\r\nhas been committed for general, pharmaceutical and utilities use\r\n\r\nand  will be taken up almost immediately upon completion of  the\r\n\r\nreclamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that the industrial land on the mainland\r\n\r\ncould run out as early as year 2001/2002.  As such, there is  an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  to  create  more  land  by  reclaiming  Tuas  View\r\n\r\nExtension  to  build up the supply of industrial  land.   Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation proposes to reclaim additional land  south  of\r\n\r\nTuas View as shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION PLAN NO 5/99\", a copy of which is displayed  in  the\r\n\r\nLibrary  of  this House for the reference of hon.

To  learn the lesson that for the growth of  a  country\r\n\r\neconomically,  politically and socially, there is  a  place  for\r\n\r\ndissent.   That  it is absolutely essential that  constitutional\r\n\r\ndissent,  lawful  dissent,  should  be  allowed  and   be   even\r\n\r\nencouraged, if the country is to move forward.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed countries have recognised this long years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd  countries which are developing are beginning to learn  this\r\n\r\nlesson.  Countries with autocratic rulers are learning that they\r\n\r\ncannot keep out constitutional lawful dissent of its people, and\r\n\r\nthey  learn it sometimes at great cost to themselves.  This  has\r\n\r\nhappened in a number of African countries.  It has happened  not\r\n\r\nvery  long ago in this part of the world when President Suharto,\r\n\r\nthe  former President of Indonesia, had to learn that  he  could\r\n\r\nnot keep dissent out and had to give way to the people's demands\r\n\r\nfor   their  voices  to  be  heard.   But  this  PAP  Government\r\n\r\nstubbornly refuses to recognise the lesson.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time, of course, when it held sway completely\r\n\r\nin  this  House from 1965 or so, to 1981, without any  room  for\r\n\r\ndissent, and during that time it perhaps suffered the opposition\r\n\r\noutside  Parliament.  But after 31st October 1981, when  dissent\r\n\r\nfound  a  place  in this House, they have clamped  down  on  any\r\n\r\nattempt for dissent, for democracy to grow in this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry.  One of the measures that had previously been used was,\r\n\r\nof  course,  the  arrest of political leaders,  detaining  them,\r\n\r\nscaring them from taking part in politics, and keeping them away\r\n\r\nfrom  any  thoughts of offering themselves as candidates  for  a\r\n\r\nparty  other than the PAP to this House.  But that,  of  course,\r\n\r\nwas  not the only method.  The PAP knows that a political  party\r\n\r\ncannot function if it is starved of funds.  And so it uses  this\r\n\r\nweapon very effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right from the beginning, there was this climate of fear\r\n\r\nbrought about by the deliberate policies of the Government  that\r\n\r\nkept  people from contributing to Opposition political  parties.\r\n\r\nThe PAP themselves, of course, have no problems.  They have only\r\n\r\ngot to ask and they will get their donations.  But the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  scared into giving anything for the  Opposition\r\n\r\nparties.   And  the PAP found that very effective,  and  so  the\r\n\r\nresult  is  that the Opposition parties find it a  struggle,  an\r\n\r\nuphill battle to try and maintain any form of dissent to further\r\n\r\ntheir  calls  for  democracy  in this  country.    And  so  this\r\n\r\ncontinues, and has continued for the last 50 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain - I have not got very much time, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir  - what I am saying by reference to  a  particular\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the recent judgment in the High Court ordering the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party to pay a substantial sum in damages and costs  to\r\n\r\na  group  of  11  plaintiffs, which included  a  PAP  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  the Executive Council decided that it would  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the  public  for  help to keep the Party continue  with  its\r\n\r\nstruggle,  because  there was a threat to  wind  up  the  Party.\r\n\r\nCouncil took the decision to apply for a licence under the House\r\n\r\nto House and Street Collections Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have handed to the Clerk copies\r\n\r\nof  the correspondence that has passed between the Party and the\r\n\r\nPolice,  and I would ask that it be distributed to those Members\r\n\r\npresent, so that they may have sight of the correspondence  that\r\n\r\nhas passed.  [Copies of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncorrespondence distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pointed out to the Police - there should be four\r\n\r\nletters,  I  think - that the Executive Council  had  taken  the\r\n\r\ndecision  as a result of that judgment, and we asked whether  we\r\n\r\nmay have a licence to make an appeal.  We took this decision  as\r\n\r\na result of two previous attempts, of which time does not permit\r\n\r\nme  to  go into in great deal but I will speak a bit later about\r\n\r\nthem.   So  we  wrote, \"Will you give us a licence  to  make  an\r\n\r\nappeal?\"  There was an immediate reply asking how did we propose\r\n\r\nto  do  it.  We said that we would like a licence to be able  to\r\n\r\nappeal  over a period of time, and not just one day  as  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Flag Days given to associations, and we said we propose\r\n\r\nto  station  perhaps one or two members in prominent  places  to\r\n\r\nreceive any donations that the public may wish to give.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some five weeks or so came the reply from the police\r\n\r\nthat  no licence could be granted to us under the House to House\r\n\r\nand  Street Collections Act.  The reason is apparently  that  it\r\n\r\ncan  only  be granted to a worthy charitable cause.  Nowhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  Act  does  it say that a licence can only be granted  to  a\r\n\r\nworthy  charitable cause.  So we wrote back to the police asking\r\n\r\nto  be  shown where the Act restricted the grant of licences  to\r\n\r\nonly worthy charitable causes.  We also asked the police to tell\r\n\r\nus  under which of the grounds specified in section 4 of the Act\r\n\r\na  licence was refused, because there are specific grounds under\r\n\r\nwhich  a licence may be refused.  And, finally, we asked whether\r\n\r\nour request had been sent to the Minister and whether it was his\r\n\r\ndecision  or  whether it was the decision of the police  officer\r\n\r\nconcerned.  That letter was written about three weeks ago and we\r\n\r\nhave  not  heard  any reply, although I asked for  an  immediate\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked for this licence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because,\r\n\r\nas  I said, of two previous attempts.  We first attempted to put\r\n\r\nout a leaflet for appeal when the Party's accounts were put into\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreceiver's hands by an ex-PAP Member of Parliament and we  asked\r\n\r\nfor the funds to be sent right to the official receiver, not  to\r\n\r\nus.   We were not soliciting in the streets.  We were prosecuted\r\n\r\nfor  it.  And sad to say, we were convicted, and appealed.   The\r\n\r\nappeal  was  dismissed.  We do not agree with that decision  but\r\n\r\nthat is the decision of the court.  So there was that instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance was when we made an appeal for help for\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General of the Party to meet  certain  judgements\r\n\r\nthat  had  been  made against him in suits brought  against  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General.  We had an account opened and asked for funds\r\n\r\nto  be sent direct to that account.  Again, we were not standing\r\n\r\nin the streets or going round from house to house to collect the\r\n\r\nmonies.   The  police swooped in after a period of time,  seized\r\n\r\nthe  monies,  closed the account and said we  could  not  appeal\r\n\r\nwithout  their  licence.  Hence, the decision of  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil.  So now, we have applied and we have not heard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking in this House now for the Minister - I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  replying  - to give categorical  answers  to  four\r\n\r\nquestions.   We  do not want any \"ifs\" and \"buts\".   We  want  a\r\n\r\nplain answer \"yes\" or \"no\".  We want to know, first of all,  why\r\n\r\nis  it  that no licence can be granted to us under the House  to\r\n\r\nHouse and Street Collections Act.  Was it his decision that  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party should not be given any licence?  Or was it  just\r\n\r\nthe  decision of the police officer?  And why have we not had  a\r\n\r\nreply to that question?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I point out that, under the Act, the Minister has the\r\n\r\npower   to   exempt  any  person,  including  organisations   or\r\n\r\nsocieties,  from  the  provisions of the  Act.   Should  he  not\r\n\r\nconsider  exempting the Workers' Party from  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis   Act   for   this  particular  purpose?   Any   democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment,  conscious of its duty to the people  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nplace  for dissent and the growth of democracy, would  exempt  a\r\n\r\npolitical party making an appeal from any law preventing it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, for the last two years, political\r\n\r\nparties with representation in Parliament receive annual grants.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  not  asking for annual grants.  We are asking for a licence\r\n\r\nto  collect lawfully and peacefully any contributions  that  the\r\n\r\npublic may wish to give to us without any fear or worry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second assurance I want from the Minister here is, if\r\n\r\nhe  thinks no licence should be granted under the House to House\r\n\r\nand Street Collections Act, will he give a categorical assurance\r\n\r\nin this House that the police will not interfere if the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  made  an appeal to the public, I repeat, not standing  in\r\n\r\nthe streets and collecting the money but an appeal to the public\r\n\r\nto  send  whatever they wish to the account of the Party  or  to\r\n\r\nhand  it in to an appointed official of the Party.  And together\r\n\r\nwith  that,  an  assurance from this House to Singaporeans  that\r\n\r\nthey  are free to make any contribution or donation towards  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party.  So I would like answers to these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, may we have clear, unequivocal answers, not an\r\n\r\nanswer that is clouded by \"ifs\" and \"buts\" and \"qualifications\".\r\n\r\nWe  want  a clear \"Yes, we will grant you a licence, or we  will\r\n\r\nnot  grant you a licence.  But you may proceed to make an appeal\r\n\r\nprovided you do not stand in the streets or do not go from house\r\n\r\nto  house.\"  We do not intend to do that, because the  House  to\r\n\r\nHouse and Street Collections Act forbids standing in the streets\r\n\r\nand collecting money or going from house to house because of any\r\n\r\npressure  that  may be brought.  We wish to make an  appeal  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  moved to give may send their donations  to  the\r\n\r\nParty.  So may we have the clear assurances from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam makes a mountain out of a molehill.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The point I am trying to say is\r\n\r\nthat there was an exchange of letters between the police\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Mr Jeyaretnam which is still ongoing.  Police has furnished\r\n\r\nthe  latest  reply  which  is now  before  the  House.   But  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  jumps the gun and raises this motion in this  House.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, he is indeed anxious because, as he said just  now,  he\r\n\r\nwas  convicted  under the House to House and Street  Collections\r\n\r\nAct in 1983, when he was fined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just reply substantively to his points, having\r\n\r\ncleared  the procedural matters because it is not as cynical  as\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam makes it out to be.  Police has replied  and  the\r\n\r\nreply  is  before the House.  Police position is very  clear  in\r\n\r\nthat  a  licence under the House to House and Street Collections\r\n\r\nAct  is required if an organisation wishes to solicit funds from\r\n\r\nthe  public by means of visits from house to house or soliciting\r\n\r\nin  the  streets or other public places.  Police issues licences\r\n\r\nwhen such soliciting of funds is for charitable causes or worthy\r\n\r\ncommunity projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some examples. Examples will include flag day\r\n\r\ncollections   for   the   Salvation  Army,   Children's   Cancer\r\n\r\nFoundation,  Walk-A-Jog  donations  for  the  National   Council\r\n\r\nAgainst  Drug  Abuse, Singapore National Stroke Association,  or\r\n\r\nBreast  Cancer  Foundation and for humanitarian aid  collection,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  by  the  Red  Cross  for  Indonesia.   All  these\r\n\r\nlicensees  are  charities registered with  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nCharities, or organisations with tax exempt status given by  the\r\n\r\nIRAS,  or  members  and affiliates of the  National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial Services.  A licence will not be issued under the Act for\r\n\r\ncollections that are for personal gain or political funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, the Workers' Party's intention to collect funds to\r\n\r\npay  damages  incurred  for  defaming  others  can  neither   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  a  charitable  cause or  worthy  community  project.\r\n\r\nPublic charity should not be exploited to underwrite criminal or\r\n\r\ncivil penalties arising from one's wrongdoing.  This approach is\r\n\r\nbased,  as the letter says, on section 4(4) of the Act.  Section\r\n\r\n44(4)(f) specifies that the Commissioner of Police may,  in  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrefuse  to grant a licence if it appears to him that the purpose\r\n\r\nof  the collection is objectionable on grounds of public policy.\r\n\r\nIt is objectionable on grounds of public policy that a political\r\n\r\nparty,  whether ruling or opposition, because the law is applied\r\n\r\nequally  and  fairly across the board, be issued  a  licence  to\r\n\r\ncollect funds in a public place.  Let me explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police's professional view is that its policy of\r\n\r\nrestricting  the issuance of licences to charitable  causes  and\r\n\r\nworthy community projects should not be widened.  Doing so  will\r\n\r\nopen the floodgates for other individuals or groups to apply  to\r\n\r\nmake  collections  for  a  whole host  of  causes.   I  am  sure\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will agree with this approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the public policy considerations? Police does not\r\n\r\nwant the proliferation of public solicitation of funds as it can\r\n\r\nconstitute a public nuisance.  For example, it does not want  to\r\n\r\nsee  a  situation  where  pedestrians, including  tourists,  are\r\n\r\nconstantly  accosted along Orchard Road by those  seeking  funds\r\n\r\nfor  a  whole  host of causes.  I am sure the Singapore  Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I by way of clarification ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No more clarification for you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I am sure the Singapore Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard shares this view.  In fact, a proliferation of such public\r\n\r\nsolicitations would not just amount to a public nuisance but may\r\n\r\neven  lead  to frayed tempers caused by persistent  hassling  or\r\n\r\nharassment.  All kinds of groups going door to door  to  solicit\r\n\r\ncontributions for a whole host of causes cannot be any better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In public places, this is all the more so when political\r\n\r\nparties   are   concerned.    People  of   different   political\r\n\r\npersuasions   may  be  approached  or  pestered  or   urged   to\r\n\r\ncontribute.  There may be hackling or quarrelling, all in public\r\n\r\nview.   The  situation  may then escalate and  others  join  in.\r\n\r\nThere  will  then  be  public  disorder.   I  think  the  Police\r\n\r\nlegitimately, being concerned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  people  should  not engage in being a public  nuisance  or\r\n\r\nthere  being public disorder, disallows such applications.   But\r\n\r\nthis  is  the second point.  This answers Mr Jeyaretnam's  first\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that political parties cannot raise\r\n\r\nfunds. There are other ways they can do this.  For example, they\r\n\r\ncan raise funds through a private collection from party members,\r\n\r\nsupporters,  well-wishers and friends.  Or they can  hold  fund-raising  dinners.  Indeed, they can make public appeals provided\r\n\r\nthat  there  are no visits from house to house or soliciting  on\r\n\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I thought I made that clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Or in public places. The point\r\n\r\nis,  as  for the Worker's Party, we are assuming that there  are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans willing to donate to the party to help it  pay  its\r\n\r\ncost.    He  asked  for  an  assurance  from  this  House   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can contribute.  I think it is not for the House to\r\n\r\ngive an assurance.  It is for the party, if it thinks it can get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who want to contribute to its cause,  to  make  its\r\n\r\ncase  and the public, I am sure, will examine the party  on  its\r\n\r\nrecord.   Indeed, I understand that there is even an  appeal  on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet by somebody who may very well be a Worker's  Party\r\n\r\nmember  appealing for funds for the party with the  address  and\r\n\r\naccount number given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, up to now, there is no law against donations to\r\n\r\npolitical parties.  But in the UK, for example, a draft Bill has\r\n\r\nbeen  put before the UK Parliament which restricts donations  to\r\n\r\npolitical  parties.  The restrictions include a ban  on  foreign\r\n\r\ndonations requiring donations of 5,000 pounds or more to be made\r\n\r\npublic and banning anonymous donations of 50 pounds or more.  UK\r\n\r\nis tightening up in this area, even running before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottomline really is that Singaporeans abhor money\r\n\r\npolitics.   This healthy attitude is because the PAP  Government\r\n\r\ntook a strong stand against it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom   the  outset.   Unlike  other  countries,  the  Government\r\n\r\nscrupulously  avoided  travelling  down  this  path.   We   have\r\n\r\nexplained our approach before. The Senior Minister, when he  was\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister in 1989, spelt out three cardinal rules to  keep\r\n\r\nmoney  politics  out of Singapore. These are,  firstly,  observe\r\n\r\nstrict legal limits on election expenses, hence our cap of $2.50\r\n\r\nper  voter for single constituencies and $2.50 per voter divided\r\n\r\nby  the  total  number of candidates for GRCs in a parliamentary\r\n\r\nelection. Secondly, donations should never be made to individual\r\n\r\nMinisters  or  MPs,  but to the party.  And  thirdly,  political\r\n\r\ncontributions must never become a means of buying  influence  or\r\n\r\nswaying Government policies.  Hence, we have stood firm by these\r\n\r\nthree tenets which have served us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about foreign donations? Indeed, a case can be made\r\n\r\nto  prohibit political parties from receiving funds from foreign\r\n\r\nsources.  This is the position in many countries, such as Taiwan\r\n\r\nand  South  Korea.   As I said earlier, the UK  which  currently\r\n\r\nallows   foreign   funding  is  re-considering   its   position.\r\n\r\nProhibiting  foreign  funding of political  parties  would  help\r\n\r\nprevent  foreign influence and lobbying in the political  arena.\r\n\r\nForeign  organisations and individuals who provide  funding  for\r\n\r\npolitical party may try to influence politics in Singapore. Some\r\n\r\nof  these organisations or individuals may be fronts for foreign\r\n\r\ncountries  which  want to see a party with a  friendlier  stance\r\n\r\ntowards  their  country  come  into  power  in  Singapore.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  some foreign organisations may, by channelling  funds\r\n\r\nto  political  parties  here, promote  their  causes  which  are\r\n\r\nincompatible with the unique make-up of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

At the Retreat, we brainstormed the\r\n\r\nchallenges  facing ASEAN against the backdrop  of  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis and an expanded membership. One of the concrete\r\n\r\noutcomes that emerged from this self-appraisal process  was  the\r\n\r\nunanimous  endorsement  of  PM's proposal  for  an  ASEAN  Joint\r\n\r\nRoadshow.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Joint Roadshow will collectively market ASEAN\r\n\r\nto the major economies in North America, East Asia and Europe as\r\n\r\nan  attractive investment destination. We hope to get the  first\r\n\r\nRoadshow  out  before  the end of this  year.   By  pooling  our\r\n\r\nresources  and  working closely together on this project,  ASEAN\r\n\r\nwill send an important message to the world that it is resolute,\r\n\r\neffective and united.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meetings that took place in Singapore last month\r\n\r\nwere  essentially  meetings of Foreign Ministers,  not  Economic\r\n\r\nMinisters.  Hence, we did not directly discuss specific  aspects\r\n\r\nabout   the   regional  economy,  although  we  reaffirmed   our\r\n\r\ncommitment to remain open, market-oriented and plugged into  the\r\n\r\nglobal economy.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike last year, there was a strong mood of optimism\r\n\r\namong  ASEAN  and  the  Dialogue Partners at  the  recent  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmeetings that countries in the region had turned the corner.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, they were realistic and recognised that  reforms\r\n\r\nmust  be  on  track  and  protectionist  tendencies  should   be\r\n\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, however, that peace and stability in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia  and  the wider Asia-Pacific  is  the  essential\r\n\r\nfoundation for economic growth and recovery.  ASEAN's  essential\r\n\r\npurpose is to manage diversity and differences in Southeast Asia\r\n\r\nwithin  a  cooperative framework.  We are a  very  heterogeneous\r\n\r\nregion and the potential for conflict is never absent.

In  this  connection,   ASEAN\r\n\r\nreaffirmed the need for a Regional Code of Conduct in the  South\r\n\r\nChina  Sea.  The ASEAN Working Group on ZOPFAN and  SEANWFZ  has\r\n\r\nbeen tasked to elaborate the document.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was encouraged by the fact that there was a candid\r\n\r\nexchange  of views even on difficult and sensitive issues.

At the same time, the Foreign Ministers also recognised\r\n\r\nthat  the  ARF  process must continue to progress  in  order  to\r\n\r\nremain  relevant.  To facilitate the evolution  from  Confidence\r\n\r\nBuilding Measures to Preventive Diplomacy, Singapore, on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN, is preparing a paper on the concept and principles of\r\n\r\nPreventive  Diplomacy for further discussion in the next  inter-sessional year.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESOLUTION OF OUTSTANDING SINGAPORE-MALAYSIA BILATERAL ISSUES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  whether  the  recent visit  by  the  Malaysian  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs Minister has brought about a better chance for Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia to resolve outstanding bilateral issues, including\r\n\r\nthe  Customs,  Immigration  and  Quarantine,  water  supply  and\r\n\r\nCentral Limit Order Book issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

Since the late 1970s, Residents' Committees\r\n\r\nwere  first  formed  to serve residents in  HDB  neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nToday,  about 28,000 are serving as committee members  of  these\r\n\r\nGROs.

Government  Ministries\r\n\r\nand  agencies,  such as Ministry of Community  Development,  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team, the schools, as well as voluntary organisations have\r\n\r\norganised joint projects with the CDCs.  More agencies will join\r\n\r\nin.   Through  these  joint projects, the agencies  bring  their\r\n\r\nservices closer to the local communities.  The local communities\r\n\r\nfeel  greater  ownership of the services.

Emphasis\r\n\r\nremains  community self-help and self-reliance towards a caring,\r\n\r\ngracious and resilient society.  With more channels and  greater\r\n\r\nawareness,  more of our citizens will become more active.
