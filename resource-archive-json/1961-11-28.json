This year, this  holds\r\n\r\nonly  too true and with greater force. For we now stand\r\n\r\non  the threshold of a new independence, reunited  with\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. It is hardly necessary for me\r\n\r\nto labour this point, as the House is in the midst of a\r\n\r\ndebate on the merger proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger is the dominant issue before the whole country\r\n\r\ntoday.  When  such momentous issues are  being  debated\r\n\r\nboth  in  the  Assembly and outside, it is almost  with\r\n\r\ndiffidence that I, as Finance Minister, enter the arena\r\n\r\nto  draw  attention  to  such mundane  affairs  as  the\r\n\r\nBudget.  Nevertheless, Sir, life must go on.  Provision\r\n\r\nmust be made for the running of the public service next\r\n\r\nyear.  Perhaps  it  is a gracious Providence  that  has\r\n\r\nordained  that the Budget should be introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of  the debate on merger. For there are  already\r\n\r\nsigns  that  some  Members  of  the  Assembly  in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Benches have allowed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  imaginations to soar into space, right into  the\r\n\r\nrealms  of  wild  fantasy. Before  their  minds  circle\r\n\r\npermanently  in orbit in outer space, it is  good  that\r\n\r\nthey be brought back to earth to face the realities  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far be it from me to deliver a sermon to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   on   the  hard  economic  facts   of   life,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, I think that a few timely reminders  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  out of place, if only to bring home the  point\r\n\r\nthat  while political excitement and euphoria may be  a\r\n\r\npleasant pastime for amateur politicians, there is, for\r\n\r\nmore  practical  people, the task of  seeing  that  our\r\n\r\neconomy  continues to function and that the  livelihood\r\n\r\nof people be thereby ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore live in a tight economic situation.\r\n\r\nWe are a small island State which is prosperous because\r\n\r\nof our central geographical position. This allows us to\r\n\r\nrender services of value to our neighbours. Through the\r\n\r\nport  of  Singapore passes much of the produce  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya,  Indonesia  and   Borneo.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  we  serve as a supply base for the  consumer\r\n\r\ngoods  which these territories need. This is  the  main\r\n\r\nsource of our livelihood. We will continue to earn this\r\n\r\nlivelihood  so  long  as  we  provide  these   services\r\n\r\nefficiently  and so long as we are on good  terms  with\r\n\r\nour  neighbours.  But  when  neither  of  these  things\r\n\r\nobtains,  then this principal source of our  livelihood\r\n\r\nmay  shrivel. And this will bring in its train  poverty\r\n\r\nand destitution for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever our differences in political outlook may be\r\n\r\nwe must refrain from such action that would lead to the\r\n\r\nruin of our country through hostility of our neighbours\r\n\r\nor  the  running  down  of our business  organisations.\r\n\r\nPolitical  slogans and political ideology  cannot  feed\r\n\r\nempty stomachs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the background of the current political situation,\r\n\r\nthe  only  possible Budget that a Finance Minister  can\r\n\r\npresent  to the House is one that sees few innovations,\r\n\r\nwhile  maintaining the public services  much  in  their\r\n\r\npresent  form  with  some scope for  modest  expansion.\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, is the Budget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am privileged to present to the House  today.\r\n\r\nFor,  with  merger  around the corner,  there  will  be\r\n\r\ninnumerable  matters which will need the  attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the Central Government of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation. There will be many anomalies and  budgetary\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  be  made  between  State  and  Central\r\n\r\nGovernments,  and at this stage it is unwise  to  enter\r\n\r\ninto new lines of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean, however, that the plan for our\r\n\r\neconomic  expansion should be halted or even  retarded.\r\n\r\nThe  policy iii this respect is stated clearly  in  the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. And I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the immediate future, the task of the Government\r\n\r\nis to proceed with the work already initiated.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I discuss the Estimates now before the House,\r\n\r\nI  shall, in line with past practice, turn to a  review\r\n\r\nof the current year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review, of 1961</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1961 was an eventful one. Several new\r\n\r\nfinancial   and  economic  measures  were  successfully\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Others initiated by the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nin  previous years came to fruition during this period.\r\n\r\nI  wish to deal briefly with some of the more important\r\n\r\nof these financial and economic measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite the most important event of the year was the\r\n\r\npublication  of  the  Four-Year Development  Plan.  The\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan sets out the targets in economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  development which the State should  achieve  in\r\n\r\nthe period\r\n\r\n1961-1964.  The principal objective of the Plan  is  to\r\n\r\nincrease the rate of capital formation from its present\r\n\r\nlevel  of  about 11 per cent of the national income  to\r\n\r\nsomething  nearer 20 per cent. This  is  to  ensure  an\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the economy sufficient to keep pace  with\r\n\r\npopulation growth and to leave aside something for  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  standards of  living.  The  Plan  also\r\n\r\ncalculates  the available resources, both internal  and\r\n\r\nabroad,  to carry out the Programme. The Plan  provides\r\n\r\nfor capital investment in the public sector, that is to\r\n\r\nsay,  capital  investment by Government  and  statutory\r\n\r\nauthorities. By the nature of things, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  and does not set out targets to be achieved  by\r\n\r\nprivate  investment, though one of the main  objectives\r\n\r\nof  the  Plan is to induce an increase in the  rate  of\r\n\r\nprivate  capital investment. The Development  Plan  was\r\n\r\nconceived   against   the  background   of   a   severe\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem which threatened to  increase  to\r\n\r\nunmanageable  proportions if  no  positive  effort  was\r\n\r\ntaken.  I  will  at a later stage give details  of  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the Plan in the current year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure of great importance, which was taken\r\n\r\nby  the Government, was to set up the Economic Develop.\r\n\r\nment  Board  on 1st August, 1961. An Ordinance  setting\r\n\r\nout  the powers and functions of the Board was approved\r\n\r\nby  the  Assembly on 24th May, 1961. It has  taken  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government some two years to launch the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. In this period, we  had  access  to\r\n\r\nexpert  opinion  at  the highest level,  including  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank and the United Nations Special Missions. The\r\n\r\nBoard  has started its work, recruited personnel,  and\r\n\r\ngot down to business, I shall deal with the work of the\r\n\r\nBoard later in my statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned in previous Budget statements that\r\n\r\nwe  would be approaching the World Bank for Development\r\n\r\nloans.  Members  will be glad to learn that  the  World\r\n\r\nBank  has  agreed in principle to negotiate  loans  for\r\n\r\nprojects in the Four-Year Development Plan. At present,\r\n\r\ntwo  projects  are  under  consideration,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of water and power supplies. It is  a  source\r\n\r\nof  satisfaction to the Government that the World  Bank\r\n\r\nhas  agreed to finance our development projects, for  a\r\n\r\nWorld Bank loan indicates the confidence of the Bank in\r\n\r\nthe financial standing of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1961 also saw the conclusion of the work\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  two  United  Nations  Special  Missions\r\n\r\ndespatched to Singapore. One Mission, headed by Dr  A.\r\n\r\nWinsemius,    studied    the   general    problem    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  of  Singapore.  In   addition,   the\r\n\r\nMission   made  recommendations  in  respect   of   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of specific new industries. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for implementing the findings  of  this\r\n\r\nreport rests with the Economic Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other United Nations Mission, headed by Mr P. L.\r\n\r\nSchereschewsky, examined the feasibility  of  a  steel\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore. The Government is acting on  its\r\n\r\nrecommendation that a small rolling mill should be  set\r\n\r\nup  as  a  first  step.  We  have  been  successful  in\r\n\r\npersuading  a group of local businessmen to pool  their\r\n\r\nresources to establish this steel plant which  will  be\r\n\r\nsited  in Jurong. They have held negotiations with  one\r\n\r\nof  the  major  Japanese  Steel  companies  over  their\r\n\r\nparticipation   in  this  project.  No  agreement   was\r\n\r\nreached,  however, though the door was  left  open  for\r\n\r\nfuture  participation  in a more  substantial  project,\r\n\r\nshould this prove feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another event of significance was the conclusion of\r\n\r\nthe  agreement on basic arrangements in regard to trade\r\n\r\nbetween  the Governments of Singapore and the  Republic\r\n\r\nof  Indonesia.  In consequences of this agreement,  the\r\n\r\nOffice    of   the   Singapore   Trade   and   Cultural\r\n\r\nRepresentative was established in Djakarta  this  year.\r\n\r\nAnother   agreement  entered  into   with   a   foreign\r\n\r\nGovernment was the Agreement on the Avoidance of Double\r\n\r\nTaxation  which  was  ratified by  the  Governments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Japan in September this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Government decided to\r\n\r\noffer  Treasury  Bills to the public on  tender.  These\r\n\r\nbills  were  issued under the authority  of  the  Local\r\n\r\nTreasury  Bill  Ordinance. The value of Treasury  Bills\r\n\r\nnow  outstanding is $12 million issued on  tender,  and\r\n\r\n$5.3 million issues on tap, making a total of just over\r\n\r\n$17  million. Treasury Bills provide a safe and  liquid\r\n\r\nform of short-term investment. They are useful to banks\r\n\r\nand other concerns which may have surplus cash balances\r\n\r\nseeking  investment of a fairly liquid form.  There  is\r\n\r\nconsiderable  scope  for expansion  of  the  short-term\r\n\r\nmoney market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loan of $50 million bearing an interest of 5\u00be per\r\n\r\ncent  redeemable  in  20  years  was  floated  on  27th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1961, all of which was taken up.  This  loan\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  useful  addition to the resources  of  our\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to turn to the general economic picture of the\r\n\r\nState.  The value of Singapore's trade in 1961 has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  as  large as that of the previous year.  For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  three-quarters of 1961, the value of  our  total\r\n\r\ntrade  amounted  to  $5,473 million  as  compared  with\r\n\r\n$5,700  million  last  year. Our imports  fell  by  $72\r\n\r\nmillion  and,  more  seriously,  our  exports  by  $155\r\n\r\nmillion.   Our  two  major  trade  partners   are   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya and Indonesia, and in respect  of\r\n\r\nboth,  there has been a slight decrease in  value.  Our\r\n\r\nexports  to Indonesia, however, have shown a small  but\r\n\r\nwelcome  increase from an average of  $10  million  per\r\n\r\nmonth  in 1960 to nearly $13 million per month in 1961.\r\n\r\nThis improvement reflects better relations between  the\r\n\r\ntwo countries. The principal reason for the decline  in\r\n\r\ntrade  values is the fall in the price of  rubber.  Our\r\n\r\ntrade  in  rubber  accounts for a third  of  our  total\r\n\r\nimports  and  nearly  half of our  exports.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nsmall  variations in the price of rubber  will  have  a\r\n\r\nsignificant effect on our trade values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 1960, was a good year for rubber, the\r\n\r\naverage  price  for  R.S.S. 1 being  $1.08  cts.  Since\r\n\r\nOctober  1960,  however, the price of rubber  began  to\r\n\r\ndrop.  During  1961  this  drop  continued  slowly  but\r\n\r\nsteadily  with average prices being between 90  and  82\r\n\r\ncents. Recently the price is around 75 cents above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect on Singapore so far has not been very\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  As  far  as the activities  of  our  port\r\n\r\ntransport   communications  and  business  houses   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it is the volume of trade rather  than  the\r\n\r\nvalue  which  determines how well off we are.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the  position is happier.  Total  tonnage  of\r\n\r\ncargo  handled showed a slight improvement in  1961  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  last  year. In the  period  January  to\r\n\r\nAugust  1960,  just over 6 million tons  of  cargo  was\r\n\r\ndischarged and 3.4 million tons loaded. This  year  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding  figures have risen to 7.5  million  tons\r\n\r\ndischarged and 4.2 million tons loaded. The  volume  of\r\n\r\ncargo handled by the Singapore Harbour Board alone  has\r\n\r\nshown  an  increase from a monthly turnover of  396,000\r\n\r\ntons to 533,000 tons. Again during the same period, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of  ships which were cleared by our  Port  rose\r\n\r\nfrom  12,933  to  13,751. In terms of total  registered\r\n\r\ntons,  there  was an increase from 43 million  tons  to\r\n\r\n47.5  million tons. On the whole, the volume  of  trade\r\n\r\nwas  high this year and the capacity for handling  this\r\n\r\nvolume was fully employed. Nevertheless, the decline in\r\n\r\nthe  price  of rubber is bound adversely to affect  the\r\n\r\nearning power of our neighbours. They in turn will  buy\r\n\r\nless  goods  and  this may reduce the volume  of  trade\r\n\r\npassing through Singapore unless there is a revival  in\r\n\r\nthe price of rubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general trend of economic activity in the State\r\n\r\nfor  the  past year is also reflected in the volume  of\r\n\r\nfinancial   transactions  and  changes  in  levels   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  production  and  constructional   activity.\r\n\r\nLoans  and advances made by banks increased from $569.5\r\n\r\nmillion last September to $666.4 million September this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upward trend of manufacturing activity which I\r\n\r\nbrought to your notice in my last Budget speech may  be\r\n\r\nseen  to continue into this year. This is reflected  in\r\n\r\nthe  increase  of  production of main  industries.  The\r\n\r\ncigarette  industry has shown an increase of nearly  25\r\n\r\nper  cent  for the first eight months of this  year  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with the corresponding period of  last  year.\r\n\r\nOutput  rose from 2,455,000 pounds to 3,062,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOther industries which showed a significant increase in\r\n\r\nproduction  are coconut oil (17 per cent),  sago  flour\r\n\r\n(14  per cent), soft drinks (17 per cent) and remilling\r\n\r\nof  rubber (40 per cent). How, ever, the production  of\r\n\r\nbiscuits, soap and soya bean sauce declined slightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry saw heightened activity\r\n\r\ngenerated  by  the  massive building programme  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board  and  the  revival  of\r\n\r\nprivate building activity with the favourable change of\r\n\r\npolicy  towards  development  charges  for  main   City\r\n\r\nCouncil services. This is reflected in the increases in\r\n\r\nour retained imports of building materials. Imports  of\r\n\r\ncement  increased  by 40 per cent  in  the  first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  this  year.  Imports  of  steel  and  other\r\n\r\nconstructional  materials have also  shown  an  equally\r\n\r\nsubstantial increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic expansion, consumption of textiles\r\n\r\nand  durable goods have shown a corresponding rise\r\n\r\nfor  the period under review. Retained imports  of\r\n\r\nradio and refrigerators increased by about 30  per\r\n\r\ncent while new registration of private cars, motor-cycles,  and  scooters increased by 35  per  cent.\r\n\r\nTextiles retained for the first six months  showed\r\n\r\na  substantial  increase  over  the  corresponding\r\n\r\nperiod  last year. So far as statistical  evidence\r\n\r\nis  available, more goods were generally  consumed\r\n\r\nthis year compared with the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects for the coming year are not\r\n\r\nunhopeful. The American economy has recovered from\r\n\r\nthe  recession of last year and it appears set for\r\n\r\nfurther advance. Similarly, the economic expansion\r\n\r\nof  industrial  nations, which slowed  down  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  countries  last  year,  is  likely  to\r\n\r\nregister a general advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue and Expenditure 1961</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to a review of expenditure and\r\n\r\nrevenue  in  1961.  Expenditure was  estimated  at\r\n\r\n$348.3  million. For the first ten months  of  the\r\n\r\nyear,   actual  expenditure  amounted  to   $246.7\r\n\r\nmillion. It is not easy to forecast what the final\r\n\r\nfigure would be, because most of the bills for the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  equipment under O.C.S.E.  Heads  and\r\n\r\nworks started in the year will be paid in the last\r\n\r\nquarter  of the year. It is likely, however,  that\r\n\r\nExpenditure  will fall short of the  Estimates  by\r\n\r\nsome  $30  million.  I dealt last  year  with  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  expenditure of  that  year  was  not\r\n\r\nexpected  to  reach  the  levels  estimated.   The\r\n\r\nfamiliar  reasons  were  that  of  difficulty   in\r\n\r\nrecruitment of staff and delays in the  fulfilment\r\n\r\nof  orders by suppliers. This year, however, a new\r\n\r\nfactor  arose,  and  this  is  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  City Council Departments now  integrated\r\n\r\ninto the Government Departments have overestimated\r\n\r\ntheir requirements. This will be made clear when I\r\n\r\ndiscuss Heads of Expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Heads of Expenditure where there has\r\n\r\nbeen  substantial under-expenditure, Public  Works\r\n\r\nRecurrent shows that some $4 million will not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspent principally because of the lack of engineers\r\n\r\nand   architects  to  supervise  maintenance   and\r\n\r\nconstruction work. We are making every effort  to\r\n\r\nbring   the  establishment  of  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment to full strength, but there  are  still\r\n\r\ndeficiencies  in  the senior  and  medium  grades.\r\n\r\nFurther,  there  has  been  an  over-provision  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the Transport Centre taken over from to\r\n\r\nCity Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Ministry of Health, under-expenditure has been less than that of previous\r\n\r\nyears.  The Ministry of Health is likely to  spend\r\n\r\nsome  $3.7  million less than the  Estimates,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is principally due to unfilled posts in  the\r\n\r\nsenior  and  ancillary grades. The Government  has\r\n\r\nmade  certain  improvements in the  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  of nursing and other ancillary  staff.  I\r\n\r\nhope that with these improvements we shall be able\r\n\r\nto fill most of the vacant posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance is expected to spend\r\n\r\nsome  $3 million less than the Estimates. This  is\r\n\r\nprincipally  due  to  the  fact  that  an  Advance\r\n\r\nAccount  of  $2  million  provided  for   in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates   to   pay  for  forward  purchases   of\r\n\r\nmaterials   and  stores  by  the  City  Engineer's\r\n\r\nDepartment  was  not drawn upon. There  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  stricter controls over payments of  passages\r\n\r\nand  miscellaneous travelling expenses. Some  $2.4\r\n\r\nmillion  will not be spent under Charge on Account\r\n\r\nof  the  Public Debt, because the total amount  of\r\n\r\nborrowing  by  the Government did  not  reach  the\r\n\r\nlevel  estimated.  The  Ministry  of  Labour  will\r\n\r\nprobably  spend  $900,000 short of  the  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  This is principally  due  to  under-expenditure on Work Brigade projects.  The  Police\r\n\r\nwill  spend  some  $900,000 less  than  estimated.\r\n\r\nThere is difficulty in recruiting constables  with\r\n\r\nthe  qualifications and standards set  down.  Some\r\n\r\nreorganisation  has taken place, as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nwhich  certain  static  or non-operational  duties\r\n\r\nhave  been regarded as Guard Constables for  which\r\n\r\nlower  standards may be accepted.  Recruitment  to\r\n\r\nthis  group  is  proceeding  satisfactorily.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education will under-spend by  roughly\r\n\r\n$4.6   million.  This  is  due  to  more   careful\r\n\r\nadministration of Grants-in-Aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere   is  also  the  perennial  problem  of   getting\r\n\r\nsufficient numbers of suitably qualified personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1961 revenue position is satisfactory. The yield\r\n\r\nfrom  most  of  the  main  items  of  revenue  exceeded\r\n\r\nexpectations.  1960 by all accounts must  have  been  a\r\n\r\ngood  business  year,  for the yield  from  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nsurpassed  the  estimated amount of $75 million  by  $5\r\n\r\nmillion. The estimate for Property Tax of $31.6 million\r\n\r\nis  likely  to  be exceeded by $12.5 million.  This  is\r\n\r\nmainly  due  to improvements in collection  procedures.\r\n\r\nTotalisator and Sweepstakes duties did not  fulfil  the\r\n\r\noptimistic  expectations of $8 million. The yield  will\r\n\r\nbe about $2.8 million less than the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and Excise revenue was buoyant. The total\r\n\r\nrevenue  collected  from the Customs Department  during\r\n\r\nthe  first ten months of the year was $95.4 million  or\r\n\r\n$3  million more than the revenue collected  last  year\r\n\r\nfor  the  same  period. The total  Customs  revenue  is\r\n\r\nexpected to reach $116 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquor duties will probably exceed the estimated\r\n\r\n$23.1  million by $3 million. Consumption of liquor  of\r\n\r\nall grades had been maintained throughout the year at a\r\n\r\nhigh  level. The Tobacco revenue, which in recent years\r\n\r\nhad  given  rise to anxiety, will for once  exceed  the\r\n\r\nestimate. The figure of $38.5 million may be passed  by\r\n\r\nsome  $3  million.  On  the other hand,  Petroleum  has\r\n\r\nproved  a disappointment. Once again, there is a short-fall, this time probably in the region of $1.3 million.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been  a  switch from petroleum  engines  to\r\n\r\ndiesel engines to power vehicles. However, the yield of\r\n\r\nthe  special tax on heavy oil engine vehicles has  more\r\n\r\nthan   offset  the  short-fall  in  Petroleum  revenue.\r\n\r\nEntertainment Duty may just fail to reach the estimated\r\n\r\n$7.7 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instalment of $10 million of the $30\r\n\r\nmillion loan repayment by the Federation of Malaya  was\r\n\r\nmade  this year. The United Kingdom Government  made  a\r\n\r\ncontribution  of $4.28 million towards the  maintenance\r\n\r\nof the Local Defence Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>City Council integration</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I comment on the Estimates now before the\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  wish to dwell at some length on the progress\r\n\r\nmade on the integration of the City Council departments\r\n\r\ninto  the  Government.  This is a major  administrative\r\n\r\nreform  undertaken by the P.A.P. Government. I wish  to\r\n\r\nsay also something about the next stage in this process\r\n\r\nof  integration, which would be the setting up  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic   Utilities  Board  to  take  over  the  Trading\r\n\r\ndepartments of the City Council. This year's  estimates\r\n\r\nis the first exercise at integrating the Budgets of the\r\n\r\nGovernment and certain City Council departments. I have\r\n\r\ndwelt  at some length last year on the intricate nature\r\n\r\nof  this  exercise. The work of integration was carried\r\n\r\non  more smoothly than was thought possible last  year.\r\n\r\nIn   spite  of  the  different  systems  of  accounting\r\n\r\nprocedure,  the  management of this  integrated  Budget\r\n\r\ncarried  on  smoothly and without any major upset.  The\r\n\r\nvolume  of  work  handled  at the  Accountant-General's\r\n\r\nOffice has increased by about a third. The staff of the\r\n\r\noffice  had to be supplemented with one Accountant  and\r\n\r\nsixteen   subordinate  staff.   The   next   stage   of\r\n\r\nintegration  would  be to set up the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard  and I shall deal with some of the problems  that\r\n\r\nthis  will  raise, as these are matters  of  widespread\r\n\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council has hitherto been divided into two\r\n\r\nmain  parts, the Rate Fund Departments and the  Trading\r\n\r\nDepartments.  The Rate Fund Departments, which  include\r\n\r\nsewerage,  cleansing and many other  departments,  were\r\n\r\nfinanced from rates paid by ratepayers under the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance, 1957. The Trading departments are\r\n\r\nthe  water, gas and electricity departments, and  they\r\n\r\nderive their revenues from the consumers of water,  gas\r\n\r\nand  electricity.  The intention is to  constitute  the\r\n\r\nTrading  departments, with the necessary administrative\r\n\r\nstaff,  as  a  Public Utilities Board.  The  Rate  Fund\r\n\r\nDepartments  are  to be integrated or merged  with  the\r\n\r\nexisting Ministries of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   personnel   and  equipment  of  the   Rate   Fund\r\n\r\nDepartments have already been transferred physically to\r\n\r\nGovernment Ministries and are now operating  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol   of  those  Ministries.  This,  the  so-called\r\n\r\nphysical  integration, began on the  1st  January  this\r\n\r\nyear, and is, for all practical purposes, completed. In\r\n\r\naddition, the revenues formerly received by those  Rate\r\n\r\nFund Departments have been paid to the Government since\r\n\r\n1st  January, 1961, and their expenditure has been paid\r\n\r\nby the Government from the same date in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe Local Government (Financial Integration) Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1960.  The  personnel  and  equipment  of  the  Trading\r\n\r\ndepartments,  and the associated administrative  staff,\r\n\r\nwill  remain with the City Council, and their  revenues\r\n\r\nand  expenditure are still accounted for  by  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil. Standing outside and apart from the Rate  Fund\r\n\r\nand the Trading Departments are the Municipal Provident\r\n\r\nFund  and  the public loans raised by the City Council.\r\n\r\nThese two accounts serve both the Rate Fund Departments\r\n\r\nand   the  Trading  departments  and  are  still  being\r\n\r\nmaintained  by the City Council as a common service  to\r\n\r\nall   departments, including  those  that  have   been\r\n\r\nintegrated with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taking-over of the revenues of the Rate Fund\r\n\r\nDepartments by the Government requires only  one  minor\r\n\r\nadjustment.  It relates to the collection of  fees  for\r\n\r\nsewerage  and  other sanitary services. These  services\r\n\r\nare at present billed in different ways in the city and\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas, but as from 1st January  next  a\r\n\r\nuniform  system  of billing is to be  introduced.  From\r\n\r\nthat  date, the occupiers of all houses throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland   will   find  that  the  familiar  consolidated\r\n\r\naccounts rendered every month by the City Council  will\r\n\r\nbe  slightly changed and some people in the  city  area\r\n\r\nwill  find  that  they are billed for certain  sanitary\r\n\r\nservices by the Ministry of Health and no longer by the\r\n\r\nCity Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been decided that the administration of the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Provident Fund\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall  be taken over by the Government and administered\r\n\r\nin  the common interests of the Government, the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board, and the new  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard.  It has also been decided that the public  loans\r\n\r\nand  sinking funds of the City Council shall  be  taken\r\n\r\nover  by  the new Public Utilities Board and  that  the\r\n\r\nrelatively small liability of the Government for  these\r\n\r\nloans  shall  be  discharged by, regular  contributions\r\n\r\nfrom the Government to the new Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains to deal with the assets in cash and\r\n\r\nproperty of the City Council. These assets have a  book\r\n\r\nvalue  of over $600,000,000. They are to be apportioned\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government and the new  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard; the power stations, water works and other assets\r\n\r\nof  the Trading Departments going to the Board and  the\r\n\r\nroads,  sewers, fire engines and other  assets  of  the\r\n\r\nRate  Fund  Departments going to  the  Government.  For\r\n\r\nvarious technical reasons, it has been decided that the\r\n\r\nmost  convenient date on which the apportionment is  to\r\n\r\ntake  place  is  1st January, 1961, and the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  assume  the ownership of its portion with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom that date. The portion which goes to the new Board\r\n\r\nwill  be  handed  over to it when it  is  set  up.  The\r\n\r\nliabilities of the Rate Fund Departments will  likewise\r\n\r\nbe  assumed by the Government and those of the  Trading\r\n\r\nDepartments by the new Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minor adjustments are to be made for the\r\n\r\nconvenience of administration. The public street  lamps\r\n\r\nand  stand-pipes of Singapore which are  owned  by  the\r\n\r\nTrading  departments  will  be  handed  over   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment with, of course, the associated liability to\r\n\r\nmaintain  them. Certain houses and buildings which  are\r\n\r\nthe  property  of  the  Rate Fund Departments  will  be\r\n\r\nhanded  over to the new Board in order that it  may  be\r\n\r\nproperly   equipped   to   carry   on   its   functions\r\n\r\neconomically  in the interests of consumers  of  water,\r\n\r\ngas  and electricity. It will be seen that although  it\r\n\r\nis  relatively  easy  to  give general  directions  for\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  these intentions, an immense  amount  of\r\n\r\nwork will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  done  in  sorting  out  the  assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities of the City Council acquired over the  last\r\n\r\n100 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the problems of the personnel of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council,  I should first explain that  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  2,600 monthly-rated employees in the  Rate  Fund\r\n\r\nDepartments   and,  on  integration   with   Government\r\n\r\nMinistries,  they  join up with about  29,000  monthly-rated  Government employees. It has been  decided  that\r\n\r\nevery  permanently engaged monthly-rated  City  Council\r\n\r\nemployee  shall  retain his present salary  and  salary\r\n\r\nscale  on  his transfer to the Government service.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  all of them who are members of the Municipal\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  will be allowed to remain  members  of\r\n\r\nthat Fund and will, on their retirement, be entitled to\r\n\r\nreceive  the  full benefits of that Fund calculated  on\r\n\r\n.the  basic  salary  drawn in the  Government  service.\r\n\r\nThere  are many problems connected with their  transfer\r\n\r\nthe  details  of which are being worked  out  grade  by\r\n\r\ngrade and, in some cases, individual by individual. The\r\n\r\ngeneral  intention is that the entry of these  monthly-rated employees of the City Council into the Government\r\n\r\nservice  should not result in displacement or  impaired\r\n\r\nprospects  either for themselves or for the  Government\r\n\r\nemployees they join.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained, the physical integration of the\r\n\r\nRate  Fund  departments  with Government  is  complete.\r\n\r\nThose  departments  have  now become  merged  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  What remains of the City Council  is  that\r\n\r\npart  of its former self which is to become the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board. Legislative sanction to carry out  the\r\n\r\nfinal acts of formally transferring assets, liabilities\r\n\r\nand  employees will be sought in two Bills. The one  is\r\n\r\nthe  Local Government Integration Bill which will  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the transfers to the Government as well  as  with\r\n\r\nthe  manifold powers and duties carried out by the Rate\r\n\r\nFund   departments.  The  other  Bill  is  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Bill  which will establish  the  new  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board. Certain other minor Bills will also be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to bring about consequential amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe pensions laws and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitution of the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expenditure Estimates, 1962</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now discuss the 1962 Estimates. As I said in my\r\n\r\nintroductory remarks, the Budget for 1962  is  designed\r\n\r\nto  maintain existing provisions, making allowances for\r\n\r\nnormal  expansion. The only new service  that  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced next year is the Television service which  I\r\n\r\nshall discuss later. Other than this, all increases  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure are due to normal expansion. The  expansion\r\n\r\nof  the social services to keep pace with demand  is  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  one.  Education and  health  between  them\r\n\r\naccount  for  $25  million additional expenditure.  The\r\n\r\ngrowth of expenditure on education has been striking in\r\n\r\nthe  past  ten  years.  In  1951  the  annual  vote  on\r\n\r\neducation was only $12.4 million. Next year the  amount\r\n\r\nwill  be  $89.1  million, a sevenfold  increase  in  11\r\n\r\nyears. We in Singapore have reached the stage where  it\r\n\r\nis  possible to provide free education for every  child\r\n\r\nup  to  primary  stage.  I have,  in  my  first  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement,  drawn  attention to the  mounting  cost  of\r\n\r\neducation.  Every  loyal citizen  wants  the  State  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the highest possible standards of education as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to  ensure its widest possible extension.  So\r\n\r\nfar,  we  have  been fortunate that we have  sufficient\r\n\r\nresources  to  satisfy this wish. As  for  the  future,\r\n\r\nwhether  Singapore will be able to  do  so  depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not we succeed in expanding  our  national\r\n\r\nincome   fast  enough.  If  everyone  makes  his   full\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  this end, I think  we  can  make  the\r\n\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards particular Heads of Expenditure, the\r\n\r\nprincipal  increases  in expenditure  occur  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  National  Development  ($6.5   million),\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health and Law ($6.1 million),  Charge  on\r\n\r\nAccount  of  Public  Debt ($5.9 million),  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture   ($2.15   million),  Defence  Services   ($1.5\r\n\r\nmillion), and Ministry of Education ($20.98 million).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large increase in the provision of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National  Development is due to  a  change  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget. The votes for the Work Brigade have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  transferred from the Ministry of  Labour  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development. This has  been  done\r\n\r\nfor  organisational  reasons  since  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nNational Development is concerned with most of the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase under Charge on Account of Public Debt\r\n\r\nis to meet loan charges in respect of the 1961 Loan and\r\n\r\nthat part of Government's liability in relation to City\r\n\r\nCouncil loans consequent on integration of certain City\r\n\r\nCouncil departments into the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate administration, the Head \"Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth\"  has  now been reorganised under  three  Heads:\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health and Law, Hospitals  Division,  and\r\n\r\nPublic   Health   Division.  City   Health   has   been\r\n\r\nincorporated  into  the  Public  Health  Division.  The\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   medical  and   health   services   has\r\n\r\nnecessitated  an  increase  of  staff  at  all  levels.\r\n\r\nMaintenance costs have necessarily risen. The  increase\r\n\r\nis  also due to the absorption of provisions for  water\r\n\r\nsupplies  from  stand-pipes in rural  areas  and  rural\r\n\r\ncleansing  and  scavenging  services  previously  shown\r\n\r\nunder Rural Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the provision for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture is due to the incorporation under this Head  of\r\n\r\nVictoria  Theatre  and Memorial Hall (previously  shown\r\n\r\nseparately).  There  has been  also  expansion  in  the\r\n\r\nactivities of that Ministry. Members will recall voting\r\n\r\nsupplementary provision this year from Suara  Singapura\r\n\r\nand  the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan.  These\r\n\r\nhave  now gone into full swing. Provision has also been\r\n\r\nentered  for  engineering and  technical  staff  for  a\r\n\r\ntelevision service. Plans for this service have reached\r\n\r\nan  advanced  stage, and I expect that the new  service\r\n\r\nwill be inaugurated by the end of 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Defence Services for 1961 was based\r\n\r\non a standstill budget pending the outcome of financial\r\n\r\ntalks  with the British Government. Now that the extent\r\n\r\nof the contribution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  the British Government is prepared to  make  has\r\n\r\nbeen  ascertained, it is possible to have  a  realistic\r\n\r\nbudget  for  Defence  Services.  Recruitment,  repairs,\r\n\r\nreplacements  of  equipment,  and  so  on  which   were\r\n\r\npreviously deferred, could now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the large increase under the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation. With the increase in educational facilities,\r\n\r\nadditional  staff and non-teaching staff  (to  maintain\r\n\r\nschool   compounds,  buildings  and  so  on)  will   be\r\n\r\nrequired.  There will be the consequential increase  in\r\n\r\nequipment  and consumption of water and light.  Also  a\r\n\r\nlarge  element  of  the increase is occasioned  by  the\r\n\r\ncontribution to the University of Singapore. The sum is\r\n\r\n$8.5 million, of which $4.0 million is recoverable from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government in  respect  of  Federation\r\n\r\nstudents.  There is also an increase in the  number  of\r\n\r\nbursaries to students. Further, earlier this year,  the\r\n\r\nLembaga   Gerakan   Pelajaran   Dewasa   extended   its\r\n\r\nactivities   substantially   by   introducing   further\r\n\r\neducation  classes  which  have  proved  to   be   well\r\n\r\nsupported. To meet this additional commitment  as  well\r\n\r\nas  its  regular  expansion, the  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nLembaga  is  now increased from $500,000 to $1,019,400.\r\n\r\nFinally  the total under the Ministry of Education  has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased by a sum of $1,997,400  in  respect  of\r\n\r\n\"Contribution  to  the  Polytechnic\".  In  this  year's\r\n\r\nEstimates the contribution to the Polytechnic is  shown\r\n\r\nunder    the   Head,   Contributions   and   Charitable\r\n\r\nAllowances, a practice not in keeping with the  dignity\r\n\r\nof that institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to housing, the terms of a subsidy to the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board are being discussed, and I  expect  that\r\n\r\nthese  will  be settled next year. Provision  for  this\r\n\r\nwill be applied for in a supplementary estimate in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of 1962. In the meantime, substantial sums  have\r\n\r\nbeen  provided  both  in this year's  and  next  year's\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates to finance the Board  by  way  of\r\n\r\nloans.  Thus,  1962 will be another year in  which  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of social services is kept up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue Estimates, 1962</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The favourable trend in revenue collections is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  continue  into 1962.  The  1962  estimate\r\n\r\n($391.1  million) is $46.3 million more than  the  1961\r\n\r\nestimate ($344.8 million). The yield from Income Tax is\r\n\r\nexpected to exceed the 1961 estimate of $75 million  by\r\n\r\n$5  million. Property Tax will yield $14.4 million more\r\n\r\nthan  the 1961 estimate of $31.6 million. Receipts from\r\n\r\nTobacco  Duties  are also expected to exceed  the  1961\r\n\r\nestimates  by  $3  million,  based  on  the  trend   of\r\n\r\nconsumption  at present. Liquor Duties are expected  to\r\n\r\nincrease from $23.1 million estimated for 1961 to $26.0\r\n\r\nmillion. Stamp and Estate Duties are estimated to yield\r\n\r\n$0.3  million and $1.3 million respectively  more  than\r\n\r\nthe  1961  estimates of $3.6 million and $3.2  million.\r\n\r\nFurther,  increases are expected in respect  of  Postal\r\n\r\nReceipts   and   Telecommunications   Receipts,   Motor\r\n\r\nVehicles  Taxes,  Rents and Interests  and  Singapore's\r\n\r\nshare of the Currency Profits. There are also increases\r\n\r\nin  the  small items which are too numerous to  detail.\r\n\r\nBut   two  large  new  items  appear  in  next   year's\r\n\r\nEstimates. The first is Reimbursement by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   of  part  of  the  Singapore  Government's\r\n\r\ncontribution to the University of Singapore, being  its\r\n\r\ncontribution to cover Federation students  studying  at\r\n\r\nthe  University. This amounts to $4 million, and  is  a\r\n\r\nper-contra  item against the expenditure vote  of  $8.5\r\n\r\nmillion  shown under the Expenditure Estimates  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. The other is the Contribution by\r\n\r\nthe  U.K. Government towards the cost of Local  Defence\r\n\r\nServices.  This amounts to $4.7 million.  Now  for  the\r\n\r\ndecreases.  The  falling trend  in  the  collection  of\r\n\r\nPetroleum  Duties is reflected in the  decrease  of  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  shown  in the 1962 estimate against  the  1961\r\n\r\nestimate  of  $38.5 million. There is also  $\u00bd  million\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  Entertainment  Duty.  The  estimate   for\r\n\r\nSweepstake  revenue has been readjusted,  and  in  1962\r\n\r\nwill  show a reduction of $1.5 million as compared with\r\n\r\nthe   1961   estimate  of  $8.0  million.  As  regards,\r\n\r\nCommercial Broadcasting, I have taken into account  the\r\n\r\ncurrent year's collection as well as the proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduction   of   commercial  broadcasting   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. On these bases,  the  yield  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be $700,000 less than the 1961 estimate  of\r\n\r\n$2.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue forecasts are necessarily affected by the\r\n\r\nvagaries of our entrepot trade which is so sensitive to\r\n\r\nthe  effects  of  trade  fluctuations  in  neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritories.  The  forecasts  made  of  revenue  yields\r\n\r\nassume that there will be no calamitous decline in  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  primary products nor any  boom  conditions.\r\n\r\nNeither of these extreme conditions is likely and, with\r\n\r\nreasonably  good  fortune, we  may  see  our  estimates\r\n\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Summary of Expenditure and Revenue in 1962</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With expenditure estimated at $394.0 million and\r\n\r\nRevenue at $391 million, the Budget for 1962 will be an\r\n\r\nalmost  balanced one. It is a budget intended  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe public services going in the direction laid down in\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech while the  people\r\n\r\nand  the  State  get down to working out  the  detailed\r\n\r\narrangements  of merger and map out the future  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth State of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the Development Estimates. Development\r\n\r\nprojects differ from other activities of the Government\r\n\r\nin  that it is not easy to consider them in a framework\r\n\r\nof  annual  estimates.  The  reason  is  obvious.  Many\r\n\r\nprojects take more than one year to complete. Even  for\r\n\r\nshort-term  projects, work may be started in  one  year\r\n\r\nand  completed in the next. Hence there is need to look\r\n\r\nforward over a longer period than one year and this  is\r\n\r\none of the reasons why a Development Plan is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose to consider the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  against the framework of the  State's  Four-Year  Development Plan. First, I shall give  a  general\r\n\r\nfinancial outline of development expenditure  in  1961.\r\n\r\nThen  I shall proceed to an examination of the progress\r\n\r\nachieved  in  some  of  the more important  development\r\n\r\nprojects in the Four-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE 1961</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, the amount voted for development expenditure\r\n\r\nwas  $166.2  million. It is difficult to  say  at  this\r\n\r\nstage  just how much of this sum would have been  spent\r\n\r\nby the end of the year for reasons which I have already\r\n\r\nmentioned  before.  Preliminary  estimates  show   that\r\n\r\nDevelopment Expenditure would amount to about  $100  to\r\n\r\n$110 million. This is an all-time record for Singapore.\r\n\r\nA  further  sum  of  $54 million has  been  entered  as\r\n\r\nrevotes  for  next  year. Much of this  sum  represents\r\n\r\nexpenditure already committed, but the bills  will  not\r\n\r\nbe presented for actual payment this year. In assessing\r\n\r\nthe  performance in the first year of the Plan,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  bear  in  mind certain  difficulties  in\r\n\r\ngetting  the Plan into stride. First, a fair amount  of\r\n\r\ntime  has  to  be  spent  in  preparation,  design  and\r\n\r\nplanning  of public works and building construction.  I\r\n\r\nhave  already  referred to the shortage of  architects,\r\n\r\nquantity  surveyors,  engineers  in  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment. This is a source of constant anxiety to the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Further, in many cases, sites for buildings\r\n\r\nand routes for roads require preliminary steps, such as\r\n\r\nthe  acquisition of land and resettlement of squatters,\r\n\r\nbefore work can actually proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tide over the present shortage of technical\r\n\r\npersonnel,  we have tried to recruit men from  overseas\r\n\r\non   short-term  contracts  pending  the  training  and\r\n\r\nrecruitment   of  local  personnel.  I   have   already\r\n\r\npreviously  mentioned  that we tried  to  recruit  from\r\n\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, the U.K., Japan, and Israel and\r\n\r\nwe are in communication with these Governments. To this\r\n\r\nlist   must   be   added  Western   Germany.   Overseas\r\n\r\nrecruitment is by no means an easy task as the shortage\r\n\r\nof   experienced  technical  personnel  is   worldwide.\r\n\r\nFurther, recruitment procedures have to be agreed  with\r\n\r\nthe government of the countries concerned and this is a\r\n\r\ntime-consuming  process. Some small  success  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved, though I hope that next year we shall be able\r\n\r\nto  get more staff. We have so far been able to recruit\r\n\r\nfrom  Israel  two engineers and one architect,  men  of\r\n\r\nsubstantial experience. They have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffered  three year contracts and should be  coming  to\r\n\r\nSingapore soon on completion of certain formalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we have accelerated the training of\r\n\r\nlocal  staff  to acquire the qualifications  needed.  A\r\n\r\ntotal number of 93 scholarships was awarded in the last\r\n\r\ntwo  years of which no less than 76 relate to  training\r\n\r\nin  technical and specialist occupations. In  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years, the number of scholarships for training  in\r\n\r\nprofessions experiencing short supply will  be  stepped\r\n\r\nup.  But  the  acquisition of such professional  skills\r\n\r\nwill  take  a  long time and we shall reap the  rewards\r\n\r\nonly after five or six years, or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to review the progress of the more\r\n\r\nimportant  projects entered in the  Four-Year  Plan.  I\r\n\r\nwill discuss the Plan under the main heads in which  it\r\n\r\nwas divided, namely, Economic and Social Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>ECONOMIC SECTOR</i></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Development Board</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Economic Development Board\r\n\r\non  the  1st  August will prove to  be  a  landmark  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic history. The Board  will  be  the\r\n\r\ninstrument through which the State will mount its major\r\n\r\neffort to industrialise the economy. The Government has\r\n\r\nappointed a senior civil servant to the chairmanship of\r\n\r\nthe  Board. Other members representing banking, trade,\r\n\r\nprofessional  and  trade  union  interests  have   been\r\n\r\nappointed. The Board has recruited a Director, who  was\r\n\r\nsent  to  Singapore  under  the  United  Nations'  Opex\r\n\r\nProgramme, and he assumed duty a month ago. Further key\r\n\r\npersonnel are required and the United Nations are being\r\n\r\napproached for urgent assistance. The staff needed  are\r\n\r\na  senior industrial economist, an officer to head  the\r\n\r\nTechnical  Consultant Service and three other  officers\r\n\r\nto staff the service. These three officers are, one, an\r\n\r\nindustrial  designer, two, an industrial engineer,  and\r\n\r\nthree, an industrial accountant. There is also need for\r\n\r\na  chemical  engineer and a mechanical engineer.  Local\r\n\r\nrecruitment for the staff of the Board has taken  place\r\n\r\nby  secondment  to  the  Board  of  two  administrative\r\n\r\nofficers both with honours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndegree  in  economics, and a mechanical  engineer  with\r\n\r\nvery   high  qualifications.  Direct  recruitment   for\r\n\r\nadditional  staff  is in progress.  In  addition,  four\r\n\r\nstudents  with excellent results in last year's  Higher\r\n\r\nSchool  Certificate  examinations in  Science  subjects\r\n\r\nwere   awarded  scholarships  to  pursue   courses   in\r\n\r\nMechanical,  Electrical  and  Chemical  Engineering  in\r\n\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has only recently commenced work. Much of\r\n\r\nthis  work will be to complete the preparations already\r\n\r\nset  on  foot  before  its  establishment.  Some  solid\r\n\r\nprogress, however, has already been registered. A  loan\r\n\r\nof $0.5 million on favourable terms has been made to  a\r\n\r\nlocal  shipbreaking  firm  in  line  with  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy   to  encourage  shipbreaking.  There  are   six\r\n\r\napplications  now  for loans being  considered  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  amounting  to  $4.5  million.  Applications  for\r\n\r\npioneer  status in industry are processed in the  first\r\n\r\ninstance  by  the Board. At present 12 industries  have\r\n\r\nbeen  granted  pioneer status. They have an  authorised\r\n\r\ncapital  of $104.5 million and a subscribed capital  of\r\n\r\n$86.2  million.  More  than 1,300 additional  permanent\r\n\r\njobs  would have been created when all these industries\r\n\r\nare  in  production.  At present, five  have  commenced\r\n\r\nproduction  and another two more will do so before  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  year.  There are 27 new applications  for\r\n\r\npioneer status currently under consideration. These are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  provide permanent jobs for 1,900  persons\r\n\r\nand have a total authorised capital of $105.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial Research Unit</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assistance of the New Zealand Government,\r\n\r\nour  plan to establish the Industrial Research Unit  is\r\n\r\nnow  nearly complete and it is expected that  the  Unit\r\n\r\nwould  commence functioning early next year.  The  Unit\r\n\r\nwill   assist   local  manufacturers  to  solve   their\r\n\r\nproduction problems. Local staff has been recruited and\r\n\r\ntwo members are now in New Zealand undergoing training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Jurong Project</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has commenced on the development of the Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial site and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress    is    satisfactory.   To    ensure    rapid\r\n\r\nimplementation   of   this   important   project,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has formed a new organisation known  as  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Industrial  Development  Unit,  headed  by   an\r\n\r\nengineer  seconded from the P.W.D. and a  surveyor  and\r\n\r\nplanner. The Unit works under the general direction  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development Board. Some  $600,000  would\r\n\r\nhave been spent by the end of the year and works to the\r\n\r\nvalue  of another $250,000 have already been committed.\r\n\r\nFurther, a sum of $4.3 million has been spent  on  land\r\n\r\nacquisition. So far, the main works in progress are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the construction of the South Access road,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the construction of a culvert at the Jurong River,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the levelling of Hill No. 12 and associated reclamation works.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>\t</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Surveying  of other hills to be levelled is proceeding.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, test borings of the proposed  wharf  line\r\n\r\nare nearing completion. These works now in progress are\r\n\r\ngiving  jobs  to  more than 220 men,  of  whom  70  are\r\n\r\nresidents of Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, development work in Jurong will be\r\n\r\nconsiderably  stepped up and it is  expected  that  $15\r\n\r\nmillion  will be needed to pay for earth works,  roads,\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  wharf area, reservoir  to  supply\r\n\r\nindustrial  water, sewerage, drainage, etc. The  target\r\n\r\nfor 1962 has been fixed as follows. By March next year,\r\n\r\nit  is hoped that the site for the Steel Mill (Phase I)\r\n\r\nwould  have  been completed. By late 1962, electricity,\r\n\r\nwater  supply  and telephone services would  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  to  the  area. By the end of 1962,  the  first\r\n\r\nphase  of  the lighter wharf should have been completed\r\n\r\nwith one berth westward of Tanjong Kling ready by June,\r\n\r\nand,  if  justified by need, a second berth soon  after\r\n\r\nthat.  Work on the light industries area north  of  the\r\n\r\nAccess  Road should be completed by August 1962,  while\r\n\r\npart of the heavy industry area should be available for\r\n\r\noccupation by the end of 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Industrial Estates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the main Industrial Centre at Jurong,\r\n\r\nfour  small industrial estates are in an advanced stage\r\n\r\nof   completion.

It  is  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Government to build larger  and  taller\r\n\r\nschools. As a result of the number of schools completed\r\n\r\nthis year, there are available places for an additional\r\n\r\n10,560  children.  With schools soon to  be  completed,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  places for a further 10,560  children.\r\n\r\nThis is a satisfactory achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Housing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Four-Year Development Plan published details\r\n\r\nof  the Housing Programme of the P.A.P. Government,  it\r\n\r\nwas received with mixed and deep feelings, with hope by\r\n\r\nthose  in  need  of  housing, with sour  scepticism  in\r\n\r\npolitically  hostile  quarters. The  target  of  10,000\r\n\r\nbuildings a year represents nearly three times the best\r\n\r\nthat had been achieved in any one year in the past, and\r\n\r\nfour  to five times the average performance of previous\r\n\r\ngovernments. For the first year of the Plan,  a  target\r\n\r\nof  7,096  homes was set. This target is likely  to  be\r\n\r\nover-fulfilled. The last report I have  is  that  4,410\r\n\r\nhomes  have  already been completed at Bukit  Ho  Swee,\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru, MacPherson and Queens-town. Another 11,257\r\n\r\nare   under  construction,  of  which  3,044  will   be\r\n\r\ncompleted by the end of this year. The number of  homes\r\n\r\nexpected to be completed this year is therefore  7,454.\r\n\r\nThe  Board expects to meet its future target of  10,000\r\n\r\nhomes a year well in advance of its time-table. The end\r\n\r\nof  next  year  will  see  the  end  of  the  long  and\r\n\r\nfrustrating years of waiting for decent homes  by  more\r\n\r\nthan  10,000  families on the register  of  applicants.\r\n\r\nSome  have waited for six or even eight years. By  next\r\n\r\nyear  there  will  be  a home for  each  one  of  these\r\n\r\nfamilies,  and  at  rents they can afford.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nrecord  achievement in the provision of public  housing\r\n\r\nand  can  be  claimed as a major success  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. The achievement is all the more  remarkable\r\n\r\nif  we  bear  in mind that the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  had to start with what was left of the  wreckage\r\n\r\nof  the  former S.I.T. For this outstanding performance\r\n\r\nwe  are greatly indebted to the honorary members of the\r\n\r\nBoard  and  the  permanent officers who  implement  the\r\n\r\npolicy.  In  particular,  I  must  mention  the  drive,\r\n\r\nresourcefulness and skill they have displayed under the\r\n\r\nable guidance of the Chairman of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Television</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning has reached an advanced stage and tenders\r\n\r\nfor  equipment  had  been under detailed  scrutiny  for\r\n\r\nmonths.

The Government intends to commence\r\n\r\ntelevision  broadcasting once the Transmitting  Station\r\n\r\nis  ready. A permanent television studio may take  some\r\n\r\ntime  to  build,  but,  in the  meantime,  a  temporary\r\n\r\nbuilding  could provide a two-channel service of  three\r\n\r\nto  four  hours  a  day, which  could  be  operational\r\n\r\nsometime late next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>National Theatre</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site at King George V Park has already been\r\n\r\nlevelled  and  piling work for the  foundation  of  the\r\n\r\nTheatre will begin shortly.

With the exception of a few\r\n\r\nnew projects, the others are continuing ones which have\r\n\r\nbeen  initiated  this year, or for which  it  has  been\r\n\r\npossible  to go into more detailed planning this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  new  projects  included in the Development  Budget\r\n\r\nhave  been  clearly marked as such, and  I  propose  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  only  the major ones. There are two  of  them,\r\n\r\nnamely:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A multi-storey car park;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\t</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Multi-storey car park</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a multi-storey car park is one which\r\n\r\nhas  been given long and careful study by both motorist\r\n\r\norganisations  and public authorities in  the  past.  A\r\n\r\nprovision of $2 million has been entered under Head  D.\r\n\r\n19  in  the Draft Development Estimates for 1962 for  a\r\n\r\nmulti-storey car park to be built in the centre of  the\r\n\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a multi-storey car park is now more\r\n\r\npressing than ever. In common with most growing  cities\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  problem  in Singapore  is  becoming  very\r\n\r\nacute,  because  of the increasing number  of  vehicles\r\n\r\ncoming on to the road every month. An average of 550\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew cars are being registered every month, and the rate\r\n\r\nof  increase  of motor cycles and scooters  has  lately\r\n\r\nbecome  quite  phenomenal. Between September  1960  and\r\n\r\nSeptember 1961 the number of motor cycles and  scooters\r\n\r\non  the  register increased from 17,244 to  26,008,  an\r\n\r\naverage  increase  of  730 per month.  While  all  this\r\n\r\ntestifies to a measure of affluence in our society,  it\r\n\r\nalso increases our traffic problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed site for the multi-storey car park is a\r\n\r\npiece  of  vacant Crown land bounded by  Cecil  Street,\r\n\r\nCross Street and Market Street. Detailed plans have not\r\n\r\nyet  been drawn up but it is envisaged that a ramp type\r\n\r\ngarage  of  9  or  10 storeys high will be  constructed\r\n\r\ncapable  of  accommodating 800 to 900 cars and  a  fair\r\n\r\nnumber  of motor cycles and scooters. The garage,  when\r\n\r\ncompleted, will   be  operated  by  the   Government.\r\n\r\nPreliminary  estimates of revenue and expenditure  show\r\n\r\nthat the garage should be self-supporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Union House project is a fulfilment of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government's pledge to the workers of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  building  which is to be erected will  incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Conference Hall, and will  be  sited  on\r\n\r\napproximately three acres of land at Shenton Way.  Soil\r\n\r\ntests  have  been  completed and  a  competition  among\r\n\r\nSingapore architects for the design of the building  is\r\n\r\nin  progress.  Premiums amounting to  $6,000  would  be\r\n\r\nawarded to the first, second and third prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost for this new project has been\r\n\r\nestimated at $4.15 million, of which $3 million will be\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the  building itself.  The  building  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  hold between five and eight storeys,  and\r\n\r\nthe facilities will be varied and substantial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear need for a Conference Hall of\r\n\r\nadequate   size   and  with  adequate   facilities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  With  the achievement  of  independence  of\r\n\r\nAsian countries and their subsequent membership of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits agencies, each year sees innumerable conferences of\r\n\r\ndelegates  of  independent  Asian  nations.  Singapore,\r\n\r\nstanding  on  the  verge  of  independence,  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared   to  make  its  contribution  to  the   great\r\n\r\ninternational  effort in Asia to bring Asian  countries\r\n\r\ncloser together to discuss their common problems. As it\r\n\r\nstands  in  the  centre of international  sea  and  air\r\n\r\ncommunication routes, Singapore is well placed to serve\r\n\r\nas a venue for many of these conferences. But we do not\r\n\r\npossess the facilities needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, a Conference Hall with the Trade Union\r\n\r\nHouse  in  the  same building should be constructed  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  possible. It is not only a matter of national\r\n\r\nprestige;  if we were to act as host to other  nations,\r\n\r\nwe  should see to it that the facilities we provide are\r\n\r\nof adequate standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that the\r\n\r\nConference  Hall  should  be  a  substantial  one.  The\r\n\r\ndesign,  construction and equipment of the Hall  should\r\n\r\nseek   to   attain  acceptable  standards  of  dignity,\r\n\r\nelegance  and  taste. There will be an  air-conditioned\r\n\r\nauditorium which will seat 1,000 people. There will  be\r\n\r\nprovision    in   the   auditorium   for   simultaneous\r\n\r\ntranslation   equipment   which   is   used   in    all\r\n\r\ninternational  conferences. In  addition  to  the  main\r\n\r\nauditorium,  there  will  be another  three  conference\r\n\r\nrooms   each  of  about  1,000  square  feet,  a  large\r\n\r\nreception  hall  and  lounge  with  a  buffet  service,\r\n\r\nlibrary  and reading rooms, a theatrette, a canteen,  a\r\n\r\nkitchen,  as  well  as  residential  accommodation  for\r\n\r\nvisiting trade unionists and conference delegates.  The\r\n\r\noffices  and conference rooms of the Trade Union  House\r\n\r\nwill be sited in the same building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Revenue Proposals</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to revenue proposals for\r\n\r\n1962.  It is obvious that this is not the time for  new\r\n\r\ntaxes  and  I do not intend to introduce any new  taxes\r\n\r\nnext  year,  nor  to raise existing ones.  Only  import\r\n\r\nduties  may be introduced or varied if it is necessary,\r\n\r\nto   protect  local  industries.  I  would  take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity to announce that the Government has decided\r\n\r\nnot to proceed with two of the major tax measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannounced  in the last Budget. The taxes concerned  are\r\n\r\nthe Business Registration Tax and Fees to be levied  on\r\n\r\ncertain   professional  persons  in  private  practice.\r\n\r\nLegislation  to  authorise these  new  taxes  had  been\r\n\r\ncompleted  after  discussion with several  professional\r\n\r\nassociations.  By  the  time  these  discussions   were\r\n\r\ncompleted  and  legislation drafted, the  prospects  of\r\n\r\nmerger  and a reunification of the professional  bodies\r\n\r\nand  associations became a pressing point  against  our\r\n\r\ncreating  anomalies which would add to the difficulties\r\n\r\nafter merger. Moreover, there was less justification to\r\n\r\nproceed  with the introduction of these measures,  when\r\n\r\nthe  first  draft  of  next year's Budget  showed  that\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  revenue  could  be  held  in  balance\r\n\r\nwithout these measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, intends to proceed with\r\n\r\nintroducing legislation to regulate the registration of\r\n\r\ncertain professions, such as accountants and engineers,\r\n\r\nwhich  at  present  are not covered by  any  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nMembers  of the professions concerned have stated  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  welcome  such a move in  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance of standards of their profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to make a review next year of the incidence\r\n\r\nof  the Property Tax on attap houses. There has been  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of misunderstanding on the liability to  tax\r\n\r\non  attap houses. Many of these houses are occupied  by\r\n\r\npoor  people  who cannot afford better  homes.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  illegal builders are in the  practice  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  attap  houses  on  unauthorised  land  and\r\n\r\nselling or renting them out to unsuspecting members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rates of property tax in rural areas were\r\n\r\nraised last year, special concession was given to attap\r\n\r\nhouses.  These  properties were  not  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the rates of tax. Further,  all  houses,\r\n\r\nwhether  built of attap and plank or otherwise,  retain\r\n\r\nthe  old rates of tax if their annual value is $240  or\r\n\r\nless.  But,  of course, yearly revaluations  of  annual\r\n\r\nvalues  do  take  place  as a  matter  of  course.  And\r\n\r\nproperties  which  were  under-valued  have  had  their\r\n\r\nannual values raised. Accordingly, some owners\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  attap houses thought that this was contrary to  the\r\n\r\npolicy outlined in the last Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been represented to me by Government\r\n\r\nAssemblymen that in the case of attap houses  in  areas\r\n\r\nbearing the maximum rate, that is 36 per cent, there is\r\n\r\na  case  for making some concessions to owner-occupiers\r\n\r\nof  attap  houses, on the grounds that these houses  do\r\n\r\nnot  enjoy all the facilities which permanent buildings\r\n\r\ndo.  For  instance, roads in districts  where  most  of\r\n\r\nthese attap houses are found are usually unmetalled and\r\n\r\nin  poor  condition. Few of these houses  are  supplied\r\n\r\nwith   water,  light,  modern  sanitation,   or   other\r\n\r\namenities. I propose to have these problems re-examined\r\n\r\nto  see  whether or not concessions in the way  of  tax\r\n\r\nreduction are justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this may be the last Budget of the\r\n\r\nState of Singapore under its present Constitution as  a\r\n\r\nself-governing  State.  If  not  the  last,   it   will\r\n\r\ncertainly be the penultimate, for by next year,  or  by\r\n\r\n1963  at  the latest, we would have merged into Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia. No one could have foreseen the pace of events\r\n\r\nat  which  we  have  advanced in the  last  few  months\r\n\r\ntowards  our  destiny of independence  through  merger.\r\n\r\nThis is the goal towards which the P.A.P. wants to lead\r\n\r\nthe country, and we are now in sight of fulfilment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, the citizens of Singapore have\r\n\r\nhad  more than a fair share of turmoil and tribulation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more is yet to come. But it is remarkable  that\r\n\r\neven  under these troubled conditions, we were able  to\r\n\r\npress  ahead as vigorously as we did. But once we  have\r\n\r\npassed  through  these troubled waters  and  move  into\r\n\r\ncalmer  seas, the talent and energy of our people  will\r\n\r\nfind immeasurably greater outlets of expression. For in\r\n\r\nGreater Malaysia, not only will we have a strong stable\r\n\r\ncentral  government  which  will  give  certainty   and\r\n\r\npurpose of direction in political affairs, but we shall\r\n\r\nalso have an immensely wider field for the exercise  of\r\n\r\nour industry and enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question is, \"That the Assembly\r\n\r\napproves the financial policy of the Government for the\r\n\r\nyear  1962.\"  In  accordance  with  paragraph  (1)   of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 83, the debate now stands adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate to be resumed, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> 7th of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment\r\n\r\n[21st November, 1961] to Question [20th November, 1961],\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, whereas it, has always been the avowed objective\r\n\r\nof all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the\r\n\r\nreunification of Singapore with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya and to remove the artificial division created by\r\n\r\nthe British by their policy of \"divide and rule\", this\r\n\r\nHouse affirms and declares that the first objective of\r\n\r\nall true patriots of Malaya is to achieve the\r\n\r\nreunification of these two territories in a merger of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya.\".-(The\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour-Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim).

He said last\r\n\r\nnight - he was talking of another Member - \"He was\r\n\r\neloquent, but what has he said?\" For six full days,\r\n\r\nSir, we have been sitting here. I believe today is the\r\n\r\nseventh. Both the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis have\r\n\r\nbeen very eloquent. But what have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey said? Out of every hour of speech. Sir, about two-thirds of the hour are taken up with political attacks,\r\n\r\nprobably  one-sixth  washing  dirty  linen,  and   one-sixth - this is quite a generous proportion, Sir - probably\r\n\r\non merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis have shown\r\n\r\nthat  they  are more interested in the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nParty than the State or the people. Both have found fit\r\n\r\nto  use  a merger - such an important issue as merger,\r\n\r\nwhich is actually the pivoting point of the welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the people - to vie for power!  Both  are\r\n\r\nequally    guilty,   Sir.   The   motion    is    quite\r\n\r\nstraightforward. But the Minister, in  introducing  the\r\n\r\nmotion, tried to make the word \"merger\" mean the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger.  Then  the  natural  reaction  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  that  they wanted to make  it  a  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis merger. Then what caps the confusion was  when\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim, leader of the United People's\r\n\r\nParty,  said that he supported both the phoney and  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger.  Sir, this is not  surprising  because\r\n\r\nthey  all  came from the same camp. They had  the  same\r\n\r\ntraining  and, therefore, they are employing  the  same\r\n\r\nmethods. All these methods aim at confusing the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common feature, Sir, with the P.A.P. and the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is their arrogance. Had the  Minister\r\n\r\nnot introduced his motion with such arrogance and abuse\r\n\r\nand suspicion flung across at the Barisan Sosialis, the\r\n\r\nmotion   might  have  been  well  received   and   more\r\n\r\nappropriately  treated, and we, Sir,  might  have  been\r\n\r\nspared six days' debate on the amendment - or seven days,\r\n\r\nincluding today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time there is a quarrel within the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwe  have to sit here day after day. Once we even sat up\r\n\r\nto  4.00  o'clock in the morning - just to  witness  this\r\n\r\nquarrel and dissension within the\r\n\r\nParty.  In  such  instances, as in this one,  important\r\n\r\nmatters  of State have had to be put aside and  delayed\r\n\r\njust  to listen to this quarrel first. Sir, this  is  a\r\n\r\ndisgraceful  abuse  of  parliamentary  democracy.   The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  spent  more  time  here  quarrelling   and\r\n\r\nfighting  for power among themselves than  working  for\r\n\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the six days, Sir, during this\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  amendment, fits beautifully  into  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. pattern of behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, in 1959, during their first\r\n\r\nyear of office, the Prime Minister spent his leisure in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber shooting at dead ducks and gunny sacks and\r\n\r\nin  humiliating the English-educated who, according  to\r\n\r\nhim,   were  emasculated,  devitalised,  deculturalised\r\n\r\npeople,  who should go down on their bended  knees  and\r\n\r\nthank their gods that their souls have been spared.  In\r\n\r\nthe  second  year, he was indulging in challenging  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim to fight him outside the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Opposition consisted of the S.P.A. and\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O., Singapore had been warned against Right-wing\r\n\r\nsuppression. When the Opposition was enlarged by the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim and his colleagues, Singapore was\r\n\r\nwarn ed against Left-wing opportunism. Now when it is\r\n\r\nfurther enlarged by the Barisan Sosialis, we are warned\r\n\r\nagainst Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there are Communists or pro-Communists in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber, and if the dignity of this  Chamber  has\r\n\r\nbeen defiled by the presence of Communists, who are the\r\n\r\nculprits responsible for it? Who brought them in  here?\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Sir. The Prime Minister last night said, \"We\r\n\r\ntrained  them.\" Two days ago, I think the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  said, \"We nurtured them.\" But we,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nAlliance say that they shielded them from the  law,  if\r\n\r\nthey were Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the six days' debate on the amendment, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis have been behaving in exactly the\r\n\r\nway they used to behave when they were sitting there on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  benches. And the Government  applauded\r\n\r\ntheir  behaviour. Today when they are sitting  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House, their behaviour has been condemned.\r\n\r\nBut  anyone  could have told them that their  behaviour\r\n\r\nwas the same as that when they were on that side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment superficially seems to be one\r\n\r\nthat  everyone should support. As the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\npointed out, do we not want genuine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger?  Do  we  not want Singapore to be  the  twelfth\r\n\r\nState? Do we not want the 624,000 Singapore citizens to\r\n\r\nhave  automatic Federal citizenship? Of course, we  do.\r\n\r\nBut  the fact that the Member for Queenstown has  found\r\n\r\nfit,  Sir, when introducing his amendment, to  issue  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the Federation - not only to issue a  threat,\r\n\r\nbut  also  to  emphasise  the  fact  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis' intention to join up with the Sosialist Party\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation after merger in order to  overthrow\r\n\r\nthe present Government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Let every Member in this House reassess\r\n\r\nboth  the  main motion and the amendment in a  detached\r\n\r\nand  unbiased  atmosphere. Let us put the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  State and the people of Singapore before  personal\r\n\r\nor  even  party  interests and ask ourselves - does  this\r\n\r\nmotion really need an amendment? - and give ourselves  an\r\n\r\nhonest answer to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nhas  been so much talk about what is, in fact,  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple issue at this stage, and the talk has served  to\r\n\r\nobscure the real question. Do we or do we not agree  in\r\n\r\nprinciple with the concept of Merger? Months ago, years\r\n\r\nago  everyone,  including the  Barisan  Sosialis,  were\r\n\r\nready to say they wanted merger - an unqualified yes. But\r\n\r\nthen it was only a dream. Now it is a reality tabled in\r\n\r\nthis House. Now what have they to say. You would expect\r\n\r\neveryone  to greet it as the achievement it really  is.\r\n\r\nBut  no;  we  find opposition. It is easy  to  pay  lip\r\n\r\nservice  to a far-off dream, that may never  come  off,\r\n\r\nbut when it becomes a reality, then is the time to test\r\n\r\nfor sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Parties have said they want merger. All we are\r\n\r\nasked for is our agreement in principle. We are going\r\n\r\nno further than the first objective. The Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown has talked of marriage and of the difference\r\n\r\nbetween a wife and a mistress. Well, the period of\r\n\r\ncourtship does seem to have successfully come to an\r\n\r\nend, and we are at the proposal stage. And any woman\r\n\r\nwill tell you that now is the moment for a straight\r\n\r\n\"yes\" or \"no\". It is not the time to haggle and impose\r\n\r\nimpossible conditions, unless you want to lose the\r\n\r\noffer. Later, once the union has taken place, then the\r\n\r\nprocess of adjustment occurs - in stages - and a full\r\n\r\nrelationship is worked out - a working relationship to\r\n\r\ntry to make that union for better, not for worse. In\r\n\r\naccepting the proposal, Sir, we are declaring our faith\r\n\r\nthat such a union will succeed, and bring benefits to\r\n\r\nboth parties, as we believe this merger will do. The\r\n\r\nproposal, moreover, is a sincere one. Singapore is\r\n\r\nbeing offered an honest union; she is not being\r\n\r\npropositioned as a mistress. I would remind the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown that the real difference between a wife\r\n\r\nand a mistress is a legal one. The mistress may, in\r\n\r\nfact, enjoy more benefits but they are temporary ones\r\n\r\nand she has no security in law. This merger is legal\r\n\r\nand constitutional and permanent. Can you call it\r\n\r\nanything but a genuine merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> What is fundamentally at stake?

The Member for Queenstown and his comrades  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  reduce them to selfish party  issues,  even\r\n\r\npersonal  ones. This is a cause of the people,  not  an\r\n\r\nexcuse  for abuse and personal smears. Why go  to  such\r\n\r\nlengths about the stability of the Government?

Of  course, the\r\n\r\nopportunists  look at merger for what  they  themselves\r\n\r\ncan  get  out  of it, which is perhaps why the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are calculating how many extra seats  will  be\r\n\r\nthere for them to contest in the Federation. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nprefers to act as the agent of the people. They are the\r\n\r\ngo  betweens  in  this marriage proposal - the  properly\r\n\r\nauthorised  go-betweens  on an  election  mandate.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis,  having  deserted  their   election\r\n\r\nmandate, have only themselves to act for. And as to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. being too weak for their task, they have managed\r\n\r\nto  negotiate terms with the Federation that two  years\r\n\r\nago seemed impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the Federation appeared to be the\r\n\r\nstumbling-block. The block has been removed only to  be\r\n\r\nreplaced by one within our own ranks. Having come  this\r\n\r\nfar towards our goal, it would seem that the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  is doing his best to frustrate  the  entire\r\n\r\nplan.  His demands are extreme. They could be aimed  at\r\n\r\nfrightening off the Federation. We all know that if you\r\n\r\nare  set  against making a business deal,  you  set  an\r\n\r\nimpossibly high price on yourself. You demand  in  this\r\n\r\ncase  automatic citizenship of the Federation, and  you\r\n\r\ndo  not hesitate to insult the Tunku, because he  is  a\r\n\r\nclient you wish to drive away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the Barisan Sosialis are being\r\n\r\ndeliberately obstructionist. Their objections  are  red\r\n\r\nherrings,  to  draw us away from the real  issue.  They\r\n\r\ndisbelieve the sincerity of the Federation because  the\r\n\r\nsame  people who once opposed merger are still  at  the\r\n\r\nhelm.  Yet  I  seem  to remember that  they  themselves\r\n\r\ncrossed  the  Floor  here, because they  changed  their\r\n\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say we shall become second-class citizens with\r\n\r\nonly  a token representation in the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n15  seats  are a pretty big token - second only to  Perak\r\n\r\nand more representatives than the Barisans can claim in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. It is not very flattering to  Singapore\r\n\r\npoliticians and the people's choice to suggest that our\r\n\r\n15 will not be able to exert any influence. We can only\r\n\r\ngain from becoming part of the Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterritory, and for this, we give up nothing. We  remain\r\n\r\nfirst-class  citizens  of Singapore  enjoying  all  our\r\n\r\nprevious  rights plus independence. In fact, where  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have negotiated for separate conditions for  us,\r\n\r\nthey  have  all been in our favour. Far from castrating\r\n\r\nor  crippling us, they give us special privileges  over\r\n\r\nthe  other  States  in education, labour,  Finance  and\r\n\r\ntrade.  Where  is the sell-out? Where are  the  losses?\r\n\r\nWould the Member for Queenstown exchange our education\r\n\r\nand  control  of labour for this automatic citizenship?\r\n\r\nWe  in  fact  get  two  brands of independence - the  new\r\n\r\npolitical   release   from   colonialism    and    full\r\n\r\nnationality,  and the old independence or  autonomy  in\r\n\r\nwhat matters most to us. We enter the married state and\r\n\r\nare allowed to take our jewels with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the only ones who stand to lose are those who\r\n\r\nare  afraid of the Internal Security Council, but these\r\n\r\nare not the honest loyal citizens of Singapore whom the\r\n\r\nCouncil cannot touch. There is no longer a principle at\r\n\r\nstake.  The  Council will not be like the P.P.S.O.,  an\r\n\r\ninstrument of the colonial power. It cannot be seen  as\r\n\r\ninterfering in our affairs because it will  consist  of\r\n\r\nour  own local people. We objected to the British lion,\r\n\r\nbut we do not object to the Malayan tiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk of sacrifice on behalf of the\r\n\r\npeople. This seems a very noble thought from those  who\r\n\r\nwere   last  heard  of  looting  furniture  and  sewing\r\n\r\nmachines   from   their  former  Party  Branches.   But\r\n\r\nsacrifice  is  rather vain, is it not? Would  they  not\r\n\r\nbetter  serve  the cause of socialism by joining  their\r\n\r\nbrothers  in the Federation whom they claim  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nand  our  Prime  Minister have  a  common  interest  in\r\n\r\nsuppressing? This is surely an opportunity to  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves  through  constitutional  means  on  a  pan-Malayan   basis.   But  perhaps  they   do   not   like\r\n\r\nconstitutional means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to my first point. We are being offered a\r\n\r\nfair,  realistic deal for our people - more than we  ever\r\n\r\nexpected  at this time last year.

It is not a question of whether we want a merger\r\n\r\nor not. It is a question of what type of a merger do we\r\n\r\nwant.  Do  you want the merger proposed by the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  a  sell-out merger, or do you want  our  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis' genuine merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the amendment moved by our\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  i.e., for  a  genuine  merger?  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  let me state  why  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis want a genuine merger. Is the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nafraid  of  a  real  merger? Is  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nsincere  in  putting forward this genuine merger?  What\r\n\r\nare  the  basic  conditions  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ntowards  the merger question? Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\ngeographically,       ethnically,       linguistically,\r\n\r\nhistorically, economically and in customs  and  habits,\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation  were  one  originally.\r\n\r\nHowever,  ever since 1944, Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  were  forcibly divided by  the  colonialist\r\n\r\nBritish  Government.  It became  part  of  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialist policy to divide and rule. The arrogant and\r\n\r\nunreasonable conduct adopted by the British  Government\r\n\r\nin  those  days  aroused protests from  the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. In spite of protests by the people in those two\r\n\r\nterritories   against   their   policy,   the   British\r\n\r\ncolonialists  still  persisted in  carrying  out  their\r\n\r\ndivide  and  rule policy. In August 1957,  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists  gave  up  the Federation  of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nallowed  it  to  be  independent. On  1st  June,  1959,\r\n\r\nSingapore  became  a self-governing State.  Ever  since\r\n\r\nthat  time,  the separation between the two territories\r\n\r\nhas  become  more and more marked. Do  the  peoples  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation of Malaya  want  to  be\r\n\r\nseparated?   Do  the  Left-wing  forces  in   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories want to be separated? No, not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we the Left-wing forces have\r\n\r\nnever  supported  the artificial division  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories.  The peoples in these two territories  are\r\n\r\nnot  happy  about this division of the two territories.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it has been one of our objectives  to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  a  real  and  genuine  reunification  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  and to be free from colonialism.  This  is\r\n\r\nalso  the  main objective of the Left-wing  forces.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve in the integration of the two territories  with\r\n\r\nindependence in economy and politics, equal rights  for\r\n\r\nthe people, and democratic freedom. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, these are our basic aims. A genuine merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation is one objective for which\r\n\r\nwe  will never give up fighting. The Right-wing  forces\r\n\r\nshould not smear us and give warning to us here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my duty to state the\r\n\r\nobjectives of the Barisan Sosialis as contained in  our\r\n\r\nParty  Constitution.  Let  me  now  read  some  of  the\r\n\r\narticles  in  our  Party  Constitution.  Article   1 - to\r\n\r\neliminate  colonialism and to establish an  independent\r\n\r\nunified nation comprising the Federation and Singapore.\r\n\r\nArticle  2 - to set up a democratic government  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  right  of  franchise of the citizens  in  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories.  Article 3 - to bring  about  a  prosperous,\r\n\r\nstable  and  just  economic system.  Article  4 - to  get\r\n\r\ntogether the people of all races to establish a Malayan\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis demand\r\n\r\na  genuine merger of Singapore and the Federation. This\r\n\r\nis in accordance with our Party platform and is also in\r\n\r\nconformity with the interest of the people.  Our  stand\r\n\r\nis firm and resolute. We are not weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the socialist ideology was\r\n\r\nborn  in an unjust society. The socialist movement  has\r\n\r\nhad  its  setbacks and socialists have been prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThis  is to be expected and it is not surprising. Those\r\n\r\nwho  make  use of the socialist banner to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  become turn-coats half-way. This  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich very often occurs in the course of development of\r\n\r\nthe socialist movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today we are discussing the\r\n\r\nserious problem of merger between the two territories.\r\n\r\nWe the Barisan Sosialis request a genuine merger\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. The\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P. has said that we are afraid of\r\n\r\nmerger because we are afraid of a strong Right-wing\r\n\r\nCentral Government. They have also said that the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis want to make use of Singapore as a\r\n\r\nbase in order to emancipate the people of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. All these accusations are\r\n\r\nnonsense. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P. whether they are sincere in\r\n\r\nseeking a true merger between the two territories of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya. The answer is,\r\n\r\n\"No, they are not sincere.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the P.A.P. want is a kind of sellout for the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. According to the P.A.P. logic, we\r\n\r\nare afraid of merger because we are afraid of being\r\n\r\narrested. They say that we are opportunists. But I can\r\n\r\nhonestly tell the leadership of the P.A.P. that what we\r\n\r\nare afraid of is that the interests of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore will be endangered if there is no genuine\r\n\r\nmerger between the two territories, because the people\r\n\r\nwill not be able to share the same political life as\r\n\r\nthat enjoyed by the people in the Federation. As to the\r\n\r\nthreat that the Left-wingers will be arrested by the\r\n\r\nRight-wing Government after merger, this is another\r\n\r\nmatter and it is not important. The socialist movement\r\n\r\nhas been known to be curbed. History has proved that\r\n\r\nthe socialist movement has always met with a setback,\r\n\r\nafter which it becomes all the stronger and develops\r\n\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have learnt from history\r\n\r\nthat those who are really afraid of being arrested are\r\n\r\nthose reactionaries and traitors who sell out the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people. These people pursue a line of\r\n\r\nholding high State posts in order to enrich\r\n\r\nthemselves - like Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang\r\n\r\nChin-wei, Bao Dai and Chew Swee Kee. For the sake of\r\n\r\ntheir own personal interests, positions and prestige,\r\n\r\nthese people resort to any means to curb the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities  of  patriots and sell out the  people.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are now following this line in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Left-wing forces of\r\n\r\nSingapore  demand  a  true  merger  between   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories of Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThey  expect that they may be arrested and thrown  into\r\n\r\nChangi Goal or detained in St. John's Island. But  true\r\n\r\nsocialists  work only for what is in the  interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people and the future of the country, so that  the\r\n\r\npeople  can move forward towards a more prosperous  and\r\n\r\nhappy future.

In   his   struggle   against\r\n\r\ncolonialism, Mr Nehru spent many years in prison.  The\r\n\r\nIndonesian President, Dr Soekarno, in his struggle  in\r\n\r\nthe  past against the Dutch colonialists, had also been\r\n\r\nimprisoned. The Congolese Prime Minister, Mr  Lumumba,\r\n\r\nbecause   of  his  struggle  against  colonialism   and\r\n\r\nimperialism,  was  murdered. The  President  of  Partai\r\n\r\nRakyat  in  the Federation of Malaya, Inche  Boestamam,\r\n\r\nhas  been  imprisoned for his struggle in the socialist\r\n\r\ncause.   Singapore's   Leftist   elements   have   been\r\n\r\nimprisoned too. Now they are still under detention. Why\r\n\r\nare they imprisoned? Why do they suffer? For what? What\r\n\r\nthey   are   fighting  for  is  only  to  achieve   the\r\n\r\nintegration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  two national territories. And they oppose  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule.  They  seek  to  achieve  a  more  just\r\n\r\nsociety. They are not afraid of death, and they do  not\r\n\r\ncarry   on  the  struggle  for  the  sake  of  personal\r\n\r\ninterests  or prosperity. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  the Barisan Sosialis, in our stand for true merger,\r\n\r\nwere  positive in the past. We are positive at present,\r\n\r\nand in future we will also bepositive in our stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, according to the Prime Minister's speech, we are not sincere in our demand for true merger. He said we are purposely trying to embarrass\r\n\r\nthe  Government. He also said that we are afraid of the\r\n\r\nRight-wing  Government in the Federation. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nfor a non-Communist, socialist leader of the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nmake such childish utterances is a very sad thing.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the Prime Minister has said that the  leaders\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis are capable young men who lack\r\n\r\nexperience.  Yes, we are still young. We  do  not  have\r\n\r\nexperience in deceiving the people. We congratulate our\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister for his experience in this  respect,  a\r\n\r\nvery  rich experience. But I regret that a person  with\r\n\r\nseveral  years  - of experience of the  so-called  non-Communist,  socialist  struggle cannot  understand  the\r\n\r\ntrue  meaning of socialism and the development  of  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  movement.  Perhaps the  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\ntried to suppress the growth of the socialist movement.\r\n\r\nBut  I  can  honestly  tell the  Prime  Minister  that,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  facts of history  and  my  personal\r\n\r\nexperience which I have gained from study and learning,\r\n\r\nthe  socialist  movement is not based on  race,  creed,\r\n\r\nreligion, colour, or any form of barrier. There  is  no\r\n\r\nbarrier.  As  long  as  there  is  unreasonableness  in\r\n\r\nsociety, the germ of socialism will grow into  a  plant\r\n\r\nand  flower  and bring forth fruit. Because  if  these\r\n\r\nunreasonable  conditions in society, the people  become\r\n\r\npoorer  and  poorer everyday and they are  deprived  of\r\n\r\ntheir  democratic  rights. All  these  harsh  facts  of\r\n\r\npractical  life clearly tell the people that they  must\r\n\r\nreform the society in which they live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We are not debating socialism at\r\n\r\nthe  moment. We are debating merger. As I said, all  he\r\n\r\nneed do is to touch on the fringe of socialism and make\r\n\r\nhis point in that way, but he must not go into details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nshall   return  to  the  main  subject.  The  Left-wing\r\n\r\nmovement in the territories of the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nand  Singapore existed during the colonial era.  Before\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of the P.A.P. in  1954,  there  was\r\n\r\nalready  a  socialist movement. And there was socialism\r\n\r\nbefore  I  was born. All along the Left-wing  movement-had   met   with  oppression  and  attacks   from   all\r\n\r\nreactionary forces. The Left-wing movement could  still\r\n\r\nexist  under such conditions and expand. Does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  reactionary forces of oppression could  curb\r\n\r\nthe  Left-wing  movement? No. They cannot  do  so.  The\r\n\r\ntruth  of  the  matter is that the  socialist  movement\r\n\r\nmoves according to history, which propels the socialist\r\n\r\nmovement   forward,  and  in  its  natural  course   it\r\n\r\ndevelops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although at present in the\r\n\r\nFederation  there  is  a  strong Right-wing  government\r\n\r\nsuppressing  the  Left-wing  movement,  our   socialist\r\n\r\ncomrades, under the banner of the Socialist Front,  are\r\n\r\nnow  strengthening and expanding their forces and  they\r\n\r\nhave  extended their influence to every city, town  and\r\n\r\nrural   kampong.  The  prospects  for  the  future   of\r\n\r\nsocialism  are very bright. Socialism is on the  march.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the Socialist Front is in opposition  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  at  present, the oppression  of  socialist\r\n\r\nelements there was no better than under  colonial rule.\r\n\r\nAll  this  could  not  stop the  Socialist  Front  from\r\n\r\ndeveloping.  It cannot stop the cause of socialism.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore  the Left-wing strength has been attacked  by\r\n\r\nthe   oppression   of  this  so-called   non-Communist,\r\n\r\nsocialist  Government. The democratic  rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople have been curbed by the Government. Unreasonable\r\n\r\nlaws have been passed. They are more stringent -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I ask the hon. Member to come\r\n\r\nback  to the motion. All this, to my mind, is more than\r\n\r\nirrelevant. It is opening out a debate-that has nothing\r\n\r\nat all to do with the merger motion before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was\r\n\r\nexplaining  to  you why we, the Barisan Sosialis,  want\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger. But the Government says we are  afraid\r\n\r\nof  merger  because we are afraid of being  curbed  and\r\n\r\noppressed   by   the  Right-wing  Government   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation. Therefore, I have mentioned all these facts\r\n\r\nand  reasons to prove that in moving our amendment,  we\r\n\r\nare  very sincere in asking what we want. What we  want\r\n\r\nis genuine merger and not a phoney merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rapid development and\r\n\r\nprogress  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nstruck  fear  in  the  heart of the P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no matter how bad the circumstances are, the\r\n\r\nsocialist  movement can still exist  and  develop.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Pahang River must flow out into the South\r\n\r\nChina  Sea.  The  Rivet Nile must  flow  out  into  the\r\n\r\nMediterranean Sea. The River Thames must flow out  into\r\n\r\nthe  English Channel. That is a course nobody can  stop\r\n\r\nor  alter. Therefore, no matter what kind of oppression\r\n\r\nor curb is imposed upon it., the socialist movement can\r\n\r\nstill  endure  and  progress.  All  these  efforts   at\r\n\r\nsuppression will be wasted. People in the end will tell\r\n\r\nthe oppressors what the result will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we the Barisan Sosialis demand a genuine merger. We are ready at any time to suffer the same fate as our comrades in the Federation. We want to\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  the same aim-and the same  objective  as\r\n\r\nlong as the people of Singapore and the Federation live\r\n\r\nthe  same  political life and share and enjoy the  same\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights.. The socialist movement  will  have\r\n\r\nnothing to fear. Only those who do not like to see  the\r\n\r\nsocialist movement progress will be afraid. Only  these\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill think of ways to deprive the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nof  their  citizenship rights. By this they  have  been\r\n\r\nexposed as phoney socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its formation, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  has  never altered its stand  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nmerger of the two territories. We do not want to change\r\n\r\nour  stand  now. The stand will also not be changed  in\r\n\r\nthe future. In this respect the P.A.P. dare not criticise\r\n\r\nus.  They  can only allege hypocritically that  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  embarrass the Government and  that  we  are\r\n\r\nafraid of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of history, you can\r\n\r\nnever find any true socialists who are opposed to  true\r\n\r\nunification of the territories into one nation. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, true socialists will go through  fire  and\r\n\r\nwater to achieve the unification of the territories and\r\n\r\nunity  of  the  country. They will fight very  hard  to\r\n\r\nachieve this aim. I cannot understand the so-called non-Communist,  socialist P.A.P. leadership. They  are  now\r\n\r\nlooking  at  everything through coloured glasses.  They\r\n\r\nalso   look  through  coloured  glasses  at  this  very\r\n\r\nimportant issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we the Barisan Sosialis have proposed this amendment in order to demand a genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya We do this out\r\n\r\nof sincerity and honesty We do this in the interests of\r\n\r\nall  the  people. If the people of the two  territories\r\n\r\ncan truly merge and be united, it does not matter if we\r\n\r\nsocialists  have to make sacrifices. It  is  worth  our\r\n\r\nsacrifices. I hope that hon. Members in this House  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  our sincerity, and not try to  slander,  to\r\n\r\nsmear  and to indulge in mud-slinging for the interests\r\n\r\nof their own Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis' basic\r\n\r\nprinciples  in regard to merger of Singapore  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A genuine merger of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Singapore becoming the twelfth State of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The present Singapore citizens automatically\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of the Federation on Merger Day;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Singapore citizens can freely take part in\r\n\r\nelections  in  any  part in the  Federation.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, any citizen from the Federation can also\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore to take part in elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one word, Mr Speaker, we ask that after merger of\r\n\r\nthe  two territories, the people of the two territories\r\n\r\nwill be able to enjoy equal political life. This is the\r\n\r\nbasic attitude of the Barisan Sosialis towards merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question before us is not\r\n\r\nwhether we want a merger, but whether we want a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  or a phoney merger, that is, a sell-out merger.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan Sosialis want to achieve a genuine merger.\r\n\r\nBut  the P.A.P. are opposed to this genuine merger. The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis demand that all the Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nshould become the citizens of the new Federation  after\r\n\r\nMerger  Day.  But the P.A.P. want to give up  the  over\r\n\r\n600,000  citizens  of Singapore. The  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ndemand that after true merger Singapore will become the\r\n\r\ntwelfth  State  of the new Federation. But  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant  Singapore  to  become  only  a  partner  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation. The Barisan Sosialis: want the citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe new Federation to be able to stand for election  in\r\n\r\nany  State  in the new Federation. But the P.A.P. only\r\n\r\nwant the citizens of Singapore to be able to stand  for\r\n\r\nelection only in Singapore. The Barisan Sosialis demand\r\n\r\nthat there should be proportional representation in the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament. But the P.A.P. want  to  determine\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  representatives  after  taking   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  fact  that  Singapore   will   have\r\n\r\nautonomy in labour and education and how much Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have  to contribute to the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  these are the basic differences  in  our\r\n\r\ndemand for merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, I wish to give an analogy here. Let me take the example of an integrated\r\n\r\nschool  introduced by the Government. But it  does  not\r\n\r\nmean that the management of integrated schools is being\r\n\r\ncarried out very well. I mean to say, the rights of the\r\n\r\nstudents in this school are equal. Therefore, this  can\r\n\r\nhelp us to understand what will happen after the merger\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  with the Federation  of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nrights  and  obligations of the  citizens  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories should also be equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you know that the Government has integrated students from the Chinese stream of education with students from the English stream into\r\n\r\none  school. Students from the two streams of education\r\n\r\nwere  in  the past separated in different schools.  The\r\n\r\nstudents had their respective obligations and rights in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  schools. They had  their  respective\r\n\r\nprincipals  in  their schools. But now  when  they  are\r\n\r\nintegrated into one school, they go to the same school.\r\n\r\nThis integrated school has one principal. There is only\r\n\r\none  school song. The students go to different  classes\r\n\r\nto attend their lessons. The students have the right to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  various activities in the same  playground.\r\n\r\nThey use the same auditorium and the same library. They\r\n\r\nuse  the same Physics laboratory and they can also  use\r\n\r\nthe  same microscope. They can use the same music hail.\r\n\r\nThey  can have equal access to the Arts room. Not  only\r\n\r\nhave they the right to use the same facilities provided\r\n\r\nby  the  school and have the same rights, but  what  is\r\n\r\nimportant  is that everyone of them has an equal  right\r\n\r\nwith the other. They also have the right to elect their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the students body, for instance, the\r\n\r\nHistorical Society, the Geographical Society, the  Film\r\n\r\nSociety,  the  Photographic Study Society,  the  Sports\r\n\r\nSociety and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> On a point of order.

But perhaps the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\ndoes  realise  that he is going into too many  details.\r\n\r\nWhatever  he  has  said could have  been  said  in  one\r\n\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  been trying to help you and our friends  opposite\r\n\r\nto  understand what is the true meaning  of  a  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger.  Now  let me continue. I: does not matter  from\r\n\r\nwhich  school  the students come. They  have  the  same\r\n\r\nrights  and  obligations to elect their representatives\r\n\r\nto  be  responsible for various kinds of offices. Every\r\n\r\nstudent  can stand for election as an office-bearer  of\r\n\r\nany student body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the students in the school enjoy\r\n\r\nthe same rights and obligations. In this way the school\r\n\r\ncan  be said to be a genuine integrated school. We  can\r\n\r\nalso  call it a genuine merger. If the students do  not\r\n\r\nenjoy   the   same  rights  and  do  not   have   equal\r\n\r\nobligations, where then is the equality? If there is no\r\n\r\nequality, how can we talk about merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya is just like the analogy I have mentioned. It is just like an integrated school. The\r\n\r\nbasic question is that of equal rights. In other words,\r\n\r\nafter  merger  the present citizens of  Singapore  must\r\n\r\nbecome the citizens of the new Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We must not have too much repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwas  just about to end my speech. If there are no  such\r\n\r\nrights, then it is no use for us to talk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  autonomy. What kind of merger will that be then?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, there is a very good Chinese proverb\r\n\r\nwhich  goes like this, \"If there is no skin, where  can\r\n\r\nthe  hair grow?\" The meaning is that there is no  place\r\n\r\nto  grow any hair. If there is only hair, but no  skin,\r\n\r\nwhat is the use of the hair then? Therefore, in talking\r\n\r\nabout  a  merger  of Singapore with the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  the  same  reason obtains  if,  after  merger,\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens can automatically become citizens of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. It is as important as the skin on  the\r\n\r\nbody.  Citizenship rights and autonomy  in  labour  and\r\n\r\neducation are just like our hair. They are unimportant.\r\n\r\nThis analogy tells us that if we do not solve the basic\r\n\r\nproblems, but instead, deal with minor, irrelevant  and\r\n\r\nunimportant things and split hairs over minor  details,\r\n\r\nthen  it will be a waste of time and energy. We  cannot\r\n\r\nget  any benefit out of it. On the other hand, we  will\r\n\r\nincur a loss as a result of wasting our energy and time\r\n\r\non those minor issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote from the Nanyang Siang\r\n\r\nPau  of 22nd November, in which the person who occupies\r\n\r\nthe  second  seat on the Government Bench, namely,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, in replying to my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, on the 21st November, said, \"Why\r\n\r\ndo  the  Barisan  Sosialis want to quarrel  over  these\r\n\r\nsmall  issues?\"  These \"small issues\"  are  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights.  The  so-called  \"small  issues\"  to  him   are\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights and things like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the basic principles of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  in  regard to merger  is  that  this\r\n\r\nshould  not endanger the present position of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.

What\r\n\r\nmust  we  degrade them to the position of  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens?  Does  it  mean  that  \"citizenship\"  is   an\r\n\r\nacademic  phrase or word? Mr Speaker, Sir, I  use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"academic\" because the Minister for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that this is a question pertaining to an academic\r\n\r\nexercise.

He  knows   that   the   word\r\n\r\n\"citizenship\"  is  academic. It is  not  realistic  and\r\n\r\npractical; therefore, it is not important.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Minister for Finance that if he  wants  to\r\n\r\nchop off his own head just because of an academic word,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  concerned.

Who elected the Prime Minister?\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is the citizens of Singapore. Who  elected\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture? The answer is the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

After a real merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the Federation, any  citizen  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will be able to stand for  election  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But the P.A.P. is not prepared to fight  for\r\n\r\nthe   basic   citizenship  rights  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

What  are  these\r\n\r\nbenefits?  We  ask  the P.A.P. to tell  us  what  these\r\n\r\nbenefits  are. As far as I know, there will be  another\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister in Singapore.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have all these things,\r\n\r\ndoes  it  mean that we have a genuine merger?  Does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that  our  problems will be  solved  if  we  have\r\n\r\nnational  rights? \"National rights\" is  the  registered\r\n\r\ntrademark of the P.A.P. The P.A.P. tries to mislead the\r\n\r\npeople  by  covering up the mistakes  of  their  regime\r\n\r\nwhich  is going to perish.

Can the interests of the  people\r\n\r\nbe regarded as party interests?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health and Law\r\n\r\nsaid  on 22nd November - let me quote a passage from  his\r\n\r\nspeech as reported there:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All these flimsy arguments about citizenship,\r\n\r\nstatus,  and  so  on, are invented  by  those  who  are\r\n\r\nagainst   merger.  Nationalists  and   patriots   after\r\n\r\nunderstanding that there are no basic differences  will\r\n\r\nnot  insist  on  saying that there is a  difference  in\r\n\r\ncitizenship status.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is meant by a \"flimsy and\r\n\r\nphoney\" argument? A first-class citizen is demoted to a\r\n\r\nsecond-class  citizen - is that not a  fact?  Is  it  not\r\n\r\nfalse?  Is  it  not  hypocrisy? Does the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth and Law know what is the definition of the  word\r\n\r\n\"invention\"? By saying that there are different classes\r\n\r\nof  citizens, this inventor then should be  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwho invented all these different classes of citizens. I\r\n\r\nam  only mentioning numerous facts to prove that  there\r\n\r\nare  different classes of citizens. What we mention  is\r\n\r\nbased on facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law accused us of being anti-merger and of giving flimsy or hypocritical arguments. Mr Speaker, in the course of history, you can never see the true patriots and nationalists who will insist on giving away their country, their national flag and their national anthem and their rights to acquire unequal rights and status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government of the Federation, in opposing the South African apartheid policy, has set a very good example. But if the people of Singapore are\r\n\r\nlikened to the coloured people of South Africa, and the\r\n\r\ncitizens of the 11 States of the Federation are likened\r\n\r\nto  white men, what difference is there in this kind of\r\n\r\nanalogy? This comparison is very apt. I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nthat  under  true  negotiations  of  merger,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  will  have  the same equal  rights.  Let  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. declare   what   are   the   definitions    of\r\n\r\n\"nationalist\",  \"patriot\",  and  the  so-called   \"non-Communist\".  What is the theoretical basis  of  a  non-Communist socialist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us examine this. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture,  as you know, is a non-Communist  Malayan\r\n\r\nSocialist.  He is the Chief of Staff in promoting  this\r\n\r\nMalayan culture. He asked, with reference to the speech\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Queenstown, how many of the 600,000-odd citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  enjoy  this right? How many of them  think  they\r\n\r\nwould  go  to the Federation to stand for election?  He\r\n\r\nalso  said that even if the majority of the voters were\r\n\r\ngiven  that right, they were not interested in standing\r\n\r\nfor  election.  Mr  Speaker,  how  irresponsible  that\r\n\r\nspeech  is. The people of Singapore now know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore is dealing with the problem  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  on this basis. That is why the citizenship\r\n\r\nrights of the people of Singapore can so easily be sold\r\n\r\nout.  I want to tell the Minister for Culture this:  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   it  cannot  be  that  all  these  600,000-odd\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens will stand for  election,  but  the\r\n\r\n624,000  citizens  want  to enjoy  the  same  political\r\n\r\nrights as the citizens of the Federation. And Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  want  to move about freely in  the  other  11\r\n\r\nStates in the Federation. The 624,000 citizens want  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  same economic life. May I ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture what is meant by parliamentary  democracy?\r\n\r\nWhat  is the basis of parliamentary democracy?  Is  not\r\n\r\nvoting the basic political right of the people? In this\r\n\r\nworld, is there any inequality of rights existing in  a\r\n\r\nsocialist country? What kind of socialism is the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfollowing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, of the 624,000 citizens of Singapore, how many of them can make use of these rights? They will not strive just for the sake of standing for\r\n\r\nelection?  What is conveyed by these two sentences?  It\r\n\r\nshows  that  the  Minister for Culture  is  ungrateful.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the elections, he went round to  all\r\n\r\nthe voters to persuade them to come out to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI do not mean that the citizens of Singapore should not\r\n\r\nbe conscripted to defend our motherland. What I mean is\r\n\r\nthat  under  the  phoney  merger  by  the  P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore and the Federation have the  same\r\n\r\nobligations but they do not enjoy the same rights.  How\r\n\r\ncan you say this is a merger? How can you say that this\r\n\r\nis  a  reunification  of the two territories?  Is  this\r\n\r\nequality?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few days, the Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis have clearly reflected the  views\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore. If the Party in power want\r\n\r\nto  fight for the interests of the people, they have to\r\n\r\nbe  awakened  now.  They should stop selling  out.

SU 4444 is\r\n\r\na car belonging to Tommy Koh's father and often used by\r\n\r\nhim.  A  young Chinese sitting in the front seat beside\r\n\r\nthe  driver was identified by an intelligence  observer\r\n\r\nas  Tommy Koh Thong Bee. Since receiving this telegram,\r\n\r\nfurther investigation have been made for corroboration.\r\n\r\nIt  would  now appear that the young man  next  to  the\r\n\r\ndriver  of  the car SU 4444 is a member of the  family\r\n\r\nfor whom he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tender full and ample apology for having\r\n\r\nmisinformed   this  House  because  of   the   mistaken\r\n\r\nidentity.

I want to pinpoint  on  the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Member for Queenstown. I  oppose\r\n\r\nhis   amendment   because   it   is   inopportune   and\r\n\r\nunrealistic. Its purpose, as has been clearly shown  by\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, is entirely to oppose merger. Why\r\n\r\nshould they talk about genuine merger? They talk  about\r\n\r\nSingapore  becoming  the  twelfth  State  of  the   new\r\n\r\nFederation.   They   talk  about   Singapore   citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically becoming citizens of the Federation.  All\r\n\r\nthis   is  an  eyewash.  Let  us  not  try  to  deceive\r\n\r\nourselves.  Let  all the people of Singapore  know  now\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis are opposed to merger. Their\r\n\r\ndefection from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  because  the  P.A.P. Government  supports  and  has\r\n\r\narranged  for a merger with the Federation  Government.\r\n\r\nThat is why they had to resort to any means and tactics\r\n\r\nto  break  away from the P.A.P. Therefore,  their  talk\r\n\r\nabout genuine merger and all the rest of it is only  to\r\n\r\nhoodwink  the  people  or  calculated  to  blind  their\r\n\r\nvision.   Their   true  purpose   is   to   delay   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of merger and to sabotage any conditions\r\n\r\nfor the merger of a true democratic country. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe can say that the true purpose of the amendment moved\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Queenstown is to sabotage the  work\r\n\r\nof  merger. They know that merger is now in view.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  stop it. But on the other hand, they are afraid\r\n\r\nof merger because they know that after merger, internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  will  be  in the hands of  a  strong  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the  Federation. The Communist  forces,\r\n\r\nwhich  they represent, cannot develop in Singapore  any\r\n\r\nmore.  On the contrary, they will be checked. They  are\r\n\r\nafraid  of  merger. But they cannot  stop  merger  from\r\n\r\ncoming  into  effect. How can they delay  merger?  They\r\n\r\nmust  find  some  way  to delay merger,  to  delay  the\r\n\r\nunpleasant  day from coming. They have  thought  out  a\r\n\r\ncondition  to  make the people of Singapore  afraid  of\r\n\r\naccepting  merger.  They have  also  thought  out  some\r\n\r\nconditions which cannot be acceptable to the Government\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation.  The method is  contained  in  the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that Singapore and the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  have  been separated for more than  ten  years.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of economy and politics, Singapore has its\r\n\r\nown special peculiarities and characteristics which are\r\n\r\ndifferent from the Federation. The Federation also have\r\n\r\ntheir peculiar policies which cannot be carried out  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Barisan Sosialis want a complete merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore to be the twelfth State of the Federation. In\r\n\r\nother  words,  they want Singapore to follow  the  same\r\n\r\npolicy of livelihood as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat pursued in the Federation. Can this be accepted by\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore? Singapore is a trading  port\r\n\r\nfor the Federation to export its goods. The imports and\r\n\r\nexports  of the Federation have to be directed  through\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Therefore,  a great  portion  of  materials\r\n\r\nneeded  by  the Federation are preserved in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTaxes  and  revenues  are also  in  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government.  The  Government  can  use  this\r\n\r\npublic  money to improve the livelihood of the  people.\r\n\r\nIt  can carry out all kinds of social welfare and other\r\n\r\nservices.  Therefore, the average  national  income  is\r\n\r\nmore  than that of the Federation of Malaya. The public\r\n\r\nmoney  spent by the Singapore Government on social  and\r\n\r\nother  services  is much more than that  spent  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. The social services  and  other\r\n\r\nbenefits  enjoyed by the people of Singapore are  of  a\r\n\r\nhigher  standard  and more than those  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\npeople of the Federation. Now, if Singapore were to  be\r\n\r\ncompletely  merged with the Federation  of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nbecome its twelfth State, it would mean that the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  would  have  to  give  up  their  higher\r\n\r\nstandard of living. They would have to adapt themselves\r\n\r\nto  the conditions in the Federation. Can the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore agree to this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us examine objectively what kind of\r\n\r\nsituation Singapore will be in if we were to  agree  to\r\n\r\nthe amendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If according to the Barisan Sosialis' type of\r\n\r\nmerger,   Singapore  is  completely  merged  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya to become the twelfth State,  the\r\n\r\npresent  social services and allowances now enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nthe  people  will  decrease.  This  is  because  social\r\n\r\nservices  are  pan-Malayan. The policy  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsocial  services will have to follow that obtaining  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. Everyone knows that the average social\r\n\r\naid  is  illustrative of what the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nget. Can the people of Singapore accept this situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): 2. If we follow the\r\n\r\nmethod  of  the  Barisan Sosialis, the examinations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Chinese schools will be  effected  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  or  Malay medium. Chinese students in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools cannot write their answers in Chinese. That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is  being done now in the Federation  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nUnder  a complete merger, Singapore will have to follow\r\n\r\nsuit.  Can  the  Chinese parents in  Singapore  or  the\r\n\r\npresent students accept this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If we go according to the Barisan Sosialis'\r\n\r\nmethod,  the  Bank  of  China in  Singapore  and  other\r\n\r\nforeign  banks  will  have to close  down,  because  at\r\n\r\npresent  there  is  a law in the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwhich   prohibits  foreign  banks  from  carrying   out\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  the Federation. Under a complete  merger,\r\n\r\nthis law will be applicable to Singapore and bank staff\r\n\r\nwill  be  unemployed.  I think,  perhaps,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis do not want to see this. Perhaps they like  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  there  are  more unemployed.  The  more  the\r\n\r\nmerrier. They want to see a confused situation. What we\r\n\r\nmust take into serious consideration is that, if we  go\r\n\r\naccording to the way of the Barisan Sosialis, then  our\r\n\r\nfree port status will be affected and the merchants  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will suffer. Will the merchants of Singapore\r\n\r\nagree to that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Under a complete merger, products from China, such\r\n\r\nas  textiles, cannot be imported into Singapore because\r\n\r\nthis is the present policy of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, there are many other things which\r\n\r\ncannot  be  adjusted so very easily at this  moment.  I\r\n\r\nhave  only enumerated some objective problems  existing\r\n\r\nin the two territories. Of course, we entirely agree in\r\n\r\nprinciple  to  a  full  and  complete  merger,  because\r\n\r\nbasically  this  will  solve our  social  and  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.  But as I have already said just  now,  there\r\n\r\nexist between the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\nterritories   numerous  divergencies  and  differences.\r\n\r\nSince  there  exist different objectives,  environments\r\n\r\nand  circumstances, therefore, to carry out a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger   immediately  would  only  cause   very   great\r\n\r\nconfusion  among the people. So this  is  a  road  that\r\n\r\ncannot be followed. Only adventurers will, for the sake\r\n\r\nof  their own personal interests, accept such a  course\r\n\r\nthat  will  be  detrimental to  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete merger of Singapore with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya will happen one day, but its coming cannot be as\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member  for Queenstown has suggested,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nthrough  his  amendment.

The\r\n\r\nMember for Queens-town has said that to achieve it,  he\r\n\r\nneed  only move an amendment. Before a complete  merger\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  with the Federation can take  place,  we\r\n\r\nwill have to pave the way for it. We have to lay a firm\r\n\r\nfoundation   for  the  ultimate  merger  of   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories.  On  this  point,  I  believe  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposed   merger  in  this  transitional   period   is\r\n\r\nrealistic, practical, objective and feasible.  It  will\r\n\r\nlay  down  good foundations for the ultimate merger  of\r\n\r\nthe  two territories. We will talk about this in  other\r\n\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the amendment moved by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown  is  intended  to  mislead  the\r\n\r\npeople.  That  is why I oppose it. A few  days  ago  he\r\n\r\nuttered weak and empty words. He tried to convince  all\r\n\r\nof us that the purpose of the motion was to mislead and\r\n\r\nconfuse  the  people and to divert attention  from  the\r\n\r\nreal issue. Therefore, we have to expose his intention.\r\n\r\nHe  wants  to  entice  the people by  saying  that  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  should  automatically   become\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the  Federation. This  is  an  attractive\r\n\r\nrequest.  But, in fact, everyone of us knows that  this\r\n\r\ndemand  is not acceptable to the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nThe  hon.  Member's  intention is to create  discontent\r\n\r\namong  the  people  and  mutual  suspicion  among   the\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Moreover,  he  wants  to  embarrass   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government. Judging from the nature  of  the\r\n\r\namendment moved, we can easily put forward all sorts of\r\n\r\ndemands. We can even ask for the moon and the stars  in\r\n\r\nthe  sky,  but we have to consider whether our  demands\r\n\r\nare  reasonable or not, whether they are feasible,  and\r\n\r\nwhether they are in the interests of the people  or  in\r\n\r\naccordance with their aspirations. All of us know  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  citizenship laws in the Federation.  Anyone\r\n\r\nwho  wants to become a Federal citizen has to apply  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the citizenship laws in the Federation\r\n\r\nand  not in accordance with the laws of the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis also proposed that Singapore\r\n\r\nshould merge with the Federation on the basis of Penang\r\n\r\nor  Malacca. But in the 7\u00bd hour speech of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, there was no mention  of  Malacca  and\r\n\r\nPenang because the Minister for Finance has taught  him\r\n\r\na  lesson and he has now become wiser. Now let  me  ask\r\n\r\nhim  questions  about  the citizenship  rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Malacca and Penang. Can all the  people  in\r\n\r\nMalacca    and    Penang   become   Federal    citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically?  Or  can  they become  citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  according  to the law  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown?  Can  Singapore  citizens  become   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  by  using the same Law? We have to  base  our\r\n\r\narguments on practical circumstances. We should not try\r\n\r\nto  sabotage the merger negotiations between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation  by putting  forward  unreasonable\r\n\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come back to the question of Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca. The situation in these two places is not  like\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Queenstown said. Only those people\r\n\r\nborn in Penang and Malacca can become Federal citizens.\r\n\r\nThe other people have to apply for Federal citizenship.\r\n\r\nWhy  do  the  Barisan Sosialis not ask  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould merge with the Federation on the basis of Penang\r\n\r\nor  Malacca? Do they realise that what they  asked  for\r\n\r\nbefore and what they propose now is not the same thing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Choa Chu Kang has said that his\r\n\r\nstand is resolute and firm and that he never changes\r\n\r\nit. I want to ask the Members opposite, when they were\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P., -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We were never in the P.A.P.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I mean the Members\r\n\r\nwho belong to the Barisan Sosialis, they also said that\r\n\r\nour stand was very firm. But today when they are in the\r\n\r\nOpposition, they say that their stand is firm, and\r\n\r\ntomorrow when they sell out the people's rights, they\r\n\r\nwill also say that they are very firm in their stand.\r\n\r\nThey are firm in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nputting forward demands which are not in accordance\r\n\r\nwith objective realities. The Barisan Sosialis do not\r\n\r\neven know what they want. How can the people expect\r\n\r\nthem to put forward more reasonable demands?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that what the Barisan Sosialis want is not\r\n\r\nmerger.  We know that they want to oppose merger.  They\r\n\r\nwant Singapore to be still under British colonialism so\r\n\r\nthat they can smoothly carry out their under-ground and\r\n\r\nabove-ground activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a few days ago some Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis quoted many historical events and phases  from\r\n\r\nChinese  history.  They likened the Federation  to  the\r\n\r\nManchu Dynasty which conquered China. This sort of talk\r\n\r\nis  very dangerous. It will cause suspicion and  racial\r\n\r\nconflict  between  the people of the  two  territories.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  want  to  advise  our  friends  in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition that they should be careful about what  they\r\n\r\nsay.  If  they support merger in principle,  then  they\r\n\r\nshould not make speeches which would cause a feeling of\r\n\r\nuneasiness in the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  just  now  I  have  heard   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for   Home\r\n\r\nAffairs talk about a lot of things. I feel that what he\r\n\r\nhas  said  is contradictory to what his Ministers  have\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister for Finance-said that we did\r\n\r\nnot  break  away from the P.A.P. over the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger,  but  just now the Parliamentary Secretary  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we did so because of the P.A.P.'s  proposed\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also touched on the\r\n\r\neducational  problem. He asked whether we  would  agree \r\n\r\nwith  the education policy of the Federation.  I  think \r\n\r\nwhat he said was on the same lines as what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education said two days ago. He also said that true \r\n\r\nmerger was good but not realistic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy  should  the Party in power want to  use  terms  in\r\n\r\ntheir  motion to confuse the people? Merger is  only  a\r\n\r\nname. If there is to be a merger, then we should have a\r\n\r\ngenuine merger and they should not make use of the term\r\n\r\n\"merger\"  to  confuse the people.  The  motion  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour runs like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That, whereas it has always been the avowed\r\n\r\nobjective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve  the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and to remove the artificial division created by\r\n\r\nthe  British by their policy of \"divide and rule\", this\r\n\r\nHouse affirms and declares that the first objective  of\r\n\r\nall   true  patriots  of  Malaya  is  to  achieve   the\r\n\r\nreunification of these two territories in a  merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this motion mean that there should be a\r\n\r\nmerger,  and if there is merger, it should be a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger.  They  should  not use  the  word  \"merger\"  to\r\n\r\ndeceive  the  people. I feel that the speeches  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership are not sincere. They  should  learn\r\n\r\nfrom  the Tunku and say that this kind of merger  is  a\r\n\r\npartnership.  It will be more correct if they  use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"partnership\",  and  not  the  word  \"merger\"  to\r\n\r\nconfuse the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let me return to the point. Let me talk on the amendment moved by our Chairman. I fully support it because it is based on a stand which is\r\n\r\ntruly  for  the benefit and interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nthe two territories. It is unbiased and just. It is the\r\n\r\ncorrect way to deal with true merger of Singapore  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, and with the language issue. It  meets\r\n\r\nwith  the wishes and desires of the people of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories. It also reflects the stand of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis on merger between the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis has spent 7\u00bd hours to analyse and to deal with what the Prime Minister has in a few months spread among the people - misgivings and discontent. Our Chairman has dealt with all this. The Prime Minister has been creating artificial tension among the people. He wants to divert their attention from the fact that he is selling them out. He has also analysed the special\r\n\r\ncharacteristics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting  in the two territories, and of the  socialist\r\n\r\nforces  that are now growing and developing, especially\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, which is a new political force in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Its   strength  must  have   caused   some\r\n\r\napprehension in the leadership of the P.A.P. and  made\r\n\r\nthem run to the Federation to fall on all fours to  beg\r\n\r\nfor help from the Tunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship rights, our Chairman\r\n\r\nhas  clearly pointed out that we are concerned with the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the citizens of Singapore, and we  have  to\r\n\r\nclarify our stand on this. He has also pointed out  the\r\n\r\ndeceits and hypocrisy of the P.A.P. He has pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. has not only deprived the citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  their citizenship rights, but  has  also\r\n\r\nintended to sell out the basic democratic rights of the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore.  What  we  want  is  a  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger - Singapore  entering  into  the   Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya, as a State. All Singapore citizens on the  day\r\n\r\nof  merger should automatically become citizens of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  All this shows that what we,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  want is a genuine merger in which  there  is\r\n\r\nintegrity  and a reunification of the two  territories.\r\n\r\nWe resolutely oppose the phoney merger of the P.A.P. We\r\n\r\nhave also declared that we\r\n\r\nwant  to  retain the basic citizenship  rights  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore on merger. In order to  preserve\r\n\r\nthe  basic rights of the citizens of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore, however  adverse\r\n\r\nthe   circumstances  and  conditions,  we  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis will resolutely -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order,\r\n\r\nSir.

We know that with the sell-out  of  their  citizenship rights, Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nwill  lose all their interests. Therefore, in order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  their present and future interests,  we  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  must  point  out  what  the   basic\r\n\r\nconditions  for  true merger are. We  must  expose  the\r\n\r\nphoney merger of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the debate today is mainly for all Assemblymen to ponder carefully over this question of genuine merger. On this question there has already\r\n\r\nbeen  a  debate for several months. From the result  of\r\n\r\nthe  debate on this question, we can find out who  are,\r\n\r\nin fact, representatives of the people and work for the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people, and who are hypocritical  and\r\n\r\ndeceiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. If the translation is\r\n\r\ncorrect, I think the word \"hypocritical\" is used. I ask\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member to withdraw that word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI withdraw this word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the true picture is very clear now. Speaking as a member of the Barisan Sosialis, our stand on merger is in accordance with the wishes and\r\n\r\ndesires  of  all classes of people. Therefore,  we  are\r\n\r\nalways  resolutely working along this line. We want  to\r\n\r\nfight  for  a  complete  genuine  merger  of  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories,  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nand  to  reunify the two territories. The views of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis are that we must achieve true complete\r\n\r\nmerger  of  the  two  territories,  to  eliminate   all\r\n\r\ncolonial  forces remaining in the two territories,  and\r\n\r\nto seek more freedom and democratic rights. Under these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the two territories can then enjoy  real\r\n\r\nhappiness. Therefore, in accordance with the  terms  of\r\n\r\nour amendment, there are three conditions for merger of\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories,  namely, that  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  on  the day of merger  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation.  If  these  citizens  of  Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\nautomatically  become citizens of the Federation  after\r\n\r\nmerger,  then  the people of Singapore will  be  losing\r\n\r\nmany important political rights. This is what everybody\r\n\r\ncan  understand. It cannot be refuted.  Only  when  the\r\n\r\ncitizens   of  the  two  territories  enjoy  the   same\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights  can  they  enjoy  equal  political\r\n\r\nrights and other benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. Let us look at the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nphoney  merger. According to this type of  merger,  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore cannot enjoy the same citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  as the citizens of the Federation. The citizens\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  then  cannot  take  part  in  political\r\n\r\nactivities in the various States of the Federation,  to\r\n\r\nform  big  Parties  and to stand for  election  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious States. Under these circumstances, whenever the\r\n\r\nFederation  Central  Government takes  reactionary  and\r\n\r\ndictatorial measures, the people of Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nsuppressed  and they will not be able to seek  redress.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, if they can have common citizenship\r\n\r\nrights,  then  if  the  Federation  Government  ignores\r\n\r\npublic  opinion, or if they suppress the people in  the\r\n\r\ntwo territories, then the people in the two territories\r\n\r\ncan  unite and oppose the unreasonable policies pursued\r\n\r\nby  the Government. The people in these two territories\r\n\r\ncan  unite through the system of one man one vote,  and\r\n\r\nelect  a  new government which represents the  people's\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all these comparisons are\r\n\r\nbased  on  the premises that we have common citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  and  functions.  This  shows  that  with  basic\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights, we can enjoy political rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about the economic problems of the\r\n\r\npeople in relation to the merger issue. If a person  in\r\n\r\nSingapore wants to go to the Federation to open up  new\r\n\r\nland and cultivate it, or if he wants to open a farm in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  then without a real  merger - when  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  are  not\r\n\r\nenjoying the same citizenship rights - this person will be\r\n\r\nfrustrated in his desire to open a new farm. If a rich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson wants to start a new business in the Federation,\r\n\r\nthen, because he does not enjoy the same rights as  the\r\n\r\nFederation  citizens, he will be  thwarted.  He  cannot\r\n\r\neven  carry on his business. If a person wants to apply\r\n\r\nfor  a  taxi  licence but he is not a Federal  citizen,\r\n\r\nthen  he  cannot  achieve his aim.  In  short,  whether\r\n\r\nlooking  at  this problem from the daily lives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  or  from  the  economic  point  of  view,   the\r\n\r\nimportance of citizenship rights is indisputable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we the Barisan Sosialis advocate that on\r\n\r\nMerger Day the citizens of Singapore must automatically\r\n\r\nbecome Federal citizens. Our demand is a just one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to reiterate what our Party Chairman said at, a mass rally. I think it is necessary to bring out this question. We can show that\r\n\r\nwe  are honest, serious and careful on the question  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  We  can also expose the groundless accusations\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Ministers when they said  that  we  were\r\n\r\nsabotaging merger, that we were insincere about merger,\r\n\r\nand  that we were not nationalists. We can also  expose\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  they  tried  to  divert  the  people's\r\n\r\nattention from the real problem. In the course  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on this question, they want to confuse us  with\r\n\r\nall these minor points. The Government has made use  of\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the State Advocate-General to illustrate\r\n\r\ntheir  points. It is useless to do so. His  opinion  is\r\n\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four questions. Now I wish to quote from\r\n\r\nour Party pamphlet because our views on the question of\r\n\r\nmerger are propounded in this pamphlet. One of our four\r\n\r\nconditions  is that through the system of one  man  one\r\n\r\nvote  we  can establish a more just society.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwithout  the right of automatic citizenship will  those\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens who have no Federal citizenship  be\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  against  and  suppressed?  Thirdly,   if\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore do not have Federal  citizenship,\r\n\r\nwill  they  have  freedom of speech and  the  right  of\r\n\r\nassembly  and organisation in the Federation? Fourthly,\r\n\r\ncan  the  trade union movement in Singapore be unified?\r\n\r\nWill the workers in the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterritories  be  united  to fight  for  better  working\r\n\r\nconditions?  Will graduates from Singapore  schools  be\r\n\r\neligible to work in the Federation civil service?  Will\r\n\r\nNan-yang University graduates be discriminated  against\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation?  Will those  people  who  have  no\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship, i.e. merchants,  contractors  and\r\n\r\nbus  companies, be restricted in their business in  the\r\n\r\nFederation?  Will the people in Singapore  be  able  to\r\n\r\nacquire land in the Federation? Will the socialists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore be able to go to the Federation to take  part\r\n\r\nin   political   activities  there?   Are   all   these\r\n\r\nquestions, after  merger, in any way  connected  with\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, why have I raised these questions? Why have I put forward these four questions? My contention is that although we have been debating\r\n\r\nthis  question for seven days, the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nsome of the Assemblymen have not given a clear-cut view\r\n\r\nof  the  matter and have not answered these  questions.\r\n\r\nThis shows that we are cautious and very sincere in our\r\n\r\napproach to the question of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, why did our Party Chairman\r\n\r\nreiterate that we should have a genuine merger?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause we want to prevent the P.A.P. from passing  off\r\n\r\na phoney merger as a real merger. We know that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nconspiracy   in  putting  forward  the  phoney   merger\r\n\r\nproposal  is to confuse the people. They have  deceived\r\n\r\nthe   people  many  times.  They  always  put   forward\r\n\r\nplausible,  vague, ambiguous, dubious and sophisticated\r\n\r\narguments-the  so-called  independence,  autonomy   in.\r\n\r\nlabour  and  education,  that  merger  will  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the people, and all this talk on merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to allow the P.A.P. to mislead the\r\n\r\npeople  on the question of merger, we have put  forward\r\n\r\ngenuine  proposals  for a genuine merger  under  which,\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore  is merged with the Federation  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth State of the Federation, all Singapore citizens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  automatically become Federation citizens  on\r\n\r\nMerger  Day.  The basic rights of  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  not be sold out  by  this  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger proposal. We will not fall into the trap of\r\n\r\nthese plotters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.
