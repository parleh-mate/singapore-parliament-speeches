As I already explained\r\n\r\nin  some  detail  on Friday, in Singapore  where  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  proportion  of  daily  foodstuffs  are\r\n\r\nimported,  prices  are subject to  fluctuations  in\r\n\r\nsupply.  For  some  items the  price  increases  in\r\n\r\nDecember/January are seasonal, due to  the  festive\r\n\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the main fluctuations in prices are due to\r\n\r\nsuch  factors  as mentioned above, a  committee  on\r\n\r\nprices  cannot exert any influence on prices.  This\r\n\r\npoint  was  discussed  by  the  then  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  [Dr Goh Keng Swee] in December 1968  when\r\n\r\nthe same question was raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is possibly more useful is the formation of a\r\n\r\nConsumers'  Association  to  keep  watch  on  price\r\n\r\nmovements  and to ensure that prices  of  essential\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  are  not  manipulated  by  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nstallholders   and   shopkeepers   and   any   such\r\n\r\nmalpractices  are  detected and publicised.  It  is\r\n\r\nunderstood  that  there  is  a  move  for  such  an\r\n\r\nassociation   --  the  Consumers'  Association   of\r\n\r\nSingapore - to be registered.

A\r\n\r\nfull list of the average retail prices of essential\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  is published in the Monthly  Digest  of\r\n\r\nStatistics  regularly and the study of  fluctuation\r\n\r\nin  the  prices will clearly indicate that official\r\n\r\nprices   do  properly  reflect  price  fluctuations\r\n\r\nexperienced by the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRAFFIC POLICE SUMMONS NOTICES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Delay in issue)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  (a)  if  he will give the reason  for  the\r\n\r\ndelay  of over one year in the issue by the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice of a summons notice in respect of a 13-month\r\n\r\nold traffic offence; and (b) what is the backlog of\r\n\r\nsuch  cases,  and if he will take steps  to  remedy\r\n\r\nthe, situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, normally, if\r\n\r\nthe  personal  particulars of the offending  driver\r\n\r\nare  available  on the spot and if the  offence  is\r\n\r\ncompoundable, an offer of composition will be  sent\r\n\r\nto  him  within  two weeks of the offence.  If  the\r\n\r\noffer is not accepted by the driver after a period,\r\n\r\naction by way of summons will be instituted against\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many cases of traffic\r\n\r\nviolations  where the particulars of the  offenders\r\n\r\nare  not  obtainable  on the spot  by  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice.  In  these  cases, some time  is  spent  in\r\n\r\nobtaining  the  particulars of  the  owner  of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle   from  the  Registrar  of  Vehicles,   and\r\n\r\nthereafter,  the particulars of the driver  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of the alleged offence from the owner.  Often\r\n\r\nreminders have to be sent to the vehicle owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the particulars of the driver are finally\r\n\r\nobtained, it will take some time before an offer of\r\n\r\ncomposition  is sent to him. If the  offer  is  not\r\n\r\naccepted, the case will be further delayed in  that\r\n\r\nsome more time will have to be spent in obtaining a\r\n\r\nsummons from the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also difficulties in effecting the\r\n\r\nservice  of summons. In many cases, accused drivers\r\n\r\nchange  addresses  without notifying  the  National\r\n\r\nRegistration Office and the Registrar  of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nof  these changes, although required by the law  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  Hence  an accused driver may  receive  his\r\n\r\nsummons for an offence committed one year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is a backlog of approximately\r\n\r\n21,500  traffic cases, all more than  a  year  old,\r\n\r\nwaiting for the issue of summonses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a ticketing system will soon be\r\n\r\nimplemented  to  deal with traffic  offenders  more\r\n\r\neffectively  and  expeditiously.  Under   the   new\r\n\r\nsystem,  a  ticket will be issued to the  offending\r\n\r\ndriver  on the spot stipulating the amount of  fine\r\n\r\nwhich  he has to pay at the Report Section, Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice,  within  two weeks from  the  date  of  the\r\n\r\noffence.

The    Housing    Board's\r\n\r\nachievements   dominate   the   low   profile    of\r\n\r\nSingapore's skyline with the presence of more  than\r\n\r\na  hundred thousand housing units, many of them  in\r\n\r\nblocks  of high-rise flats which the Board has  put\r\n\r\nup  since  its  inception.  The  magnitude  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard's achievements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan be further gauged by the fact that nearly\r\n\r\n30  per  cent of our population are housed  in  the\r\n\r\nBoard's flats. We are given to understand that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  is constantly making plans to catch up  with\r\n\r\nthe past accumulated demand, and coping with future\r\n\r\nanticipated demand for public housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these heart-warming data, plus the proud\r\n\r\nclaim that the Board is building one unit per every\r\n\r\nhalf-hour,  undoubtedly make for a  very  effective\r\n\r\nadvertisement of Singapore's image abroad. However,\r\n\r\nto   the   many  thousands  of  citizens  who   are\r\n\r\nunfortunate enough to be still on the waiting  list\r\n\r\nof  the  Board, they may wonder whether the housing\r\n\r\nshortage  is ever likely to be solved.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon to hear that an applicant has to wait  for\r\n\r\nas  long as even one and a half years before he can\r\n\r\nbe housed. The only persons who are lucky enough to\r\n\r\nmove  into the Board's flats without having to wait\r\n\r\ntheir   turn  are  those  unfortunate,  or   rather\r\n\r\nfortunate enough, to be evicted as a result of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's development programme. In other words,\r\n\r\nthe  popular impression seems to be that  we  build\r\n\r\nhouses  only  in  sufficient numbers  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the urban renewal  scheme.  Added\r\n\r\nforce is given to such impression by the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  disposal to private developers of well located\r\n\r\nplots  of  land  vacated under  the  urban  renewal\r\n\r\nscheme   has   proved   very  profitable   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  in this House know  that  such  an\r\n\r\nimpression, though invariably popular, is erroneous\r\n\r\nand  misconceived. A blunt denial,  no  matter  how\r\n\r\nauthoritative, is not sufficient to counteract  it.\r\n\r\nA  more  concrete answer is required of the  Board,\r\n\r\notherwise  the purpose of the urban renewal  scheme\r\n\r\nwill continue to be misconstrued. I understand  and\r\n\r\nappreciate  the great strain being  placed  on  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nspiralling  increase  in the prices  of  privately-built  houses  and  the  rents  of  privately-owned\r\n\r\nhouses.   In  addition,  the  decision  to   permit\r\n\r\npurchase of the Board's flats by making use of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund contribution and the raising\r\n\r\nof the maximum income limit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  eligibility have helped to swell up the Board's\r\n\r\nwaiting  list. Thus, if we continue at the  present\r\n\r\nrate  of building just sufficient housing units  to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of persons rendered homeless under  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal scheme, the waiting list for  public\r\n\r\nhousing  is  likely  to become longer  rather  than\r\n\r\nshorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse is my fear that our building\r\n\r\nprogramme may not even be able to keep up with  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal programme. Unless the Board is  able\r\n\r\nto  step up its building programme, I do not  think\r\n\r\nthere  can  be  any satisfactory  solution  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  mounting pressure in  the  demand  for\r\n\r\npublic  housing as long as private housing  remains\r\n\r\nexorbitantly priced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter on which I require clarification is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's urban renewal programme. I am  sure\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House are  aware  of  the  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah New Town project. This is to cover  a  vast\r\n\r\narea  of  about 932 acres. That it is a  tremendous\r\n\r\nproject cannot be denied, and in a project of  such\r\n\r\ndimensions, many problems and vexations are  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected.  It is also to be expected that  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  planning has to be thought out  and  many\r\n\r\npreparatory   measures  in   the   form   of   land\r\n\r\nacquisition   and   eviction   of   residents   and\r\n\r\narrangement  for  their  alternative  accommodation\r\n\r\nhave to be carried out before the first pile of the\r\n\r\nproject  can be sunk into the ground. My  complaint\r\n\r\nis  directed  not to the fact that such  a  project\r\n\r\nwill  cause  hardships for some of my constituents,\r\n\r\nbut  to the fact that unnecessary hardship has been\r\n\r\ncaused. What is alarming is that the nature of such\r\n\r\nhardship seems to indicate insufficient planning of\r\n\r\nthe  project. The project was divided into  several\r\n\r\nphases  of development. Thus, the process  of  land\r\n\r\nacquisition  and  eviction of  residents  had  been\r\n\r\neffected   in   accordance  with   the   order   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the various sections comprising  the\r\n\r\nproject. Suddenly it was decided that the order  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  must  shift from  one  section,  where\r\n\r\neviction  had  already begun,  to  another  section\r\n\r\nwhich was originally to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  the  last  phase of development. As  a  result,\r\n\r\nthere is considerable confusion and suffering among\r\n\r\nthe  residents  of  the whole  area,  whether  they\r\n\r\nremain in or move out of the area. Chief tenants of\r\n\r\nhouses refuse to repair houses and the requests  by\r\n\r\nsubtenants   for  Housing  and  Development   Board\r\n\r\naccommodation are denied as they are not deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe  evicted  tenants as a result of  the  shift  in\r\n\r\npriorities. On the other hand, other residents  who\r\n\r\nare  not supposed to move out until much later  are\r\n\r\nsuddenly  required  to move at  short  notice.  All\r\n\r\nthese unnecessary hardships could have been avoided\r\n\r\nif  the  order  of  development had  been  properly\r\n\r\nplanned  without  having to make  changes  half-way\r\n\r\nthrough the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people residing in an area prefer to remain\r\n\r\nin  it for various reasons. Some of them because of\r\n\r\ntheir business associations, employment, children's\r\n\r\neducation, and others merely because of the  social\r\n\r\ncontacts they have made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have one more minute, Mr\r\n\r\nGovindasamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in the case of the Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah   project,   may  I  say   that   no   such\r\n\r\nconsideration was given in planning it. Unnecessary\r\n\r\nhardships  could have been easily  avoided  if  the\r\n\r\nplanning had been thorough and if the original plan\r\n\r\nhad  not been changed, as I have mentioned earlier,\r\n\r\nhalf-way through the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it is a well-known fact that the achievements\r\n\r\nof  the  Housing  and Development Board  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing  have  earned  praise,  both  locally   and\r\n\r\ninternationally.  However, there are  some  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning   public  housing   that   require   the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  Minister.  There  are   various\r\n\r\nproblems  facing  flat-owners and  tenants  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh   that   give   rise   to   irritations   and\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.  One  of  this  is  the   Housing\r\n\r\nBoard's  attitude  in prohibiting flat-owners  from\r\n\r\nmaking  improvements to their own flats  no  matter\r\n\r\nhow minor they are. As a flat-owner surely one can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  permitted to make improvements to enhance one's\r\n\r\nown  property  provided such  improvements  do  not\r\n\r\nalter or damage the structure of the building. Flat-owners  always have difficulties with  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  over the fitting of louvered windows,  metal\r\n\r\ngrills,  gate canopies and even colour schemes  for\r\n\r\nsuch  fittings. As a matter of fact, the  Board  is\r\n\r\nnow taking legal action against several flat-owners\r\n\r\nfor  installing louvered windows in  preference  to\r\n\r\nthe  casement type installed by the Housing  Board.\r\n\r\nNo  one  in his right senses would take the trouble\r\n\r\nto make alterations to existing fittings or install\r\n\r\nnew fittings which obviously cost money if they  do\r\n\r\nnot  serve a useful purpose. If a flat-owner  feels\r\n\r\nthat  the  fittings installed by the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nare  not  up  to  his expectations,  he  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to change them. We should encourage  flat-owners   and   tenants  to  keep  the   environment\r\n\r\nattractive instead of discouraging them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem concerns defects like cracked\r\n\r\nfloors,  cracked ceilings, and choked  and  leaking\r\n\r\npipes.   Here   the  dispute  is  who   should   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for repairing such defects.  The  Board\r\n\r\nmaintains  that  if  the  occupier  has   been   in\r\n\r\nresidence in a flat for more than six months, it is\r\n\r\nnot  responsible for such repairs. I believe  there\r\n\r\nis  one such building regulation which favours  the\r\n\r\nBoard. It is absurd for the Board, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nto  disclaim  responsibility for repairs  to  these\r\n\r\ndefects  and,  on  the  other hand,  to  discourage\r\n\r\nowners  from  improving their  flats.  The  defects\r\n\r\nmentioned usually appear after the six-month period\r\n\r\nof  residence. Representations were made to  me  by\r\n\r\nthe  flat-owners and complaints were brought to the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the  Board, but so far no  satisfactory\r\n\r\nsolution has been found. Most of these defects  are\r\n\r\ndue  to  the negligence on the part of the  Board's\r\n\r\ncontractors.  Debris  is conveniently  dumped  into\r\n\r\ndrainage  pipes  and toilets, thereby  choking  the\r\n\r\nwhole  system and affecting several floors in  some\r\n\r\ninstances. The Board should exercise more stringent\r\n\r\nsupervision of the contractors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  impose  penalties  if they  are  found  to  be\r\n\r\nnegligent, like barring them from further contracts\r\n\r\nfor a period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, I would like to mention the\r\n\r\nirresponsible attitude of some contract workers  in\r\n\r\ndefacing and dirtying partially completed buildings\r\n\r\nin  Toa  Payoh.  It is not uncommon to  find  human\r\n\r\nexcreta in some of these buildings when visitors go\r\n\r\nup there to have a look at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hawkers, the present policy of the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board in allocating stalls  to  bona  fide\r\n\r\nhawkers   only   has  caused  hardships   to   some\r\n\r\nresidents,  particularly those staying in  one-room\r\n\r\nflats.  With more one-room flats coming up  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh,  more people will be taking up petty hawking\r\n\r\nas a means of supplementing their income. There are\r\n\r\nresidents who because of tragic circumstances, have\r\n\r\nto  take to hawking to earn a decent living.  There\r\n\r\nare   others  who  are  unemployable  for   various\r\n\r\nreasons.  It is better to allocate stalls  to  such\r\n\r\npeople   than  to  let  them  subsist   on   public\r\n\r\nassistance.  Because of a shortage  of  stalls  and\r\n\r\nunsuitable  location, there is an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unauthorised hawkers in Toa Payoh.  The\r\n\r\nlocation of the market near Block 18 has also given\r\n\r\nrise to numerous complaints from residents. Due  to\r\n\r\nthe  close proximity of this market and the  hawker\r\n\r\nstalls,  residents  have complained  of  flies  and\r\n\r\nnoise  nuisance  coming from  the  stalls  day  and\r\n\r\nnight.  The noise starts from 5 am, in the  morning\r\n\r\nwhen  stallholders arrive in the market to  prepare\r\n\r\nfor  the  day's  work. At night,  the  cooked  food\r\n\r\nhawkers   also   join  in.  The  noise   from   the\r\n\r\nconversation of stallholders in the early hours  of\r\n\r\nthe morning and the banging of frying pans at night\r\n\r\ndisturbs  the peace of the residents. As a  result,\r\n\r\nmany  of them have indicated that they wish to sell\r\n\r\ntheir flats and go elsewhere. I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nfuture  sites for markets and hawker centres should\r\n\r\nbe  so located that they are further away from  the\r\n\r\nresidential area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to car parks, much has been said in\r\n\r\nthe   local  press  about  inadequate  car  parking\r\n\r\nfacilities in Toa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayoh. I must say that, overall, there are adequate\r\n\r\nparking  areas  in Toa Payoh, but the  location  of\r\n\r\nsuch parking areas leaves much to be desired. Here,\r\n\r\nthe   planners  have  failed  to  make   a   proper\r\n\r\nassessment of the situation. Large and spacious car\r\n\r\nparks are located near to the one-room and two-room\r\n\r\nflats, for example, near Blocks 45, 44, 28, 30  and\r\n\r\n99.  Car  parks near the sold properties  are  much\r\n\r\nsmaller. Common sense will tell us where the demand\r\n\r\nfor  parking space is. Block 99 is mainly  used  by\r\n\r\nunauthorised hawkers. To solve the problem, I would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the Board restrict  the  parking  of\r\n\r\nbuses,  commercial vehicles and taxis to the larger\r\n\r\ncar  parks  which are less used and to  review  the\r\n\r\ndemarcation  of the smaller ones to ensure  optimum\r\n\r\nusage of the space available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of play areas, in reply to a\r\n\r\nquestion  raised  in  the  previous  sitting,   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and\r\n\r\nNational    Development    (National    Development\r\n\r\nDivision)  stated that play areas are now  provided\r\n\r\nby  the Board on the ground floor of flats. This is\r\n\r\nindeed  welcome news, particularly  to  the  lower-income group. However, may I point out to the House\r\n\r\nthat  the play areas mentioned are located  in  the\r\n\r\nwest  sector  of Toa Payoh. There are none  in  the\r\n\r\neast  sector  where there are more  people  of  the\r\n\r\nlower-income group. There are 20 blocks of one-room\r\n\r\nflats in the east sector compared to seven only  in\r\n\r\nthe  west. In order to meet the recreational  needs\r\n\r\nof residents in the east sector, may I suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  Board  consider resiting some  of  the  ground\r\n\r\nfloor residents in the one-room flats so that these\r\n\r\nflats could be converted into play areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question that always irritates tenants is the\r\n\r\napplications  for transfers. Most applications  for\r\n\r\ntransfers are from smaller to larger units or  from\r\n\r\nlarger  to  smaller units. There is a tendency  for\r\n\r\nthe   Board   to  treat  all  applications   alike,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether it is a deserving  case  or\r\n\r\nnot.  The usual reply is that all vacant flats  are\r\n\r\nreserved for resettlement cases and applicants  are\r\n\r\nrequested to wait for their turn, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be for months or years. I see the need for the\r\n\r\nBoard  to  reserve  vacant flats  for  resettlement\r\n\r\ncases.  But allowing a transfer does not fill  such\r\n\r\nvacant  flats.  It merely creates  another  vacancy\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  For  instance, there is  a  case  of  a\r\n\r\nfamily  whose  two  children were  murdered.  Their\r\n\r\napplication for a transfer to another  flat  or  an\r\n\r\nearly  allocation of a sale flat met with the  same\r\n\r\nnegative response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the lifts, it appears that the policy\r\n\r\nof  the Board, in accepting the lowest tenders  for\r\n\r\nlifts,  has  resulted in poor quality  lifts  being\r\n\r\ninstalled   in   the   Board's   flats.    Frequent\r\n\r\nbreakdowns,    inadequate    ventilation,     rusty\r\n\r\ninteriors,  inferior fittings like indicator  knobs\r\n\r\nwhere the signs are obliterated after a short  time\r\n\r\nof  usage, are fairly common. When you enter a lift\r\n\r\nin  a  Housing  Board flat, you have a  feeling  of\r\n\r\ninsecurity. Whether the lift will move  up  or  get\r\n\r\nstuck  halfway is a matter of interest. It is never\r\n\r\na smooth journey when you travel in a Housing Board\r\n\r\nlift.  Sometimes  the  lift  vibrates  or  emits  a\r\n\r\ngrumbling  noise  which  sends  shivers  down  your\r\n\r\nspine.  I  hope, Sir, the Minister will  look  into\r\n\r\nthese  problems  and try to rectify  them  wherever\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

Perhaps I can deal\r\n\r\nwith them in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah seeks clarification\r\n\r\nof  the  Housing and Development Board  policy  and\r\n\r\nquestions  the long wait of one and a half  to  two\r\n\r\nyears  before  one gets a Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flat, either as a tenant or as a  purchaser.\r\n\r\nIt   is  admitted  that  the  waiting  period   for\r\n\r\nallocation of flats is at least one and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf  to two years, sometimes even longer.  It  was\r\n\r\ndifferent in the 1960s when the demand for housing,\r\n\r\neither from resettlement or other cases, was  about\r\n\r\nequal  to  the  number of Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats built. The position today is  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  and  I  put this down to  the  extensive\r\n\r\nconcessions  granted by the Government  early  last\r\n\r\nyear,  especially the availability of  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund monies. Previously one had  to  wait\r\n\r\nuntil  one  reached  55 years before  drawing  that\r\n\r\nmoney.  Now everybody is rushing to use his Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  money, and  hence  the  desire  to\r\n\r\npurchase Housing and Development Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year alone the Board received 12,324\r\n\r\napplications for rent and 20,598 applications  from\r\n\r\npurchasers  desiring  to  buy  flats,   making   an\r\n\r\nunprecedented total of 32,922 applications  in  one\r\n\r\nsingle year. At the start of 1970 there was already\r\n\r\na  backlog. And we had to deal with another  33,000\r\n\r\napplications.  Last year the Board built  a  little\r\n\r\nless  1han  14,000  units. It cannot  build  28,000\r\n\r\nunits  within  one year. That is  not  all.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  enough building 14,000 units, but  there\r\n\r\nare  plans  to increase this to about 20,000  units\r\n\r\nannually  by  1975. This year the  Board  hopes  to\r\n\r\nbuild  about  17,000 units. Even if it succeeds  in\r\n\r\nthis plan and builds 17,000 units, it is a far  cry\r\n\r\nfrom the 32,922 applicants who registered for flats\r\n\r\nlast  year. The position is not hopeless.  We  have\r\n\r\nbroken   the   back  of  the  housing  problem   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but the Member for Telok Blangah used  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  word, \"solve\". By \"solve\" it means  that\r\n\r\nwe  must  be  able to provide a flat to anyone  who\r\n\r\nwants a flat. The position today is that the demand\r\n\r\nfar exceeds the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also grumbled about the hardships that\r\n\r\nhis constituents are undergoing as a result of this\r\n\r\nplanning for the new town in Telok Blangah. He says\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  gigantic problem, so  on  his  own\r\n\r\nadmission it is not easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

There are plans. The work is\r\n\r\ngoing  according to phases, but certain areas  were\r\n\r\ncleared   to   make  way  immediately  for   urgent\r\n\r\nprojects. For instance, two areas within  the  town\r\n\r\nwere  cleared  for the development  of  the  P.U.B.\r\n\r\nsubstation   and  the  Singapore  Telephone   Board\r\n\r\nExchange.  Hence  eviction. Yet another  place  was\r\n\r\ncleared  for the cutting of a hill as  well  as  an\r\n\r\naccess  road  to this hill in order to provide  for\r\n\r\nthe   Pasir   Panjang  Reclamation  Scheme.   These\r\n\r\nclearance  projects were undertaken and they  might\r\n\r\nhave  given  the Member the impression  that  there\r\n\r\nhave been no plans. I can assure him that there are\r\n\r\nplans.  They are well laid-out plans, but any  plan\r\n\r\nto  be  implemented  must be a  flexible  one.  You\r\n\r\ncannot  say, \"I am moving in here on this  day  and\r\n\r\nthere  on  that day.\" Circumstances change  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is hardship we regret it. In order to  avoid\r\n\r\nmore hardship, I would suggest that the Member call\r\n\r\nat the Ministry of National Development and look at\r\n\r\nsome  of  the plans, which I assure him we have  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry.

Perhaps I should assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Toa Payoh that I will look into his\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  I do not think all his complaints  are\r\n\r\ntrue.  There  is  such  a demand  for  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board flats and yet  the  Member  says\r\n\r\nthat the lifts are no good, the walls are cracking,\r\n\r\nthere is dirt all over the place, the market is too\r\n\r\nclose  to the flats, the car parks are in the wrong\r\n\r\nplace,  and the playgrounds are in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nIf  all  these are true, I do not know why everyone\r\n\r\nwants to go to Toa Payoh. I do not know why we  had\r\n\r\n32,000 applications by last year. Something must be\r\n\r\nwrong!  In one breath the Member says that some  of\r\n\r\nhis  poorer constituents who occupy one-room  flats\r\n\r\nwould like to supplement their income by being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhawkers.  In  the next breath he says  the  hawkers\r\n\r\nmake  too  much noise at night or in the market  in\r\n\r\nthe day. But there are difficulties. Everyone wants\r\n\r\nto be a hawker nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> We are short of labour!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, we are short of labour.

In multi-storey housing, strict\r\n\r\ndiscipline  must be maintained for the common  good\r\n\r\nof  the  residents. You can have your minor repairs\r\n\r\nprovided they are within the building, but  if  you\r\n\r\nput  an awning on to the common corridor or to some\r\n\r\nother common area, then the neighbours grumble.  If\r\n\r\nyou  want to put a gate or a grill, put it in  your\r\n\r\nown  house,  but do not trespass on to  the  common\r\n\r\narea because if you do your neighbours grumble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, your time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is all, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

This is  the  point  I\r\n\r\nmade, but there are also one or two other points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> They have to do with planning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I admit there are  bound  to  be\r\n\r\nproblems in a project of such vast dimensions,  but\r\n\r\nI  have, as the Minister knows, gone to the Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board and looked at these plans. My\r\n\r\nobjection  is  to the chopping and  changing  of  a\r\n\r\ndecided  pattern of a plan, in the sense  that  one\r\n\r\narea was laid down for the first phase of development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand you moved out the people from there,  and\r\n\r\nthen   half-way  through,  perhaps  for  some  good\r\n\r\nreason, it was decided to move the phase to another\r\n\r\nlocation where the people would be evicted. So  you\r\n\r\nhave  the  situation where half of the people  were\r\n\r\nevicted  in the first location, and the other  half\r\n\r\nstill  remain behind, thereby creating  unnecessary\r\n\r\nproblems.  If  there  had been  planning,  if  this\r\n\r\nchange  in  phase development had not taken  place,\r\n\r\nthere would not have been these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also admit that the backlog in the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board is bound to  increase  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  using  C.P.F. funds  for  purchase  of\r\n\r\nhouses.  The  high-cost  houses  developed  by  the\r\n\r\nprivate developers will again further --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Is that the fault of the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No, but we have got to cope\r\n\r\nup  with the requirements which we are not able  to\r\n\r\ndo.  Perhaps there may be other causes too.  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  one  or  two other causes which  may  have\r\n\r\nresulted in this big backlog? One could be that  at\r\n\r\npresent there is no means of preventing members  of\r\n\r\none  family  from making separate applications  and\r\n\r\nusing   one  another  in  substitution   of   their\r\n\r\nrespective applications for one flat. In one family\r\n\r\nof  six  people,  two or three  can  make  separate\r\n\r\napplications. The enforcement of the income ceiling\r\n\r\nfor  eligibility  for the Board's  flats  militates\r\n\r\nagainst fixed wage-earners, people who earn monthly\r\n\r\nincomes  in  the  form  of  salaries.  It  benefits\r\n\r\nbusiness people who are likely to claim very  small\r\n\r\nincomes and the Board is not in a position to check\r\n\r\nand  provide flats only to those whose wages do not\r\n\r\nexceed  the  requirement.  Similarly  through   the\r\n\r\nabsence of a cross-check between the Board and  the\r\n\r\nProperty  Tax  Department, property owners,  people\r\n\r\nwho own houses, may be also allotted flats. Not all\r\n\r\nattap dwellers are really impoverished. Hawkers may\r\n\r\nbe people who earn very much more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan what they claim to earn.

Cross-checks are  now  being\r\n\r\nmade with the Property Tax Division. If anyone  who\r\n\r\nalready   owns   property  is  caught   making   an\r\n\r\napplication for a Housing Board flat, he  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  lose  his  flat,  but  he  is  liable  to  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the income of hawkers, why does the Member\r\n\r\nnot  ask the Minister for Finance how he checks  on\r\n\r\nthem?  I  do not think he has any means of checking\r\n\r\non  them. If the Member has any suggestions how  we\r\n\r\ncan  check the income of these hawkers, we will  be\r\n\r\nhappy to consider and to implement them. These  are\r\n\r\nthe problems - there are loopholes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell of another loophole. There are grouses\r\n\r\nthat  when you buy a Housing Board flat, it  really\r\n\r\ndoes not belong to you. You cannot do this, and you\r\n\r\ncannot do that, as the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToa Payoh has said. Fair enough. We have introduced\r\n\r\na  rule which says, \"If you want to sell a fiat, go\r\n\r\nahead  and sell it, provided you sell it to someone\r\n\r\nwho qualifies to buy that flat and he is already on\r\n\r\nthe register.\" This has led to abuse. Mr X gets  a\r\n\r\nflat  today  and sells it tomorrow  at  a  handsome\r\n\r\nprofit of $5,000. These are loopholes which we will\r\n\r\nplug.  So  the  Housing Board  is  now  considering\r\n\r\nimposing  a  limitation on the  resale  of  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats, and anyone who sells a flat will  not\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to apply for another flat for the  next\r\n\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the planning of Telok Blangah, my\r\n\r\ninstructions  are  that, except  for  the  specific\r\n\r\nprojects which I have mentioned, there should be no\r\n\r\nchopping and changing about. I think the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah will agree with me when I say that no\r\n\r\none  likes  to  shift on his own. And  when  he  is\r\n\r\nevicted,  he wants to come back. The usual  excuses\r\n\r\nare  that  they have got used to the district,  the\r\n\r\nschool is nearby, and the market is nearby. They do\r\n\r\nnot  tell you that their wives' mahjong friends are\r\n\r\nclose by, too! No one likes to move, but unless  we\r\n\r\nmove  them there will be no urban renewal.  Do  you\r\n\r\nwant  progress, or do you want stagnation?  If  you\r\n\r\nwant  progress,  you  have to evict  them.  So  you\r\n\r\ncompensate  them, but they are not  satisfied.  You\r\n\r\nprovide  them  with Housing Board flats,  they  are\r\n\r\nalso  not  satisfied. They want  a  flat  of  their\r\n\r\nparticular  choice. They want the fifth floor,  and\r\n\r\nthey  want a corner flat. And everybody wants  that\r\n\r\nflat. We cannot satisfy everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise\r\n\r\ntwo  points concerning the economics of our  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres?

This means  that  there  is\r\n\r\nlittle  business turnover for the large numbers  of\r\n\r\nhawkers congregated at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnewly-built  hawker centres.

It seems to\r\n\r\nme  that the rentals are too exorbitant for some of\r\n\r\nthese  hawkers. It seems to me too that at some  of\r\n\r\nthese hawker centres, the charges are so high  that\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers  pass them on to the consumer  in  the\r\n\r\nform of higher prices for cooked food, resulting in\r\n\r\na  rise  in the cost of living for the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup.

But until such time as  we\r\n\r\nare  able to educate or re-educate these people  to\r\n\r\nturn  to occupations that we want them to go  into,\r\n\r\nthat is, the factories, building construction,  and\r\n\r\nso on, we have to let them earn their living.

In fact, the construction  of  smaller\r\n\r\nhawker   centres  at  strategic  sites   is   being\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Housing Board, because  a  hawker\r\n\r\ngoes  out  of  business if he  is  in  some  lonely\r\n\r\noutpost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the rentals charged, it can be looked at\r\n\r\nboth  ways. Some hawkers are making money hand  and\r\n\r\nfoot,  but others are not. But we have to have  one\r\n\r\nstandard rate, otherwise they grumble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for unlicensed hawkers, the Government is\r\n\r\nsympathetic. The Government's policy is not to  get\r\n\r\nrid  of  hawkers in Singapore. But licensed hawkers\r\n\r\ncomplain  about unlicensed hawkers.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nyou  build a market for foodstalls. You license the\r\n\r\nhawkers   therein.  And  as  some  of   them   were\r\n\r\nunlicensed  before, you give them  a  licence.  But\r\n\r\nother hawkers come in, and sell across the road. So\r\n\r\nthe licensed hawkers say, \"What are you doing about\r\n\r\nthat?  We  will go out of business.\" An example  is\r\n\r\nthe  little  row  of stalls we built  opposite  the\r\n\r\nentrance to the Botanic Gardens. Previously all, or\r\n\r\nmost of them, were unlicensed hawkers selling under\r\n\r\ninsanitary  conditions.  We  put  up  a   permanent\r\n\r\nhawkers  centre  and rented out  the  stalls  quite\r\n\r\ncheaply. They were given water and electricity, and\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing good business. But now  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers come along. And you must have read  in  the\r\n\r\npapers  about  the  police  chasing  an  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawker  and,  in running across the road,  knocking\r\n\r\ndown somebody's child. Well, this happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the hawkers at the junction of\r\n\r\nFarrer Road, Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road,  in\r\n\r\nTanglin  Constituency;  and  yet  another  one   in\r\n\r\nNewton,  in  Cairnhill Constituency. These  hawkers\r\n\r\nwere  all  unauthorised or trespassing  on  someone\r\n\r\nelse's  land.  They were not paying any  rent,  and\r\n\r\nwere    selling    food   in   rather    insanitary\r\n\r\nsurroundings.  We levelled the land,  cemented  the\r\n\r\nplace,  put  up  little stalls, and  they  are  now\r\n\r\npaying  rent at about $40 a month for a  stall.  If\r\n\r\nyou  sell cooked food, for which you pay a rent  of\r\n\r\nabout  $1.50 a day, you are well in. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, if you merely sell sweets, for which you have\r\n\r\nto  pay  a rent of $1.50 a day, you might not  make\r\n\r\nit. If you sell ice-water --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> You boom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> - you are in.

But I can assure the Member that\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy is not to  get  rid  of  every\r\n\r\nhawker in Singapore. We have come to accept hawkers\r\n\r\nas  part of the life of Singapore. In the past when\r\n\r\nhawkers were moved into shops in the Housing  Board\r\n\r\npremises, they had to pay a high rent. As a result,\r\n\r\nthe   price   of  their  food  went  up.  Customers\r\n\r\nsubsequently  stopped coming, and  then  they  went\r\n\r\nbankrupt. But they cater for a need. The Government\r\n\r\nrealises  this, and we will continue to build  more\r\n\r\nand  more hawker centres, so that they can hawk  at\r\n\r\nvery   cheap  rates,  otherwise  they  go  out   of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  I  am speaking generally,  not  only  in\r\n\r\nrespect of those built in Housing Board estates but\r\n\r\nthose  at Farrer Road, Newton Road, and the one  at\r\n\r\nOrchard Road in front of the Cold Storage, which is\r\n\r\nthe  most  popular in Singapore. They are  doing  a\r\n\r\nroaring  business. There is another centre opposite\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Polytechnic, which recently  started\r\n\r\nbusiness - a car park by day, and a hawkers  centre\r\n\r\nby  night.  So once again may I assure  the  Member\r\n\r\nthat  we  are not against hawkers. We have come  to\r\n\r\naccept  them as part of the life in Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  ensure  that  they  sell  food  under\r\n\r\nsanitary conditions, so that when hon.

But at the same time, there are other places\r\n\r\nwhere  the  hawkers are so poor  that  the  rentals\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have got to pay are really exorbitant.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to suggest is to apply the simple\r\n\r\nlaw  of economics - supply and demand - to each and\r\n\r\nevery hawker centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to unlicensed hawkers, we have to\r\n\r\nask  ourselves this question: why are there so many\r\n\r\nunlicensed hawkers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a situation which reflects upon  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  or failure of our educational policy,  our\r\n\r\nhealth  measures, and our ability  to  educate  the\r\n\r\npublic  on these matters.

However, I would like to comment on the implementation of\r\n\r\nthis policy which involves the acquisition of lands\r\n\r\nbelonging to the private sector. In the process  of\r\n\r\nacquisition   of   private   lands   belonging   to\r\n\r\nindividuals, much criticism, acrimonious complaints\r\n\r\nand  dissatisfaction  have been  expressed  by  the\r\n\r\npublic  over  the arbitrary prices  paid  for  such\r\n\r\nlands  which  have no relationship  to  the  market\r\n\r\nprice  which  can  be  obtained  for  their  lands.\r\n\r\nPrivate  landowners welcome and are very happy  and\r\n\r\nwilling  if lands are requisitioned to build  roads\r\n\r\nand   other  public  projects  for  national   use.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  lands acquired by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development for the private  sector  have\r\n\r\nbeen  re-tendered for sale at prices  five  to  ten\r\n\r\ntimes more than the original price paid for, and it\r\n\r\nis  in such cases that genuine grievances have been\r\n\r\nexpressed. The owners feel that they have not  been\r\n\r\nfairly   compensated  and  that  they   are   being\r\n\r\nexploited in order to make the rich people  richer,\r\n\r\nespecially  when land has been sold  with  all  the\r\n\r\nbuilt-in incentives provided by the Government. Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Law  and  National  Development\r\n\r\nexplain to this House by what criteria lands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are  to  be  acquired  for  development  are\r\n\r\nevaluated  and  the  price  arrived  at?   Is   the\r\n\r\nvaluation   undertaken  by  a  Government   or   an\r\n\r\nindependent   valuer?  Although  there   is   legal\r\n\r\nmachinery  by  which  dissatisfied  landowners  can\r\n\r\nappeal  to the Appeals Board, more often  than  not\r\n\r\nthe  aggrieved party is not prepared to go to court\r\n\r\nto  get a judgment because they know that it  is  a\r\n\r\nforegone  conclusion and, at  the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\nlegal  expenses  involved are too costly.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  give  more sympathetic  consideration  to\r\n\r\nlandowners,  especially small landowners,  who  own\r\n\r\nsmall  plots of land, so that in future acquisition\r\n\r\nof  land a more equitable price is paid for land to\r\n\r\nbe developed by the private sector?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also suggest that landowners be given a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  grace for half a year to  one  year  to\r\n\r\ndevelop the land themselves if they intend to do so\r\n\r\nbefore acquisition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, urban renewal schemes will be undertaken in many other areas. I am very concerned with those areas bounded by Kallang Road, Lavender Street, and Jellicoe Road where small- and medium-sized engineering works are situated. Many of these engineering workshops have been in existence for two or three generations. The business has been\r\n\r\npassed  down from grandfather to father,  and  from\r\n\r\nfather to son. The skills also have been passed  on\r\n\r\nfrom  the  elders to the children. They  have  been\r\n\r\nacquired through the hard school of experience  and\r\n\r\nthrough trial and error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister give the House an assurance that when these areas which I have mentioned are acquired for urban renewal, he will provide a suitable area with clean and cheap factory buildings for these engineering works so that they can survive? A reasonable rental can be\r\n\r\ncharged  for these new workshops. At their  present\r\n\r\nsites they pay low rentals and their overheads  are\r\n\r\nlow.  These  engineering works are the mainstay  in\r\n\r\nproviding  the supporting manpower skill  and  high\r\n\r\nproductivity, especially as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsub-contractors  to  the  big  engineering,   ship-repairing and shipbuilding firms. Without them  the\r\n\r\nbig  firms  will find great difficulty in competing\r\n\r\nwith  other countries in fabricated metal work  and\r\n\r\nother  engineering  services. I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  bear  in  mind that these  firms  are  firmly\r\n\r\nrooted  and  every effort should  be  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to enable them to continue their  trade.\r\n\r\nThey will then be able to upgrade their skills  and\r\n\r\nacquire new know-how it will be a big loss  to  our\r\n\r\nRepublic  without  them because they  make  a  real\r\n\r\ncontribution to our economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first may I thank\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  River Valley  for  giving  me  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to explode a myth? This  myth  is  the\r\n\r\ngeneral misconception that Government acquires land\r\n\r\ncheaply and sells it at high prices. It is admitted\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  past year or so the  Government  has\r\n\r\nacquired  quite  a  bit  of  land.  Most  of   this\r\n\r\nacquisition has been made for purposes of  defence.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers need training grounds, and, therefore,\r\n\r\nlarge  tracts of land have been acquired.  However,\r\n\r\nit  is  not true that we acquire land and  pay  the\r\n\r\nowner  whatever  we like. The Land Acquisition  Act\r\n\r\nitself  provides  that land  can  be  acquired  for\r\n\r\npublic  purposes  but  at  the  market  rates.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment Valuer values the land, but that is  not\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  matter. The owner  of  the  land\r\n\r\nacquired  has  his  own  valuer  and,  if   he   is\r\n\r\ndissatisfied, there are provisions by which he  can\r\n\r\nask  for  a hearing before the Appeals Board  where\r\n\r\nthe  two valuers can set out their cases. They  can\r\n\r\ngive  their reasons why the land should  be  $10  a\r\n\r\nsquare  foot  or $20 a square foot.  A  High  Court\r\n\r\njudge sits on the Appeals Board and he decides  the\r\n\r\ncase accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to go back to the question of Government\r\n\r\nacquiring  land cheaply and selling it dearly.  One\r\n\r\nreason  for this misconception perhaps is  that  no\r\n\r\none likes his land to be acquired by Government. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not matter whether it is acquired cheaply  or\r\n\r\ndearly,  he does not like it. However, we  have  to\r\n\r\nacquire  land  for public purposes. Perhaps  people\r\n\r\nhave this false impression because they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not  aware of the following factors. The  land\r\n\r\nwhich   is   bought   by  Government   is   usually\r\n\r\nencumbered. It costs a lot of money and it takes  a\r\n\r\nlot   of   time   to  clear  the  land   of   these\r\n\r\nencumbrances.  It is only the Government  that  can\r\n\r\nevict  the  squatter  occupiers.  If  the  land  is\r\n\r\nsubject  to rent control, it is very difficult  and\r\n\r\nvirtually impossible for the landowner to evict his\r\n\r\ntenant.  In some cases, the tenant demands hundreds\r\n\r\nof  thousands  of dollars. Therefore,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfactors  is  encumbered  land  which  has   to   be\r\n\r\nunencumbered. The Government's offer to the private\r\n\r\nsector  in respect of urban renewal sites  includes\r\n\r\nmany   concessions.  First,  there  is   the   easy\r\n\r\nrepayment  of the purchase price: 20 per cent  down\r\n\r\npayment  with the balance repayable over ten  years\r\n\r\nwithout  interest.  This works  out  roughly  at  a\r\n\r\nsaving  of  approximately 35 per cent of  the  land\r\n\r\npremium.  Second,  there is  reduced  property  tax\r\n\r\nwhich is one-third the normal rate. The normal rate\r\n\r\nis  36  per  cent. The property tax for  the  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal sites is 12 per cent payable over 20 years.\r\n\r\nTherefore, many people buy them. There are a lot of\r\n\r\npurchasers willing to buy them. The owner pays only\r\n\r\n12 per cent property tax for the next 20 years. The\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flat-owners pay 23 per cent property\r\n\r\ntax  now,  after long communication and conferences\r\n\r\nwith   the   Ministry   of   Finance.   Previously,\r\n\r\nQueenstown  flat-owners  paid  23  per   cent   and\r\n\r\nAljunied flat-owners paid 36 per cent. Now there is\r\n\r\na  flat rate. In any case, even Housing Board flat-owners  pay more than the 12 per cent property  tax\r\n\r\nin  respect of the urban renewal sites.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso  other  reasons. The land acquired is  usually\r\n\r\nfragmented  with  small and narrow frontages  which\r\n\r\ncannot  be developed. These little pieces  of  land\r\n\r\nare  collected by the Government and  put  together\r\n\r\ninto one big complex and then sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, when Government sells land, it sells at\r\n\r\n\"net\", if I can use the phrase. `You do not have to\r\n\r\nset  aside part of your property for drains, canals\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroads.  Everything is laid on. All you do is  build\r\n\r\non  that land. The planning work has been done.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the land offered is almost immediately ready\r\n\r\nfor  construction.  And last  but  not  least,  the\r\n\r\nsimulated  plans  provided  by  the  Urban  Renewal\r\n\r\nDepartment give the developer expert advice on  the\r\n\r\noptimum  use of the land. I have not given you  all\r\n\r\nthe  factors. But these are the major  factors  why\r\n\r\nthe three urban renewal sales that we have had have\r\n\r\nbeen  successful and why the public is prepared  to\r\n\r\npay more and more for these sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the assurance asked for by the Member in\r\n\r\nrespect of resettlement of the small industries  at\r\n\r\nLavender Street, Geylang Road and Jellicoe Road, he\r\n\r\nneed not worry now. No clearance programme has been\r\n\r\ninitiated for urban renewal purposes as it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  Government to ensure that  there  is\r\n\r\nsuitable alternative accommodation available before\r\n\r\nfull-scale relocation takes place. But the widening\r\n\r\nof  Lavender Street by the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nwill  affect a few cases in this locality, and this\r\n\r\ncannot  be helped as the road widening is  urgently\r\n\r\nneeded.

As a  result\r\n\r\nof  the prosperity of our country, certain problems\r\n\r\nof communication were created. Two years ago, Upper\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar Road was widened in order to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  laying  of sewer pipes. Some attap  houses  in\r\n\r\nLorong Tai Seng were demolished and the sewers were\r\n\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paya Lebar Airport will have to accommodate the\r\n\r\nBoeing  747s and, as a result of the need to expand\r\n\r\nthe airport, some houses in Paya Lebar will have to\r\n\r\nbe   demolished.  There  is  no  doubt  that  these\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects have affected the people in my\r\n\r\nconstituency who have to make sacrifices.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  be very careful in dealing with the problem  of\r\n\r\nresettling  people  who  are  affected   by   these\r\n\r\nprojects. We should not carry out plans rigidly and\r\n\r\nwithout any flexibility, thus driving them  to  the\r\n\r\nbrink of despair and hopelessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out clearly that, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  such  development  projects  as   road-widening and sewerage works, many houses and  shops\r\n\r\nhave  been demolished. Many of my constituents have\r\n\r\nexpressed  their distress and great  disappointment\r\n\r\nwhen  they see their houses brought to the  ground.\r\n\r\nHowever,  after lengthy persuasion on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe local leaders and myself, the great majority of\r\n\r\nthem have come round to the point of view that  the\r\n\r\nnational  interests must come first.  The  question\r\n\r\nnow  is  how  to  resettle properly those  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by these development projects. Because  of\r\n\r\nimproper  handling by the officials of the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board, many problems  which  were\r\n\r\noriginally capable of solution have become more and\r\n\r\nmore    complicated   and   have    caused    great\r\n\r\ninconvenience to many of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a person who has been affected by\r\n\r\nresettlement    applies    for    Housing     Board\r\n\r\naccommodation or shop premises, he has to  fill  in\r\n\r\nan  application  form  to indicate  his  choice  of\r\n\r\npremises. These people have accordingly indicated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  preference for the location, the lot numbers\r\n\r\nand  the  addresses. However, what they  have  been\r\n\r\nallocated  in  the end turns out to  be  completely\r\n\r\ndifferent. Their original choice has been given  to\r\n\r\nother people. This situation has made me doubt  the\r\n\r\nstatement  that  these people are, in  fact,  given\r\n\r\npreferential treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory reallocation of shop premises\r\n\r\ncannot  work because much depends on the customers.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if a coffee shop has been  given  an\r\n\r\nisolated  corner to carry on the  business   ---  I\r\n\r\nhave received complaints from coffee-shop owners on\r\n\r\nthis score it has only itself to serve and no other\r\n\r\ncustomers, and it will have to wait for the day  to\r\n\r\nfold up its business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of allocation of premises to those\r\n\r\naffected  by  resettlement, we  must  find  them  a\r\n\r\nbetter solution and give them a better choice. Only\r\n\r\nin  this  way  can  we say that  we  are  fair  and\r\n\r\nimpartial.   Many  people  have  been  delayed   or\r\n\r\ndisappointed  by the method and the  way  in  which\r\n\r\nallocations  have  been made. However,  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department,  especially the  Roads  Section,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  seem to be aware that these people  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  allocated their new  premises  and  have\r\n\r\nissued  summonses to them asking them to appear  in\r\n\r\ncourt.  I have emphasised this point before.  These\r\n\r\npeople  have already agreed to move away  but  they\r\n\r\nhave   not   been   allocated  any  premises   yet.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they are still there. This anomaly quite\r\n\r\ncommon  and people who are affected by resettlement\r\n\r\nhave complained to me very often about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right hand of the Government does not\r\n\r\nseem  to  know what the left hand does. Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  we  seem  to have lost the  spirit  and  the\r\n\r\nquality of the P.A.P. when we first came to  power.\r\n\r\nI  complained  to  the department  concerned  about\r\n\r\nthis. The reply was that those who were affected by\r\n\r\nresettlement were in the wrong. Or else I would get\r\n\r\na  perfunctory reply full of high-sounding language\r\n\r\nand  beating  about  the  bush.  On  behalf  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents. I would like the Minister to instruct\r\n\r\nhis  departmental  heads that they  should  not  be\r\n\r\noverbearing.

In my constituency,  more\r\n\r\nthan half the area is designated for industrial  or\r\n\r\nmilitary  use. In these areas, people  have  become\r\n\r\nvery  hard  pressed. First, the  period  given  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is not fixed. Some of  them  say  this\r\n\r\narea  is  to be developed in two years,  but  after\r\n\r\nfive years, nothing seems to have been done. During\r\n\r\nthis  period, the farmers will have received notice\r\n\r\nto  cease  further cultivation of  their  land  and\r\n\r\ntheir  huts, however decrepit, cannot be  repaired.\r\n\r\nMost  of  them  do  not have water and  electricity\r\n\r\nsupplies and they are not going to have any. If the\r\n\r\ndrains  are  blocked  and  the  roads  damaged,  no\r\n\r\nrepairs  are carried out. Only until the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee have repeatedly  brought  up\r\n\r\ntheir  complaints  that  the  roads  are  in   poor\r\n\r\ncondition that any action has been taken  and  only\r\n\r\nvery  minor repairs have been carried out. Needless\r\n\r\nto  say,  these minor repairs do not help to  solve\r\n\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I have noticed that the policy of allowing no\r\n\r\nmajor  repairs  but permitting only  minor  repairs\r\n\r\nseems  to  have  been changed. Three  roads  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency   are  in  a  horrible  and   shocking\r\n\r\ncondition. They are Lorong Kemabal, Joo  Koon  Road\r\n\r\nand  Jalan Tuas. The people have recently submitted\r\n\r\ntheir applications for urgent repairs to be made to\r\n\r\nthese three roads. I do not know why permission has\r\n\r\nnot been given. I wish to point out to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the  first  two  roads  are  used  daily   by\r\n\r\nthousands  of people in my constituency. The  third\r\n\r\none  is  the only road that leads to an army  camp.\r\n\r\nMany  of  the  parents  whose  children  are  doing\r\n\r\nnational  service in the camp have to make  use  of\r\n\r\nthis  road  to go to the camp. I fail to understand\r\n\r\nwhy  even  minor  repairs to these  roads  are  not\r\n\r\napproved.  This has given rise to a great  deal  of\r\n\r\ndiscontent and unhappiness. I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is true that minor repairs cannot be carried out\r\n\r\nin  areas  designated  for industrial  or  military\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and what is the reason for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

They have requested\r\n\r\naccommodation as follows: 24 families want flats in\r\n\r\nMacPherson Estate or the Kallang Basin; 36 families\r\n\r\nwant  shops,  and  all want to go  to  the  Kallang\r\n\r\nBasin,  two  motor vehicle workshop owners  request\r\n\r\nlocations  which  are not even available,  and  one\r\n\r\nlight  industrial factory wants another  allocation\r\n\r\nwhich   is   also  not  available.

So the request of these 24 families  asking\r\n\r\nfor  flats in the Kallang Basin and 36 more  asking\r\n\r\nfor  shops in the Kallang Basin cannot be  met.

On  numerous\r\n\r\noccasions, too, I have repeatedly suggested certain\r\n\r\nproposals  for  the improvement and reformation  of\r\n\r\nour agriculture. The speaker may be persuasive, but\r\n\r\nso   far,  unfortunately  the  listener  is  rather\r\n\r\nindifferent. I hope I will not find it necessary to\r\n\r\nrepeat  again  what I have said in  this  House  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department was established\r\n\r\nover  11 years ago. But has it seriously considered\r\n\r\nthe  crux  of the problem relating to the  farmers?\r\n\r\nHas it seriously considered how it should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp   the  farmers?  Sir,  before  the  department\r\n\r\nstarted to exercise farm licensing, it claimed that\r\n\r\nit  was  not  in  a  position to  assess  the  true\r\n\r\nposition  of  the farmers. Therefore, on  the  16th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1968, to be exact, the department  carried\r\n\r\nout  farm  licensing. All the data on  the  farmers\r\n\r\nwere  gathered, but in spite of their establishment\r\n\r\nstrength  of 1,218 members, the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment has not been able to disclose any  plans\r\n\r\nfor  agricultural development in Singapore.  If  at\r\n\r\nall  any help is given, it is only for the big-time\r\n\r\nfarmers.  Little assistance is given to the  small-time  farmers. When I last visited my constituency,\r\n\r\nI formed the impression that the small-time farmers\r\n\r\nare still on the brink of poverty. They lead a very\r\n\r\nsimple  life  and  they use  very  old  methods  of\r\n\r\nfarming and livestock rearing. They work throughout\r\n\r\nthe day and only manage to live from hand to mouth.\r\n\r\nThey   make   up  the  majority  of   our   farming\r\n\r\npopulation, and therefore the problem of  improving\r\n\r\ntheir  standard of living is a very serious matter,\r\n\r\ndeserving  the attention of the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although our country is unable to implement the scheme of \"land to the tillers,\" our farmers should at least have some form of security in respect of their land. At the present moment, farmers are occupying land under Temporary Occupation Licences, a system inherited from the\r\n\r\ndays  of  colonial administration. The T.O.L.s  are\r\n\r\ngranted  to  the farmers on a temporary basis,  and\r\n\r\nthey can be withdrawn at any time. Sir, if they are\r\n\r\nwithdrawn,  the  farmers will be left  without  any\r\n\r\nland  to  till.  Since a total area of  581  square\r\n\r\nkilometres (permit me to use the metric  here)  for\r\n\r\nthe  various zones, like the industrial  zone,  the\r\n\r\nGolden  mile zone, the motor repair zone,  and  the\r\n\r\nhigh-class residential zone, has been drawn  up  in\r\n\r\nthe  Master  Plan,  how is  it  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nagricultural zone? Can we not give our farmers some\r\n\r\nkind of lease that is more tenable so that they can\r\n\r\nbe  assured of land to till without having to worry\r\n\r\nabout the withdrawal of the T. 0. L.s?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for several years the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  been carrying out  a   feasibility\r\n\r\nstudy  of  our  offshore islands  for  agricultural\r\n\r\npurposes;  in  particular,  Pulau  Ubin  and  Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong,  with  a  total area  of  about  28  square\r\n\r\nkilometres. But why has it been so quiet about  it?\r\n\r\nDoes it not have any plans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem confronting the farmers is\r\n\r\nfinance.  The farmers' crops are subject  to  price\r\n\r\nfluctuations, and they require financial assistance\r\n\r\nfor   any   development  or  expansion.   I   have,\r\n\r\ntherefore, suggested to the Minister for Finance to\r\n\r\nestablish  a Farmers' Bank to grant loan facilities\r\n\r\nto our farmers in times of need. Since the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance has not indicated whether or not it  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept this proposal, perhaps  we  may\r\n\r\nconsider    converting   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  into a statutory board so as  to  avoid\r\n\r\nall  the  unnecessary  administrative  restrictions\r\n\r\nimposed  on it as a Government department, in  this\r\n\r\nway   the  Primary  Production  Department,  as   a\r\n\r\nstatutory board, will be able to have, in  addition\r\n\r\nto  its  existing functions, a Finance Division  to\r\n\r\ndeal specially with financial matters to assist the\r\n\r\nfarmers. The banks and other financial institutions\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are prepared to grant loans only  for\r\n\r\ncommercial  and industrial purposes. They  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to grant loans for agricultural purposes,\r\n\r\nparticularly  to  the small-time farmers.  So  they\r\n\r\nhave no choice but to resort to money-lenders or to\r\n\r\nrely  on  tontines to raise funds.  Sometimes  they\r\n\r\neven have to borrow from the grocers or the animal-feed  dealers. And if any epidemic breaks out among\r\n\r\ntheir  livestock, or their harvest is poor,  or  if\r\n\r\nthere   is  any  price  reduction  in  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce,  they  will be heavily in debt.  But  when\r\n\r\ntimes  are good, their profits have to be  used  to\r\n\r\npurchase   agricultural   implements, seeds   and\r\n\r\nfertilisers.  So they have no savings  at  all  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  capital  accumulation.  So  whatever\r\n\r\ntechniques  you  can  create  or  devise  for   the\r\n\r\nfarmers, they are not able to take advantage of the\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance offered because  of  lack  of\r\n\r\nfinance, if the Primary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  still  stagnates   in   its\r\n\r\nfunction   to   provide  technical  assistance   to\r\n\r\nfarmers, it is of no help at all. In fact, even  in\r\n\r\nthe dissemination of technical assistance among the\r\n\r\nfarmers,   the   department  has  not   been   very\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore say that financial assistance is\r\n\r\nof  greater importance to the farmers than anything\r\n\r\nelse,  and  I  urge the Government to  convert  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department  into  a  statutory\r\n\r\nboard,  so  that  it will be in a better  position,\r\n\r\nthrough the proposed Finance Division, to help  our\r\n\r\nfarmers  financially. With adequate finances,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to take advantage of  whatever  new\r\n\r\ndevelopments,  techniques,  or  technical  aid   is\r\n\r\noffered  to  them. At the same time, I  would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that the Finance Division  of  the\r\n\r\nPrimary   Production  Department  (as  a  statutory\r\n\r\nboard)  set  up  some  sort of  a  crop  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme,  so  that when the farmers are  faced  with\r\n\r\nproblems   such   as  a  decline   in   prices   of\r\n\r\nagricultural  produce, they will not have  to  lose\r\n\r\nvery much. This problem is particularly evident  at\r\n\r\nthe  present moment as their prices are manipulated\r\n\r\nby  the  middlemen, The prices in  the  market  are\r\n\r\nquite good, but because of the manipulation of  the\r\n\r\nmiddlemen, all that the farmers get for their crops\r\n\r\nis  very  little. So the Government  should  assist\r\n\r\nthem in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to my proposals. Farmers make up about nine per cent of our population, that is there are about 175,000 of them, and so they deserve our assistance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that the\r\n\r\nguillotine time for this Head is Five o'clock.

The farming\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore forms quite an important\r\n\r\nsector of our economy. At a time when our\r\n\r\nagricultural produce brings in an income of about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$200  million,  their contribution to  our  economy\r\n\r\ncannot be overlooked or underestimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what assistance has the Government given to\r\n\r\nour  farmers?  Speaking dispassionately,  over  the\r\n\r\npast  few  years the Government has  done  quite  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal for them through the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment.  The  department teaches  them  how  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their farming techniques, how to vaccinate\r\n\r\ntheir livestock, and other such things. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  the  department  has  also  been  conducting\r\n\r\nexperiments,  and the results of these  experiments\r\n\r\nare made available to the farmers so that they will\r\n\r\nknow  how to breed their livestock. As a result  of\r\n\r\nall  these  improvements, our agricultural  produce\r\n\r\nhas  increased. But this does not mean that we have\r\n\r\ndone  enough for the farmers, or that we have  done\r\n\r\nall  that is needed to be done to help them. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, Sir, the Minister for Finance has pointed\r\n\r\nout in his budget statement a few days ago that our\r\n\r\nagricultural industry is now faced with many  great\r\n\r\nproblems. He has also said that over the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears  there  has  been  an  apparent  decline  in\r\n\r\nagriculture, if that is the case, I must appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry concerned to take early steps to  try\r\n\r\nto solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view, there are two problems facing agriculture. First, there is the shortage of land. As we know, consequent on the acquisition of land for industrial purposes, urban renewal and housing development, arable land is diminishing in area. In order to ensure the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  viability of our  agriculture,  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the existing agricultural areas should be\r\n\r\npreserved  for agricultural purposes. There  should\r\n\r\nbe no more acquisition of such land for other kinds\r\n\r\nof development. In order to solve the acute problem\r\n\r\nof  land  shortage, the then Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nlast year during the budget debate proposed flatted\r\n\r\nfarming as a method for rearing poultry. However, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo   not   know  whether  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment has made any study of this proposal.  If\r\n\r\nso,  what progress has been made on flatted poultry\r\n\r\nfarming?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the land allotted to farmers now is barely sufficient for agricultural purposes. One acre of land allotted to a farmer is too small a size for the development of agriculture. Therefore, the farmers affected by land acquisition should be allotted a bigger area of land so that they can\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with their farming, whether  poultry  or\r\n\r\nvegetable  farming,  and  in  this  way  they   can\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  our  national income.  The  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has been allotted  huge  sums\r\n\r\nof  money  to  carry out experiments  and  research\r\n\r\nprojects.  This  is, of course, a  good  policy  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, because it indirectly helps our farmers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the question is whether the results of the\r\n\r\nresearch and experiments will benefit every  farmer\r\n\r\nand, if it does, to what extent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise the question of the\r\n\r\nerection  of chicken sheds. If a farmer puts  up  a\r\n\r\nchicken  shed of a size in excess of the dimensions\r\n\r\noriginally approved, no mercy will be shown to him.\r\n\r\nThe  shed  will be immediately demolished,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in future some sympathy will be shown to such\r\n\r\ncases.  The  authorities should not  be  too  rigid\r\n\r\nabout the measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I wish to ask is this. In view\r\n\r\nof  the  shortage  of land, is there  any  plan  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  agriculture in our off-shore islands,  and\r\n\r\nis there any plan for deep-sea fishing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  question of flatted farming'? It  was  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  by  the  then  Minister  for   Finance.\r\n\r\nHowever, he is not in charge of farmers.  I  am  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  them. But he is in charge of money.  If\r\n\r\nyou  want  to  borrow money or  if  you  want  your\r\n\r\nfarmers  to  be financed, do not ask  me.  Ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. The Member should  get  this\r\n\r\nclear.

These officers visit the farms regularly\r\n\r\nand give on-the-spot advice to the farmers, whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  big-time farmers or small-time  farmers.\r\n\r\nThey also organise training programmes and talks in\r\n\r\nthe  respective farming areas for farmers to obtain\r\n\r\nthe   most   up-to-date  information   on   farming\r\n\r\ntechniques  and  the  results  of  experiments  and\r\n\r\nresearch.  Information is also disseminated  widely\r\n\r\nthrough the Department's news bulletins, pamphlets,\r\n\r\nrural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfilm   shows   and  rural  news  broadcasts.

It  meant the resettlement  of  some\r\n\r\nfarmers  there.  Therefore,  development   on   the\r\n\r\noffshore  islands has not started.

However,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the time factor I would  not  like  to\r\n\r\nraise  the same points again. But I hope that  when\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard is out he will pay serious  attention\r\n\r\nto my questions by reading them carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of fisheries was raised just now and\r\n\r\nI  would like to express my own opinion on it.

We should  be  proud\r\n\r\nof the progress our country has made, but we should\r\n\r\nfeel  sad  because Singapore is not self-sufficient\r\n\r\nin  its supply of fish. According to the statistics\r\n\r\nin  the  1969  Year Book, the quantity of  locally-produced fish was 12,714 tons, whereas in the  same\r\n\r\nperiod  the  quantity of imported fish  was  41,951\r\n\r\ntons.  In  other words, three-quarters of our  fish\r\n\r\nconsumed is dependent on foreign import. Thus every\r\n\r\nyear  there  is  a loss of millions of  dollars  in\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange. We can see from  the  same  year\r\n\r\nbook  that  the  number of fishermen registered  in\r\n\r\n1962  was  4,366, whereas in 1969 there  were  only\r\n\r\n1,348  fishermen registered left. We can  see  from\r\n\r\nthis  that our fishing industry is declining.  With\r\n\r\nthe increase of our population, the demand for fish\r\n\r\nconsumed  will,  of course, increase,  whereas  the\r\n\r\ncatch   of  fish  is  decreasing.  Based   on   the\r\n\r\ncalculation  of  60  pounds of  fish  consumed  per\r\n\r\nperson  per year, by 1985 when our population  will\r\n\r\nhave reached three million, the consumption will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80,000  tons,  whereas by the year 2,000  when  our\r\n\r\npopulation  will  be four million, the  consumption\r\n\r\nwill  reach 107,000 tons. From this we can see that\r\n\r\nwhile  our population is increasing every year  our\r\n\r\nfishing  industry is dwindling. The more  dependent\r\n\r\nwe  are on imported fish, the less bargaining power\r\n\r\nwe  have over increasing prices. So now is the time\r\n\r\nfor us to save our fishing industry and I hope that\r\n\r\nthe Government will make a two-pronged approach  to\r\n\r\nremedy   the   situation.  The  Government   should\r\n\r\nseriously develop the deep-sea fishing industry and\r\n\r\nprovide  actual  and  positive  assistance  to  our\r\n\r\nfishermen who are in dire difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our island is surrounded by seas all round.\r\n\r\nIn  the  seas,  there are inexhaustible  resources.\r\n\r\nParticularly  in  the Indian Ocean  and  the  South\r\n\r\nChina  Sea there are rich fish belts waiting to  be\r\n\r\nexploited. In the Indian Ocean, there are  lots  of\r\n\r\ntuna  fish which is a great potential for our  fish\r\n\r\nprocessing   industry.  The  Government   has   not\r\n\r\nencouraged  deep-sea fisheries in any way.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  by  the end of 1969, the Government  has\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  the  pioneer  status  of  the   deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing  industry. It has spent a lot of money,  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the  United  Nations  Food   and\r\n\r\nAgriculture  Organisation,  to  set  up  a  Fishing\r\n\r\nTraining School in Changi and also, under the aegis\r\n\r\nof   the   South-east  Asia  Fisheries  Development\r\n\r\nCentre,  to  set  up  a South-East  Asia  Fisheries\r\n\r\nResearch  Centre  to train our  youth  in  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing.  But  then,  although the  Government  has\r\n\r\nspent a lot of money, the trained youths cannot get\r\n\r\nany  jobs  because  there are not  enough  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing boats. Is this all that the Government  can\r\n\r\ndo?  In the end, all this is a waste of money.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment    should   consider    and    encourage\r\n\r\ninvestments  in deep-sea fishing and try  to  think\r\n\r\nout  schemes to encourage its development. From the\r\n\r\npoint  of view of old-time merchants, an investment\r\n\r\nin  deep-sea fishing is an uncertain investment. So\r\n\r\nthe Government should provide more encouragement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto this industry and take the lead. It should\r\n\r\nalso establish joint ventures with local or foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists in this industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our traditional fishing methods, such as kelong\r\n\r\nfishing,  are out-dated and backward.  Our  coastal\r\n\r\nfishing areas are limited in fish supplies. So  our\r\n\r\nfishermen have to venture out into the open seas to\r\n\r\nfish.  But  now and then we read in the  newspapers\r\n\r\nabout fishermen being robbed by pirates or detained\r\n\r\nin  foreign countries. This happens when they  meet\r\n\r\nwith  a storm or an engine failure and have to take\r\n\r\nrefuge  in neighbouring islands belonging to  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Sometimes they meet  with  pirates  and\r\n\r\nthey  incur  more  losses than  just  imprisonment,\r\n\r\nfines  and  confiscation of their ship  by  foreign\r\n\r\ngovernments.  But some of them, after  having  been\r\n\r\nrobbed  by  pirates, did not report to our  police,\r\n\r\nknowing very well that even if they did, they could\r\n\r\nnot  get any assistance from the Government because\r\n\r\nit   could  not  do  anything.  Due  to  all  these\r\n\r\nhazardous  incidents  the off-shore  fishermen  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  problems. Furthermore, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  not  allotted them sites for resettlement.  So\r\n\r\nall  this  has resulted in the dwindling number  of\r\n\r\nfishermen in our country. Sir, now is the time  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  save our  fishermen  and  give\r\n\r\npositive assistance to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister   will  be  patient.

We should have\r\n\r\nsome   sort  of  fishing  agreement  with   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries so as to allow our fishermen\r\n\r\nto fish in their territorial waters. At least, they\r\n\r\nshould  be given safe passage home and  not  be\r\n\r\ndetained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should send out more sea patrol boats or\r\n\r\norganise a kind of emergency sea relief  fleet\r\n\r\nin order to protect our fishermen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) As regards fishermen being robbed by pirates,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should  give  them  financial\r\n\r\nassistance to ensure that they could  continue\r\n\r\nwith  their old trade so that they may not  be\r\n\r\nforced to change their vocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government may perhaps set up a sort of\r\n\r\nair   reconnaissance  service  to   spot   the\r\n\r\nlocation  of  fish from the air by  scientific\r\n\r\nmeans.   This   would  be  better   than   the\r\n\r\nfishermen themselves spotting for fish in  the\r\n\r\nvast  expanses of the seas. Furthermore,  with\r\n\r\nour  own  planes  flying  overhead,  it  would\r\n\r\nprovide   additional   protection    to    the\r\n\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Government should allot certain areas\r\n\r\nnear  the  sea coast for fishing  villages  so\r\n\r\nthat   fishermen  who  are  evicted   can   be\r\n\r\nresettled  there. If they are forced  to  live\r\n\r\nin  Housing  Board flats, they would  have  to\r\n\r\nchange their vocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can seriously consider my\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  and  Jurong have  raised  two  very\r\n\r\nserious  questions:  one,  regarding  the  use   of\r\n\r\nagricultural land, and the other, the promotion  of\r\n\r\nfisheries. Just because the demand for agricultural\r\n\r\nproducts and the demand for fish are both likely to\r\n\r\nincrease  dramatically in the years ahead does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean that it will be economic for us to\r\n\r\nproduce  more  in respect of agricultural  products\r\n\r\nand more fish ourselves; in other words, to be more\r\n\r\nself-sufficient.  Much  of  modern  economic   life\r\n\r\ndepends  upon specialisation, a division of labour.\r\n\r\nSir,  you can imagine the kind of life each one  of\r\n\r\nus  would lead if we were to build our own houses,\r\n\r\nmake our own clothes and so on. We would be back in\r\n\r\nthe cave age. In similar fashion, a country has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngot to specialise too. If we can use our labour and\r\n\r\nour  resources more profitably in manufacturing and\r\n\r\nso  on,  I  say  by all means give up  fishing  and\r\n\r\nagriculture.  Of  course,  there  is  a  short-term\r\n\r\nproblem as well, to the extent that the farmers and\r\n\r\nthe  fishermen get penalised. I would join them  in\r\n\r\ntheir  plea  for some kind of Government assistance\r\n\r\naccordingly. But let us not lose sight of the long-term perspective for both these industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jek, I believe you wanted to\r\n\r\nsay something?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\njust  now was rattling off his speech so fast  that\r\n\r\nthe interpreter was unable to catch up with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong.  I  myself was very disappointed  when  the\r\n\r\npioneer status for deep-sea fishing was struck  off\r\n\r\nthe  list of pioneer status industries. The Primary\r\n\r\nProduction   Department  has  done  its   best   to\r\n\r\nencourage  deep-sea fishing. There is  the  Fishing\r\n\r\nTraining  Centre  at  Changi,  a  joint  Singapore-U.N.D.P.  (United  Nations  Development  Programme)\r\n\r\nproject established in 1969 conducting two types of\r\n\r\none-year  courses: firstly, a deck course to  train\r\n\r\nnavigators and fishing technicians; and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nan  engineering  course  to  train  fishing  vessel\r\n\r\nengineers.  Prior  to running  these  courses,  the\r\n\r\nFishing  Training Centre conducted  several  short-term  intensive  courses of two  to  three  months'\r\n\r\nduration for fishermen in late 1969 and early  1970\r\n\r\nin   seamanship,  navigation,  engine  repair   and\r\n\r\noperation of fishing gear. A total of 51 out of  75\r\n\r\nfishermen  satisfactorily completed these  courses.\r\n\r\nThe  centre  also  conducted a one-week  course  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1970  for 32 captains of fishing  trawlers\r\n\r\nbased  at  Upper  Serangoon Road. So  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  is  not  sleeping  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter. But as I said, our fishermen prefer  to  do\r\n\r\nin-shore  fishing and I am ashamed to say  that  we\r\n\r\nimport  three-quarters of the fish  we  consume  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, why should we be ashamed?\r\n\r\nIt is simple economics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, perhaps the Member misunderstood\r\n\r\nme.

But if\r\n\r\nour neighbouring countries can get the fish cheaper\r\n\r\nthan  we can, let them do it and we import  it  and\r\n\r\nuse  our  resources better.

I have received  many  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  people in my constituency that there has been\r\n\r\nan  excessive delay in their applications to repair\r\n\r\ntheir  houses.  Let  me quote  an  example.  In  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,   a   certain  person   applied   for\r\n\r\npermission to repair his attap hut. This hut is  in\r\n\r\nan  advanced state of dilapidation, and if  repairs\r\n\r\nare  not  carried out immediately, it will  not  be\r\n\r\nsafe  to  live  in  that hut. His  application  was\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a long time, but he has so far  received\r\n\r\nno reply. This goes to show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the efficiency of the Building Survey Division\r\n\r\nhas  deteriorated very badly. I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  order  investigations to be carried  out  and\r\n\r\ninstruct the division to raise their efficiency.  I\r\n\r\nhope he will ask them to speed up the processing of\r\n\r\napplications to repair houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about the cumbersome\r\n\r\nprocedure in dealing with applications. As far as I\r\n\r\nknow,  it  is  as follows. In the first  place  the\r\n\r\napplicant  must  go  to  the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and inform the building inspector  (Di-Niu)  that  he would like to repair his house.  The\r\n\r\nbuilding inspector will give him a form and ask him\r\n\r\nto  go back and fill it. After filling it, it  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  returned to the Ministry of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. A month later the person will  receive\r\n\r\na  letter  asking  him to submit his  property  tax\r\n\r\nreceipts, land rent receipts and two  maps.  These\r\n\r\ntwo  maps are to be purchased from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development. To purchase these  two  maps\r\n\r\nthe  person has to fill in another form. What gives\r\n\r\nthese  applicants a considerable headache  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  must supply the mukim and the lot number  for\r\n\r\nthe  area in which the house is situated.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthese  people  in the rural area are  not  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  these  mukims and lot numbers. They  have  to\r\n\r\nconsult the Di-Niu (building inspectors), and, more\r\n\r\noften than not, they cannot help. So the applicants\r\n\r\nare advised to refer to the landlord. After filling\r\n\r\nin the form --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

This  term  is  generally\r\n\r\naccepted  outside the House, Sir, but as a  gesture\r\n\r\nof respect to the civil servant, I think the Member\r\n\r\nshould  use  the actual term of inspector,  housing\r\n\r\ninspector or survey inspector, but not land cow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> How do you use it in Chinese, Mr\r\n\r\nFong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Ji Char Yuan, Sir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir,  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is saying\r\n\r\nan  unnecessary thing.

Let  me\r\n\r\ncontinue.  After filling in the form the applicants\r\n\r\nhave  to  purchase the maps. They have to wait  for\r\n\r\nanother  week  before they receive  them.  Together\r\n\r\nwith the property tax receipts and the receipts for\r\n\r\nthe  land rents, they have to submit the two  maps.\r\n\r\nAfter  another  two or three weeks, another  letter\r\n\r\nwill   be   sent  by  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  asking for details of the  renovation,\r\n\r\nwhether it is going to be a complete renovation or,\r\n\r\nreconstruction, or merely involve the  changing  of\r\n\r\nthe  roof or walls. The applicants have to draw two\r\n\r\nsketches  giving the specifications of  the  length\r\n\r\nand breadth of the existing house. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  have no choice but to abide  by  the\r\n\r\nprocedure. A few days later, the housing  inspector\r\n\r\nor  building  inspector -- I hope the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is satisfied with this term now  -  will\r\n\r\narrive and check whether the house is according  to\r\n\r\nthe  specifications.  This  is  stage  one  of  the\r\n\r\napplication procedure. The applicants will have  to\r\n\r\nwait  patiently. After a month or so, they  go  and\r\n\r\nask  the building inspector what progress has  been\r\n\r\nmade. The reply is, \"Hey, how can you expect us  to\r\n\r\nwork so quickly? We are very busy. Come back in two\r\n\r\nweeks' time.\" Two weeks later, the answer will  be,\r\n\r\n\"The application has been submitted to the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment.\" The same old story - \"Come back in two\r\n\r\nor three weeks' time.\" After the two or three weeks\r\n\r\nare  up,  the applicants again make inquiries.  The\r\n\r\nanswer now is, \"Come back next week.\" At least this\r\n\r\nis good news. One week later, they go back and ask.\r\n\r\nThe  reply  this  time  is, \"Ah!  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development has approved your application.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  plans  have been  submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health, and we can proceed only  after\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health has given its approval.\" But\r\n\r\nthat will take another two or three weeks. However,\r\n\r\nat  long  last they are granted a temporary licence\r\n\r\nto carry out repairs or renovations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these delays here and there cause the\r\n\r\napplicants  to go to and from more than  ten  times\r\n\r\naltogether.  This is not the way to  do  things.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will consider  simplifying  the\r\n\r\napplication  procedure and  assigning  one  or  two\r\n\r\nofficers  to  assist  the  applicant  to  fill   in\r\n\r\napplication forms for permission to carry out house\r\n\r\nrepairs, and what is more important, to ensure that\r\n\r\nthere are facilities to enable them to complete all\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  procedure in one visit.  This  will\r\n\r\nsave  them a lot of precious time, which  they  can\r\n\r\nusefully spend on working in the farms. Sir, if the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Survey Division is willing  to  help  the\r\n\r\nrural  people, it should be a very easy matter  now\r\n\r\nbecause all the depart-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nments  of the Ministry of National Development  are\r\n\r\nhoused  in the same building. So it should  not  be\r\n\r\ntoo  difficult  to  co-ordinate  the  procedure  of\r\n\r\napplications   and  to  instruct  the   departments\r\n\r\nconcerned to liaise with one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to raise refers to\r\n\r\nillegal structures which are more than three  years\r\n\r\nold.  In the past certain people in the rural areas\r\n\r\nconstructed  houses in violation  of  the  building\r\n\r\nlaws.   This  was  because  they  did   not   quite\r\n\r\nunderstand  these  laws. So  in  respect  of  these\r\n\r\ndwellings  which are more than three years  old,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  department concerned will  consider  the\r\n\r\nposition sympathetically, otherwise summonses  will\r\n\r\nbe  issued to them every six months, and the  fines\r\n\r\nwill increase with each summons. This will impose a\r\n\r\nvery  heavy  financial burden on them. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider the plight of  these  rural\r\n\r\npeople and help them solve their problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I would like to associate\r\n\r\nmyself with the Member for Sembawang in airing  the\r\n\r\ngrievances of the rural people in this House.

In this respect, can the\r\n\r\nChief Building Surveyor think of a more simple  way\r\n\r\nto  help  these  people get their houses  repaired,\r\n\r\nsuch  as cutting out red tape, as mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang just now, which requires  the\r\n\r\napplicant  to  go down town to the  Chief  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor's office, then to the Planning Department,\r\n\r\nand  then to the Health Ministry, and so on? I wish\r\n\r\nsuch a complicated procedure can be made simpler so\r\n\r\nthat  it will also help those Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nin the rural constituencies, including the Minister\r\n\r\nof State for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang has somewhat exaggerated the position\r\n\r\nas   regards  the  delay  and  the  procedure.   My\r\n\r\nunderstanding  is that normally an application  for\r\n\r\nrepair  of temporary houses is approved within  two\r\n\r\nweeks from the time the application is made to  the\r\n\r\nChief Building Surveyor's Department. The procedure\r\n\r\nfor  submitting such applications is already  quite\r\n\r\nsimple.  There  seems  to be  no  need  to  further\r\n\r\nsimplify it. The procedure may be generally  listed\r\n\r\nas  follows. The applicant first goes to the  Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding  Surveyor's Department  and  the  building\r\n\r\ninspector  will  help him fill in  the  application\r\n\r\nform.  He  is then immediately advised to  purchase\r\n\r\ntwo  copies  of the site plans from the Development\r\n\r\nControl Division of the Planning Department.  Next,\r\n\r\nthe   plans  together  with  the  ground  rent   or\r\n\r\nassessment receipt to prove ownership of the house,\r\n\r\nare  then  handed to the building inspector.  After\r\n\r\nthis,  the  building inspector will then visit  the\r\n\r\nsite,  take  measurements of the building  and  its\r\n\r\nlocation,  and  draw  up the  necessary  plans  for\r\n\r\napproval.  Those  are  the  three  steps   of   the\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mukim number and the lot number, my\r\n\r\nsympathy goes to those people who do not understand\r\n\r\nwhat this is all about. But I think the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang will appreciate that no building plan can\r\n\r\nbe  passed unless the site is located. To do  this,\r\n\r\nwe  must  know the mukim number and the lot number.\r\n\r\nBut  as  far as is possible, the building inspector\r\n\r\nwill assist the applicant in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the confusion about the procedure really\r\n\r\nlies  with  what is meant by \"repairs\". The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang spoke about repairing a house  which\r\n\r\nwas in a dilapidated condition, If a house is in  a\r\n\r\ndilapidated condition, seldom will the  owner  want\r\n\r\nto  repair  it.  What he does is  to  demolish  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  and put up a new one. This is where  the,\r\n\r\ntrouble  starts. A simple application  for  repairs\r\n\r\ncan  be approved provided it is merely repairs. But\r\n\r\nmore  often  than not, you will find  the  occupier\r\n\r\napplying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the department for repairs to his house when his\r\n\r\nintention is to demolish it and put up a  new  one.\r\n\r\nAnd  when the building inspector subsequently makes\r\n\r\na   check,  he  finds  that  the  rooms  have  been\r\n\r\nenlarged,  the house has gone a little higher;  and\r\n\r\nthen there is trouble. I think this is the basis of\r\n\r\nthe confusion that exists, because if a house is to\r\n\r\nbe  reconstructed, the signature of the land  owner\r\n\r\nis required as he owns the land. You cannot build a\r\n\r\nhouse  on his land without his permission. He  will\r\n\r\nnot  give  the occupier permission to build  a  new\r\n\r\nhouse  nor will he sign the plan, but the  occupier\r\n\r\ncomes  to  the  Chief  Building  Surveyor  with  an\r\n\r\napplication  for repairs. So there is  trouble  all\r\n\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the houses are reconstructed on the same\r\n\r\nsite with the same floor area as the original,  the\r\n\r\nowner's  consent  is done away with.  But  in  many\r\n\r\ncases the reconstruction is first carried out,  and\r\n\r\nthen  the  applicants  go  to  the  department   to\r\n\r\nregularise  the position. It is only  in  cases  of\r\n\r\nreconstruction of concrete semi-detached or terrace\r\n\r\nhouses  that  applicants are advised to  engage  an\r\n\r\narchitect to prepare the building and site plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also mentioned\r\n\r\ncontinuous  court actions. It all starts  with  the\r\n\r\nbuilder   being  prosecuted  for  putting   up   an\r\n\r\nunauthorised building. The magistrate convicts  him\r\n\r\nand  fines  him, and also makes an  order  that  he\r\n\r\nshould   demolish  that  house.  It  is  called   a\r\n\r\nmandatory  order.  But,  of  course,  he  does  not\r\n\r\ndemolish  the  house. He will not comply  with  the\r\n\r\nterms  of the mandatory order. Because of that,  he\r\n\r\nis  brought  to  court again  and  again.  And,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  long  as he does not comply  with  the\r\n\r\norder  to demolish, subsequent convictions lead  to\r\n\r\nbigger  fines. If we are to drop the matter  after,\r\n\r\nsay,  three  years, then the position  will  become\r\n\r\nhopeless.  He  defies  the  law,  he  ignores   the\r\n\r\nmandatory  order,  and  after  three  years,   when\r\n\r\neverybody keeps quiet, he has got away with it.  So\r\n\r\nI think the Member for Changi is right on that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscore.  But  there  have been  cases  where,  after\r\n\r\nseveral convictions and on sympathetic grounds, the\r\n\r\ndepartment has not taken any further action. But to\r\n\r\ndo  that  in  all  cases would lead  to  many  more\r\n\r\nunauthorised  houses being put up, thereby  getting\r\n\r\nthe cloak of authority within three or four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like the Minister  to  clarify  two\r\n\r\npoints.  First, he has mentioned just now that  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  inspectors will help  the  applicants  to\r\n\r\nfill in the forms. As far as I know, they have  not\r\n\r\nassisted  the  people from the rural  areas  to  do\r\n\r\nthat. These forms are in English, and because these\r\n\r\npeople do not know English, they do not know how to\r\n\r\nfill  in the forms. If the building inspectors  had\r\n\r\nassisted them, I think this problem would have been\r\n\r\nsolved.  But since the Minister says that  they  do\r\n\r\nhelp,  I  hope that they will from now on  actually\r\n\r\nassist them in filling up the forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to repairs and renovations of old\r\n\r\nhouses,  these  houses are in many  respects  in  a\r\n\r\ndilapidated condition. All that the occupier  wants\r\n\r\nto  do  is to replace some of the old parts of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding with new ones. They are not reconstructing\r\n\r\nthe  whole  building.  They want  to  renovate  the\r\n\r\nbuilding on the existing site. If the Minister says\r\n\r\nthat this work does not require the approval of the\r\n\r\nlandlord,  I say that this is not so. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding inspectors often make it difficult for the\r\n\r\napplicants. Sometimes they kick them about  like  a\r\n\r\nball  from  here to there. I think the Minister  is\r\n\r\nnot  aware  of  this  fact.  I  hope  he  will  pay\r\n\r\nattention   to  this  matter.  This  is   a   great\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the people in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people in the rural\r\n\r\nareas,  we have often encountered problems of  this\r\n\r\nnature. I have the opportunity to understand  these\r\n\r\nproblems  more clearly. I am speaking  very  slowly\r\n\r\nnow. I hope the Minister can understand me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Some houses which are\r\n\r\nmore, than three years old do not have any building\r\n\r\nplans.   At  the  time  when  the  builders   first\r\n\r\nconstructed  their houses, they were not  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe building laws. As a result, they violated them.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister has said that one must look at  these\r\n\r\ncases  sympathetically, and that after one  or  two\r\n\r\nfines have been imposed, these offenders should not\r\n\r\nbe  fined  any further. However, some of them  have\r\n\r\nbeen  fined  more  than  three  times.  They  still\r\n\r\nreceive a fine thereafter. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\npay  attention to this matter. He has already  said\r\n\r\nin  this  House that he will consider  these  cases\r\n\r\nsympathetically.  I  hope  he  will  instruct   his\r\n\r\nMinistry to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek some\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister. If a person wishes\r\n\r\nto repair a house by replacing the main pillars and\r\n\r\nchanging  the roof and, at the same time, replacing\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the planks, will it be considered  a  new\r\n\r\nhouse or a repaired house? The sides and the height\r\n\r\nof the house remain the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the repairs\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Member are carried  out  to  the\r\n\r\nletter, it will not be considered by the department\r\n\r\nas  reconstruction but under the phrase  \"repairs\",\r\n\r\nprovided, of course, the rooms are not extended. If\r\n\r\nyou  re-build your house, shall we say, on the same\r\n\r\nsite  with  exactly  the same area;  that  is,  you\r\n\r\ncompletely   demolish  the  house,  and   you   put\r\n\r\nsomething new there but with exactly the same  area\r\n\r\nas  before,  the department considers the  work  as\r\n\r\nrepairs. But if you increase the size of the  house\r\n\r\nby  three  square inches or three square  feet  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  building inspectors measure it and  find\r\n\r\nthat the house is bigger, they will say it is a new\r\n\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang seems to be at issue with\r\n\r\nme  as  to  what  happens  in  the  Chief  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor's Department. My understanding is that the\r\n\r\nbuilding  inspectors are there to help  members  of\r\n\r\nthe public. The Member's understanding is that they\r\n\r\ndo  not help them. However, since the beginning of'\r\n\r\nthis year, my Parliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary has been put in charge of the Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor's Department and he can  keep  an\r\n\r\neye on what is happening in the department from day\r\n\r\nto  day. If the Member has any difficulties on this\r\n\r\nscore, I would suggest that the Member contact him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the court convictions, I do not think I\r\n\r\nneed  repeat  what  I have said.  There  have  been\r\n\r\nconvictions  of even more than half a dozen  times.\r\n\r\nBut  if  there are sympathetic grounds on which  we\r\n\r\ncan  drop the whole matter, we will do it. And this\r\n\r\nhas  been done in several cases. If the Member  has\r\n\r\nany  particular  case  in  mind,  he  can  draw  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's  attention to it and  we  will  give  it\r\n\r\nevery consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I think the Minister is sincere in his  reply\r\n\r\nto  my question. However, there is another point on\r\n\r\nwhich  I  wish to seek clarification. This concerns\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties in the application procedure. The\r\n\r\nMinister says that I have exaggerated the  case.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think I have exaggerated in the  slightest\r\n\r\ndegree, because what I know has been gathered  from\r\n\r\ncomplaints  by many people who have, in fact,  gone\r\n\r\nthrough this cumbersome procedure. What I have said\r\n\r\nis  based  on  facts, and nothing else.  Since  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  given  serious consideration  to  my\r\n\r\nquestion  and  has  assured  the  House  that   his\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary will now be responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Building Surveyor's Department and  that\r\n\r\nevery  problem can he referred to him, I beg  leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $819,150 for Head 1110 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1202 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are some junior doctors who resign\r\n\r\nfrom Government service after serving a couple of  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears.   As   a  result,  there  are  no  immediate\r\n\r\nreplacements for the vacant posts. It appears  that\r\n\r\nthe  student  doctors who are in  the  housemanship\r\n\r\nprogramme have to consult the senior doctors  every\r\n\r\nnow  and then. In the end they are a burden to  the\r\n\r\nsenior doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this pressure and if the senior\r\n\r\ndoctors  resign from the service, what will  happen\r\n\r\nto  the Hospitals Division? I, therefore, call upon\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  rectify  the  situation  in  the\r\n\r\nmedical  services,  or else  the  standard  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals will deteriorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that some doctors work from 82 to 119\r\n\r\nhours  a week. If this is true, how can they manage\r\n\r\nto continue in Government service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it is not financial considerations\r\n\r\nalone  which  have resulted in the  resignation  of\r\n\r\ndoctors.  It  is, in fact, because  of  their  poor\r\n\r\nconditions of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if too many specialist doctors\r\n\r\nresign  from  Government service, I fear  that  the\r\n\r\nmany costly instruments and apparatus owned by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  not  be  properly   handled   by\r\n\r\ninexperienced doctors. If that is the  case,  these\r\n\r\ncostly instruments may turn out to be a waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presume some of the departments have\r\n\r\ninsufficient staff when resignations or retirements\r\n\r\noccur, especially in the E.C.G. Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, student nurses should be given proper training in good manners, politeness and etiquette, because I have seen some of them not performing their duties according to the above standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that it is compulsory for\r\n\r\nstudent  nurses to stay in the hostel during  their\r\n\r\ntraining   periods.  As  a  result,  expenses   are\r\n\r\nincurred by them for lodging, laundry, food,  etc.,\r\n\r\neven  though  they may stay near to the  hostel.  I\r\n\r\nwould,  therefore,  suggest  that  staying  in  the\r\n\r\nhostel  should not be made compulsory,  because  it\r\n\r\nwill affect the take-home pay of the nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I wish to raise but\r\n\r\nwhich  probably does not come under  this  subhead.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  I will mention it, although I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether or not the Minister will reply to it.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwith reference to the Institute of Health at Outram\r\n\r\nRoad,  it  appears  that  the  conditions  in   the\r\n\r\nvicinity of the institute are more like those of  a\r\n\r\nmarket  than  a  hospital. I  wonder  whether  some\r\n\r\nchanges  can be made to the institute so that  this\r\n\r\nhospital   for  children  will  have   a   brighter\r\n\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to know whether the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider introducing a health service system, as is\r\n\r\nbeing adopted in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a professor from New Zealand a few days ago mentioned the shortage of doctors in Singapore. This confirms what I have told the Minister, that there is a shortage of doctors in the Singapore General Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson that we are short of doctors.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when I made my speech last year, I did say\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking his first point, when talking about the\r\n\r\nresignation of specialists, he has asked what  will\r\n\r\nhappen after that? Following the resignation  of  a\r\n\r\nspecialist,  the  next  most  senior   officer   is\r\n\r\nimmediately  appointed to act  in  the  post.  This\r\n\r\nperiod is necessary to enable this officer to carry\r\n\r\nout  the duties of the specialist and to enable the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to assess his suitability for  promotion.\r\n\r\nPromotion exercises are held about twice a year, as\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission is not in a position\r\n\r\nto  hold  them  more frequently. Furthermore,  time\r\n\r\nmust  be  allowed for officers who were  considered\r\n\r\nnot suitable in the earlier promotion exercises  to\r\n\r\nprove their worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also mentioned some\r\n\r\ndoctors who have been made to work from 82  to  119\r\n\r\nhours.  Though I agree that some of them have  been\r\n\r\nasked  to work long hours, I think 119 hours  is  a\r\n\r\nbit  of an exaggeration. If we divide 119 by seven,\r\n\r\nwe get 17 hours. I do not think that it is possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor any doctor to work 119 hours a week. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  is  quite  obviously a prima  facie  case  of\r\n\r\nexaggeration. However, may I say that a  survey  of\r\n\r\nthe  working  hours of doctors was carried  out  in\r\n\r\nAugust 1969. It showed that they were on duty  from\r\n\r\n42  hours  to  a maximum of 86 hours  a  week.  The\r\n\r\nmatter  was looked into and in August 1970,  on  my\r\n\r\ninstruction, a circular was issued to all heads  of\r\n\r\ndepartments   to  the  effect  that  whenever   the\r\n\r\nexigencies   of  the  service  permitted,   medical\r\n\r\nofficers on night duty in a clinical unit should be\r\n\r\ngiven half a day off the next day. The position  up\r\n\r\nto the beginning of this month showed that this was\r\n\r\nbeing  implemented  in 16 out of  the  23  clinical\r\n\r\nunits of the hospital services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I just say something about the number of\r\n\r\nmedical  officers  who  are  now  working  in   the\r\n\r\nhospitals?  In August 1970, the number  of  medical\r\n\r\nofficers  in  service was 248 and  on  15th  March,\r\n\r\n1971,  the  figure  was  261.  There  has  been  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  13 medical officers. In view  of  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the staffing position, instructions\r\n\r\nhave  been  issued that with effect  from  15th  of\r\n\r\nMarch  this  year,  all medical  officers  who  are\r\n\r\nrequired to perform night duty will be given a half-day off the following day. This would result in the\r\n\r\nreduction of the total number of hours of  duty  by\r\n\r\ndoctors  by about four hours per week if an officer\r\n\r\ndoes  one  night duty per week, and by about  eight\r\n\r\nhours  per week if an officer does night duty twice\r\n\r\nper week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the nurses, I agree again with the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that the student nurses - I do not\r\n\r\nknow why the Member has picked on student nurses  -\r\n\r\nshould be properly trained and should be courteous,\r\n\r\nin  fact, they are properly trained. I can say that\r\n\r\nthe  majority of them are courteous to the  public.\r\n\r\nNot only student nurses but, in fact, all grades of\r\n\r\nthe nursing staff are taught to be courteous at all\r\n\r\ntimes  with  the patients, with the  public,  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and their seniors, and  this  has  been\r\n\r\nemphasised throughout their training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod as well as in circulars and so on.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson will agree with me that  in  any\r\n\r\norganisation  there  are bound  to  be  some  black\r\n\r\nsheep.  I believe he will also agree with  me  that\r\n\r\nthere are black sheep among postmen. That being the\r\n\r\ncase,  we have devised a method whereby all members\r\n\r\nof  the  staff of the hospitals have been asked  to\r\n\r\nwear  a  name tag and, if there are any complaints,\r\n\r\nto  let us have them. Has the Member for Anson  any\r\n\r\ncomplaints about the student nurses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

I do not know  how  he\r\n\r\nviews it to be like a market. I agree with him that\r\n\r\nthe  building is quite old. We always  welcome  new\r\n\r\nbuildings, but so long as we have none, we have  to\r\n\r\nmake the most of what buildings we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member mentioned the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nnational  health service. In other words, he  wants\r\n\r\nus  to bring private practitioners also within  the\r\n\r\nhealth  service. May I say that at the  moment  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Health  has  about  27   outpatient\r\n\r\ndispensaries,  and  they are  providing  a  service\r\n\r\nparticularly to the low-income group, and I can say\r\n\r\nthat  the  service is adequate. Therefore,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment we are not considering utilising the doctors\r\n\r\nin  private practice and introducing a U.K. type of\r\n\r\nnational health service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Anyway, I do not want  to  prolong\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards student nurses, the Minister has asked\r\n\r\nme  whether I have complaints to make.

With    our     expanding\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  the  question   of   industrial\r\n\r\nhealth has to be scrutinised more and more.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that we may at some future date  want  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the services of industrial nurses  in  the\r\n\r\nfactories  in  Jurong, and for that purpose  I  ask\r\n\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  Ministry of Health does  not  have  a\r\n\r\nformal  course  in our School of  Nursing  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining of industrial health nurses. The reason is\r\n\r\nthat  this  subject  is  a very  new  one  and  the\r\n\r\ntraining of nurses in industrial health has  to  be\r\n\r\nundertaken   overseas.  In  the   initial   period,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the  Ministry will be sending  one  staff\r\n\r\nnurse  some  time  this  year  to  be  trained   in\r\n\r\nindustrial  health nursing at the Royal College  of\r\n\r\nNursing in London.

As  a  result,\r\n\r\nthey are unable to adjust themselves and to come to\r\n\r\nterms with the tremendously increased pressure  and\r\n\r\nchanged  circumstances of a  modern  society.  This\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  the sad story behind the  statistics\r\n\r\nsupplied  by the Minister for Health to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong  yesterday. It will be  seen  that  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of people who sought psychiatric  help\r\n\r\nhas  gone up from 28,431 in 1968 to 39,847 in 1970.\r\n\r\nThese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  patients who attended the outpatient  clinics.\r\n\r\nThe increase is definitely quite frightening.

It is not correct to say that there is only one\r\n\r\npsychiatrist who is working in Woodbridge Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we  have three consultant psychiatrists.\r\n\r\nThey  are  the  person who is  noted  down  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates as Psychiatrist (Grade G), referred to by\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Jalan  Kayu,  and  the   Medical\r\n\r\nSuperintendent and Deputy Medical Superintendent of\r\n\r\nWoodbridge   Hospital  who  are   also   consultant\r\n\r\npsychiatrists   and  are  doing   the   duties   of\r\n\r\nconsultant  psychiatrists.  In  addition  to  these\r\n\r\nthree,   we   have  three  senior   registrars   in\r\n\r\nWoodbridge  Hospital all of whom are in  possession\r\n\r\nof  the Diploma in Psychological Medicine and  are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, specialists in psychiatry, although  they\r\n\r\nhave not been appointed clinical consultants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that even this number of psychiatrists\r\n\r\nwill  not  be sufficient in the next few years.

This is one matter  which  I\r\n\r\nfeel  might  be due to the lack of supervision  and\r\n\r\npossibly  could be due to the shortage of staff  at\r\n\r\nthe Woodbridge Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the Member for Jalan  Kayu  has  not\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  modern  psychiatric  approach   of\r\n\r\ntreatment of patients. In fact, it is the policy of\r\n\r\npsychiatric  hospitals to have an open-door  policy\r\n\r\nwherein  patients are allowed a more open and  free\r\n\r\nenvironment  under supervision. This  more  natural\r\n\r\nenvironment  helps the patients in the  process  of\r\n\r\nrecovery. In many hospitals patients are encouraged\r\n\r\nto  run  their own wards and given the  freedom  to\r\n\r\nmove in and out.

The\r\n\r\nidea  behind  it  is  that in  their  natural  home\r\n\r\nsurroundings   they  should  get   better   faster.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there may be cases of relapse and so\r\n\r\non. May I just say that if a patient is known to be\r\n\r\nunpredictably  violent or shows  a  possibility  of\r\n\r\nviolence, he will be put in a more secure  ward.

It appears that the Health Ministry shirked\r\n\r\nits  responsibilities by putting the blame on a man\r\n\r\nwho  had  failed to practise personal hygiene,  and\r\n\r\nwho  had acted as a carrier of the disease, as  was\r\n\r\nreported  in  the newspapers recently.  I  consider\r\n\r\nthat  such  an accusation brings disrepute  to  the\r\n\r\nHealth  Ministry itself for trying to cover up  its\r\n\r\nfaults  regarding public cleanliness in this  area.\r\n\r\nThe  efforts of the Public Cleansing Department  in\r\n\r\nthe  Kampong  Ubi and Geylang Serai  constituencies\r\n\r\nwere  very  inefficient.  Refuse  was  allowed   to\r\n\r\naccumulate  and became stinking, while drains  were\r\n\r\nblocked.  The  residents of  these  two  areas  had\r\n\r\nplayed a useful role during the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep  Singapore Clean campaigns in 1969  and  1970,\r\n\r\nwith  the result that they are now imbued with  the\r\n\r\nspirit of cleanliness and it has become a household\r\n\r\nchore  to  clean  the environment of  their  homes.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is a matter for regret that the  Health\r\n\r\nMinistry cannot share this responsibility in regard\r\n\r\nto cleanliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister is aware that the\r\n\r\nconstruction of a new road from Sims Avenue,  which\r\n\r\nis   in   the   Geylang  Serai  and   Kampong   Ubi\r\n\r\nconstituencies up to Jalan Eunos, has  resulted  in\r\n\r\nseveral  drains being blocked. If the  Minister  is\r\n\r\naware of the consequences after a flood, what steps\r\n\r\nand  measures can be taken by the Public  Cleansing\r\n\r\nDepartment to overcome this hardship? I am sure the\r\n\r\ntyphoid  carrier contracted the disease by accident\r\n\r\nof  circumstances,  but up to  date  no  conclusive\r\n\r\nevidence has been obtained. What ought to  be  done\r\n\r\nby  the Public Cleansing Department is to send  the\r\n\r\ncleansing  workers to take over the  responsibility\r\n\r\nof  maintaining a state of cleanliness in these two\r\n\r\nareas and, at the same time, clear the drains which\r\n\r\nhave been choked in consequence of the road project\r\n\r\nnow  in progress. This should be done daily and not\r\n\r\nonce  or twice a year, which has hitherto been  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  the  Public Cleansing  Department  in\r\n\r\nrespect of these constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I refer\r\n\r\nfirst to the rather blatant statement by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang Serai who attributed all the blame  of\r\n\r\nthe  typhoid  outbreak to the  Health  Ministry.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve he must have followed the correspondence in\r\n\r\nthe  Berita Harian where my officer put  the  facts\r\n\r\nquite clearly.

From\r\n\r\nwhat  the doctors told me - it was not told  to  me\r\n\r\njust for the sake of trying to exculpate themselves\r\n\r\nfrom  blame,  but  as  a result of  bacteriological\r\n\r\ntests which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad been carried out and from the evidence gathered\r\n\r\n-  it was quite conclusive that the major factor in\r\n\r\nthe  outbreak was a break-down of personal hygiene,\r\n\r\nand not the unsanitary conditions of the drains and\r\n\r\nso on. This outbreak was the result of transmission\r\n\r\nof the disease through food. In other words, it was\r\n\r\ntransmitted  by carriers. In fact,  this  has  been\r\n\r\nborne  out  by  the  fact  that  one  carrier,  who\r\n\r\nhappened  to  be  a hawker selling ice-drinks,  was\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the people who had  bought  drinks\r\n\r\nfrom  him  going down with typhoid,  and  they,  in\r\n\r\nturn,  infected  their families and friends.  These\r\n\r\nvictims  had  informed the Ministry officials  that\r\n\r\nthey  had bought drinks from this man. It is  quite\r\n\r\nclear  that this outbreak of typhoid was the result\r\n\r\nof poor personal hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I may explain what I mean by personal\r\n\r\nhygiene.  It  means that you must wash  your  hands\r\n\r\nwhen  you handle prepared food and before  you  eat\r\n\r\nit.  Not only that, you must cover any exposed food\r\n\r\nor drinks from flies around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true to say that the Health Ministry has\r\n\r\nbeen shirking its duties. It has been carrying  out\r\n\r\nits  duty of removing the refuse in that area.  But\r\n\r\nmay I say that if there is refuse in the drains  it\r\n\r\nis  also  the  fault of the residents of  the  area\r\n\r\nbecause, as the Member for Geylang Serai will know,\r\n\r\nin  our Keep Singapore Clean campaigns, the message\r\n\r\nwas  that refuse should be thrown into dustbins and\r\n\r\nnot  into drains. If there is refuse in the drains,\r\n\r\nwhose fault is it? Of course, it is the duty of the\r\n\r\nMinistry's workers to collect the refuse  from  the\r\n\r\ndrains, but whose fault was it that, from the  very\r\n\r\nbeginning,  refuse  was  thrown  into  the  drains?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Member for Geylang Serai  may  answer\r\n\r\nthat  simple question. Also, we have been  informed\r\n\r\nthat  the  residents  did  allow  the  children  to\r\n\r\ndefecate into the drains. Again, there was evidence\r\n\r\nthat  many  of the lavatories - this is the  bucket\r\n\r\nsystem  of lavatory which we find is unsatisfactory\r\n\r\n-  was  not  in a good state. Does the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  say that the Health  Ministry  must\r\n\r\nrepair these lavatories for the residents there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he mentioned the construction of the Sims\r\n\r\nAvenue  Expressway which he blamed as the cause  of\r\n\r\nflooding.  I  am afraid he has raised  this  matter\r\n\r\nunder  a  different subhead. It should be  under  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministry. There again, may  I  say  that\r\n\r\nthis is an area which is below the high-tide level.\r\n\r\nI  think  my  Ministry officials have stated  quite\r\n\r\nclearly that the only way to solve this problem  of\r\n\r\nflooding is to raise the whole area, because, as we\r\n\r\nknow, water flows from a high level to a low level.\r\n\r\nIt cannot flow from a low level to a high level. So\r\n\r\nif  the  land is below high-tide level, how do  you\r\n\r\nexpect it to flow? Is it the responsibility of  the\r\n\r\nHealth Ministry to see that water flows upward?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has said that the people in his\r\n\r\nconstituency  have co-operated with the  Government\r\n\r\nin  its  Keep Singapore Clean campaign. I  am  very\r\n\r\nglad  they  have done so. And he says that  because\r\n\r\nthey  have done so, they are now clean. We are  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that the residents are dirty or  have  poor\r\n\r\npersonal  habits. It needs only one, two  or  three\r\n\r\nhawkers who practise poor personal hygiene to cause\r\n\r\nan  outbreak  of typhoid, even though the  majority\r\n\r\npractise a high standard of personal hygiene.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  the  Ministry  has never  grown  tired  of\r\n\r\nreminding  the  people of Singapore that,  for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  their  own  health, a  high  standard  of\r\n\r\npersonal hygiene should be maintained. My officials\r\n\r\nhave told me that even though the surrounding areas\r\n\r\nare  insanitary,  if  a high standard  of  personal\r\n\r\nhygiene  is maintained by everybody, this  sort  of\r\n\r\noutbreak via carriers cannot occur. I believe  that\r\n\r\nour Chairman, who is a medical man, will be able to\r\n\r\nunderstand it even better. But that does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat the Health Ministry is neglecting its duty  to\r\n\r\nclear  the  rubbish. We do clear  it.  In  fact,  a\r\n\r\ncorrespondent  in one of the newspapers  says  that\r\n\r\nthe  place  is  much  cleaner now.  Of  course,  an\r\n\r\nargument can be raised that we only cleaned  it  up\r\n\r\nafter the outbreak. But if the Cleansing Department\r\n\r\nhas  not done its duty, did the Member complain  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health before? I did  not  receive\r\n\r\nany complaint from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the Member for Anson.

In  spite  of  the\r\n\r\ncleaning  of the city, these mosquitoes  are  still\r\n\r\nactive. I wonder how the Anti-Mosquito Unit  works.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister see to it that the Anti-Mosquito\r\n\r\nUnit  checks the breeding spots of mosquitoes  more\r\n\r\nthoroughly,  so  that  these  places  will  not  be\r\n\r\ninfested  with mosquitoes? I understand  there  are\r\n\r\nsome new spray machines available in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nperhaps  these  can be used to kill the  mosquitoes\r\n\r\nwherever they are found breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, first of all, may I\r\n\r\nthank the Member for saying that Singapore is  much\r\n\r\ncleaner  now.  May I also say that the  problem  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  will  be there so  long  as  there  are\r\n\r\npeople who breed mosquitoes in their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different types of mosquitoes. One of\r\n\r\nthem is the Aedes mosquito which causes dengue  and\r\n\r\nhaemorrhagic fevers. This species breeds in  water-bearing receptacles and other artificial containers\r\n\r\nin  the  homes,  which are often carelessly  thrown\r\n\r\ninto  the  garden or into the open. Since launching\r\n\r\nour Keep Singapore Clean and Mosquito Free Campaign\r\n\r\nin 1969, we have had some good results in the sense\r\n\r\nthat  the  number of haemorrhagic fever  cases  has\r\n\r\ngone  down. In 1968 the number of these  cases  was\r\n\r\n1,000 and in 1969 there were only 200 cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the spraying of drains to prevent the\r\n\r\nbreeding of mosquitoes, that is being done. But may\r\n\r\nI  say  this: Singapore is a tropical country,  and\r\n\r\nthe  climate is such that you may spray the  drains\r\n\r\nin  the  morning, but if it rains in the  afternoon\r\n\r\nall  the insecticide is really going down the drain\r\n\r\ninto  the canal. So as far as mosquito breeding  in\r\n\r\ndrains  is concerned, it is an engineering problem,\r\n\r\nas  there  must  be proper levels of  drainage,  in\r\n\r\nother words, water must flow from higher levels  to\r\n\r\nlower levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are  still using D.D.T. for  mosquito\r\n\r\ncontrol?

We are trying to go away from D.D.T. to\r\n\r\nanother type of oil, not only because D.D.T. is not\r\n\r\ngood  for  health, but because it  also  makes  the\r\n\r\nlarvae more resistant.

There are about  100  hawkers\r\n\r\ndoing  business  along Tai Thong Crescent,  by  the\r\n\r\nside  of  MacPherson Market. In the mornings  these\r\n\r\nhawkers  obstruct the flow of traffic,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible for vehicles to pass through  Tai  Thong\r\n\r\nCrescent.  This  problem has been  brought  to  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of the Hawkers Department a few years  ago,\r\n\r\nwith  the  request that they resite the hawkers  or\r\n\r\nallot them pitches near the market,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the backlanes and sidelanes and along one  side\r\n\r\nof  Tai  Thong Crescent. In this way they need  not\r\n\r\nlose  their livelihood, and the traffic  also  need\r\n\r\nnot  be  obstructed. From time to time  the  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir Citizens' Consultative Committee and I myself\r\n\r\nhave written to the Hawkers Department, and once to\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary about this problem, but\r\n\r\nwithout any result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry take steps to allot proper\r\n\r\nspaces  or pitches to these hawkers, and to  settle\r\n\r\nthis  matter  soon without causing any hardship  to\r\n\r\nthem?  From time to time the reason given  for  not\r\n\r\ntaking  action  to solve the problem  is  that  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department has priorities  and  that  this\r\n\r\ncase does not deserve first consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I brought up the hawker\r\n\r\nproblem  in the last budget debate, and I  have  to\r\n\r\nbring it up again today. In the cleared areas  when\r\n\r\nthe hawkers slightly obstruct the road, the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  takes legal action against  them.  But\r\n\r\nyou  find  that  no legal action is  taken  against\r\n\r\nhawkers  in  many areas which are still  uncleared,\r\n\r\nand  these hawkers make more profits and do not pay\r\n\r\nlicence  fees.  I  am  not  speaking  against   the\r\n\r\nofficials  concerned for not taking action  against\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers. All I am asking is that,  until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as the whole of the republic is considered  a\r\n\r\ncleared  area,  the  hawkers in the  cleared  areas\r\n\r\nshould  be  treated  more  leniently  as  they  are\r\n\r\nlegitimate hawkers, and they possess licences to do\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the hawker problem is\r\n\r\nquite  a  difficult one.

Although, as he has rightly said, we  have\r\n\r\npriorities,  he  can  be  sure  that  the   Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment will effect the resiting of the  hawkers\r\n\r\nat  Tai  Thong  Crescent in June 1971.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Department to resite them  into  a\r\n\r\nnewly  paved  back-lane and  sidelanes  around  the\r\n\r\nMacPherson Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Anson, he suggested\r\n\r\nsomething which quite astounded me. He said that no\r\n\r\naction  or  very  little  action  should  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  hawkers  in  a  cleared  constituency.  My\r\n\r\nrational mind says that if you clear a constituency\r\n\r\nof  hawkers and resite them properly, you must  not\r\n\r\nallow other unlicensed hawkers to take the place of\r\n\r\nthose who have been resited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In order to get the facts  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  my  argument, I have personally  made\r\n\r\ninquiries  into  the increase in  prices  of  daily\r\n\r\nnecessities. Let me quote the prices of the items obtaining in the past and compare them with  those\r\n\r\nobtaining  in January 1971. We all know  there  are\r\n\r\nseveral  items of daily necessities.  Although  the\r\n\r\nprice  of rice has not gone up, the price of  bread\r\n\r\nhas  recently  been  increased.  Bread  can  be   a\r\n\r\nsubstitute for rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me mention the price of oil.\r\n\r\nFormerly, cooking oil cost $3.80 a tin. Now  it  is\r\n\r\n$4.20  a  tin. Salt now costs 15 cents  more.  Bean\r\n\r\nsauce  now  costs 90 cents per bottle. Formerly  it\r\n\r\nwas  80 cents per bottle. One tin of condensed milk\r\n\r\ncost 40 cents before. Now it is 45 cents per tin. A\r\n\r\nfive-katty tin of biscuits formerly cost $3.00. Now\r\n\r\nit  costs  $3.30 per tin. Lean meat cost $2.50  per\r\n\r\nkatty before. Now it is $3.30 per katty. There  are\r\n\r\nalso  other  imported  goods, for  example,  frozen\r\n\r\nbeef,  which formerly cost $2.60 per katty. Now  it\r\n\r\ncosts $4.40 per katty. This is quite a considerable\r\n\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just enumerating these few items to enable\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  and his Parliamentary  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  situation  better.  Perhaps   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance has not been very  careful  in\r\n\r\ncompiling  the  data. It may well be  that  it  has\r\n\r\ngathered the data from hearsay and, as a result, it\r\n\r\nis  not well informed. The increases in prices have\r\n\r\na  great influence on our people, especially  those\r\n\r\nin  the lower income group. Take, for instance,  an\r\n\r\nemployee  working  in  a  small  office  earning  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  salary  of $200 and with  many  mouths  to\r\n\r\nfeed. His livelihood will be made very difficult as\r\n\r\na  result of these increases in prices. Out of  the\r\n\r\n$200, he will have to spend $40 on house rent,  and\r\n\r\nin   addition  he  will  have  to  spend  money  on\r\n\r\neducation,   food   and  other   items   of   daily\r\n\r\nnecessities. How is he going to make ends meet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reason for the increase in prices in\r\n\r\nrecent  months? We should find out the real  reason\r\n\r\nso  that we can deal with this problem. I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will not take a cannot-careless attitude.\r\n\r\nOn  the contrary, he should take positive steps  to\r\n\r\nremedy  the  situation by curbing the  increase  in\r\n\r\nprices.  I  agree with the Minister  of  State  for\r\n\r\nFinance  when  he suggested that we should  form  a\r\n\r\nConsumers'  Association. A Consumers'  Association,\r\n\r\ncomprising people of the middle and lower  classes,\r\n\r\ncan  see to it that the merchants and traders  will\r\n\r\nnot  overcharge the prices of goods. In  this  way,\r\n\r\nthe  consumers  can bargain with  the  traders  and\r\n\r\nmaintain the prices of goods at a reasonable level.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the suggestion and I hope the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  will  take  steps  to  assist  in  the\r\n\r\nformation   of   a   Consumers'  Association.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Ministry of Finance can be  of  great\r\n\r\nassistance in the field of administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to suggest to the Minister that he\r\n\r\nshould  set up a Price Control Committee.  Although\r\n\r\nhe  may  say that he is not prepared to  do  so,  I\r\n\r\nwould like him to reconsider my suggestion, because\r\n\r\nI   think   a  Price  Control  Committee  is   very\r\n\r\nessential. This committee can be charged  with  the\r\n\r\nduty  of  not  only collecting data on prices,  but\r\n\r\nalso  determining whether or not certain  increases\r\n\r\nin  prices  are justified. The committee  can  also\r\n\r\ndeal  with  merchants  who  increase  their  prices\r\n\r\nunreasonably.   In  fact,  the   price   of   daily\r\n\r\nnecessities  does not depend on supply  and  demand\r\n\r\nonly.  Sometimes it is due to personal manipulation\r\n\r\nand other extraneous circumstances. For instance, a\r\n\r\nfew  weeks ago when Parliament was about to sit  to\r\n\r\ndebate  the  present budget, certain  irresponsible\r\n\r\nmerchants  spread  rumours among  the  people  that\r\n\r\ncertain  goods  would  be taxed  and  that  certain\r\n\r\ntinned   foodstuffs  would  also  be  taxed.   Even\r\n\r\nOvaltine and rice would be further taxed. All these\r\n\r\nrumours  caused fluctuations in the market  prices,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  prices of daily necessities.  Some\r\n\r\nirresponsible   merchants   made   use   of    this\r\n\r\nopportunity to increase the prices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  certain goods. If we can set up a Price Control\r\n\r\nCommittee   to   control  the   prices   of   daily\r\n\r\nnecessities and to supervise the market, the prices\r\n\r\nof  daily  necessities will  be  more  stable.  Our\r\n\r\npeople will be able to live a more stable life  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  be subject to the fluctuations  in\r\n\r\nmarket prices. I hope the Minister will consider my\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after going\r\n\r\nthrough the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for the current financial year,  I  find\r\n\r\nthat  I  am more confused about the actual staffing\r\n\r\nposition in the various Ministries and departments.\r\n\r\nLet  me  illustrate my point by  referring  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Labour,  for  example,   where   the\r\n\r\nincumbents  of  various  positions,  from  that  of\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary to those of executive officers,\r\n\r\nare  not substantive holders of the posts. They are\r\n\r\nmerely  acting in the posts. What is most  puzzling\r\n\r\nto  me is that some of them are acting in posts two\r\n\r\ngrades  above  their substantive grades.  If  these\r\n\r\nacting appointments were made for a short period of\r\n\r\ntime,  it would have been more understandable.  But\r\n\r\nthe  strange fact is that these acting appointments\r\n\r\nare  often of several months' duration and, without\r\n\r\nexaggeration, they may be said to be made for life.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation is obviously very unhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said of practically all the other\r\n\r\ndepartments in the Singapore civil service. Even in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance, I believe there are  more\r\n\r\n\"actors\" than substantive holders of the posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has many types of employees,\r\n\r\nnamely,  open-vote employees, temporary  employees,\r\n\r\nacting   employees,  officiating   employees,   and\r\n\r\nsupernumerary  employees. Open-vote  employees  are\r\n\r\nalso  known to be temporary. However, some of these\r\n\r\nopen-vote employees have been in service  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  30  years  and they are still  known  by  the\r\n\r\nnomenclature.  Temporary and officiating  employees\r\n\r\nare either acting for some other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincumbents,   who   themselves   are   acting    or\r\n\r\nofficiating for others or are officiating in  their\r\n\r\nown  right, but in both cases for long periods.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  we  have supernumerary posts  filled  by\r\n\r\npeople who have no business to be there at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can we expect the Ministry of Finance to\r\n\r\nstreamline   the   civil  service   so   that   all\r\n\r\nappointments are filled by permanent employees  who\r\n\r\nare  more likely to give better service, since  one\r\n\r\nof  the main grouses and frustrations of our  civil\r\n\r\nservants is that, although they may be good  enough\r\n\r\n\"actors\"  for  many years, they  are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nqualify  for the substantive appointments in  which\r\n\r\nthey  have  acted.  If they are  not  suitable  for\r\n\r\nsubstantive  appointments, it is not  fair  to  ask\r\n\r\nthem to act for long periods. Perhaps we should try\r\n\r\nto  induce more suitably qualified persons to apply\r\n\r\nfor  civil service appointments. The salary  scales\r\n\r\nfor  senior  civil  servants are not  competitively\r\n\r\nattractive and their working conditions leave  much\r\n\r\nto be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke about this aspect during the debate on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's financial policy statement, and I  was\r\n\r\nnot properly answered. A committee was set up on an\r\n\r\nad  hoc basis to revise the salary structure of the\r\n\r\nopen-vote  daily-rated employees. Another committee\r\n\r\nwas  set up to look into the salaries of the Police\r\n\r\nForce. And yet a third committee was set up to look\r\n\r\ninto   the   salaries  of  senior  civil  servants.\r\n\r\nYesterday  we were told by the Minister for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs that the salaries of the Fire Brigade staff\r\n\r\nand their terms and conditions of service will also\r\n\r\nbe  looked  into after they have settled  with  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force. The Ministry of Education  is  again\r\n\r\nlooking  into the salary structure of the teachers.\r\n\r\nAre  we  going to continue to look into the  salary\r\n\r\nstructures  and  working conditions  department  by\r\n\r\ndepartment?  I  believe it is high  time  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance gave sufficient thought to  the\r\n\r\nwhole structure of the civil service and drew up  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive programme for streamlining the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  in  respect  of the salary  structure  and\r\n\r\nworking  conditions if we are to have an  efficient\r\n\r\ncivil service.

The  reply  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education was that, as far as his\r\n\r\nMinistry  was concerned, they had already submitted\r\n\r\ntheir  proposals  to the Ministry of  Finance  some\r\n\r\ntime  in December last year. This is late March.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister for Finance when  we\r\n\r\ncan  expect an answer from his Ministry and whether\r\n\r\nhe  will  personally look into the matter. He  must\r\n\r\nexcuse me if I have got not much confidence in  the\r\n\r\ncivil servants of his Ministry for two reasons. One\r\n\r\nreason is that, as the Member for Telok Blangah has\r\n\r\npointed out, they are in acting capacities and  are\r\n\r\nnot  confident or competent enough to make  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  study and make sound judgments on some  of\r\n\r\nthe  proposals  that have been put forward  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. The other reason is  that  I\r\n\r\nmyself  have  personally  lost  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nmanner   in   which  the  Treasury  handles   civil\r\n\r\nservants'  problems with regard  to  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to illustrate my point, I quote the example\r\n\r\nof   one  teacher's  problem  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\nanomaly.  On 1st May, 1958, a new salary scale  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  for  teachers who  joined  the  service\r\n\r\nafter this date. This scale is inferior to the  old\r\n\r\nscale.  The  stipulation of the  Treasury  and  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry was that those who  joined  the\r\n\r\nservice after that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndate would be placed on the new scale and those who\r\n\r\nwere in the service before that date would get  the\r\n\r\nold  scale.  And today we have teachers who  joined\r\n\r\nthe education service before 1st May, 1958, and who\r\n\r\nwere  put on the new scale. This problem was raised\r\n\r\nwith  the  Education  Ministry  years  ago  by  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Unions and we received  a  reply  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the matter had been referred to the Treasury,\r\n\r\nbut up to now there has been no reply from the Trea\r\n\r\nsury.  This is one example to illustrate  my  point\r\n\r\nabout  the  very inefficient manner  in  which  the\r\n\r\nTreasury  is  handling some of the civil  servants'\r\n\r\nproblems  with  regard to terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to round off my request, I would seek the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance's personal attention  to  the\r\n\r\nteachers'  proposals  so that  the  matter  can  be\r\n\r\nexpedited.  He will appreciate that on the  1st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1970, the then Minister for  Education,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Pang Boon, made an announcement  inviting\r\n\r\nthe Teachers' Unions to negotiate with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education.  The first official meeting  was  on\r\n\r\n10th  October,  1970.  All that  the  teachers  are\r\n\r\nasking  for is some response to the proposals  that\r\n\r\nwere put forward at the meeting. Surely this is not\r\n\r\ntoo  much  to expect from the Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\nwhen   the   Ministry  of  Education  has   already\r\n\r\nsubmitted  its  recommendations  on  the  teachers'\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have the same feeling as the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nhas  in regard to the officials of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.  They are slow as snails in their  working\r\n\r\nefficiency.  I  hope  the  Minister  himself   will\r\n\r\nsupervise  them  and  ask  them  to  expedite   the\r\n\r\nquestion of teachers' salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister one question. When we were discussing  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  fisheries, the Minister for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development  said that  the  question  of\r\n\r\npioneer  status came under the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nand  not under his Ministry. I want to know why the\r\n\r\npioneer status for the deep-sea fishing industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  withdrawn. The Minister for Law and,  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has asked me to refer this  matter  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance. So I  am  taking  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to do so. I notice that in the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  budget  speech, he  mentioned  that  he\r\n\r\nwould encourage deep-sea fishing. If he intends  to\r\n\r\nencourage  it, why was the pioneer status  for  the\r\n\r\ndeep-sea fishing industry withdrawn?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hon, you have 10 minutes to\r\n\r\nreply to all the points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, because of the shortage of time, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  I  will  not  be able  to  answer  all  the\r\n\r\nquestions.

This is not\r\n\r\nbecause  I do not consider it important.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis is one of the many problems that we shall have\r\n\r\nto  consider during this year. Perhaps I should say\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Sembawang that I do not live  on\r\n\r\nfresh  air  and sunshine, and that I  also  consume\r\n\r\nsome of the commodities that he has mentioned, like\r\n\r\nrice, bread, oil, salt and so on.

We have not agreed to these increases.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the case of bread, the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  given that we  have  accepted  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in the price of bread is not correct.  We\r\n\r\nhave asked why there has been this increase, and we\r\n\r\nhave found that even if there is an increase in raw\r\n\r\nmaterials, it does not justify an increase of  five\r\n\r\ncents.  There  may be an increase in the  price  of\r\n\r\nflour  which might justify a one-cent increase.  We\r\n\r\nare looking into all these matters and we shall try\r\n\r\nto do what we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I do not think we can accept\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of price control, because the experience\r\n\r\nof  people who lived with price control just  after\r\n\r\nthe   war  should  make  it  clear  that  this   is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the supply that is coming on to  the\r\n\r\nmarket at reasonable prices. But we will give  such\r\n\r\nhelp  as  we  can in the collection of  statistics,\r\n\r\nalthough there is some doubt about the figures that\r\n\r\nwe  produce. I think our inspectors in  the  market\r\n\r\nare  just  as  able to find out about  prices.  The\r\n\r\nTrade  Division  and  the  Singapore  Institute  of\r\n\r\nStandards  and Industrial Research will  look  into\r\n\r\nthe  quality  and nature of the materials  that  go\r\n\r\ninto the finished products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come to the matter of the civil\r\n\r\nservice. I am in some sympathy with the Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah when he says he is confused  by  the\r\n\r\nmany appointments - acting, officiating, temporary,\r\n\r\nsupernumerary, etc. These, of course, are not there\r\n\r\nbecause  we  like to confuse Members or  ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut  they  are  just the result  of  a  very  rapid\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of civil servants. In  fact,\r\n\r\n50  per  cent  of the administrative officers  have\r\n\r\nless   than   three   years'  service.   They   are\r\n\r\nprobationers.  In  the  circumstances,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible for the posts to be filled by officers who\r\n\r\nhave  the  requisite experience and qualifications.\r\n\r\nIn  1959, our civil service had 1,255 Division  One\r\n\r\nposts. Today there are 3,907 Division One posts, an\r\n\r\nincrease of more than three times, and we  are  not\r\n\r\nable to keep up with the expansion of the services.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have  had  to  resort   to   acting\r\n\r\nappointments.  Where  these appointments  are  more\r\n\r\nthan  two grades higher, then the persons who  fill\r\n\r\nthem are said to be officiating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supernumerary appointments are, of course,\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Under  various circumstances,  officers\r\n\r\ngoing on very long leave or going on leave prior to\r\n\r\nretirement, or officers who are understudying other\r\n\r\nofficers   before  taking  over  the  duties,   and\r\n\r\nofficers  in excess of requirements naturally  will\r\n\r\nhave  to be shown in the estimates, especially when\r\n\r\nthey  go  off  on national service.  These  various\r\n\r\ndesignations are there because there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  need  to  show  them  as such,  rather  than  as\r\n\r\npermanent  officers. Of course, we  would  like  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  civil service filled with officers of  the\r\n\r\nright    quality   and   calibre   in   substantive\r\n\r\nappointments, and we are trying our best to do what\r\n\r\nwe can to train our civil servants so that they can\r\n\r\nbe fully qualified for their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the salary scales and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice and their determination, this is one of the\r\n\r\nimportant matters we have to look into in order  to\r\n\r\nget a full complement of substantive holders of the\r\n\r\nposts,  and  we  will  give  consideration  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  salary  scales.  Consideration  of   these\r\n\r\nscales  is  being  done.  In  fact,  it  has   been\r\n\r\nmentioned  that we are looking into the  scales  of\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers, the Police  Force,  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  and so on. So some action is being  taken,\r\n\r\nperhaps not as fast as the Members would like us to\r\n\r\ntake,  but we are looking into these salary scales.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of  the shortage of staff  which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, and the fact that we do not always  have\r\n\r\npeople in the grades doing the work of looking into\r\n\r\nthe  salary  scales,  I think  our  civil  service,\r\n\r\ninstead of being criticised, ought to be given some\r\n\r\npraise for the work that they are doing and for the\r\n\r\nvery large amount of overtime which they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Ministry of Education and the\r\n\r\nteachers'  proposals, this is not  something  which\r\n\r\nhas been set aside. I hope that after consideration\r\n\r\nof  the budget has been gone through, we shall  get\r\n\r\nin touch with the Ministry of Education and come to\r\n\r\nsome  arrangement  on the new salary  scales  which\r\n\r\nhave been under examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked why fisheries are not\r\n\r\npioneer  industries. The reason for this is  fairly\r\n\r\nsimple.  The fishing industry is really a very  old\r\n\r\nindustry, if not the oldest industry in the  world.\r\n\r\nIt   certainly  is  not  a  modern  industry,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we did not think that it was appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  it should come under pioneer status. We  wish\r\n\r\nto  encourage  fisheries. In fact,  we  make  large\r\n\r\namounts of finance available to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanyone  who  wishes to engage in deep-sea  fishing.\r\n\r\nThe   loans  which  have  been  approved   by   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank for some of the  industries  have\r\n\r\nbeen  to  the extent of 80 per cent of the cost  of\r\n\r\nthe assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I was not criticising the\r\n\r\ncivil service but the Ministry of Finance. Officers\r\n\r\nhave  been asked to act for umpteen years and  they\r\n\r\nare doing a good job. This is quite clear. I am not\r\n\r\ncriticising  the officers who are acting.  If  they\r\n\r\nare  found  to be suitable to act for a  number  of\r\n\r\nyears,  they should be found suitable to  hold  the\r\n\r\njob  substantively.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned,\r\n\r\nofficiating means somebody officiating a  marriage.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be a tremendous shortage  of  suitable\r\n\r\npersons in the civil service if officers are  asked\r\n\r\nto  officiate  two  steps above  their  substantive\r\n\r\nappointments. This shortage, as I mentioned earlier\r\n\r\nwhen  we  debated  the Minister's financial  policy\r\n\r\nstatement,  is  due to the fact  that  we  are  not\r\n\r\ngetting  the  appropriate persons  into  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,   as   we  are  not  offering  competitive\r\n\r\nsalaries  and  attractive terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.  Therefore,  my point  is  that  there  is\r\n\r\njustification  for  a  salary revision,  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  accepts, and as a result ad hoc  salary\r\n\r\nrevision  committees have been set  up  for  daily-rated  and senior civil servants, the Police Force,\r\n\r\nthe  Fire  Brigade and the teachers.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  accepts that the cause  for  revision  is\r\n\r\nthere. My point is, why not do it once and for  all\r\n\r\nfor  the  whole civil service instead of department\r\n\r\nby department and division by division?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in virtually\r\n\r\nevery  country  civil service salaries  lag  behind\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial salaries, even more so in\r\n\r\na  situation of very rapid development as  we  find\r\n\r\nourselves  in.  The danger that we  are  confronted\r\n\r\nwith  here  in  Singapore today  is  that  the  top\r\n\r\ncalibre personnel in the civil service may be drawn\r\n\r\naway towards the commercial and industrial sectors,\r\n\r\nleading to shortages of the kind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are  very serious indeed, namely,  top-level\r\n\r\npersonnel.  In  such  a situation,  there  are  two\r\n\r\nthings  which can be done. One is a quick  revision\r\n\r\nof   salary,  but  this  cannot  be   done   to   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  extent,  especially  in  the  present\r\n\r\ncontext  of  our general wage restraint policy  for\r\n\r\nindustry  and  the commercial sector as  well.  The\r\n\r\nother  possibility, taken in conjunction with  some\r\n\r\nrevision  of salary, is rapid promotion of  people.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  get away from the kind  of  mentality\r\n\r\nwhich  says that, because I took 20 years to become\r\n\r\na   Permanent  Secretary,  therefore  anybody   who\r\n\r\nbecomes a Permanent Secretary must take 20 years to\r\n\r\nget  up  there. Why cannot a person do it  in  five\r\n\r\nyears  or seven years if he has the ability and  is\r\n\r\nprepared to work hard? Let us change this  kind  of\r\n\r\nmentality. Promote people rapidly. If they have the\r\n\r\nability, put them up there. If you put them  in  an\r\n\r\nacting capacity for three months or six months  and\r\n\r\nthey  have shown themselves to be capable,  confirm\r\n\r\nthem  in their positions. I have argued on at least\r\n\r\ntwo  occasions for the upgrading of the quality  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service, especially in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nupper level and the professional staff. Our economy\r\n\r\nis  getting  more sophisticated, and  in  order  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  it, to comprehend it and to service  it\r\n\r\nadequately,   we   need  to  have   technical   and\r\n\r\nprofessional people to monitor and service industry\r\n\r\nand  commerce. In order to do this, we have  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay the price for people  with  these\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we pay Master's Degree holders two\r\n\r\nincrements  above the ordinary point of entry,  and\r\n\r\nfour  increments in respect of Ph.D.s. It seems  to\r\n\r\nme   that  it  is  just  ridiculous  to  give   two\r\n\r\nincrements  for a Master's degree and  four  for  a\r\n\r\nPh.D, degree,  because, first of  all,  there  are\r\n\r\nconsiderable earnings which a person has to give up\r\n\r\nwhen  he  pursues a Master's degree, which normally\r\n\r\ntakes  at least one year, if not two; and  a  Ph.D.\r\n\r\ndegree  takes  at  least two years,  if  not  four,\r\n\r\ndepending on which country he goes to. In addition,\r\n\r\nthere is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderable  effort behind the  acquisition  of  a\r\n\r\nhigher  degree. It also presupposes a certain  high\r\n\r\nenough  level of qualifications in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nbasic  degree. All things taken together, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nindication is that we need substantially more  than\r\n\r\ntwo   increments  for  the  Master's   degree   and\r\n\r\nsubstantially more than four increments for the Ph.\r\n\r\nD. degree, and also rapid promotion for both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, nobody cares very much\r\n\r\nfor the civil servants because they cannot run away\r\n\r\nfrom a department after having served there for  20\r\n\r\nto  25 years. The professional officers can all run\r\n\r\naway  because they can get higher salaries outside,\r\n\r\nbut   the   poor  junior  officers,  with  whatever\r\n\r\nsalaries  they receive, will have to remain  there.\r\n\r\nNow  legally  qualified  officers  also  come  into\r\n\r\nGovernment   service  and  therefore   long-service\r\n\r\npeople  have  difficulty in getting promotion.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance must consider  revising  the\r\n\r\nsalaries of the civil servants because they are the\r\n\r\nbackbone of the Government. If they work hard,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will also get a better name. Because the\r\n\r\npoor  civil servants cannot vent their grouses,  we\r\n\r\ntend  to leave them out.

I\r\n\r\nrequested the Ministry of Finance to take steps  to\r\n\r\nassist   in   the   formation   of   a   consumers'\r\n\r\nassociation, and the Minister of State for  Finance\r\n\r\nhimself mentioned this possibility. I think this is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  a very good thing to do. We would  like\r\n\r\nto set up a consumers' association to stabilise the\r\n\r\nprices  of  our  goods.

As  far  as  the\r\n\r\nacting appointments are concerned, and their  being\r\n\r\ndone   away   with,   this  is   not   within   our\r\n\r\ndispensation.  The  substantive filling  of  posts,\r\n\r\nespecially  the superscale posts, is a  matter  for\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission. Unless it considers\r\n\r\nthat   the   civil  servant  can  fill   the   post\r\n\r\nsubstantively,  the only course of  action  we  can\r\n\r\ntake  is  to  fill  it  on an acting  basis  or  an\r\n\r\nofficiating basis or a temporary basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to quick solutions to the civil\r\n\r\nservants' salaries, of course, it is very  easy  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that we should do this in a very rapid way.\r\n\r\nI  suppose the most rapid way is to give everyone a\r\n\r\n10  per  cent increase. On this basis, we can  then\r\n\r\nreally get rid of the committees inquiring into the\r\n\r\nsalary  scales of daily-rated workers,  the  senior\r\n\r\ncivil  servants and the staff of the Fire  Brigade!\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we should take some of the blame  for  not\r\n\r\ndealing  with these matters as rapidly as possible,\r\n\r\nbut I suppose the test of any Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nor any of his officials, is whether or not they are\r\n\r\naccused  of  giving in too easily to  requests  for\r\n\r\nsalary increases!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa suggested that it would be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to give salary increases for a  Master's\r\n\r\ndegree  and a Ph. D. degree beyond the two to  four\r\n\r\nincrements that have already been conceded. On this\r\n\r\npoint,  we  must  consider not  whether  the  paper\r\n\r\nqualifications  are a Master's, a  Ph.  D's  or  an\r\n\r\nHonours  degree, but whether the applicant  or  the\r\n\r\npresent holder can fill the job, and on this  there\r\n\r\nis  no  other test than actual performance  of  the\r\n\r\njob. For quality in the civil service, it would  be\r\n\r\nvery  desirable that we should be able to pay civil\r\n\r\nservants  a  remuneration commensurate  with  their\r\n\r\nvalue,  but  the difficulty in dealing  with,  say,\r\n\r\n4,000  senior civil servants - that was the  figure\r\n\r\nof  Division One officers which I gave is  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot compete with the commercial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirms  which want only one or two officers and  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  pay  10 per cent above whatever  may  be\r\n\r\noffered  in the civil service. Even if we  increase\r\n\r\nthe senior civil servants' salaries by 20 per cent,\r\n\r\nthe  commercial firms can always up this by another\r\n\r\n20 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I do\r\n\r\nnot  think there is any question about it. This was\r\n\r\nthe decision of Members of Parliament here when the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission Ordinance was passed.  I\r\n\r\nstill think that however much we like to be able to\r\n\r\npromote the officers, the neutrality of the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  is something  which  we  still\r\n\r\naccept and would like to see continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Master's and Ph. D. degrees, it has been\r\n\r\nconsidered    that   two   and   four    increments\r\n\r\nrespectively would be sufficient, because it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  opinion whether or not we  are  getting\r\n\r\nenough  Ph.D.s. But we have quite a  number.  Those\r\n\r\nwhom  we send overseas on study courses, when  they\r\n\r\ncome back, are usually bound to the Government  for\r\n\r\nthree  or five, or even eight years in some  cases.\r\n\r\nOur  problem really is not to recruit them into the\r\n\r\nservice  but rather, after they have been recruited\r\n\r\ninto the service, to retain them in the face of the\r\n\r\nblandishments of commerce and industry. I say  that\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult because the private sector  can\r\n\r\nalways  pay a little bit more than whatever we  may\r\n\r\nwant  to pay them. The final test really is whether\r\n\r\nthe  man likes the administrative work in the civil\r\n\r\nservice  or whether he wants to go outside and  try\r\n\r\nhis  luck  in commerce and industry. Perhaps  there\r\n\r\nare  very big rewards obtainable there, but at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  there is the great risk that his  paper\r\n\r\nqualifications may not, after all, make him a  good\r\n\r\nindustrialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, on the question of\r\n\r\npassing   the   buck  with  regard   to   promotion\r\n\r\nexercises, I accept the explanation of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance that the buck has got to be passed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission, because it  is  the\r\n\r\nultimate authority in determining the promotion  of\r\n\r\nofficers. But there are other civil service matters\r\n\r\nwhich   the  Public  Service  Commission   is   not\r\n\r\nconcerned with, and the buck actually ends  at  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance. Therefore, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  is  responsible for, shall I say,  messing\r\n\r\nthings up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate my point, I will just quote an\r\n\r\nexample  of what happened in the Education service.\r\n\r\nNot  everybody  knows that there is a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nteachers,  but  everybody knows  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  graduate teachers.  Sometime  between\r\n\r\nadvertisements for teachers, graduates applied  for\r\n\r\nposts in the Education Ministry, and the reply  was\r\n\r\nthat  there  was no vacancy because  certain  civil\r\n\r\nservice  procedures had to be observed to determine\r\n\r\nthe  vacancies. I think it will take me a long time\r\n\r\nto  explain how they work. In fact, I myself do not\r\n\r\nquite  understand how they work. They have  a  one-track   mind.  This  is  just  to  illustrate   the\r\n\r\nridiculous  situation that exists.  You  know  very\r\n\r\nwell that there is a shortage of graduate teachers,\r\n\r\nand  yet  you get a reply saying that there  is  no\r\n\r\nvacancy.   And  they  quote  so  many   rules   and\r\n\r\nstipulations to prove that there is no shortage  of\r\n\r\nteachers.  This  proves the  point  that  when  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  is  clearly with  some  department,\r\n\r\nthey mess things up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come back to the other point which I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier but which was not answered,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is the stipulation laid down by the Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  (of  course, with  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry) that teachers who joined  on  or\r\n\r\nafter  1st  May, 1958 would receive a salary  scale\r\n\r\nlower  than  that given to those who joined  before\r\n\r\nthat  date.  The old salary scale is  much  better.\r\n\r\nThere  are  teachers who joined the service  before\r\n\r\n1st May, 1958, and so according to the stipulation,\r\n\r\nthey  should  get the old scale, but  instead  they\r\n\r\nwere  given the new scale. And when representations\r\n\r\nwere made to the Education Ministry, they said  the\r\n\r\nFinance   Ministry  was  responsible.  The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry in turn said the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry was responsible. This  went  on\r\n\r\nfor  years. What happens then to the teachers? This\r\n\r\nis  only one example  to show how helpless the civil \r\n\r\nservants are.  When they  want  to  seek  redress for their grievances in matters\r\n\r\nrelating to service conditions, I do not\r\n\r\nthink the Ministry of Finance can pass the buck to anybody else, \r\n\r\nbecause the buck ends there. I think this manner of handling problems \r\n\r\nrelating to service conditions and other matters has\r\n\r\nreach such a very unhealthy level\r\n\r\nthat a log of dissatisfaction and \r\n\r\nunhappiness is caused, apart from the poor salary scales of the civil service.\r\n\r\nI think it is because of this situation that civil servants are just not satisfied\r\n\r\nwith the answers they get for their\r\n\r\ngrievances. They get lost. They are\r\n\r\nhelpless. They do not know where to\r\n\r\ngo to. This passing of the buck from \r\n\r\none Ministry to the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\nconveniently ignores the civil servants'\r\n\r\nproblems. So unless the Finance Ministry takes the \r\n\r\nbuck and handles the\r\n\r\nproblems more intelligently - rather than with a one-track mind -\r\n\r\nI think such problems will never be solved. But \r\n\r\nif there is a more efficient and more intelligent manner of handling\r\n\r\ncivil service problems, many of the grievances will be removed, and there will be greater\r\n\r\ncontentment in the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, first of all, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhy the Ministry of Finance should be blamed even for\r\n\r\ngraduate teacher vacancies not being \r\n\r\nfilled. Quite obviously there are vacancies,\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Education, I \r\n\r\nbelieve, has made it quite clear that he cannot get\r\n\r\nenough teachers. And if the \r\n\r\nMember for Moulmein has got any \r\n\r\ngraduate teachers knocking at the door,\r\n\r\nI guarantee that they will be let in.\r\n\r\nThere will be no passing of the buck in\r\n\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the stipulation laid down by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education, I am afraid\r\n\r\nI do not know much about the circumstances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin which the old and the new salary  scales\r\n\r\nwere  formulated.  But  if it  will give him any satisfaction, I will look  into\r\n\r\nthis  and see whether it is the Ministry of  Finance  that  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, will Minister consider\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a Personnel Department to look after the interests\r\n\r\nof  the civil  servants,  as  this  will  prevent  the  passing  of  the\r\n\r\nbuck?  This  is important, because I have noticed \r\n\r\nfrom the civil service structure in the Ministry of Finance \r\n\r\nthat  there is only one Executive Officer (I think  he  is\r\n\r\nacting  as  Higher Executive Officer) looking after the interests\r\n\r\nof about 13,000 daily-rated employees. The civil servants do\r\n\r\nnot  know where to  take  their problems to. If they take them to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned, they  are asked to refer to the Ministry of Finance, and they  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whom they  should  approach there. I think it is about time the\r\n\r\nGovernment prevented  further frustrations of the \r\n\r\ncivil servants and set  up a  Personnel Department in the Ministry of Finance \r\n\r\nto look into the  problems\r\n\r\nof the numerous  civil servants that we have. Will \r\n\r\nthe Minister consider the possibility of setting up such a department?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I think the Member for Telok Blangah is not really aware\r\n\r\nof  the  organisation  of the civil service. Surely\r\n\r\nwe   have   a   Personnel Department; in  fact,  it\r\n\r\nis    the   Establishment Branch of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance,     and      the Permanent Secretary is in\r\n\r\ncharge.  He has a  number of  Deputy Secretaries in\r\n\r\ncharge     of     service conditions.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nCareer   and  Development Officer  whom we recently\r\n\r\nappointed to take  charge of  the training of civil\r\n\r\nservants.  The   question which   has  been   asked\r\n\r\nabout      the     Higher Executive   Officer    in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the  Training Centre  -  I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether this is the  same matter - but anyway I can\r\n\r\ncategorically assure  the Member that the Personnel\r\n\r\nDepartment and  personnel matters  are  not   being\r\n\r\nhandled    at   Executive Officer     or     Higher\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance when was the  last  time\r\n\r\nthat rules and regulations governing the terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of the entire civil service were revised\r\n\r\nor  overhauled? It seems to me that some  of  these\r\n\r\nrules  must be out-dated. Although they were  meant\r\n\r\nto  prevent  abuses and so on, they do,  in  actual\r\n\r\nfact,  considerably tie the hands of  the  brighter\r\n\r\npeople, people with more entrepreneurial energies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, on the question of the\r\n\r\nPersonnel  Department, it is true  that  there  are\r\n\r\npersons  or  bodies  in  this  department  handling\r\n\r\npersonnel matters and so on. But I think it is  not\r\n\r\nso   much  a  question  of  bodies  handling  these\r\n\r\nproblems, but the approach adopted by the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia, what do you mean by\r\n\r\n\"bodies\"? Do you mean human beings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Persons, yes. The Minister\r\n\r\nreplied  to  my  colleague, the  Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah,  that there is such a department with  the\r\n\r\nPermanent   Secretary   in   charge,   and   Deputy\r\n\r\nSecretaries and so on. It is accepted. But I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  the  manner  of  handling  these  personnel\r\n\r\nproblems.  And  as  has  been  pointed  out  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member for Whampoa,  some  of  the\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations are obsolete. I think  there\r\n\r\nshould   be  some  adoption  of  modern  management\r\n\r\ntechniques, personnel relationship. I suggest  that\r\n\r\nwe follow some of the private firms where they have\r\n\r\nmuch  less  employees, and they adopt very  modern,\r\n\r\nclose   personnel   relations,   human   relations,\r\n\r\nabsolutely important, not bureaucratic, impersonal.\r\n\r\nI  was told that in the civil service they are just\r\n\r\ndigits -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Bodies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Bodies. I think it is a\r\n\r\nmatter of revamping the whole set-up and adopting a\r\n\r\nnew  approach  in  keeping  with  the  progress  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, this is an important\r\n\r\nissue.  Fortunately for me, Sir, I have dealt  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance on grievances  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  daily-rated  employees,  the  lot.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  is  right  - they have  an  Establishment\r\n\r\nBranch  where a Deputy Secretary, who is in  charge\r\n\r\nof  so  many  other matters, is also in  charge  of\r\n\r\npersonnel problems. When I said that there is  only\r\n\r\nan  Executive  Officer, acting as Higher  Executive\r\n\r\nOfficer, who handles the problems of 13,000  daily-rated  employees, I meant it, Sir. That is a  fact.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not  have a Personnel Department  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance as such. The Estimates  do  not\r\n\r\nprovide  for  it.  But there  are  persons  in  the\r\n\r\nEstablishment Branch who, when grievances are taken\r\n\r\nup,  deal with them. As the Member for Moulmein has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  what  we want is a  department  that\r\n\r\nlooks after nothing else but this, and a department\r\n\r\nwhich  has sufficient people to handle the  day-to-day  problems  that  arise in such  a  large  civil\r\n\r\nservice   as  ours,  perhaps  even  to  match   the\r\n\r\npersonnel departments in the private sector. In the\r\n\r\nlong run, Sir, this will be a worthwhile investment\r\n\r\non  the part of the Government in that it will have\r\n\r\na  less  frustrated civil service. Although it  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  possible  to remove all the  frustrations,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  could  have  a less  frustrated  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> The human touch!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> First of all.
