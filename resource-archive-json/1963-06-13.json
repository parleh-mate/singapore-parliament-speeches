The efficiency and work of  this\r\n\r\ndepartment  have a very great effect on the future  and\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of the people. We see that the  expenditure\r\n\r\nof  this  department for this year is the same as  that\r\n\r\nfor  last  year. Its duties and tasks in the past  have\r\n\r\nbeen of great concern to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, I also said that in the rural areas,\r\n\r\nthere are many bridges, roads and drains which are in a\r\n\r\nvery  bad  condition. Weeds are also  found  along  the\r\n\r\nroadside. The P.W.D. should not neglect its maintenance\r\n\r\nand  repair work. We have not seen it carrying out  its\r\n\r\nduties  in  the past year. In order that the roads  and\r\n\r\ndrains   in  the  rural  areas  can  be  repaired   and\r\n\r\nmaintained, the people in these areas must  first  wait\r\n\r\nfor  the Prime Minister to visit them. I have facts  to\r\n\r\nback  up  what  I  say. Now all this  has  aroused  the\r\n\r\ngrievance  of  the people. They have to  wait  for  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to visit them before work can be carried\r\n\r\nout  by  the P.W.D. The impression is created that  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  roads  and  the  building  of   social\r\n\r\namenities  in the rural areas is at the convenience  of\r\n\r\nthe   Prime   Minister.  This  shows  the  bureaucratic\r\n\r\npractice of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the bridges and roads in the rural areas are very necessary for the people and they should be properly looked after by the P.W.D. If they are damaged or they are in a bad condition, this will have a great effect on the livelihood of the rural folks. If the roads are bad and the bridges are not kept in a\r\n\r\nstate  of repair, the eggs and agricultural produce  of\r\n\r\nthese people will not find their way to the market  and\r\n\r\nthis will result in a great loss for them. In the past,\r\n\r\nthe drains and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrivers  in  the rural areas were looked  after  by  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. every two or three months, but now this work  is\r\n\r\nhanded  over to the Work Brigade which is not  carrying\r\n\r\nout  the work of regular maintenance done in the  past.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can see lallang and weeds everywhere  and\r\n\r\nsome areas are flooded after rain, and, as a result  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  people  in the rural areas  suffer  a  loss\r\n\r\nbecause  their vegetables are destroyed. Obviously  the\r\n\r\nduties  of  the  P.W.D. are very  important,  but  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  National  Development  has   not   paid\r\n\r\nattention to the work of this department. He has handed\r\n\r\nover  this  sort of work to the Work Brigade  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  carried out the work which should have  been\r\n\r\ndone,  thus  causing unnecessary losses  to  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.  I am of the opinion that since the expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  this department for this year is the same as  that\r\n\r\nfor  last  year, the Government should  carry  out  its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to  the rural  people,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of roads, drains and bridges as it has done\r\n\r\nin  the  past.  In this way, the rural people  will  be\r\n\r\ngreatly helped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, as usual the Member for Choa Chu Kang is\r\n\r\ntalking a lot of rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Head is Public Works, Recurrent. It concerns the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  repair of Government offices,  public\r\n\r\nstreet light, roads, backlanes, drainage, sewerage  and\r\n\r\nother services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then brings up the Prime Minister's visits\r\n\r\nto  constituencies.  He says that the  Government  does\r\n\r\nwork  only  after the Prime Minister has visited  these\r\n\r\nconstituencies. [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the work of construction and development,\r\n\r\nwhether  in  the city or rural areas, goes on  all  the\r\n\r\ntime.  The  Member  knows it.  But  he  comes  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  haranguing, hoping that  the  people  outside\r\n\r\nwill  believe what he says. But I think in general  the\r\n\r\npeople  out-side  already  have  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nproperly  assessed.  They know that  these  people  yap\r\n\r\nrubbish.  They  do nothing in their own  constituencies\r\n\r\nand they harp on \"only when the Prime Minister goes  to\r\n\r\nthe urban constituencies that things are done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the work of development in the rural areas goes\r\n\r\non  all the time. For the information of the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang, in the rural areas from  1962  to  May\r\n\r\n1963,  we  spent $784,460 on laying 173 standpipes  and\r\n\r\nalso making water supply available to Pulau Tekong.  We\r\n\r\nalso  spent  $2,492,000 supplying rural electrification\r\n\r\nschemes  for  33 kampongs. We also lit up  100  kampong\r\n\r\nroads,  spending $240,186. We lit up 68 public  streets\r\n\r\nat a cost of $455,195.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also made up 194 kampongs and access roads to the\r\n\r\ntune of $1,125,318 for the making up of these roads.  I\r\n\r\nwould  not have brought this up if the Member for  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang had not brought up the idea that we  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing  anything  for the people of Singapore.  Although\r\n\r\nthis  is a Head which concerns only maintenance, he  is\r\n\r\ntalking about development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned something about the Work Brigade\r\n\r\ndoing  the  work  of the P.W.D. It  is  true  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade has taken over certain functions of the P.W.D.,\r\n\r\nlike  grass  cutting, desilting drains  and  all  these\r\n\r\nthings.  But what these people from the Barisan benches\r\n\r\never  since we had this Budget sitting have been trying\r\n\r\nto  say is that we do not do anything for the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and that it is only when the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nvisits  the place that we are doing something  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.  If they  were  in  their  right\r\n\r\nsenses, they would not have been saying such things.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Member for Choa Chit Kang get his head\r\n\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this Head 24 concerns  the  maintenance\r\n\r\nfees  of  public  works. This Public Works,  Recurrent,\r\n\r\nexpenditure  should  be  spent  on  the  repairing  and\r\n\r\nmaintaining of roads and drains. However, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development has said that we the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members have not been working on our own. This\r\n\r\nproblem  will cause no surprise. As far as  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department work is concerned, the P.A.P.'s policy\r\n\r\nis  to  classify  the  works into  several  categories.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is whether the area concerned belongs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the Ministers' constituencies. If it is so, then if\r\n\r\nthere is any complaint, undoubtedly the Government will\r\n\r\nhave the work done in that constituency. Next comes the\r\n\r\nconstituencies of the Parliamentary Secretaries.  If  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary and a Minister apply  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  work to be done, of course, the priority will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  application of the Minister.  Thus  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary comes next. The third  category\r\n\r\nare  the  Back-benchers, and there are also first-class\r\n\r\nand  second-class  Backbenchers.  Those  who  are  more\r\n\r\nobedient  are  classified  as first-class  Assemblymen.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are querulous or quarrelsome are classified\r\n\r\nas  second-class  lack-benchers. So in  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments there are four categories of services. Even\r\n\r\nin the Government departments there are four classes of\r\n\r\nwork.  So if the people want any drains or roads to  be\r\n\r\nrepaired  or  maintained or any  street  lights  to  he\r\n\r\ninstalled, they have to go to the Minister. If they  go\r\n\r\nto the Minister, then the work can be done. They should\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  Minister first. If they  cannot  find  the\r\n\r\nMinister,   then  they  must  find  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary.   If  they  cannot  find  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  they  must  go  to  the  first-class  Back-benchers;  and then comes the last. If they go  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Assemblymen, they will not  have  any\r\n\r\nhope  of  having the work done, because the application\r\n\r\nwill be thrown into the waste-paper basket. This is the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  P.A.P. That is why the  constituencies\r\n\r\nbelonging to our Assemblymen do not have any work done,\r\n\r\nbecause in the Government itself there are four classes\r\n\r\nof work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember before I left the P.A.P. I made an\r\n\r\napplication  that the areas in Market  Street  and  Tew\r\n\r\nChew   Street  should  have  their  roads  and  streets\r\n\r\nrepaired. I made the application in May 1961. At  first\r\n\r\nit  was  intended  to carry out the work.  But  when  I\r\n\r\nbecame  an Opposition Member this work was not  carried\r\n\r\nout.  No wonder the Minister was saying that we Barisan\r\n\r\nAssemblymen have no work to do, because, as far as  the\r\n\r\npeople are concerned, they have found out that even  in\r\n\r\nthe   Government  Party  there  are  four  classes   of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the people in Singapore wish to have some\r\n\r\nimprovement   in  their  life  and  in   their   social\r\n\r\namenities,  they must, first and foremost,  topple  the\r\n\r\nreactionary  and colonial stooge Government.

But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has discarded the Opposition Members as far\r\n\r\nas   public  works  are  concerned.  They  play   party\r\n\r\npolitics.

This is  because\r\n\r\nin  the  Government Party itself there are four classes\r\n\r\nof Assemblymen.

The allegation  made  by\r\n\r\nhim just now is that when applications were made for  a\r\n\r\ncertain job to he done, they were not approved and  the\r\n\r\nwork  was  not done. This is all rubbish. I  can  quote\r\n\r\nexamples  to  prove  that even work in  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers' constituencies has been carried out. It is not\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say  that only applications coming  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  constituencies are  approved  and  work  is\r\n\r\ncarried  out  there. While he made such allegations  he\r\n\r\nshould also substantiate them. According to him,  there\r\n\r\nare  certain  roads which need to he repaired  but  the\r\n\r\nrepair  has  not been done.

Actually it is this: because  they\r\n\r\nare  the Government, they know that if such work is  to\r\n\r\nbe done on a certain day of a certain week, they see to\r\n\r\nit  that before the work commences they go to that area\r\n\r\nand take a look.

But\r\n\r\nsince  several Members of the Barisan Sosialis opposite\r\n\r\nhave  repeatedly  mentioned the  visits  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, I feel that, as a responsible Member  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Ministry of the Prime Minister, it is\r\n\r\nproper for me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the debate on this Head, this question of\r\n\r\nvisits   of   the   Prime   Minister   to   the   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies has been repeatedly mentioned. To  them,\r\n\r\nthe  question is like an atom bomb, because it  exposes\r\n\r\nthe dirt of the Barisan Sosialis to the rural folks.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose who deliberately close their eyes can fail to see\r\n\r\nthe achievements and projects that have been carried\r\n\r\nout in the rural constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of office of the P.A.P., we have\r\n\r\nestablished  the Urban and Rural Services  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee  which was previously headed  by  the  former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Prime Minister,  now  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  the Barisan Sosialis. Its members comprised\r\n\r\nthe Members for Choa Chu Kang, Toa Payoh. Changi. Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu - if I am not mistaken - and also I think the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Pasir Panjang. However, Mr Speaker, if  you  will\r\n\r\nperuse the minutes of the previous Committee, you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that,  at  the  time when  the  Barisan  Members\r\n\r\ndefected from the P.A.P. not a single minute was handed\r\n\r\nto  the succeeding Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  When I took over from the Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  who went to Israel, I found that  standpipes\r\n\r\nwere  meant for Choa Chu Kang only. The Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang,  at  one time, was acting as a Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary.  As he then was, lie was trying to  cut  his\r\n\r\ncoat  to fall in with Members of the Government. I  can\r\n\r\nprove   that,  Mr  Speaker.  There  is  not  a  single\r\n\r\nconstituency  left out of the Government's  development\r\n\r\nprojects.  Perhaps when the Prime Minister  visits  the\r\n\r\nrural  constituencies,  he  will  be  informed  by  the\r\n\r\nconstituents  of  the  projects  or  achievements  made\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, I think the people know who are\r\n\r\nfond  of  twisting facts. Mr Speaker, forgive  me  for\r\n\r\nquoting  an  analogy.  If the  intent  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  had, the smell will be  detected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  because works and projects such  as  drainage,\r\n\r\nstandpipes,  have,  in fact, been carried  out.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible that some Members of the Barisan Sosialis have\r\n\r\napproached  the Director of Public Works with  requests\r\n\r\nto  get  work  done. It was wrong, because  we  have  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  this purpose, and they know  that  this\r\n\r\nCommittee is responsible for such work. So they  should\r\n\r\nchannel their applications to this Committee. As  Vice-Chairman  of  the Committee, I have never  received  an\r\n\r\napplication from Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis for requests to carry out rural work in  their\r\n\r\nconstituencies.   But  the  Member  for   Tanglin   has\r\n\r\nsubmitted an application for work to be carried out  in\r\n\r\nhis constituency. The Member for Kampong Kembangan, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Southern Islands and the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai too have submitted applications. But not a single\r\n\r\nrequest  has been received from Members of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  This clearly shows that they have  neglected\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the  people  whom  they  claim   to\r\n\r\nrepresent, because to date not a single application has\r\n\r\nbeen  received  by  the  Committee  from  them  to   do\r\n\r\nimprovement work in those constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  that  he is addressing the  Speaker?  He  is\r\n\r\npointing  in the wrong direction. I do not mind  if  he\r\n\r\npoints at the Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yaacob (In Malay): Mr Speaker, I want to speak\r\n\r\non  this  point which has been debated since yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan  claims that after the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\npaid  visits  to the constituencies that work  is  then\r\n\r\ncarried out. The purpose of the visits is to buy  votes - so  the Barisan claims. If I were to read in detail the\r\n\r\nprojects  that  have  been  implemented  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies  for  the  information  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, it will take a long time. If I am to  address\r\n\r\nmy  speech to people who are deaf, it will he the  same\r\n\r\nas  tuning  on  my  radio in full volume  for  them  to\r\n\r\nlisten, and it will still not have any effect on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to prove that the people welcome the visits of the Prime Minister, they themse1ves submit memoranda with recommendations for consideration by the Government. If the Prime Minister visits the rural constituencies, the people who welcome him do not comprise only members of the Work Brigade. If Members opposite are prepared to accompany the Prime Minister\r\n\r\non  his visits, I am prepared to invite them to see for\r\n\r\nthemselves  the livelihood of the people. The  fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not prepared to face the  constituents\r\n\r\nthemselves  because they have not done their  job.  For\r\n\r\nthat reason, the Prime Minister himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntakes the trouble to visit the rural constituencies  to\r\n\r\nface  the people so as to know their grievances. I wish\r\n\r\nto remind the Barisan Sosialis Members of the speech of\r\n\r\nPresident  Soekarno, \"As the father of the Republic  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia, all State machinery will be at my  disposal.\r\n\r\nWith  the  strength  of  the  State  machinery,  I  can\r\n\r\ninfluence thousands, nay, millions of people.

Most of the time the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister spent was in plotting how best he could\r\n\r\nfix  the Member for Hong Lim. The second year, he spent\r\n\r\na  lot  of time plotting how to fix Mr Lim Ching Siong\r\n\r\nand  the rest of us. This is one of the things they do.\r\n\r\nThey  are very active. They use police and other agents\r\n\r\nto  try  and  disrupt organisations  that  do  not  owe\r\n\r\nallegiance  to  the P.A.P. They spend  a  lot  of  time\r\n\r\ntrying  to  find ways and means of how  best  they  can\r\n\r\ndisrupt, for example, trade union organisations.  Aside\r\n\r\nfrom  activities like this, Sir, they build  roads.  We\r\n\r\nare not saying that they are not building roads. We are\r\n\r\nnot saying they do not build drains, improve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroads and undertake other development projects. What we\r\n\r\nsay,  in  the  first  place,  is  that  all  these  are\r\n\r\ninadequate.  That is our first point. I am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthe people agree with us that these are inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly is this immediate and recent concern the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has shown in the welfare of  the  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers. The Prime Minister became the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin June 1959. He did not go round the constituencies in\r\n\r\nJune  1959.  In June 1959 he did a victory  parade.  But\r\n\r\nafter, the whole of 1959, 1960) - no. When did he  start\r\n\r\nthese  so-called Prime Minister's visits to  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas? Only recently. The reason is obvious. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's visits are a political stunt to catch votes,\r\n\r\nand  I say the Government are dishonest if they do  not\r\n\r\nadmit this ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I  think  the\r\n\r\nallegation  now is that the rural complaints  have  all\r\n\r\nbeen  attended to, just because the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nvisited rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not want to reopen the debate. I just\r\n\r\nwant  to make this point because so much play has  been\r\n\r\nmade  of  this so-called desire of the Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  anxiety and concern of the Prime Minister over the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the rural dwellers - a concern that  did  not\r\n\r\narise  during the three years in office, but  has  only\r\n\r\narisen in recent months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we realise that right at the moment, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is paying extra concentration on  improving\r\n\r\nroads,   building  new  roads  and  other  construction\r\n\r\nprojects. We agree they pay greater concentration  now.\r\n\r\nThe  reason for this is very simple. The elections  are\r\n\r\naround  the  corner.  It  will be  remembered  that  in\r\n\r\n1957/1958, just before the last general elections,  the\r\n\r\nprevious government also concentrated on building roads\r\n\r\nand  more  roads,  more post offices,  schools,  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nflats ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is not what we said in the\r\n\r\nelection campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister, when he was on this\r\n\r\nside  of  the House just before the elections in  1959,\r\n\r\nhad  said  these  things.

But, however, Sir, some of the things that  he\r\n\r\nhas  been  saying, I think, call for some  reply.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  point he has been making  is  this.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has done a lot of good things. But it should\r\n\r\ndo  more. I agree with him. But what I want to know is:\r\n\r\nWhat  have  the Barisan Sosialis been doing?

For example, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is true that the Prime Minister and lots of us  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  catch  up with sonic other  work,  backlog,\r\n\r\nmainly because after the second year, we spent a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour time, nearly two years, fighting the Communists who\r\n\r\nwere  trying  to  sabotage  a  major  platform  in  our\r\n\r\nelection  programme-merger and  Malaysia.  The  greater\r\n\r\npart  of  two years which was vital to us was spent  in\r\n\r\ncombating   them,  stifling  them,  conscribing   them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  if there are not enough  stand-pipes,\r\n\r\nnot  enough  roads, then I say the Communists  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   bear   a   great   deal   of   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the interesting things is that since the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis left this side of the House everybody\r\n\r\nis  well  aware that things are coming up.  Houses  are\r\n\r\ncoming up, schools are coming up, and a friend of  mine\r\n\r\nhas  told me that that proves that if you have a  water\r\n\r\npipe,  you will always get some dirt clogging the pipe.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the dirt, the water flows freely. That is\r\n\r\nwhat  has been happening. After the Communists suffered\r\n\r\na   defeat   at  the  referendum,  people   have   more\r\n\r\nconfidence,  no more obstruction. All that the  Barisan\r\n\r\ncan  do  is to make occasional speeches here and there.\r\n\r\nWe  have been able to more than fulfil a great deal  of\r\n\r\nour  programme.  And for that, I would  like  to  place\r\n\r\nhere,  Sir, I think, for the instruction of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  a  pamphlet* produced by our Ministry  which gives  the  achievements of \r\n\r\nthe Government  during  the last 47 months, one month short \r\n\r\nof four years.

So  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has solved anything for the  people  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, the Prime Minister should not take  pride\r\n\r\non account of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this incident happened only a few weeks\r\n\r\nbefore the Prime Minister went to Punggol constituency.\r\n\r\nI  remember  that  a few weeks before  he  went  to  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, there were a few P.A.P. members who  went\r\n\r\nround  to  get  the  people  to  organise  a  welcoming\r\n\r\ncommittee. But they could not find the chairman of  the\r\n\r\ncommittee,  and  the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nhad to go there himself to look for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have completed the debate on rural\r\n\r\nvisits.

On  the  day when the Prime  Minister  went\r\n\r\nthere,  this  chairman of the welcoming  committee  put\r\n\r\nforward  a  suggestion to deepen  the  river  in  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon.  He asked the Prime Minister  to  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem  about this river. Later on, the P.W.D. people\r\n\r\nwent  there  to  investigate it. I had also  written  a\r\n\r\nletter to the P.W.D., but the reply I received was just\r\n\r\na  printed  card  which states that  \"the  problem  now\r\n\r\nraised by you is now under consideration.\" Later on,  I\r\n\r\nheard  nothing  about  it.  But  the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nwelcoming  committee,  after sending  his  application,\r\n\r\nmanaged to get the work done immediately. It seems that\r\n\r\nhis power and influence is greater than an Assemblyman.\r\n\r\nThis is very unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Havelock has just now  said  that  when  a\r\n\r\nMinister  sends in an application for work to be  done,\r\n\r\nthe  Government always attends to his work first.  This\r\n\r\nis absurd. This is not correct. This is just to condemn\r\n\r\nthe  Government. At the last meeting of the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Consultative Committee, the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development sent in a request to have  a  road\r\n\r\nmade  up. But I, as the Chairman, and committee members\r\n\r\nturned it down. It is not a matter of our attending  to\r\n\r\nthe    Ministers    first,   then   the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  and then the Assemblymen.  Our  committee\r\n\r\nattend   to   all   Assemblymen  who  send   in   their\r\n\r\napplications.  When a Member sends in  an  application,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  for  a standpipe at a certain  spot,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a standpipe not more than 50 feet away,  how\r\n\r\ncan  we  install  one more standpipe there?  Naturally-when  an  application is made, the Water Inspector  and\r\n\r\nthe Work Engineer visit the site and report back to the\r\n\r\ncommittee. If we are not satisfied, we in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee visit the site to see for ourselves whether a\r\n\r\nstandpipe  is  necessary or whether the existing  roads\r\n\r\nshould  be urgently repaired. We always attend  to  all\r\n\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Members of the Opposition say that we only attend\r\n\r\nto  Assemblymen of the P.A.P. constituencies.  This  is\r\n\r\nutter  nonsense.  We  have been in the  Government  for\r\n\r\nnearly four years now. Does it mean to say that all  of\r\n\r\nus are stupid and that we do these things in the public\r\n\r\neye?  We  are not so stupid as the Opposition Members,\r\n\r\nespecially the Barisan Sosialis people. They are always\r\n\r\ntrying   to  mislead  the  people.  They  condemn   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and they want it to collapse, so  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  come  to power. I would remind Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  be very careful about  doing  these\r\n\r\nthings.

When the Prime Minister paid visits to the rural areas, he announced several projects which would be carried out. All these works are only part of what I had applied to be done in the\r\n\r\npast.  If  the Government want to mention these  works,\r\n\r\nthey should also mention that I had applied for them to\r\n\r\nbe  done  in  the past. I know that it is difficult  to\r\n\r\ncarry out the work to the satisfaction of all. This  is\r\n\r\nmy  reply  to  some  of  the allegations  made  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Government is either\r\n\r\ncorrupt  or  incompetent or is trying to  do  something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not realistic. Certain kampong roads,  after\r\n\r\nhaving been completed a year ago, have now fallen  into\r\n\r\ndisrepair. Certain roads should be at least six  inches\r\n\r\nthick. But perhaps some of the works on the roads  were\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  contractors  and  the  work  was  not\r\n\r\nproperly done. That is why the roads are easily damaged\r\n\r\nby water or the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain drains were not properly built. They are not\r\n\r\naccording to the proper plan and this causes the  water\r\n\r\nto  flood the road in the kampong area. That is why the\r\n\r\nsurface earth of the road has been washed away  by  the\r\n\r\nflood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the improper manner in which they\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  roads. There are so many  holes  in  the\r\n\r\nroads.  It is difficult for cars and vehicles  to  pass\r\n\r\nover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.

Mr Speaker, Sir,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as the nurses' strike is concerned. I was all  the\r\n\r\ntime  in communication with the two contending unions.\r\n\r\nThere is a long history behind this dispute, and I  do\r\n\r\nnot propos e to bore the House with the details. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neventually  sometime in 1960 these two unions  came  to\r\n\r\nsome  sort  of  a hotchpotch agreement.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical   Services  Union  claimed  to  represent   the\r\n\r\nassistant  nurses, and the rival union,  the  A.U.P.E.,\r\n\r\nclaimed  to  represent the male nurses.  The  assistant\r\n\r\nnurses   number   about  719   in   a   total   nursing\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  2,241, and the male  nurses  number\r\n\r\nabout  219.  There the matter stood, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nAfter  both these unions served demands on the Ministry\r\n\r\nclaiming  revisions of salaries for the  whole  of  the\r\n\r\nnursing  service  and  for  improved  conditions,   the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of the A.U.P.E.,  i.e.,  the  former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture,\r\n\r\ncalled  on  me at my office in February this  year.  He\r\n\r\nmade  a  proposal  for a solution of  this  matter.  He\r\n\r\nsuggested to me that the Ministry should propose to the\r\n\r\nother  union that he should keep in his membership  all\r\n\r\nthe  student  nurses and staff nurses and that  he  was\r\n\r\nquite  prepared  to  let  the  other  union  have   the\r\n\r\nassistant  nurses and the sisters and charge nurses - the\r\n\r\ncharge  nurses are the male equivalents of the sisters.\r\n\r\nThat  proposal  was  put to the other  union  and  they\r\n\r\nflatly turned it down They said it was unfair and  they\r\n\r\nwere  quite  prepared to submit the whole matter  to  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  ballot  of  the  nursing  service.  They  went\r\n\r\nfurther to say that if they lost in the ballot, they were  quite  prepared to dissolve themselves  and  return\r\n\r\ntheir  certificate of registration. When they  received\r\n\r\nthat  offer,  we  made  every attempt  to  contact  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  A.U.P.E.   Three   official\r\n\r\nletters  were written to him at various dates. Various\r\n\r\ntelephone  calls were made on him. But every  time  our\r\n\r\nofficials  were  told that he was elsewhere  on  other\r\n\r\nimportant business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to our surprise, on 23rd May, we received a strike notice. The strike notice said that if the demands that his union had made were not settled by midnight, the 6th of June, then the union would call out all the student nurses, assistant nurses, sisters, and the charge nurses on strike. This union included in\r\n\r\nits  strike  notice these grades of sisters and  charge\r\n\r\nnurses which it earlier said in February it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared  to  concede  to the  rival  union..  When  we\r\n\r\nreceived  that  notice,  we had  to  refer  it  to  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour and ask him to conciliate.  The\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour held two meetings  with  these\r\n\r\ntwo unions, and they took firm stands on this issue  of\r\n\r\nunion  representation. The Singapore  Medical  Services\r\n\r\nUnion  claimed that they represented all grades of  the\r\n\r\nnursing staff and that they wanted a general ballot  to\r\n\r\nbe  held  for all grades. The other union said that  it\r\n\r\nwanted  a  restricted  ballot to  be  held -  a  ballot\r\n\r\nrestricted  only  to the grades for  which  the  strike\r\n\r\nnotice was served. These meetings took place very  near\r\n\r\nto  the date when the A.U.P.E. decided to call out  its\r\n\r\nmembers.    A   strike   then   took   place    without\r\n\r\njustification. Before that, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  told\r\n\r\nboth  unions that we had decided that a general  ballot\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken  to  find out  which  union  had  the\r\n\r\nmajority of membership of the nursing staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the A.U.P.E. disagreed with us, we\r\n\r\nnevertheless  proceeded to take that ballot,  and  that\r\n\r\nballot   is   still  proceeding.  The  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nintervened  in  the  matter. He felt  that  if  certain\r\n\r\nproposals  that we had in mind were put to  both  these\r\n\r\nunions, there was a likelihood of their accepting them,\r\n\r\nin  fact, he did hold meetings with them and put  these\r\n\r\nproposals  which  have been accepted.  The  unions  are\r\n\r\nagreed  now that the Arbitration Court should be  asked\r\n\r\nto  find out whether the nursing staff were all members\r\n\r\nof  a  single service or whether the staff employed  in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals  should be categorised,  and  the  Court\r\n\r\nshould be asked to determine whether there should he  a\r\n\r\ndecision   on   representation  which   would   involve\r\n\r\nrepresentation  by two unions in respect  of  different\r\n\r\ncategories in the service or representation by a single\r\n\r\nunion  in respect of the whole service. That matter  is\r\n\r\nnow  before the Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, for the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Pasir  Panjang to say that I left it  all  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is quite untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the cholera epidemic, it happened that\r\n\r\nat the time this epidemic occurred, the Director of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical  Services was on leave, At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Director  of Medical Services  (Hospitals)  was\r\n\r\naway  on  a  conference,  and the  Deputy  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical Services (Health) - these are the three  most\r\n\r\nimportant  officials  in  the  Ministry - was  ill   in\r\n\r\nhospital.  So  I  was left with a comparatively  junior\r\n\r\nofficer. He is the Chest Physician in the Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nHospital. We got together and organised a campaign;  so\r\n\r\nthat  it is also quite untrue for the Member for  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang to say that in the cholera epidemic I left  all\r\n\r\nmatters  to  the Prime Minister. It was true  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  did  hold a  conference  to  which  he\r\n\r\ninvited representatives of the Public Utilities  Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Health was also represented, and I was\r\n\r\npresent at that conference. That conference was  called\r\n\r\nso  that he could co-ordinate the activities of the two\r\n\r\nDepartments to meet this epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nasked me  to  tell  the House when the revision of salaries affecting \r\n\r\nthe  nurses and medical auxiliary staff was last  made. The answer is that there was a committee that went \r\n\r\ninto all  this, and it was necessary to relate the  salaries \r\n\r\nof  all these different grades to key salary scales  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government service. This committee took two  years\r\n\r\nto  do  this  work,  and finally the  new  scales  were\r\n\r\nimplemented as from 1st February, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is shocking to\r\n\r\nhear  the  Minister  say that his  Ministry  had  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  trying to contact the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  A.U.P.E., that despite three official  letters\r\n\r\nsent  to him and attempts made to contact him, all were\r\n\r\nto  no  avail.  At that particular time the  Secretary-General \r\n\r\nof the A.U.P.E. was the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Culture. He was paid out of public\r\n\r\nfunds,  and he should be sitting in that office.  Where\r\n\r\nthen  was  the difficulty in contacting him?  If  there\r\n\r\nreally  was  that difficulty, it would  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had allowed a Parliamentary Secretary, paid  out\r\n\r\nof public funds, to be up to his tricks doing something\r\n\r\nelse.

Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I disagree with the Member for Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nwhen  he said that the Prime Minister has no confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  Minister  for  Health  and  that  was  why  he\r\n\r\nintervened  in  the nurses' strike. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  to intervene because it was a quarrel between  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary  before\r\n\r\nhe resigned. It was a completely P.A.P. matter, And who\r\n\r\nelse   but   the  Prime  Minister  could   admonish   a\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary? The Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture could just twiddle his  thumb\r\n\r\nat  the  Minister for Health if the Minister for Health\r\n\r\ntried  to settle it, But when he had to meet the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, it was a different kettle of fish. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister took over. The Prime Minister,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  has great confidence in the Minister for Health.\r\n\r\nHis   confidence  is  so  great  that  even  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's   wife  went  to  a  private  hospital   for\r\n\r\ntreatment - the  Mount Alvernia Hospital - instead  of  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital or any other hospital in the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Sir,  I\r\n\r\nrealise this is a very special matter that concerns the\r\n\r\nformer  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture,  who  is not here now, and the nursing  staff,\r\n\r\nwho are a special preserve of the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nthe A.U.P.E. I do not want to pry into his affairs, but\r\n\r\nbecause  this  has  come  to he  of  public  importance\r\n\r\nleading to a stage where a strike, in fact, took place,\r\n\r\nI  think  it is fair to assume that there is legitimate\r\n\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, luckily this strike was not called by a union\r\n\r\nthat  is affiliated to the S.A.T.U. group, as otherwise\r\n\r\nthe  charge  would  have been that the  Communists  are\r\n\r\ncalling  the  strike,  that they are  making  the  poor\r\n\r\npatients  suffer.  I think I will not  be  wrong  if  I\r\n\r\nassume   that  the  strike  was  not  called   by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. It was not a political strike, it was not a\r\n\r\nCommunist strike, but it was a genuine strike. Sir,  on\r\n\r\nthat  basis  at  least  we must assume  that  there  is\r\n\r\ngenuine  discontent. As far as I can understand,  there\r\n\r\nare  numerous grades of nurses and salary scales in the\r\n\r\nservice.  I  hear there is strong dissatisfaction  over\r\n\r\neven   the   nature  of  duties  performed,  and   that\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  extends to the general  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice of the whole nursing staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of all this, what I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Health and Law is  this:  will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   consider  setting  up  a   Commission   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  into the conditions of employment  of  the\r\n\r\nnursing  staff and their salaries, etc, with a view  to\r\n\r\nbringing  about  a general revision and unification  in\r\n\r\nemployment terms and salaries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that there is\r\n\r\na   genuine  grievance  among  nurses  that  they   are\r\n\r\nunderpaid for the work they do, in the sense that their\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  are  related to the  salary  scales  of\r\n\r\nclerical officers though they have to do shift work and\r\n\r\novertime   work   and  night  work   without   adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I think  it  would  be\r\n\r\nwise to let the Arbitration Court decide this issue  of\r\n\r\nrepresentation first. Once that is got over, we can see\r\n\r\nhow  best we can deal with the need for proper  inquiry\r\n\r\nto  be  made into the conditions of work of the members\r\n\r\nof the nursing staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as to salary scales, the Member for Thomson is in the trade union field and he knows that the unions take exception to boards of inquiry, say, fixing or making recommendations for wage scales. The unions always feel that they can get a better deal if they can collectively bargain for better scales of pay\r\n\r\nand  for improvements. So I would suggest that we  wait\r\n\r\nuntil we get the decisions of the Arbitration Court and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen we will either have to deal with one union or  two\r\n\r\nunions  and  see how best we can reach a solution  that\r\n\r\nwill be satisfactory to all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Political Secretaries have been under  fire\r\n\r\nat  every Budget meeting since 1960. In this particular\r\n\r\ncase,  the Ministry of Health, the particular Political\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  now under lock and key, put  in  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I am wondering whether the Minister  still\r\n\r\nconsiders that this post should remain on the Budget so\r\n\r\nthat  the Government can go around trying to find  some\r\n\r\nCommunist  or Communist sympathiser whom the Government\r\n\r\nhopes  to  win  over  to their non-Communist  socialist\r\n\r\npolicy  and then give him this job out of public funds,\r\n\r\nand  later  on, when the Government finds to  its  cost\r\n\r\nthat  such a person cannot be trusted, put him in gaol.\r\n\r\nI  remember  the Minister did say that if  he  did  not\r\n\r\nconsider  that such a post was desirable he  would  see\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  abolished.

I am not so sure  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Health has given such an  assurance,\r\n\r\nbut  I  have  a feeling that almost all Ministers  gave\r\n\r\nthat  assurance.  Does the Minister  for  Health  still\r\n\r\nconsider that he wants that post on the Budget?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will concede that last\r\n\r\nyear, eighteen months ago.

I also concede  that  there  are\r\n\r\nMinistries  where  the  need  for  the  services  of  a\r\n\r\nPersonal Secretary (Political) is more urgent.  I  must\r\n\r\npoint out that there are some sensitive departments  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health which regularly  receive  the\r\n\r\nattention of trouble makers. For instance, there  is  a\r\n\r\nHawkers'  Department and our new policy of helping  the\r\n\r\nhawkers - we  always  give  them  alternative  sites  and\r\n\r\nprovide  these alternative sites with standpipes,  they\r\n\r\nmay have to be moved to enable cleansing to be properly\r\n\r\ndone  or to clear a traffic obstruction which might  be\r\n\r\ncaused   by   them.

Although we have  now\r\n\r\nset  up  24  outpatient clinics, in one day only  5,000\r\n\r\npeople  can  be  treated. In order  to  cope  with  our\r\n\r\nincreasing population, we have to set up another  seven\r\n\r\nmodem  clinics,  each one catering for 500  people,  in\r\n\r\n1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, four years have passed and the\r\n\r\npatients in the hospitals are always asked to leave the \r\n\r\nhospitals before they get better. We know that the poor \r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore live in very insanitary conditions \r\n\r\nand  the air is very impure. When a patient returns  to\r\n\r\nhis  home before he gets better, this is very  bad  for\r\n\r\nhim and it will not help him to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the patients in the General\r\n\r\nHospital  are  crowded  together  especially   in   the\r\n\r\nOutpatients Department. The Government claims  that  it\r\n\r\nwants  to build 17 clinics in the Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan. But it seems that it has not reached this target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that in Upper Serangoon and Yio\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  there  is  one  old outpatient  clinic.  The\r\n\r\npatients who attend that clinic have to queue up in the\r\n\r\nhot  sun and the queue is very long. Will this help the\r\n\r\npatient  who  is  queueing up to get better  if  he  is\r\n\r\nexposed  to  the heat?

Mr Speaker, Sir, the  turn-round\r\n\r\nin  the  use  of beds is about 50,000 a  year  in  this\r\n\r\nhospital, and the General Hospital has only a  capacity\r\n\r\nof  1,351 beds. Unlike the Chronic Sick Hospital at Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng Hospital you have about 1,300 beds  and  the\r\n\r\nsame  patient  remains in a bed  for  a  longer  period\r\n\r\nbecause tuberculosis is a disease which requires longer\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are doing our best to turn the Chronic Sick Hospital at Thomson Road into a subsidiary general hospital. In fact, there are 11 wards in that hospital; in five wards, 180 beds are being used at the\r\n\r\npresent time, and six wards with a capacity of 216 beds\r\n\r\nare   vacant.  We  have  introduced  a  crash  training\r\n\r\nprogramme to train nurses. As soon as we are able to do\r\n\r\nso with the modest increase in doctors that we have, we\r\n\r\nwill  -bring this hospital into service as a subsidiary\r\n\r\ngeneral  hospital, and that will help  to  relieve  the\r\n\r\npresent pressure on the General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as far as his complaint that there is a lot of\r\n\r\ncongestion  at the main clinic at the General  Hospital\r\n\r\nis  concerned, we admit that. That is so.

I visited it myself recently.  It\r\n\r\nis  just  at the corner of Yio Chu Kang Road and  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon Road. We have a site in view at the corner of\r\n\r\nYio Chu Kang Road and Highland Road for acquisition for\r\n\r\na  new clinic to replace this old clinic.

Those  who are employed are,  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  made  pupil  midwives  and  are  subject  to\r\n\r\ntraining  for  a  period of about two  years  and  four\r\n\r\nmonths.  I  may  be wrong - the Minister may  correct  me\r\n\r\nhere - but  to the best of my knowledge, it is two  years\r\n\r\nand  four months, after which they are expected to  sit\r\n\r\nfor  an  examination. If the candidates succeed in  the\r\n\r\nexamination, they are given three months' duties in the\r\n\r\nclinics in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three months, I hear, are for further practical\r\n\r\ntraining.  Of  course, in the course  of  the  training\r\n\r\nduring  the  two years and four months, they  are  also\r\n\r\nexpected to do practical work, and most of them in fact\r\n\r\nperform  duties which are normally performed  by  staff\r\n\r\nmidwives.  They are, of course, supervised by qualified\r\n\r\nstaff midwives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the curious thing is this, Mr Deputy Speaker.\r\n\r\nAfter   the   period   of  training,   they   are   not\r\n\r\nautomatically  employed as staff  midwives.  After  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of training, their services are dispensed  with\r\n\r\nand, if they desire to become staff midwives, they have\r\n\r\nto  wait  for  the Ministry of Health to announce  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  vacancies and that they intend  to  recruit\r\n\r\nstaff midwives. Those pupil midwives who are successful\r\n\r\nin their training are then allowed to apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this appears peculiar and outmoded, because what\r\n\r\nis  the  purpose of giving them their training  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  want to  employ  them  as  staff\r\n\r\nmidwives? I can only think of one reason, and  that  is\r\n\r\nto have cheap labour. I know some private employers are\r\n\r\nin the habit of doing this sort of thing. I do not like\r\n\r\nto  believe seriously that the Government wants to have\r\n\r\ncheap  labour,  because in the course of training,  the\r\n\r\npupil  midwives  do work which is normally  done  by  a\r\n\r\ntrained staff midwife, but they are paid the rate for a\r\n\r\npupil  midwife, But after training, instead of  getting\r\n\r\nautomatic appointment like the assistant nurses,  their\r\n\r\nservices are dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like to ask the Minister if the Government\r\n\r\nwill  lock  into  this with a view to  abolishing  this\r\n\r\nsystem, so as to provide an arrangement similar to  the\r\n\r\none that is in existence for other nursing grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I am not\r\n\r\nmistaken,  the  Member  for  Thomson  says   that   the\r\n\r\ngrievance that the pupil midwives have is that they  do\r\n\r\ngo out during the time that they are pupil midwives and\r\n\r\ndo  the work of staff midwives for a certain period but\r\n\r\nthat  they do not receive the salary of staff  midwives\r\n\r\nwhen they are so employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot have it both\r\n\r\nways.

Their\r\n\r\nservices are terminated, They have to wait for  months,\r\n\r\nOnly  when  the Ministry of Health says that they  want\r\n\r\nmidwives, can they apply. That is the basic grievance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, if the Member for Thomson had not\r\n\r\ninterrupted  me,  I would have gone on  to  the  second\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think the first point to be answered is this:\r\n\r\nif you are a pupil midwife, you must be paid as a pupil\r\n\r\nmidwife, though you go and help out as a staff midwife.\r\n\r\nThe  second objection now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,In\r\n\r\nthe  case of nurses and assistant nurses, we accept the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for  training  them.  The   Government\r\n\r\naccepts  that responsibility and the Government ensures\r\n\r\nthat  it  will train sufficient numbers of  nurses  and\r\n\r\nassistant  nurses  to  fill  all  available  Government\r\n\r\nvacancies.  It  is  true  that  there  is  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nwastage - many  of them leave us, and so on - and  we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to have crash training programmes to catch up with\r\n\r\nincreases  of staff which are necessary. That  goes  on\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  nursing  service.  It  is  unlike  the\r\n\r\nmidwifery  service, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. We  cannot\r\n\r\naccept  any  responsibility for assuring every  midwife\r\n\r\nthat we train that there will be a vacancy for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, unlike the nursing service, there are a lot of midwives who go into private practice. They work on their own or they work with doctors. The Member for Thomson knows that very well, Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, their training and so on is not unlike that of the radiographers. We have got a\r\n\r\nmedical  auxiliary  staff  of  radiographers  which  we\r\n\r\ntrain.  We  have  got a radiography  school.  We  train\r\n\r\npeople who want to be radiographers, but we train  them\r\n\r\nso  that they can go into private employment as well as\r\n\r\ncome  into Government service when there are vacancies.\r\n\r\nIt  would  be impossible for the Member for Thomson  to\r\n\r\nexpect that the Government can create the vacancies  in\r\n\r\nthe Government service to accommodate every midwife who\r\n\r\nhas been trained at the expense of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I honestly cannot understand the argument\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister.  Sir. The Minister  says  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  guarantee employment: in other words, they  are\r\n\r\nsaying that there may not be the vacancies. Sir, surely\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government employs, say, one  hundred  pupil\r\n\r\nmidwives,  they are employing them not for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  giving  training, but for the purpose of doing  one\r\n\r\nhundred persons' work and also ultimately with the view\r\n\r\nto  placing  one  hundred as midwives  in  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  institutions.  Take  the  question  of  the\r\n\r\nnurses.  The same principle operates. You do  not  take\r\n\r\nassistant  nurses, give them training and  in  the  end\r\n\r\ndispense with their services on grounds that you cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee posts for trained nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point that I want to make here is the\r\n\r\nquestion of a midwife who leaves the service to go into\r\n\r\nprivate  employment. It is quite true  that  there  are\r\n\r\nprivate clinics which have midwives  - maybe K.K. - trained\r\n\r\nmidwives.  But,  on  the other hand,  if  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  investigates this matter, he will  find  that\r\n\r\nthe  vast majority of the pupil midwives who leave  the\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau Maternity Hospital after training  look\r\n\r\nforward  to Government employment for obvious  reasons,\r\n\r\nbecause most of these pupil midwives are young;  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible for them to go out and practise on  their\r\n\r\nown,  and  there are lesser opportunities  to  work  in\r\n\r\nprivate clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think you will\r\n\r\nagree,  regarding these pupil midwives, that  there  is\r\n\r\nquite a large number of them and we can employ only  as\r\n\r\nmany  as we can. We cannot give an assurance that every\r\n\r\nmidwife who is trained will be absorbed into Government\r\n\r\nservice. That will all have to depend on the vacancies.\r\n\r\nYou will realise that there is a much larger number  of\r\n\r\nmidwives practising on their own than there are  nurses\r\n\r\nwho   practise   as  nurses  outside   the   Government\r\n\r\nemployment. Now, I do appreciate that there  are  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of them who are outside Government service  who\r\n\r\napply for Government jobs.

Therefore, there will not  be\r\n\r\nthe  additional  supply  which  will  go  into  private\r\n\r\npractice.  As  the Minister for Health  has  said,  the\r\n\r\nnumber    of   midwives   in   private   practice    is\r\n\r\nproportionately  more  than the  number  of  nurses  in\r\n\r\nprivate practice.

I understand  there  is\r\n\r\ngreat dissatisfaction with the Japanese doctors who are\r\n\r\nstill  being employed in the Singapore hospitals.  They\r\n\r\nwere  originally brought into Singapore,  according  to\r\n\r\nthe  advice  that I have got, as a spite more  or  less\r\n\r\nagainst  local doctors as a result of a number of  them\r\n\r\nhaving  resigned  consequent on the pay-cuts.  But  the\r\n\r\nwhole trouble about these Japanese doctors is that they\r\n\r\nhave  been made Senior Registrars with a pay of  $1,100\r\n\r\nas  a  starting salary and yet they are only doing jobs\r\n\r\nof  ordinary M.O.s and supervised by ordinary M.O.s  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Why should that be so? I remember I  brought\r\n\r\nthis question up in 1961, and the Minister then gave an\r\n\r\nundertaking  to  look into the matter and  I  gave  him\r\n\r\nconcrete  examples. I wish the Minister would enlighten\r\n\r\nus on what he has done about the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter which I wish to bring forward is\r\n\r\nthis:  the Outpatients Department in Singapore  at  the\r\n\r\npresent   moment  is  very  congested.  They  have,   I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  15  doctors  working  in  the  Outpatients\r\n\r\nDepartment in the daytime, but only one at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why do you not volunteer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why should there be only one\r\n\r\ndoctor  at  night? Consequent on there being  only  one\r\n\r\ndoctor  after the usual office hours, many  people  who\r\n\r\nare  very ill have to wait for a very long time  before\r\n\r\nthey  are attended to in the Outpatients Department  of\r\n\r\nthe General Hospital. Are we short of doctors, or what?\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister explain to us why there should  be\r\n\r\nonly one doctor when we are supposed to have many, many\r\n\r\ndoctors with no shortage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to raise is: if the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  refer to page 174 under subhead 11 (3),  he  will\r\n\r\nsee  \"Drugs  and Chemicals\", Estimates 1962,  $780,000.\r\n\r\nBut   for  1963,  it  has  been  reduced  to  $723,000.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  \"Dressings and Sundries\"  above  this,  the\r\n\r\nfigure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the same for 1962 and 1963. Similarly, on page 175,\r\n\r\nunder   subhead   21 (2),  he  will  find   \"Drugs   and\r\n\r\nChemicals\", and the amount is again the same  for  1962\r\n\r\nand  1963.  And  further  down under  subhead  26  (2),\r\n\r\n\"Dressings and Sundries\", it was $100,000 in 1962,  but\r\n\r\nit has gone down to $71,000 in 1963. Similarly, on page\r\n\r\n176 under subhead 31 - Medical and Surgical Equipment and\r\n\r\nStores -  you will find all the figures in the column for\r\n\r\n1963 much lower than those in the column for 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume that with a population increase in Singapore\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  and more people  making  use  of  the\r\n\r\nservices  in the General Hospital. How is it then  that\r\n\r\nless money is voted for all these services in 1963?  Is\r\n\r\nit because fewer people are making use of the hospital?\r\n\r\nI would like to be enlightened on this, especially when\r\n\r\nwe know that there is a lot of surplus in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 26 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100 ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> The amendment has been\r\n\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have a few\r\n\r\nquestions. One concerns the General Hospital.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister for Health if  he  can  say\r\n\r\nwhether   there  can  be  established  in  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital   an   Emergency  Unit  which   will   provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  patients to be  admitted  without  any\r\n\r\nspecial  procedure,  so that they  can  be  immediately\r\n\r\nadmitted  when there are emergency cases, in  order  to\r\n\r\nreduce the pains suffered by the patients and to lessen\r\n\r\nany  worry of the members of their family and to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  fatalities.  Because  without  such  a\r\n\r\nfacility,  the  people concerned will  find  it  rather\r\n\r\ninconvenient; there will be cause for concern for them.\r\n\r\nThis is one thing I would ask the Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the services provided in the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital are usually rather lax,  because  the\r\n\r\npatient  will sometimes have to wait for two  hours  or\r\n\r\nseveral hours at a stretch. I hope the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister will pay attention to this and find some means\r\n\r\nto improve this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is in regard to the Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital. This hospital is in charge of maternity cases\r\n\r\nwho  go  there for confinement. I have been  there  too\r\n\r\nbecause  my elder sister and younger sister  have  both\r\n\r\nbeen  there  and have other friends there too.  I  have\r\n\r\nfound   that   the   situation  there   is   also   not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory,  because after two days' stay  an  inmate\r\n\r\nwill have to move out. Perhaps the Minister's wife  has\r\n\r\nnot   been   delivering  any  baby  in  that  hospital,\r\n\r\notherwise  the  Minister would have taken  measures  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  situation. I hope the  Minister  can  pay\r\n\r\nattention to this matter so as to improve the situation\r\n\r\nthere  and help poorer people, because well-off  people\r\n\r\nperhaps  would not go there for delivery. It is  mostly\r\n\r\nthe  poor people who go there. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\ndo  something  to help them and make things  convenient\r\n\r\nfor  them.  It is the poorer people who are making  the\r\n\r\nmost use of the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. When they  are\r\n\r\nhospitalised,  members  of  their  family  are   rather\r\n\r\nconcerned. At home they do not have telephones and they\r\n\r\nnaturally  find  it  rather difficult  to  contact  the\r\n\r\nhospital  staff.  This is another  reason  for  further\r\n\r\nworry.  Whereas for the richer people or the Ministers,\r\n\r\nthey  have  telephones at home and can  easily  get  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  the  hospital staff to enquire  about  the\r\n\r\ncondition of their wives in the K.K. Hospital. This  is\r\n\r\nanother  point  I hope the Minister will pay  attention\r\n\r\nto, to help the poorer people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is this.

Then   for   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates for 1963, it is seen  that  they\r\n\r\nfelt  that out of this vote of $400,000, only  $350,000\r\n\r\nwould  have been spent by the end of 1962 and therefore\r\n\r\na  revote of $50,000 was asked for for 1963. But now in\r\n\r\nthis  Estimate of Personal Emoluments, it is seen  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is going to scrap this Maternity Home. I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  upon  the Government to  reconsider  their\r\n\r\ndecision  and to do all they can to set up a  maternity\r\n\r\nhome in that area which is very thickly populated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as to the Japanese\r\n\r\ndoctors - we  have five doctors - the contract of  one  has\r\n\r\nexpired and he has gone home. There is still a shortage\r\n\r\nof  doctors  in the medical service, although,  on  the\r\n\r\nlatest  figures  that  I have, we have  fortunately  in\r\n\r\nservice  a total of 329 doctors as today. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nwe  are  still  short. We are happy to  accept  in  our\r\n\r\nservice more doctors if we can get them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently two doctors from Formosa applied to join our\r\n\r\nservice  and  I  snapped  them  up  immediately.  These\r\n\r\nforeign  doctors  are  not  in  any  way  blocking  the\r\n\r\npromotions  of  local doctors. They  are  paid  from  a\r\n\r\nseparate  vote in the Estimate. If we can get  them,  I\r\n\r\nthink we should be grateful for their services, so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  help out in our hospitals and  our  clinics.\r\n\r\nThis  expansion will not be possible unless we can  get\r\n\r\nmore  nurses  and  doctors. That must  be  realised  by\r\n\r\nMembers in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the complaint was that they get into senior positions in the hospital and, therefore, block the promotions of our local officers. In point of fact, all our young local medical officers of ability get every opportunity of coming under the notice of specialist doctors, so that they can get opportunities\r\n\r\nof  going overseas to get higher qualifications. I have\r\n\r\nspoken to the specialist officers who are in charge  of\r\n\r\nthese various units employing the Japanese doctors, and\r\n\r\nthey have assured\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  that  these  Japanese  medical  officers  are  good\r\n\r\nofficers, experienced officers, and they would be  glad\r\n\r\nto retain them in the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the complaint that there is only one doctor on\r\n\r\nduty at night, whereas there are 15 doctors on duty  in\r\n\r\nthe  daytime  at the Outpatients Clinic at the  General\r\n\r\nHospital, these postings are dependent on the number of\r\n\r\npatients  that  are dealt with in the  daytime  and  at\r\n\r\nnight. I will be making enquiries to find out why  only\r\n\r\none  doctor is employed at night. I would have  thought\r\n\r\nthat   before   the   officers  in  charge   of   these\r\n\r\narrangements  make  these  postings,  they  would  have\r\n\r\nregard  to  the numbers attending at night and  in  the\r\n\r\ndaytime at the clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown referred to reductions in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates on Chemicals and drugs. I have discussed\r\n\r\nthat  with  the Minister for Finance just now,  and  he\r\n\r\ntold me that the amounts for the purchase of drugs have\r\n\r\nbeen overestimated in previous years. I have also on my\r\n\r\nown  checked  on  this question and the  Superintending\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical  Chemist  has  given  me  a  note  here,\r\n\r\nstating that the total number of all patients, both out-patients  and in-patients, at all Government  hospitals\r\n\r\nincreased from 3,000,000 in 1958 to 4,920,000 in  1962.\r\n\r\nAlso  the  amounts spent on the purchase of drugs  have\r\n\r\nalso  increased from $2,389,000 to $3,155,000.  I  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  in checking these estimates that it  has  been\r\n\r\nthe  practice  in  the  past to overestimate,  But  the\r\n\r\nSuperintending Pharmaceutical Chemist has given  me  an\r\n\r\nassurance that they have sufficient drugs in store  and\r\n\r\non purchase to meet all requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has asked that we make\r\n\r\narrangements  to  provide  for  easier  facilities  for\r\n\r\nadmission  to  the  General  Hospital.  That   is   not\r\n\r\npossible.  Even  if  the patient  is  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital by a general practitioner, it does not\r\n\r\nfollow that he gets admitted. He has to be seen by  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Medical Officer in charge, and  if  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMedical Officer in charge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagrees  that  his case merits admission, then  he  gets\r\n\r\nadmission.  I have told the House just now  that  there\r\n\r\nare  only  1,351 beds in that hospital and if everybody\r\n\r\ncan  be  freely admitted into that hospital,  it  would\r\n\r\nlead to complete chaos and breakdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Jalan Kayu also complained that\r\n\r\nthe patients at the K.K. Hospital were detained for two\r\n\r\ndays  and released after two days' detention.  That  is\r\n\r\nall  that we can do in the present circumstances. There\r\n\r\nare 50,000 babies delivered in that hospital in a year,\r\n\r\nand  there  are  a little more than 400  beds  in  that\r\n\r\nhospital,  and unless babies are delivered  quickly,  I\r\n\r\ncannot see how that hospital can carry on. Then he said\r\n\r\nthere were not sufficient telephones by which the  poor\r\n\r\ncan  contact their relations outside. There is a public\r\n\r\ntelephone in that hospital and I see no reason for that\r\n\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the complaint of a charge of $12 and $6\r\n\r\na  day.  Those charges have been enforced for  quite  a\r\n\r\nlong  time.  Then  he  wants  the  salaries  of  nurses\r\n\r\nrevised. All that is being attended to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin asked that we give\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  improving  the  facilities  for  the\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  cancer.  In  fact,  Mr  Speaker,  Prof.\r\n\r\nPatterson of Liverpool University visited Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  three months and he has drawn up a programme\r\n\r\nfor  the  construction of the new cancer unit  for  our\r\n\r\nhospital.  The cost involved is around $2\ufffd million.  He\r\n\r\nsays  if the programme is supported by the World Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation, then it would be possible for us  to  get\r\n\r\nfunds from overseas to buy the equipment that is needed\r\n\r\nfor  such a centre. It is also important that you  have\r\n\r\nphysicists for this centre before you embark on putting\r\n\r\nup  the  buildings and buying the equipment. There  are\r\n\r\ndoctors     already    available    with     specialist\r\n\r\nqualifications for the treatment of cancer. If  we  can\r\n\r\nget  the  funds, then we can proceed with this project;\r\n\r\nbut  in  point of priority there are other  commitments\r\n\r\nwhich  deserve  earlier attention. I am  just  bringing\r\n\r\nthat to the attention of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill has asked why we did\r\n\r\nstop  the  vote for the provision of $400,000  for  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a Maternity Home at the old Hospital  in\r\n\r\nMaxwell Road. That was the project. But our plans  were\r\n\r\nconsidered   by   Professor   Baird - he   is   a   noted\r\n\r\ngynaecologists   and   obstetrician - when   he   visited\r\n\r\nSingapore, and both he and Professor McKelvie,  who  is\r\n\r\nnow  on secondment and in service in the Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital, have advised that we should not proceed  with\r\n\r\nthis  project. It is necessary that in the building  of\r\n\r\nthis maternity hospital for there to be incorporated in\r\n\r\nthe hospital itself the other facilities that go with a\r\n\r\nmodern  hospital and there is little room for expansion\r\n\r\nin  this  hospital.  So they have  advised  me - both  of\r\n\r\nthem - and they have said it is their considered  opinion\r\n\r\nthat if we proceed with this project, it would be money\r\n\r\ngoing down the drain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that building can serve another useful purpose.\r\n\r\nIt  can, as I have explained earlier on this afternoon,\r\n\r\nbe  converted into a main clinic to serve the Chinatown\r\n\r\narea. Now, that will relieve the congestion at the main\r\n\r\nclinic of the General Hospital, and it will enable  the\r\n\r\nclinic  at  the  General  Hospital  to  concentrate  on\r\n\r\ncasualties and emergency cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the points that have been\r\n\r\nraised by Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  was  shocked to hear the answer that, because  there\r\n\r\nare  no  beds in the Hospital, women who go  there  for\r\n\r\nconfinement  are kept for only two days.  Is  that  the\r\n\r\nproper answer from a good Government which sees to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the people? Is expansion, more space,  more\r\n\r\nbeds  and more facilities, not the answer, rather  than\r\n\r\nkeep  them for two days? What happens if more women  go\r\n\r\nto  deliver in one day? Then afterwards, what  happens?\r\n\r\nIt is a very strange answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Minister explained that\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  doctors  on  duty  at  night  in  the\r\n\r\nOutpatients Department is dependent on the number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatients  dealt with.

If, after\r\n\r\nhaving  been  in office for so long he still  does  not\r\n\r\nknow  that there are many people waiting in long queues\r\n\r\nin  the  O.P.D. and admission room at night,  then  he\r\n\r\nshould resign, and let somebody take his office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You take over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If he finds that one doctor is not\r\n\r\nenough, then it is his job to have two doctors here  or\r\n\r\neven three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Why should that be? And yet he tells us\r\n\r\nthat there are plenty of drugs. Outpatients go there to\r\n\r\nask for drugs, and they are told that there is none.

That is a hospital\r\n\r\nin  which about 50,000 babies are delivered in a  year.\r\n\r\nIt  is  one of the biggest maternity hospitals  in  the\r\n\r\nworld today. Now we have expanded the facilities there,\r\n\r\nand  when there are normal deliveries, there is a quick\r\n\r\nturn-round;  they come in, and they  go  out.  Now,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the cases that require treatment,  well,  they\r\n\r\nget the treatment that they require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the case of the clinic at the General\r\n\r\nHospital, the Member for Queenstown was protesting that\r\n\r\nit  was  very  unfair and unjust that one  doctor  only\r\n\r\nshould he posted on duty at night, whereas fifteen  are\r\n\r\non  duty  in  the daytime. The question is to  get  the\r\n\r\ndoctors. As I told you just now, we have 329 doctors in\r\n\r\nthe   service.  They  protest  against  our   employing\r\n\r\nJapanese doctors. They do not want us to employ doctors\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad. Is it not reasonable that we  should  get\r\n\r\nmore  doctors in the service? I put it to the Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical  Association. They said, \"Oh, yes, we will  co-operate; all of us will co-operate; give our service to\r\n\r\nhelp out part-time in clinics and hospitals.\" So far  I\r\n\r\nhave only got eight doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The   post   was\r\n\r\nadvertised on 25th March, 1963, but the grading of  the\r\n\r\npost  has been objected to by the Amalgamated Union  of\r\n\r\nPublic Employees which raised this objection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  Chief  Administrative Officer  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and with a Board of Inquiry which  is  looking\r\n\r\ninto  the  terms  and conditions of  transfer  of  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  employees into Government service. In view  of\r\n\r\nthis  objection,  it  has been  decided  to  defer  the\r\n\r\nfilling  of  this  post  until the  Board  has  had  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to consider and recommend the scale for the\r\n\r\npost on integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Dato\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (2)  of subhead 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dato Abdul Hamid is not here.

They also know the problems faced by the\r\n\r\nhawkers,  that  they  had been under  the  unreasonable\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  so  many  departments  before  1959,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  under  police control, and interference  from\r\n\r\nthe  Police Department. But normally the reason for the\r\n\r\narrest  of hawkers is the same as the reason  given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent of Hawkers, and that is  that  they\r\n\r\nobstruct   traffic.   In  its  election   pledges   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   was  determined  to  get   rid   of   this\r\n\r\nmalpractice and that all problems relating  to  hawkers\r\n\r\nwould  come under the control of one authority and  not\r\n\r\nunder so many departments. But four years have elapsed.\r\n\r\nAre   the  hawkers  today  under  the  control  of  One\r\n\r\nauthority? Actually, it is not so. They are still under\r\n\r\nthe  control of so many departments. They are the  same\r\n\r\nas  they  were  before; their plight  is  the  same  as\r\n\r\nbefore. Moreover,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  hawker policy of the P.A.P. is not consistent, and\r\n\r\nthe Hawkers Department cannot deal with the problem  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  effectively and reasonably. There are so  many\r\n\r\napproaches  towards  the solution  of  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote an example. Some of the hawkers in\r\n\r\nQueen Street have licences, some have not, but whenever\r\n\r\na licence is transferred to another person, the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  always carries out investigations  to  find\r\n\r\nout whether the licensed hawker is actually engaged  in\r\n\r\nthe  business. But those unlicensed hawkers are allowed\r\n\r\nto  carry  on their business. The licensed hawkers  are\r\n\r\nvery  much  worried because they are  harassed  by  the\r\n\r\nauthority. They cannot leave their business because the\r\n\r\nHawker  Inspector may turn up at any  time  to  inspect\r\n\r\ntheir  licences, and if it happens that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nthere,  then their licences will be rescinded and  they\r\n\r\nare sometimes summoned to the Hawkers Department to  be\r\n\r\nquestioned. This is a great harassment to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the problem of hawkers has become more\r\n\r\nacute.  Before there were only 40,000 hawkers, but  now\r\n\r\nthe  number  has  increased to more  than  50,000.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,    while    trying   to    boast    of    their\r\n\r\nindustrialisation scheme which is only a paper  scheme,\r\n\r\nhas given wide publicity in newspapers. On T.V. we have\r\n\r\nalso listened to the industrialisation scheme, but  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unemployed has increased and the number  of\r\n\r\nhawkers has also increased. The Government has not made\r\n\r\nany  effort to alleviate the problem of hawkers at all.\r\n\r\nIt  is  adopting the same methods and measures  towards\r\n\r\nit,  that is, to impose fines and harass them and expel\r\n\r\nthem. We know that in many areas many hawkers have been\r\n\r\nevicted,  for example, in Changi. East Coast Road,  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat,  near  Hollywood Theatre,  Lavender  Street  and\r\n\r\nTanjong  Rhu. Especially in East Coast Road the hawkers\r\n\r\nthere were engaged in the business for a long time, but\r\n\r\nnow  they  have been asked to remove to the back  lanes\r\n\r\nand, as a result, their business has gone down. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  if  they  are arrested,  a  fine  is  very\r\n\r\nseverely imposed. If a hawker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  warned consecutively three times, he will be  fined\r\n\r\nvery heavily - up to $50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the hawker stalls along Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu  Market  have not been properly looked  after.  The\r\n\r\nright   of   allotment  was  handed  to  the   Hawkers'\r\n\r\nAssociation,  and the hawkers who were there  were  not\r\n\r\ngiven their places, but instead these places were given\r\n\r\nto  others,  especially  to  members  of  the  Hawkers'\r\n\r\nAssociation which supported the P.A.P.'s phoney  merger\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to\r\n\r\ndraw  the attention of the Minister - and I have done  it\r\n\r\nseveral times - to the complaints in the papers and by me\r\n\r\nhere  about  the condition of drains, especially  along\r\n\r\nEast  Coast Road, Geylang Serai, Mountbatten  Road  and\r\n\r\nthe  Katong area. I do not know about other areas,  but\r\n\r\nthe  drains there are in a terrible state. It is really\r\n\r\nin  a  disgraceful state. Apart from that in town, down\r\n\r\nHigh  Street or North Bridge Road and Change Alley,  if\r\n\r\nyou  go there during week-ends, which I happened to  do\r\n\r\none week-end when I took some tourists down there (they\r\n\r\nare  friends  of mine), I have never known that  Change\r\n\r\nAlley  could  be such a disgraceful place to  take  any\r\n\r\ntourist  around. I do not know who has been  scattering\r\n\r\nall  the rubbish along the roads. If you go down  on  a\r\n\r\nweek-end  evening - Saturday evening, probably on  Sunday\r\n\r\nevening - down  High Street, you will not recognize  that\r\n\r\nplace,  I  can assure you, Sir. Would the  Minister  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about it because a lot has been  said  about\r\n\r\nearning money through tourism and this certainly is not\r\n\r\na way to attract tourists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  I  would like to tell the Minister is  this.  The\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  the  sanitary inspectors  in  the  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  area, when they carry out their  duties,  is\r\n\r\nnot very good. At the end of this sitting, I will write\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  concerned and  remind  him  of  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  and I hope he will give consideration to  this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto welcome the steps taken by the Government to try and\r\n\r\nsolve  the  pressing problems of the  hawkers  who  are\r\n\r\nplying their trade in back lanes and crowded streets. I\r\n\r\nhave  had occasion before to raise this matter  in  the\r\n\r\nChamber. Such steps might inconvenience certain people,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think,  in  the  interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  should not take this  problem  lightly.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  proper regulation of control  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  hawkers' problem. If the  Government  takes\r\n\r\npositive steps, I believe, like the recent outbreak  of\r\n\r\ncholera epidemic, however much the Government puts  out\r\n\r\nits efforts, this is a matter which we should view with\r\n\r\ngrave concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns health. We\r\n\r\nshould  feel ashamed of ourselves, as has been  pointed\r\n\r\nout  by  the  Member for Mountbatten, that no  measures\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken to rectify the situation  as  certain\r\n\r\nshops are dumping their rubbish indiscriminately.  This\r\n\r\nnot  only concerns health, but also we must take  pride\r\n\r\nin the fact that Singapore can attract many tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these tourists see hawkers plying all over the\r\n\r\ncity,  I think it will bring the good name of Singapore\r\n\r\ninto disrepute. I hope the recent measures taken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be continued persistently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  has said that we have failed to carry out  our\r\n\r\npromise  to  set  up one authority for the  control  of\r\n\r\nhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before we became the Government, hawker control was exercised by two authorities, the City Council and the Rural Board. Now with the integration of the local authorities and the Central Government, it is the Ministry of Health that exercise unified authority over hawkers. So that he really does\r\n\r\nnot understand what is happening in Singapore, although\r\n\r\nhe is a Member of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have an intelligent and reasonable programme and an outlook on the hawkers' problem. It is not possible to eliminate the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  depends on the economics of our present position.\r\n\r\nAll  that  we  can  do is to bring  the  problem  under\r\n\r\nreasonable  control. There are people who  are  not  as\r\n\r\nfortunately placed as ourselves. These people  have  to\r\n\r\nfind  a  livelihood, and because they find it difficult\r\n\r\nto find other employment, they have to take to hawking.\r\n\r\nWe  understand  all  that. We have tried  to  help  the\r\n\r\nhawkers as much as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto the licensing laws were unreasonable in the\r\n\r\nsense  that if a hawker decided to give up hawking,  he\r\n\r\nwas  not  permitted to transfer his business to another\r\n\r\nperson.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have  made  the  hawking\r\n\r\nlicence  freely transferable - that would stop graft.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  Sir, if a man gave up hawking, his  licence\r\n\r\nwould  be cancelled and his pitch would be put  up  for\r\n\r\nauction as it were. And that, Mr Speaker, Sir, was  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  corruption. Now  when  it  is  freely\r\n\r\ntransferable, he gets money for his pitch  whenever  he\r\n\r\nwants to leave it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been necessary to remove hawkers from\r\n\r\nareas  where  they  definitely cause  obstruction.  But\r\n\r\nbefore  we take any action, we give them notice and  we\r\n\r\nfind   them  sites  close  to  where  they  have   been\r\n\r\noperating. This is common knowledge in the town.  Upper\r\n\r\nEast  Coast  Road  has been mentioned. Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  this spot, where the hawkers were hawking, was  a\r\n\r\nspot  where you have, say, three big cinemas. The  road\r\n\r\nthere was very narrow and we had to widen it. For  that\r\n\r\nreason, to relieve the traffic congestion there, we had\r\n\r\nto   move   the  hawkers  into  backlanes,  give   them\r\n\r\nalternative sites and provide standpipes for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, outside the Hollywood\r\n\r\nTheatre.  That was a complete mess. We have now  tidied\r\n\r\nall that up. We have moved them into the grounds of the\r\n\r\nHollywood Theatre and everybody is satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scandalous traffic obstruction at the\r\n\r\ncorner  of Joo Chiat and Changi Roads. Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  that juction is a main junction and it  caused  a\r\n\r\nreal obstruction. It was scandalous that it was allowed\r\n\r\nto continue for so long. We had to serve notices on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  move them from outside Changi  Market  to\r\n\r\nLorong 101, which is just by the side of the market. We\r\n\r\nprovided pitches for the hawkers who were plying  their\r\n\r\ntrade in Joo Chiat Road outside the market. We took the\r\n\r\ntrouble to mark out about 150 pitches there. We did all\r\n\r\nthat.  We allocated sites to them. Everything was  done\r\n\r\nthrough  a ballot system. Everybody who hawked  in  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  Road  qualified for the ballot.  They  balloted.\r\n\r\nThey got their allotments. And we fixed a date by which\r\n\r\nthey  had  to move into their allotted areas.  When  we\r\n\r\nwent  in  there, we found the whole place  vacant.  Our\r\n\r\nhawker inspectors had to check up why that happened. We\r\n\r\nallotted  spaces  and  they disappeared.  We  went  in,\r\n\r\nchecked up and found most of those hawkers were hawkers\r\n\r\nwho had stalls in the market. We checked up their names\r\n\r\nand  addresses when we marked them for ballot,  and  we\r\n\r\nchecked  on  their names and addresses  in  the  market\r\n\r\nitself, and we found that they were related to the same\r\n\r\npersons. It clearly shows you what happens if  the  law\r\n\r\nis  not  enforced. There must be an enforcement of  the\r\n\r\nlaw, otherwise no person who is in the market stall  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to remain there if hawkers outside compete  with\r\n\r\nthem.  That is the clearest example which you  can  get\r\n\r\nthat that is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that there was a mess outside the\r\n\r\nLido Cinema in Orchard Road. All those hawkers have not\r\n\r\nbeen  put  out of business. They have been accommodated\r\n\r\nin  the  lane by the side of the East Asistic building.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a favourite haunt of all the people  who  are\r\n\r\nemployed  in the Orchard Road area. They go  there  and\r\n\r\neat  in the daytime. There has been no harm done to the\r\n\r\nhawkers.  They  have  their  same  employment   at   an\r\n\r\nalternative  site. Similarly with the  hawkers  at  the\r\n\r\nEast Coast Road area. They are in backlanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is the Tay Buan Guan organisation which has\r\n\r\na grocery shop in East Coast Road. They have offered to\r\n\r\nput  up  a  building behind their shop  to  accommodate\r\n\r\nthese  hawkers.  They find there are opportunities  for\r\n\r\nthem to make money and for the hawkers to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  with  them  just behind their business  in  East\r\n\r\nCoast Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Housing Board has also taken a very\r\n\r\nenlightened  view of the hawker problem in the  Kallang\r\n\r\nBoard  Estate.  They  put up as  many  as  436  hawkers\r\n\r\npitches. Now they propose to rent those pitches `to all\r\n\r\nhawkers  who  are now trading in shacks in  that  area.\r\n\r\nWhen the hawkers move into these new pitches, they  can\r\n\r\ndemolish  those  shacks. They give them  a  proprietary\r\n\r\nright to those pitches. Those hawkers who go into those\r\n\r\npitches will have to pay $10 a month and, at the end of\r\n\r\nthree years, the stall will be theirs - the site will  be\r\n\r\ntheirs to do as they will. And they pay a small fee  to\r\n\r\nthe  Hawkers Department to exercise proper control over\r\n\r\nthe  whole  problem.  That sort of operation  has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on, not only at Kallang but in Tanjong  Rhu,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Queenstown  area  and  in  many  other  areas   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so  that it is not true  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is dishonest in regard to the pledges it has\r\n\r\nmade  to the hawkers. Of course, we keep a close  watch\r\n\r\non  what  the  inspectors are doing.  We  have  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  a  Hawkers Advisory Committee  on  which  the\r\n\r\nHealth Department doctors, the Road Traffic people  and\r\n\r\nthe Police are represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have tried as much as we can to help them and see that there is an authority knowing what our inspectors are doing. They have to take out summonses against hawkers if they continue to obstruct the public roads, if they refuse to move into the sites that we make available for them. We have got to do\r\n\r\nsomething about it. Recently somebody rang me up in the\r\n\r\noffice  saying that just by the Clifford  Pier  on  the\r\n\r\nmain  road there was a man setting up a hawker's stall.\r\n\r\nIf  we  had  allowed that, there would have  been  more\r\n\r\ngoing  in  there, We had to take action immediately  to\r\n\r\nclear him out of there. That must be done in order that\r\n\r\nwe can keep our streets clear for traffic to move in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang said also that we were\r\n\r\nunfair  in  the way we allotted pitches and  stalls  to\r\n\r\nhawkers, that the allotments were handed over to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Hawkers'  Association.

If it is a tidal drain, then the tide is\r\n\r\na  strange  title  that never ebbs, because  the  water\r\n\r\nlevel  is  always high. If the Minister wants  to  know\r\n\r\nwhich  drain I am referring to specifically - all  drains\r\n\r\nare dirty - it is especially the drain beside the Garrick\r\n\r\nTheatre  and  it goes through the Haig Road  Government\r\n\r\nquarters  into  East Coast Road and  into  the  Kampong\r\n\r\nAmber  area down to the sea.

V. Devan Nair, which requested the removal  of\r\n\r\nthe President of the Arbitration Court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be recalled that there was a\r\n\r\nPress report on this and a photograph where we saw some\r\n\r\nyoung  feminine  members of the Bank  Employees'  Union\r\n\r\ngoing to the residence of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to\r\n\r\npresent  the  memorandum. I am  told  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment and Mr Devan Nair were not very happy about\r\n\r\nthe  contents  of the memorandum, but  because  of  the\r\n\r\npressure  of the members of the union and the executive\r\n\r\ncommittee, this memorandum was submitted. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister if he can explain what steps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   taken  on  the  contents   of   this\r\n\r\nmemorandum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> When parties in a dispute appear before\r\n\r\nthe courts they either succeed or lose, and it will  be\r\n\r\nquite  impossible  to  agree  that  when  a  party   is\r\n\r\ndissatisfied just because the decision did  not  go  in\r\n\r\nhis  favour, then the judge is to he removed. We cannot\r\n\r\naccept that that should be the position at all. In that\r\n\r\ncase, the dispute was whether a bonus was negotiable or\r\n\r\nnot.  The court held that it was and the Ordinance gave\r\n\r\nit  the power to decide such questions. The court  went\r\n\r\non  to apply the quantum of bonus awarded in an earlier\r\n\r\nbanking  caste  to  the  dispute  in  question  without\r\n\r\nhearing from, the union on the question of quantum, and\r\n\r\nthe  court had the power to so award.

It  is  specifically  so  laid  down  in   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. And he receives the same salary as a Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt   Judge.   All  Supreme  Court  Judges   get   an\r\n\r\nentertainment   allowance  of  $150   a   month,   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we  thought it right and  proper  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the  Court should  also  have  the  same\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park will remember that we\r\n\r\ncreated  the post of the Deputy President, and  it  was\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  amending Ordinance that  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPresident should exercise the same powers and have  the\r\n\r\nsame   protection  and  immunities  as  the  President.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we thought  that  it  was\r\n\r\nright  that  the Deputy President also should  have  an\r\n\r\nentertainment allowance. Now, the Deputy President is a\r\n\r\ncareer  officer  in the legal service of  Superscale  G\r\n\r\nstanding, and he has been seconded for service in  this\r\n\r\npost   as   Deputy   President,   These   entertainment\r\n\r\nallowances  are  attached  to  offices.  They  are  not\r\n\r\npersonal  allowances.  They  are  allowances  that  are\r\n\r\nattached  to  particular offices. We have  also  powers\r\n\r\nunder the Ordinance to appoint an acting President  and\r\n\r\nan  Acting  Deputy  President,  so  that  whenever  the\r\n\r\nPresident  or the Deputy President is away, the  Acting\r\n\r\nPresident or the Acting Deputy President can draw  upon\r\n\r\nthese  allowances. Not being personal  allowances,  the\r\n\r\nallowances  must be specially claimed and supported  by\r\n\r\nvouchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, I concede to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat if an allowance is properly payable in the case of\r\n\r\nthe  President, it should also be paid in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe  President  of  the  Second Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  I  certainly  concede that proposition.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Minister takes the view that,  because  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance sets out the status  and\r\n\r\nposition of a Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappointed under that Ordinance shall be similar to that\r\n\r\nof our Judges in the Supreme Court, therefore, anything\r\n\r\nthat  is  given to a Judge should also be  given  to  a\r\n\r\nJudge under the Industrial Arbitration Ordinance.  That\r\n\r\nI  do  not  accept, Mr Speaker, Sir. I think what  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Ordinance intended to do was  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the status and power and position  of  Judges\r\n\r\nand  give  them a similar status. I doubt whether  that\r\n\r\nproposition  could  reasonably include  the  contention\r\n\r\nthat,  because  a  Supreme  Court  Judge  is  given  an\r\n\r\nentertainment allowance, therefore, it follows that the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Court President should also get it; now, not\r\n\r\nall   our  Judges  get  entertainment  allowances.  Our\r\n\r\nDistrict  Judges  do not get entertainment  allowances.\r\n\r\nThe  Supreme Court Puisne Judges certainly do, and  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice  gets  a very much bigger  entertainment\r\n\r\nallowance than the Puisne Judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the main reason for giving our High Court\r\n\r\nJudges allowances - and I do not deny that they should be\r\n\r\ngiven  those  allowances - is  that  by  virtue  of  the\r\n\r\nposition   that  they  hold,  they  have  to   maintain\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  a  certain  manner  and  when  visiting\r\n\r\ndignitaries come, it is incumbent upon them to see that\r\n\r\nthey are properly entertained. I accept the proposition\r\n\r\nthat   our   Supreme  Court  Judges  should  be   given\r\n\r\nentertainment  allowances  for  which  they   are   not\r\n\r\naccountable in a voucher form.

The Government did not take him out or  force\r\n\r\nhim  to  come  out of that panel, just because  he  had\r\n\r\njoined the S.A.T.U. group. He was, in fact, a member of\r\n\r\nthat Court up to the date of his detention in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is easy for the Member for Thomson to impute bias against us. He very well knows that we found great difficulty. Every time there is a case to be heard by the Arbitration Court, the unions of the S.A.T.U. group refused to make an appointment with anybody in this panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You never wrote to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They refused to make an appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> So I invariably got letters from either\r\n\r\nthe  President  or the Deputy President  asking  me  to\r\n\r\nexercise  my powers, since they do not want to nominate\r\n\r\none  from  the  panel  on  to  the  Court,  to  make  a\r\n\r\nnomination myself.

In the\r\n\r\nfirst  place,  he talks about the T.U.C. days.  It  is\r\n\r\nbehind  times. The T.U.C. was dissolved in 1961 because\r\n\r\nMr  Kandasamy,  a  P.A.P. Member  and  the  Secretary-General  of  the T.U.C., went to see the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour, another P.A.P. Member, and asked for the T.U.C.\r\n\r\nto  be dissolved and the T.U.C. was dissolved. That was\r\n\r\nin 1961. This is now 1963, Mr Speaker, I agree that in\r\n\r\n1961, when the T.U.C. was asked to nominate, there were\r\n\r\ndifficulties in getting the names. That was because  of\r\n\r\nthe    political   considerations   that   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  gave  in the T.U.C. secretariat  when\r\n\r\ntheir  names were being considered. But, however,  that\r\n\r\nis a story relating back to 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, right at the moment, no union which is a non-P.A.P. union as such - I can name at least 40 trade\r\n\r\nunions representing more than 100,000 members has  ever\r\n\r\nbeen  invited  to  nominate members to  the  employees'\r\n\r\npanel. The Minister says that he has six now and I tell\r\n\r\nhim that he can appoint up to ten. Let him write to  us\r\n\r\ntomorrow  and we will nominate four names. Let  him  do\r\n\r\nthat.  Then there should be no difficulty.  If  he  had\r\n\r\nwritten  to  these unions and if they  had  refused  to\r\n\r\nnominate members to this panel, then he would have been\r\n\r\njustified in what he says. But this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not  the case. He has not invited at least  40 trade  unions, \r\n\r\nwhich constitute the  majority  of trade  unions  in Singapore, \r\n\r\nwhich  represent  the majority  of  the  working  population  and \r\n\r\nwhich represent  the  majority of disputes  arising,  to nominate \r\n\r\ntheir representatives to the  employees' panel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the unions of  this group  have  consistently shown by their  attitude \r\n\r\nthat  they  do  not  wish to  participate  in  the workings  of  this Court.\r\n\r\nThat is the  front  that they put up all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Everytime when there is a case to he heard,\r\n\r\nthey will not make a nomination  from  the panel,  and they leave it \r\n\r\nto the Minister to  make the nomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is because\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have  a member.  Mr  Byrne:  That is always the thing  that  \r\n\r\nthey have  done.  It  is not true for  the  Member  for Thomson  to \r\n\r\njust gloss over all these things  and say,  \"Oh,  yes, that was in 1961.\" For two  solid years  from  20th October, 1960,  when  the  First \r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court began to function, we have written repeatedly\r\n\r\nto them and asked them  to make  their nominations to this panel.  Under  \r\n\r\nthe powers  of  the Ordinance, before it was  amended, they  had  the  right\r\n\r\nto appoint all  ten  to  the employees' panel. They refused to do so and \r\n\r\nuntil today  they have not shown that they have  changed their attitude at \r\n\r\nall.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I wish to point this out. Perhaps the Minister is under a misapprehension. He is talking of two things at the same time, One is the appointment of a member from the employees' panel to sit in the Court to hear a dispute, and the other is what I referred to just now under section 6 subsection 3 (b) where the Minister may invite a\r\n\r\ntrade  union to nominate for the inclusion in  the\r\n\r\nemployees' panel such number of persons as he  may\r\n\r\nspecify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point. Today, because these 40\r\n\r\nunions  do  not have on the employees'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npanel  such persons  as they themselves have appointed  to  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the employees' panel, when a case goes\r\n\r\nbefore  the Court, these unions do not know  which\r\n\r\nmember of the employees' panel to choose. If there\r\n\r\nis  a  dispute concerning a bank employees'  union\r\n\r\nand an employer, the bank employees' union chooses\r\n\r\na  member  from  the employees' panel  because  it\r\n\r\nknows,  perhaps, that so and so in the  employees'\r\n\r\npanel  can represent the union's interest well  in\r\n\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to these 40-odd unions, this is not possible\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not have, at the moment,  anybody\r\n\r\nin  the employees' panel whom they have nominated.\r\n\r\nThis is  what the Minister means  when  he  says\r\n\r\nsometimes we do not nominate members to the court.\r\n\r\nThat  is  quite so, Sir. But my grievance  is  not\r\n\r\nabout  that.  I say, to remedy this position,  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  under  section 6  subsection  (3)   (b) ,\r\n\r\nshould  write to, if not the 40 unions,  at  least\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  big  unions,  and  invite  them  to\r\n\r\nnominate  names  for inclusion in  the  employees'\r\n\r\npanel. There is no question of our not wanting  to\r\n\r\ngo  to court. Surely if the Minister looks up  the\r\n\r\nrecords,  he knows the number of cases  these  so-called  Communist unions have taken  to  court.  I\r\n\r\ngive a pledge to the Minister that if he writes to\r\n\r\nus  tomorrow, within a matter of a week,  we  will\r\n\r\nnominate. There are four places. The Minister says\r\n\r\nthere  are  only six at the moment. The  Ordinance\r\n\r\nallows  up  to ten. We will nominate four,  if  we\r\n\r\ncan,  and  if not, at least two, Let the  Minister\r\n\r\nwrite to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  has given  an  assurance  in\r\n\r\npublic  that  he  supports  this  court  as  such.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, their attitude was this. \"This was  the\r\n\r\ncourt   that   the   Government   had   set   up.\" [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> \"We did not participate in this\r\n\r\ncourt.

He  said,  \"Mr\r\n\r\nByrne,  we  make four. You make the rest. This  is  the\r\n\r\ncourt that the Government set up.\" I like to hear  what\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson said. He said so  publicly  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly today that he fully supports this court,\r\n\r\nand  that  if  the Minister writes to him he  is  quite\r\n\r\nprepared  to suggest at least two names. I pointed  out\r\n\r\nto  this  Assembly  that Mr James  Puthucheary  was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  this court. There was a split. He  was  not\r\n\r\nremoved  because  he  joined  the  S.A.T.U. group.  He\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  serve on the panel. I pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  these four vacancies. We could have  tilled\r\n\r\nall  the  vacancies. But we have left four appointments\r\n\r\nstill  vacant on this panel. In view of what the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Thomson  has  said,  we  are  prepared  to   give\r\n\r\nconsideration ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Write to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> --- to his request in this Assembly, in view\r\n\r\nof what he has said here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, I originally wanted to speak\r\n\r\nalso  under amendment (7)*, but since the Minister  has raised this, I might as well \r\n\r\nmake the speech now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  Amendment (7) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 29 be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no question of our supporting the court\r\n\r\nor  not  supporting  the court. The  Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nexists and it will continue to function so long as  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance is in force. Sir, I  can\r\n\r\nsay that we have never boycotted the court as such.  We\r\n\r\nhave had our reservations. If today the Bank Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  can  say, \"Petition the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,\r\n\r\nthrow  the President out\" - and it is because this was  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate complaint; there was discontent. We had  our\r\n\r\nreservations. We do not want to run to the  court  like\r\n\r\nthe Bank Employees' Union. Devan Nair faces the workers\r\n\r\nand  makes  a  very fiery speech. Tempers  go  up.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  say  they  want to go on  strike.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nagainst the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  to call strikes because more strikes will  mean\r\n\r\nmore  Communists  coming out. But, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot possibly tell the workers, \"Do not  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike,\" because the workers would turn around and  say\r\n\r\nto  Devan Nair. \"You are not brave enough to lead us on\r\n\r\nstrike.\"  So  they call a strike for a few  days.  Then\r\n\r\nthey  go  to  the Minister and say, \"Please,  Minister,\r\n\r\nrefer it to the Arbitration Court,\" And so they had one\r\n\r\nstrike   after   another - the  Bank  of   America,   the\r\n\r\nMercantile Bank, the Chartered Bank, the Straits Times,\r\n\r\none  after  another all these went to  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not operate on this basis. And we say, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   unreservedly,  that  we  believe  that   the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  can fulfil  a  useful  function  in\r\n\r\nsolving   industrial   disputes  and   in   maintaining\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace.  But as to whether  this  court  can\r\n\r\nsucceed  or  not  will  depend on the  individuals  who\r\n\r\noperate  this court, including the Government. But  the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants a pledge as to whether we are going  to\r\n\r\nsupport the court. I do not see his question. We do not\r\n\r\nboycott  the court. We go to the court. There  was  the\r\n\r\nPlywood  case. I cannot remember offhand,  but  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister wants, I can list the number of cases that  we\r\n\r\nhave  referred to arbitration, Fraser and Co, went  on\r\n\r\nstrike.  We  asked the Ministry of Labour  Conciliation\r\n\r\nOfficer  to  get  the employer to agree  to  refer  the\r\n\r\ndispute  to  arbitration.  The  employer  refused.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment did nothing about it. Watts & Baker went  on\r\n\r\nstrike.  Ford went on strike. In the Straits Times,  43\r\n\r\nworkers  made a demonstration today because  they  were\r\n\r\nsacked  for  getting cholera inoculations. We  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister, \"Refer this case to arbitration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are facts. He tried to put on a show that\r\n\r\nwe  boycotted the court. We were against the  operation\r\n\r\nof the court and, therefore, we should not be given the\r\n\r\nright to appoint members to the employees' panel. I say\r\n\r\nthis is merely, in the usual P.A.P. fashion, a cover to\r\n\r\nprotect  the wrong that they have done to the  majority\r\n\r\nof  unions. I hope, Mr Speaker, that the Minister will\r\n\r\ngive a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npledge that he will write to these unions, ask them  to\r\n\r\nnominate members to the employees' panel and we  pledge\r\n\r\nto nominate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will give\r\n\r\nconsideration  to this request. As far as  the  strikes\r\n\r\nthat were referred to just now are concerned, I do  not\r\n\r\nknow what the facts are. But I know it was the habit of\r\n\r\nthe  unions  in this particular group to strike  first,\r\n\r\nand  then when they get the worst of it, they  try  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court.  That is not playing  fair  by  the\r\n\r\ncourt.  If  they cannot get their way, it is only  when\r\n\r\nthey  fail in the strike that they say. \"We go  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr S.\r\n\r\nT.

We definitely have certain reservations  as\r\n\r\nto  whether  these Arbitration Courts can fulfil  their\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  establishing industrial  justice.  These\r\n\r\nreservations  are justified by events that  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the proper functioning of these courts, one\r\n\r\nof  the necessary things the Government ought to do  is\r\n\r\nto ensure that there is no governmental intervention in\r\n\r\nthe  proceedings  of  the Arbitration  Court.  As,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in the case of a journalist who was dismissed\r\n\r\nby  Kerala  Bandhu Press in 1961, the proceedings  were\r\n\r\ninterrupted under a cloak of secrecy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  an  award  was made without the case  being  fully\r\n\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, it is necessary to give all\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  the facilities of participation  in  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  of  the  court - the  facilities  to  appear\r\n\r\nbefore the court. Sir, the proceedings of the court are\r\n\r\nconducted  in English. There are very few  trade  union\r\n\r\nofficers  who are English-educated and who arc  capable\r\n\r\nof  presenting  cases in English.  We  have  made  this\r\n\r\nrequest in the past and we renew this request again -  we\r\n\r\nthink  that  the courts must allow for multi-lingualism\r\n\r\nin the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just one\r\n\r\nobservation. Under the Industrial Courts Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nMinister  responsible  for this  is  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour. I am therefore, wondering whether it would  not\r\n\r\nbe   proper   that   such   estimates   should   appear\r\n\r\nappropriately under the Ministry of Lahour instead  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Thio?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there really was not any\r\n\r\ngovernmental  intervention as such. The only  thing  is\r\n\r\nthat  the court was made aware of reasons why the paper\r\n\r\nin  question  was  not  allowed  to  circulate  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  That cannot be held to be intervention  of\r\n\r\nany   sort   of   governmental  intervention   in   the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of facilities for participation. We have the ordinary courts of criminal and civil jurisdiction here, where the proceedings are in English. There would be chaos, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the proceedings were to be conducted in Tamil or in Malay or in Chinese in this Court.

I wish to\r\n\r\nbring to your notice that I had given notice of  an amendment  \r\n\r\nunder  item  (20) ,  but  because  under  the \"Notes\"  column, \r\n\r\nwithin brackets the words \"se\" appear, it would appear that my \r\n\r\nnotice was treated as being out of  order. My contention is this: that my notice was in\r\n\r\norder,  because  under  section  30  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council, subsection (7) , if you\r\n\r\nwill permit me to read it, Mr Speaker, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The State Advocate-General shall be paid such\r\n\r\nremuneration and allowances as may from time to time be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by the Assembly, and such remuneration  and\r\n\r\nallowances  shall be charged on and  paid  out  of  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  unless  and  until the remuneration and  allowances\r\n\r\nhave  been determined by this Assembly, they shall  not\r\n\r\nbe  chargeable on the Consolidated Fund, and it is only\r\n\r\ncharges  on  the Consolidated Fund that  are  items  of\r\n\r\nstatutory  expenditure.  So  until  the  Assembly   has\r\n\r\napproved  the allowances of the State Advocate-General,\r\n\r\nit is not a charge on the Consolidated Fund. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit is not statutory expenditure. Therefore. I am within\r\n\r\nmy rights in moving the amendment.

Mr\r\n\r\nRajah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the point is a constitutional one.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing intricate about it.  There  are  two\r\n\r\npoints,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir. One  is  a  constitutional\r\n\r\npoint.  You  see, Sir, the remuneration  of  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  was.  I  think,   determined   by   a\r\n\r\nresolution of this Assembly on 16th July, 1959.  It  is\r\n\r\nsubsequent  to that resolution that it became  possible\r\n\r\nfor the Government to put it down in the Budget. Unless\r\n\r\nand until a resolution has been framed and approved  by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly in respect of the $6,000, my  submission\r\n\r\nto  the  Assembly  would he that  this  $6,000  is  not\r\n\r\nproperly entered in the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item I wish to bring to the notice of the\r\n\r\nAssembly  is  this.  The point  that  would  have  been\r\n\r\nraised, certainly by me if a resolution to this  effect\r\n\r\nhad  been brought to the House, would be this: that the\r\n\r\nremuneration of the State Advocate-General is  $24,900.\r\n\r\nThe remuneration of the Chief Justice, which is on page\r\n\r\n45  of  the Estimates, is $28,500. So remuneration  for\r\n\r\nremuneration, there is a difference which reflects  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  the  position and  the  status  of  the\r\n\r\nposition in our constitutional setup. This allowance of\r\n\r\n$6,000  which, really, in effect is a remuneration,  if\r\n\r\nadded to the State Advocate-General's salary, makes  it\r\n\r\n$30,900, which makes him $2,400 above that of the Chief\r\n\r\nJustice. Now, Mr Speaker, that is a position I  cannot\r\n\r\naccept. That is the second point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is: I object on principle, and I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw  will  agree  with me on this,  that  no  allowance\r\n\r\nshould  be paid to the holder of any office special  to\r\n\r\nhimself.  He  is the holder of the post.  The  post  is\r\n\r\nevaluated at a certain sum of money. He gets  that  and\r\n\r\nnothing more. It is an invidious business that when the\r\n\r\npresent  holder  vacates  his office,  either  in  five\r\n\r\nyears' time or two years' time as the case may be,  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  incumbent of that post is not going  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven $2,400 on the basis that \"You are not as good  as\r\n\r\nthe previous chap.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on these three points, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ncertainly object to this special allowance personal  to\r\n\r\nthe  present  holder  of the post  of  State  Advocate-General. The only reason for my giving notice  of  item\r\n\r\n(21)   was  to join the two together and speak  on  them\r\n\r\ntogether. Now that I have made my point on item (20), I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to say anything more on item (21), because\r\n\r\nthe  State  Advocate-General gets  his  usual  variable\r\n\r\nallowance  which  any other officer in  the  Government\r\n\r\ngets.  That  is  why  I wanted to  raise  this  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand this\r\n\r\nallowance   was  paid  to  the  State  Advocate-General\r\n\r\nbecause he is not only the State Advocate-General,  but\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent  Secretary of  the  legal  side  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health and Law. He has a lot of duties  to\r\n\r\ndischarge.  Not only has he to exercise  his  functions\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution  in  the  matter  of  criminal\r\n\r\nprosecutions   and   advise   all   Government    legal\r\n\r\ndepartments,  but he is also the Head of  his  Chambers\r\n\r\nand  the  Head, as Permanent Secretary, of a number  of\r\n\r\nvery  important Government legal departments, like  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee  and  Public Trustee's  Office,  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Companies, the Registry of Trade Marks, the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Names  and Patents Office,  the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nMarriages,  the  Registry  of  Muslim  Marriages,   the\r\n\r\nShariah  Court, the Legal Aid Bureau, and the  Juvenile\r\n\r\nCourt.  He exercises administrative control over  these\r\n\r\nimportant  legal departments. Now that is quite  unlike\r\n\r\nwhat  the Judges do. We found it impossible to pay  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General a sum equal to or more than that\r\n\r\nof  the Chief Justice. It would be quite improper if we\r\n\r\ndid that. On the other hand, we must recognise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the State Advocate-General carries more duties. He\r\n\r\nhas  to discharge more duties, and he is vested with  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  responsibilities for which  he  would  not  he\r\n\r\nadequately compensated if he were to receive  a  salary\r\n\r\nlower  than that of the Chief Justice without  adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation. For that reason, it has been agreed  that\r\n\r\nhe should get his allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can I say a few words about this\r\n\r\nmatter, Mr Speaker, Sir? Since no notice was given  of\r\n\r\nthis item. I have not come here prepared with the brief\r\n\r\non   the  constitutional  position  of  this  item   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure. But may I tell the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nabout the practical considerations which have led us to\r\n\r\ngive  him this allowance personal to himself?  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Member for Farrer Park that it is not a  good\r\n\r\npractice,  but  nevertheless there  are  precedents  of\r\n\r\nallowances  personal  to  the  holder,  and  these  are\r\n\r\ncarried out only in exceptional circumstances. There is\r\n\r\nevery  reason  to  consider  his  appointment  and  his\r\n\r\nallowances  as  exceptional. He is a man of  tremendous\r\n\r\nbreadth and depth of intellect, a man whose ability  at\r\n\r\nlegal  draftsmanship is unsurpassed  in  this  country.\r\n\r\nFurther. I should like to inform the House that he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  invited by the United Nations to serve in a  very\r\n\r\nhigh  office in that institution, the salary for  which\r\n\r\nwould  be considerably more than what we are now paying\r\n\r\nhim.  And  in fairness to him and in acknowledgment  of\r\n\r\nhis great abilities, Government has agreed to grant him\r\n\r\nthis  allowance.  If  judgment  is  made  on  practical\r\n\r\nconsiderations as against the constitutional legalistic\r\n\r\naspect, I do not think anyone will grudge the incumbent\r\n\r\nthis additional allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not grudging the\r\n\r\nincumbent his allowance. In fact, I feel very sorry for\r\n\r\nhaving to raise this, but I feel it my duty to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that on previous occasions when it was suggested that the State Advocate-General should be the Permanent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary  to a Minister, I objected to it. I  objected\r\n\r\nin the most categorical terms, I told the House that it\r\n\r\nwas  not right for the State Advocate-General to be the\r\n\r\nhead  of  a department in respect of which he might  be\r\n\r\ncalled   upon  to  give  advice  against   some   other\r\n\r\ndepartment,  and  that  would  place  him,  the   State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General, in an invidious position if  he  were\r\n\r\nmade the Permanent Secretary to a Minister. Because  as\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary to the Minister, he is a servant to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  but  as  State Advocate-General  he  is\r\n\r\noutside  the control of the Minister and in a  position\r\n\r\nto  say  yes  or  no  to him. And because  of  the  two\r\n\r\ncapacities  in  which  he  has  to  function,  I   have\r\n\r\nadvocated  that  those  two  functions  should  not  he\r\n\r\nconferred  on the State Advocate-General and he  should\r\n\r\nremain  State  Advocate-General, pure and  simple,  and\r\n\r\nnothing else,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I sympathise entirely with the plight of the Government. If I were the Government, it could be that I might try to do something about it. But the way in which it is being done is absolutely wrong. To put it under the heading \"Special Allowance personal to present holder of post of State Advocate-General - $6,000\" straightaway, puts it in opposition to\r\n\r\nthe post of Chief Justice and invidious comparisons are\r\n\r\nmade between the two. Under our Constitution, the Chief\r\n\r\nJustice enjoys a very much higher status than the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General, as it must inevitably be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the services of the State Advocate-General in\r\n\r\nthe  special circumstances in which the Government  now\r\n\r\nfinds  itself are absolutely invaluable to them at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  then  I  would suggest to the Government  that\r\n\r\nthis  is not the way to do it. There are several  other\r\n\r\nways of doing it, and it is not for me to suggest them.\r\n\r\nMy business this evening is to tell the Government that\r\n\r\nthis  is  absolutely the wrong way to do it - to  give  a\r\n\r\nspecial allowance personal to the present holder of the\r\n\r\npost  of State Advocate-General is wrong.

I just wonder whether  after\r\n\r\nfour  years this post is now necessary, because if  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries who may  be  regarded  as  super\r\n\r\ngraduates  have most of them been found to be  disloyal\r\n\r\nand so dangerous that they must be sent somewhere else,\r\n\r\nmaybe  there  is no necessity for having this  training\r\n\r\nschool,  In  any case, after four years, whatever  work\r\n\r\nthat  the school was intended to do must have been done\r\n\r\nalready.  Unless, Sir, the Finance Minister feels  that\r\n\r\nthere are still many more in the Government service who\r\n\r\nmust  undergo training through this school.

He  is  not  a\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary. The fact that the word \"Political\"\r\n\r\noccurs  in both posts does not mean that there  is  any\r\n\r\nsimilarity in the duties of these two posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, I have had to explain what work the\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre does and what the objectives the\r\n\r\nGovernment hopes to achieve by the work done  there.  I\r\n\r\ndo not think I want to repeat the arguments advanced in\r\n\r\n1961 when this subject was debated at some length.  But\r\n\r\nobviously the Member for Tanglin is in some doubt as to\r\n\r\nthe  value of this training. There are two ways whereby\r\n\r\nI  can  convince  him that this is valuable  work.  The\r\n\r\nfirst is by arguments and I would like to impress  upon\r\n\r\nhim  that in the last 18 months, the reputation of this\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre has spread beyond the shores  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  that the Governments of Sarawak,  North\r\n\r\nBorneo and the Federation of Malaya have called upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  staff of this centre to run courses for their  own\r\n\r\nofficers  in  their  respective territories.  You  will\r\n\r\nrecollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when we started  this\r\n\r\ninnovation. Members opposite, particularly those in the\r\n\r\nS.P.A., were highly suspicious of it. They thought that\r\n\r\nthis  was an attempt to indoctrinate the civil  service\r\n\r\nwith  P.A.P. ideology. Now, I am sure they  will  agree\r\n\r\nthat  if  that, in fact, had been the purpose and  that\r\n\r\nhad been what is being done in the centre, it is highly\r\n\r\nunlikely that the Governments of Sarawak, North Borneo,\r\n\r\nand the Federation would have asked for the services of\r\n\r\nthe officers of this training centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which I can convince the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  that  the duties of this post  are  completely\r\n\r\nunrelated   and  dissimilar  to  those   of   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary, is perhaps to invite him to attend a course.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  the  Director will agree to  make  special\r\n\r\nprovision  and extend an invitation to the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin.  I am also equally convinced that it  will  do\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin a lot of good. I am sure he will\r\n\r\nemerge   from  the  Centre  a  much  wiser  man,   more\r\n\r\npolitically sophisticated and convinced that  the  work\r\n\r\ndone  there  is impartial, non-party and of  tremendous\r\n\r\nvalue  to sustaining the democratic system against  the\r\n\r\nonslaught of its enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, judging by the\r\n\r\nfact  that  what  we have foretold  has  proved  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrect,  as  in  the  case of the resignation  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture,  I\r\n\r\ndo not think that I require any more brain-washing from\r\n\r\ntheir  side.

First of\r\n\r\nall, I would like to say this. There is a background to\r\n\r\nthe setting up of this Political Study Centre. Soon\r\n\r\nafter the 1959 elections, when the P.A.P. came into\r\n\r\nofficer' many Ministers, who did not really understand\r\n\r\nhow and why they were put into office, exhibited the\r\n\r\npride of being elected by the people, and they went on,\r\n\r\nto despise the English-educated, especially the English-educated civil servants who, the P.A.P. knew, largely\r\n\r\nvoted against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that one of the main reasons why the\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre was set up was to try  and  make\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants understand the aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses, so that, in their day-to-day duties, they would\r\n\r\nunderstand  the problems of our people  in  the  proper\r\n\r\nperspective  and  be  able  to  deaf  with  them   more\r\n\r\neffectively.  Sir, to the extent that a course  in  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Study  Centre will not  alienate  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants  from  the masses and the aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses,  we  welcome the setting up  of  the  Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre. It is because of this that  people  like\r\n\r\nWoodhull  and  James  Puthucheary  undertook  to   give\r\n\r\nlectures. But in practice, as the P.A.P. has done  with\r\n\r\nvarious  other State institutions, the Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre,  far from fulfilling the purpose for  which  it\r\n\r\nwas originally set up, became an institution for making\r\n\r\nP.A.P. propaganda,  for  trying  to  make  the   civil\r\n\r\nservants owe allegiance to the P.A.P. as such. And  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin is quite correct in  what  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid. In the course of lectures, personalities of other\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties, political opponents of the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nhave  been  degraded,  and there have  been  deliberate\r\n\r\nattempts  to  try and orientate the civil  servants  to\r\n\r\nthink  like  the  P.A.P.  Ministers.  Sir,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters, who, I said, soon after the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelections,  did  not  understand the  feelings  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated,  are today no better  off  than  they\r\n\r\nwere before. It will be remembered how they stood up to\r\n\r\nspite  the English-educated. Today they think  that  by\r\n\r\ncontinuing  the Political Study Centre  they  stand  to\r\n\r\ngain,  because  they  believe that  they  can  get  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated - I  am  referring   to   the   English-educated,  because the majority of the  people  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil service are English-educated - to be the supporters\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. for the P.A.P. cause, as  against  what\r\n\r\nthey  call  the Communist cause. I like  to  tell  them\r\n\r\nthis. I really have great sympathy for people like  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, the Minister for Culture ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I feel sorry for you now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am grateful, you know. Feel sorry by all\r\n\r\nmeans.  When  they used to flex their  muscles  to  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated and told them that  they  must  go  on\r\n\r\ntheir  bended  knees and beg and be happy and  grateful\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  alive, they did  not  understand  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated. We were much more realistic. We  knew\r\n\r\nthat  it was a matter of fact that the majority of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated, the majority of the  civil  servants,\r\n\r\nwere  alienated from the mass of the people, and  that,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they  were  not  able  to  understand   the\r\n\r\nfeelings,  the thinking and aspirations of the  masses.\r\n\r\nFar   from   trying   to  understand   their   problems\r\n\r\nobjectively  and  providing a proper  orientation,  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Study Centre was turned into an  institution\r\n\r\nfor  instilling  civil servants with  so-called  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nideology,  though  I do not think the  P.A.P. has  any\r\n\r\nideology  anyway. And it is sad, in spite  of  all  the\r\n\r\nmoney  spent  out of public funds, the Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre today is no better than it was before. And  this\r\n\r\nis because it is being put to misuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> First of all, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Member for Thomson whether he has been anywhere\r\n\r\nnear  the  precincts  of  the Political  Study  Centre.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] When?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have never seen him, Sir. I am a\r\n\r\nregular goer to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical  Study  Centre, and I  have  never  seen  him\r\n\r\nanywhere around there. [Interruption] The only time  he\r\n\r\nmight have come was when Mr James Puthucheary and  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull occasionally left their trade union affairs to\r\n\r\ncome and help us out in the construction of the courses\r\n\r\nfor  the  Political  Study Centre. In  fact,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncourse  itself is more or less what was agreed upon  by\r\n\r\nMr  George Thomson, Mr Woodhull, Mr Devan Nair,  Mr\r\n\r\nJames Puthucheary, the Minister for Finance, myself and\r\n\r\na few others. The course is still the same; the outline\r\n\r\nis  the  same. One of the things about the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  is  that  when  he talks  about  the  English-educated being alienated from the masses, what he means\r\n\r\nis  that  the  people  are  being  alienated  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  And  when he talks of people,  masses,  he\r\n\r\nequates them to the Communists, the M.C.P., we begin to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  drift  of his  conversations  and  his\r\n\r\nspeeches.  If  he  wants any proof that  the  Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre is a success, the first is the fact  that\r\n\r\nthere   are  Right-wing  Governments  who  are  equally\r\n\r\nsuspicious of the Political Study Centre. The  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernments  in  the  Borneo  territories  are  equally\r\n\r\nsuspicious   of  the  Political  Study  Centre.   Civil\r\n\r\nservants  were  initially suspicious of  the  Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre.  What happened was  a  number  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants  came anxiously, nervously - they  sent  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo - to  the Political Study Centre. Having gone  there,\r\n\r\nthey  told us quite openly, \"We were quite afraid. When\r\n\r\nwe  came  here, we thought that there was going  to  be\r\n\r\nP.A.P. propaganda, socialist propaganda and  Communist\r\n\r\npropaganda.\" They said that the two weeks'  course  was\r\n\r\nso  revealing  that  they  were  going  back  to  their\r\n\r\nrespective  governments to recommend that  other  civil\r\n\r\nservants be sent here. This group of officers came here\r\n\r\nat about the time when our friends decided they did not\r\n\r\nwant merger, when they felt that Singapore should merge\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia.  At about that time,  when  there  was\r\n\r\ntrouble brewing in the Borneo territories, the officers\r\n\r\nwho  were  sent  said,  \"It  is  necessary,  since  our\r\n\r\nofficers  sooner or later are going to be  troubled  by\r\n\r\nthe  same  elements that have been troubling Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt is a good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthing  to send more officers, especially civil servants\r\n\r\nin  the  Borneo territories who are more or  less  like\r\n\r\nDistrict  Officers a single officer  has  control  over\r\n\r\nlarge  tracts of territory; he is more or  less  a  law\r\n\r\nunto  himself - and it is necessary that  these  officers\r\n\r\nshould  get  a political grasp of what is going  on - not\r\n\r\nP.A.P. propaganda, as the Member for Thomson  said - the\r\n\r\nessentials of democracy, the enemies of democracy,  how\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  function, how they subvert,  how  they\r\n\r\noperate.\" Even the Federation Government also sent down\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this the Political Study Centre is serving\r\n\r\na   useful   function,  and  to  the   civil   servants\r\n\r\nthemselves. Initially, they were reluctant to come. Not\r\n\r\nonly   are  the  civil  servants  now  requesting   for\r\n\r\nrefresher  courses,  but  for the  information  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson,  who  runs  the  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union, he will be interested to know that  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of business firms have already started  sending\r\n\r\nofficers  and  staff  to  attend  the  Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre. The heat with which the Member for Thomson  has\r\n\r\nbeen  slanging  away at the Political Study  Centre  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  understandable, because just as he  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  capture a number of  unions  which  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to get into the civil service and to manipulate\r\n\r\npeople, I can tell him that very soon he will find it a\r\n\r\nlittle  more  difficult  to  mislead  the  workers   in\r\n\r\ncommercial firms, especially the English-educated.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  he  is  up  to  and what his friends  are  up  to -\r\n\r\n[Interruption]. I can see a great deal of anxiety being\r\n\r\ngenerated, but in course of time all firms ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What firms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- will be included in this course\r\n\r\nand  maybe  some private practitioners will  also  find\r\n\r\nmembers of their staff coming to these courses. Anyway,\r\n\r\nSir,  it has proved itself. This Political Study Centre\r\n\r\nis   something  independent  of  P.A.P. ideology   or\r\n\r\nindoctrination and it has become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  crucial and an effective weapon against the  enemies\r\n\r\nof democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You do not believe all this, do you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A lot of revealing things have\r\n\r\ncome  out.

Now, they are telling  us\r\n\r\nthat  even  business  firms  are  making  use  of  this\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre.

The\r\n\r\nParty hopes that the civil servants will understand the\r\n\r\nsituation of the P.A.P., and particularly the  position\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. in the general election to come and  the\r\n\r\nchange  of  policies  of the P.A.P. during  these  two\r\n\r\nyears.  I  must  give this advice to the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, that no matter how the P.A.P. Government tries\r\n\r\nto make use of the so-called political training to make\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants change their attitude towards  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., it is impossible for them to achieve this  aim.\r\n\r\nIt  is merely a waste of time and a waste of effort.  I\r\n\r\nwill  explain  to  you further on this  point.  I  came\r\n\r\nacross some civil servants and casually we talked about\r\n\r\nthese  things.  Generally speaking, the civil  servants\r\n\r\nwill never, never forget and forgive the P.A.P. for the\r\n\r\nunilateral  and  arbitrary  action  in  reducing  their\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I wish to remind the hon. Member\r\n\r\nthat  the time allotted for the Ministry of Finance  is\r\n\r\nending at 9.40 p.m. If the Member is going too long  on\r\n\r\nthe  pay  cut  of  the civil servants,  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers will be losing their chances to speak on  other\r\n\r\nitems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the meantime, the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants will never, never forget; neither  will\r\n\r\nthey  ever  forgive  the  P.A.P.  Ministers  for  their\r\n\r\narrogance  and  for their sneer at them  in  1959.  So,\r\n\r\nalthough the P.A.P. Government, especially our Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  who is quite clever and intelligent  and\r\n\r\nwho  is  quite  good  in  buying  over  talented  civil\r\n\r\nservants and get them into his own Ministry, no  matter\r\n\r\nhow hard they try, the civil servants will never, never\r\n\r\nforget  and  forgive the P.A.P. for their pay  cut  and\r\n\r\ntheir arrogance.

The Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nsaid  just now that the Federation Government  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernments of the Borneo territories quite  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  work done by the Political Training Centre, but  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  it  very much since the P.A.P. is providing  all\r\n\r\nthe  staff  for the training of civil servants  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  other  territories. I am quite  suspicious  of\r\n\r\ntheir  motives. Because on the advent of Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants of the other territories will have  got\r\n\r\nthe  influence  of the P.A.P. No matter how  hard  they\r\n\r\ntry,  I  will  tell  this  House,  although  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants of the other territories have not been given a\r\n\r\ndose   of  the  arrogance  of  the  P.A.P.,  they  will\r\n\r\nnevertheless have some influence from the  local  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have noticed in\r\n\r\nthe  last few days that a new strategy is being pursued\r\n\r\nby   the  Barisan  Sosialis;  for  example,  they  have\r\n\r\nsuddenly  come to criticising the pay cut. I  have  had\r\n\r\noccasion a few days ago to look at the speeches made by\r\n\r\nsome  of  the Members opposite and, I think,  including\r\n\r\nthat of the Member for Havelock on the pay cut. We have\r\n\r\nnever  regretted at that time having made the  pay  cut\r\n\r\nand  still  regretting it. There is justification,  but\r\n\r\ntoday the Barisan Sosialis, with complete cynicism, are\r\n\r\nusing  this purely as part of their strategy  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown  everything  with them; upset the civil  servants,\r\n\r\nthe  bourgeoisie. Yesterday they were in defence of bus\r\n\r\nowners employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. So far the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  made his point in reply to the Member for Havelock\r\n\r\non the pay cut and the civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the other point is that we are\r\n\r\nnot  interested  in  running  this  Political  Training\r\n\r\nCentre to get civil  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants' votes for the P.A.P. If we want to  do  that,\r\n\r\nthere  are  other  ways of doing  it.  I  have  already\r\n\r\nindicated  that this is a course whereby we have  tried\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the civil service performs  its  basic\r\n\r\nfunction  of  translating  effectively  the  cause   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy to the people. One of the main things of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists is always to destroy the State structure, to\r\n\r\nbring  the  police and its bureaucracy into  disrepute.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   this   Political   Training   Centre   was\r\n\r\ninstituted not to give P.A.P. propaganda but to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the bureaucracy, the civil service, can use their\r\n\r\nmachinery effectively, as they are entitled to do,  not\r\n\r\nas  politicians but as civil servants to safeguard  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic   system   against  the  encroachment,   the\r\n\r\ninundation of the anti-democratic forces. That  is  the\r\n\r\nmain reason why the Federation Government, knowing full\r\n\r\nwell  that  though it is a Political Study Centre  from\r\n\r\nSingapore of the P.A.P. Government, knowing that it  is\r\n\r\nneutral  as  far  as party politics are concerned,  has\r\n\r\nrequested the services of our training officers as well\r\n\r\nas  sending  their  officers  to  the  Political  Study\r\n\r\nCentre. I notice the Member for Have-lock is now trying\r\n\r\nto  play  a little game, and says that he is trying  to\r\n\r\nwarn the Federation Government that the P.A.P. is going\r\n\r\nto subvert their civil servants and therefore please do\r\n\r\nnot  send them. Sir, they know that most civil servants\r\n\r\nwho  are  trained at the Political Training Centre  can\r\n\r\ncarry on the battle for democracy in the Federation, in\r\n\r\nBorneo, in Sarawak and we hope in other places as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Any more Members who wish to speak?

When final agreement is reached,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  that  there  may be some  variation  to  this\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy covers not only the difference between\r\n\r\nthe  rate of interest of the market terms and  that  of\r\n\r\nthe   subsidised  terms,  but  also  other  items.  One\r\n\r\nimportant  item is the property tax which in  1962  the\r\n\r\nGovernment levied on vacant properties of the Board. We\r\n\r\nfelt  that  since  the  Board was performing  a  social\r\n\r\nservice  to the public - the Board is in fact an  agency\r\n\r\nof    the    Government    in   respect    of    public\r\n\r\nhousing - therefore  it appears to deserve  some  special\r\n\r\ntreatment by way of tax on vacant properties. There  is\r\n\r\nalso  an  item  representing the loss incurred  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard in respect of certain houses that were let out in\r\n\r\nprevious  years  at  sub-economic  rents,  even   after\r\n\r\nallowing  for lower rates of interest then  charged  to\r\n\r\nthe Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked for the amount of\r\n\r\nloans that this subsidy would cover.

It could only  be  used\r\n\r\nfor   town   improvement,  like  backlanes   and   slum\r\n\r\nclearance.  So  that it would appear  that  the  proper\r\n\r\nbeneficiary - if  the Government intends to  be  generous\r\n\r\nabout  this  thing - is not the Housing Board  but  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Authority. But the Planning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthority,  at  the moment, do not  seem  to  have  any\r\n\r\nstatutory  functions  in  the way  of  putting  through\r\n\r\nbacklanes or the clearing of slums. So I would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat, as the vote is worded, it seems to be ultra vires\r\n\r\nand a matter on which the Government cannot act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer Park, I\r\n\r\nthink,  would  be  quite correct  if,  in  fact,  these\r\n\r\npayments  were  to be made in respect of  the  position\r\n\r\nafter  the  establishment of the  Housing  Board.

It was decided in 1950 that the  amount\r\n\r\nas calculated was unduly low and, accordingly, the cost\r\n\r\nof  living allowances paid to pensioners were approved.\r\n\r\nRoughly, the rates are: on the first $50 of pension  10\r\n\r\nper  cent, second $50 four per cent, and so on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.

In fact, the actual  expenditure\r\n\r\nfor 1959 was $50,199. In 1960, it was $47,285. So there\r\n\r\nwas  not  a  very  significant drop. But  in  1961  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure dropped to $35,000. Now the grants have  to\r\n\r\nbe   estimated  on  the  actual  expenditure   of   the\r\n\r\ninstitution  in the year preceding that  in  which  the\r\n\r\nestimates  are  prepared. That is why in approving  the\r\n\r\ngrant   for   1960  the  actual  expenditure   of   the\r\n\r\ninstitution  for  1959 must be looked  at.  And  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause of' this reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in 1961\r\n\r\nand  1962  we gave them the same grant of $25,260.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  there  was  a significant drop in expenditure  in\r\n\r\n1961 we gave them half of it, $17,530, which is half of\r\n\r\nthe actual expenditure of $35,000 in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Subhead 8, Singapore Academy of Medicine, is a new item\r\n\r\nwhich appears under this head.

Membership  is   by\r\n\r\ninvitation  and  its members are specialists  from  all\r\n\r\nbranches  of medicine. The membership is now about  80.\r\n\r\nIts  objects  are  to  foster  medical  and  scientific\r\n\r\ninterests  and  to  uphold the  high  professional  and\r\n\r\nethical  standards  in  all  fields  of  medicine.  Its\r\n\r\nactivities  include scientific meetings,  post-graduate\r\n\r\neducation  by  arranging  a  series  of  lectures   and\r\n\r\ndemonstrations,    public    lectures    on     medical\r\n\r\nphilosophical   topics.  In  fact,   this   association\r\n\r\nproposed  holding  a conference sometime  in  April   - I\r\n\r\nthink  it  was  - in 1962. Note, Mr Speaker,  the  date.\r\n\r\nThis  association  was sponsored  by  an  international\r\n\r\nconference scheduled to take place sometime in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1962,  but  in  point of fact, they  did  not  get  the\r\n\r\nparticipation  of  the  invited  countries.

They  thought\r\n\r\nthat  the expenditure on the conference would be $8,000\r\n\r\nand  they  asked the Government to meet  half  of  that\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  That  was agreed to.  Later,  failing  to\r\n\r\nconvene this international conference, they had a local\r\n\r\nconference.  They  sponsored  a  local  conference   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  they asked that this  contribution  be\r\n\r\nused  for the purposes of that local meeting. That  was\r\n\r\nnot  allowed because it would have created a precedent.\r\n\r\nIf  we  had allowed that money to be used for  a  local\r\n\r\nmeeting of doctors sponsored by that association, other\r\n\r\norganisations would have made similar requests  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

Sir,  the Minister can list  these  names.\r\n\r\nThey  are all officials of P.A.P. trade unions - Mahmud\r\n\r\nAwang,  etc. I ask the Minister to publish their  names\r\n\r\nand  to  publish the amount of allowances and  salaries\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them. As usual, the P.A.P. always provide  a\r\n\r\ncover. They must have a cover. They could not put  here\r\n\r\nas  $299,000  to  be spent on P.A.P. Research  Unit  or\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Labour Research Unit. Well, it is public money,\r\n\r\nso they have to put a cover. The cover is, they say, to\r\n\r\nassist the trade unions in preparing cases, assist them\r\n\r\nin  negotiations and to set up research facilities also\r\n\r\nto assist the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make it very clear that I do not\r\n\r\noppose  such lofty aims of the Government - if they  want\r\n\r\nto  genuinely assist the trade unions in setting  up  a\r\n\r\nresearch bureau to assist the trade unions in preparing\r\n\r\ncases,  etc., we have no objection. We would say,  \"All\r\n\r\nright, why $299,000? Perhaps more.\" But that is not the\r\n\r\naim.

One of the  functions  of  these\r\n\r\npeople - the  so-called trade union leaders  who  were\r\n\r\nseconded  from private employment  - was to go round  and\r\n\r\noffer  their services. They went round telling workers,\r\n\r\n\"Look, you do not have leaders; you do not have anybody\r\n\r\nto  negotiate: we will negotiate for you.\" That was the\r\n\r\nfirst  step.  The second step would have  been  if  the\r\n\r\nworkers  had accepted it - of course, the workers  saw\r\n\r\nthrough it - make these unions P.A.P. unions - I will  name\r\n\r\nhim  one  person who did this.

He offered his services and so did many  others.\r\n\r\nIf the workers had fallen for this, the next step would\r\n\r\nhave  been  to get them into their unions  or,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture says, \"to capture the union.\" Sir.\r\n\r\nI  am  not objecting to legitimate competition  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union field.

To enable the Customs and Excise Department to exercise their functions of detection and prevention, it is important for them to be sufficiently well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequipped  in order to beat the people who use the  most\r\n\r\nmodem speed-boats and the most high-powered vehicles in\r\n\r\norder to smuggle into and otherwise distribute opium or\r\n\r\nother  contraband goods in Singapore. It  seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  in  order  to  do  this, the  Customs  should  be\r\n\r\nequipped  with really high-powered boats  and,  on  the\r\n\r\nland,  high-powered vehicles. I think it  is  important\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  be equipped with really  first-rate\r\n\r\nspeed  boats in order to tackle the smugglers who  move\r\n\r\ncigarettes and opium into Singapore. From time to  time\r\n\r\nwe  have  read  cases in the papers  where  the  report\r\n\r\nsometimes says that the smugglers were able to beat the\r\n\r\nCustoms and to make a complete get-away. I take it that\r\n\r\nthe get-away is only possible if the smugglers' boat is\r\n\r\nfaster than the Customs boat, if the Customs boats were\r\n\r\nfaster  and the smugglers got away, then it is a matter\r\n\r\nfor  discipline.  But I take it that  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the get-away was entirely due to lack of\r\n\r\nspeed.  I  think it is up to the Government to  provide\r\n\r\nthem  with  the  speed to enable them to capture  these\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I agree with the views of the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park.

I think the race started  with\r\n\r\nsomething  like  a  25 horse-power engine  and  rapidly\r\n\r\naccelerated to 75 horse-power. If the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  will  turn to page 253, subhead 20, he will  find\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  provision  for  the  purchase  of  two\r\n\r\nlaunches  costing  $150,000 and  eight  75  horse-power\r\n\r\noutboard engines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have been assured by the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Customs that this would be adequate  for\r\n\r\nthe  time  being.

Can the Minister please explain  this\r\n\r\narithmetic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nthis  time  hit on something. His arithmetic  is  quite\r\n\r\ncorrect.  Obviously  this rather  severe  drop  in  the\r\n\r\namount of variable allowances calls for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that a substantial number of the posts\r\n\r\nin the Registry of Business Names are at present vacant\r\n\r\nand will probably remain vacant for some time until the\r\n\r\nOrdinance under which this section operates is amended,\r\n\r\nso  that  in fact a lot of the sums voted for  in  this\r\n\r\nsection  of the Estimates will not be spent.  But  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not really explain the fall, because it  was  not\r\n\r\nspent  either in 1962. The reason is that in  1962  the\r\n\r\nmethod of calculation was not correct. It was incorrect\r\n\r\nbecause they estimated variable allowances at the  mean\r\n\r\nof the salary scale, whereas if there are new posts the\r\n\r\ncalculation should be at the minimum or bottom  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary  scale. That method of calculation was made  in\r\n\r\n1963  and that explains the rather severe fall  in  the\r\n\r\namount of variable allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw the amendment, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of item (78)  of subhead 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (78) shows \"Increases due to Revision of\r\n\r\nSalaries  of Division IV employees and integrated  City\r\n\r\nCouncil State.\" Would the Minister please say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  kind of Division IV employees and integrated City\r\n\r\nCouncil Staff work in the Registry of Business Names?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually there is not one member\r\n\r\nof  the  staff  of Division IV Integrated City  Council\r\n\r\nStaff  working  in  the  Registry  of  Business  Names.\r\n\r\nActually  this item refers to the whole of  The  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  Department and not merely to the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nBusiness  Names.

If, on principle, they\r\n\r\nwant to encourage people in the middle and lower income\r\n\r\ngroups  to own houses, there are people in these income\r\n\r\ngroups  who own houses in the city area and not in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas. It does not mean that just because they do\r\n\r\nnot  have  much money they have to live  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas: many of them do buy houses in the city area  but\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  enjoy  that benefit.  For  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nencouraging  people to save in order to buy  their  own\r\n\r\nhouses, especially those in the middle and lower income\r\n\r\ngroups, I am just wondering whether that concession  of\r\n\r\nrates of assessment could be extended to people who own\r\n\r\nhouses in the city area as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not follow the hon.\r\n\r\nMember.

People who\r\n\r\nlive  in their own houses and do not rent them out  are\r\n\r\nallowed on application to pay 23 per cent instead of 36\r\n\r\nor  34  per  cent. But this only applies in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  If  it so happens that such houses are  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  area  and on the boundary line just opposite  the\r\n\r\nrural area, such house owners do not get the benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My impression is that this benefit\r\n\r\nfor  owner-occupied houses in the rural areas  was  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  our  increasing the  rates.  There  was  an\r\n\r\nexercise   in  1961 - rates  in  the  rural  areas   were\r\n\r\nincreased  but we thought that we should  exempt  owner\r\n\r\noccupiers  from this increase. Now, rates in  the  city\r\n\r\narea  were not increased, and I do not think  there  is\r\n\r\nany  reason to extend the concession to owner occupiers\r\n\r\nin the city area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance has a very good memory. Yes, that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase.  It was because of the rise in the rates  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. But my argument is this: the  motive  for\r\n\r\ngiving  owner-occupied  houses  special  rates  is   to\r\n\r\nencourage  wage earners to own houses.  So  if  special\r\n\r\nrates are given to owner-occupied houses on one side of\r\n\r\nthe  boundary line between city and rural, why does his\r\n\r\nbrother or colleague who lives on the other side of the\r\n\r\nboundary line not enjoy the same benefits?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That really is the luck of the\r\n\r\ndraw. The chap who is on the rural side of the boundary\r\n\r\nline  should  thank his lucky stars that he  gets  away\r\n\r\nwith   it.  Anyway,  I  think  we  have  already  given\r\n\r\nsubstantial  concessions to owner occupiers  everywhere\r\n\r\nby  way  of  exemption from income tax. Of course,  the\r\n\r\nreal thing to do is to make capital loans available  on\r\n\r\neasier terms to people who want to buy houses. Everyone\r\n\r\nseems to think that the present terms are all right: no\r\n\r\nlack  of demand for loans on present terms. So I  think\r\n\r\nfor the present we had best leave them alone.

Long before merger and Malaysia we  already\r\n\r\nknow  how,  because they already have got quite  a  few\r\n\r\nprominent trade union and working class leaders  locked\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all the more sinister when we notice that in\r\n\r\nSingapore  we  have a position where the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  is also the Minister for Labour.  I  can\r\n\r\nonly  conclude  that  this  shows  the  importance  the\r\n\r\nGovernment attaches to Labour. I hear that one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why the present Minister for Health and Law was\r\n\r\ntransferred  was  that they thought  he  was  unfit  to\r\n\r\nhandle  labour problems, and so they needed a  man  who\r\n\r\nhad  the support of the police force and who could move\r\n\r\nthe police force and also a man who was very trusted by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. hierarchy. However, Sir, my main concern now\r\n\r\nis not the police and the Intelligence sources that the\r\n\r\nMinister possesses and which are, in fact, used against\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  that he does not like,  but  the  labour\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone knows that the P.A.P. was elected on a\r\n\r\nlabour ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Which has been carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I wish it were true.

In\r\n\r\ntheir election manifesto they said that the setting  up\r\n\r\nof a court would give the trade unions the right to opt\r\n\r\nin.  That was not kept. It will be remembered that even\r\n\r\nin the days when we were in the P.A.P., I supported the\r\n\r\nBill  from  across the Floor and I did point this  out.\r\n\r\nThe whole basis of P.A.P. labour policy was unification\r\n\r\nof  the  trade  union movement. That is all  forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere is no unification. The P.A.P. has only helped  to\r\n\r\nfurther  divide the trade union movement. In 1961,  the\r\n\r\nmoment  there was a political split in the P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Trades Union Congress was dissolved,  thereby\r\n\r\nreverting back to the position as prevailed in  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  days - a  division  in the  labour  movement.  The\r\n\r\nreason why they dissolved the T.U.C. is very clear.  As\r\n\r\nhas been explained a number of times, they had four and\r\n\r\nwe  had  six  and so they could not control the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nThere  is  the second fundamental point: the  basis  on\r\n\r\nwhich   the  P.A.P.'s  labour  policy  was  formulated.\r\n\r\n`Unification of the trade union movement - not done. Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  claim today that they have fulfilled their labour\r\n\r\npolicy. There are many other instances and examples and\r\n\r\nperhaps it is not possible for me to quote them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Labour Ministry is pursuing a policy\r\n\r\nwhereby they act on the whims and fancies of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  wish  to  say  something  on  the  Labour\r\n\r\nConciliation Officers, but I will say that when we come\r\n\r\nto  Head  46. However, I would just like to  make  this\r\n\r\nremark  as  a  prelude to that, so that I will  not  be\r\n\r\nmisunderstood. We concede that the majority  of  Labour\r\n\r\nConciliation Officers who are civil servants are  doing\r\n\r\na good job. The vast majority of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem,  almost all of them, except a few, are  genuinely\r\n\r\ntrying to seek solutions to industrial disputes. Sir, I\r\n\r\nhope  when  the Minister replies he does  not  say,  as\r\n\r\nother  P.A.P.  Ministers  have  always  said,  that  we\r\n\r\ncondemn the civil servants, we cast aspersions and what-not.  We  are  aware  that the reason  why  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  not functioning as it should function  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Labour Minister is playing politics with  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the accusation that the S.A.T.U. group\r\n\r\nof  unions do not want to use the Labour Ministry. This\r\n\r\nis not true. I believe we are able to recall the recent\r\n\r\nexchanges   between  the  Singapore   Business   Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union  and the Ministry of  Labour  on  the\r\n\r\nFraser  strike. The Fraser Company wanted to break  the\r\n\r\nstrike  and employ black-legs. The Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nsaid  yes.  If it were a P.A.P. union, it  would  be  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter. It is not a P.A.P. union. They  said,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we will give you police protection. You break the\r\n\r\nstrike.\"  Then when the union disclosed this  publicly,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  turned  around and said,  \"The  Business\r\n\r\nHouses   Employees'  Union  did  not  use  the   Labour\r\n\r\nConciliation  machinery.\" Sir, this was  proved  to  be\r\n\r\nuntrue.   The   records  maintained   by   the   Labour\r\n\r\nConciliation  Officer who handled the  case  will  show\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry was 1consuited and talks were held in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other examples to show that it is\r\n\r\nnot  these  unions  which are  staying  away  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour, but it is the Ministry  which,  as\r\n\r\ndirected  by The Minister, seeks to play politics  with\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions and disputes of the workers. So  long\r\n\r\nas  this happens, Mr Speaker, the Ministry, the  whole\r\n\r\nconciliation  machinery,  arbitration  processes,  will\r\n\r\nstand  thoroughly  discredited  in  the  eyes  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Nobody  is going to have  confidence  that  a\r\n\r\ntrade dispute can be solved peacefully. So long as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seeks  to  use the Ministry  for  political\r\n\r\npurposes,  for making political capital  out  of  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes,  confidence cannot develop in the ability  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said earlier that the Government's labour\r\n\r\npolicy  is  inconsistent and based  on  the  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. I would like to quote just  one  further\r\n\r\nexample to prove this. There is the question of  secret\r\n\r\nballot. I quote this example because it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister to say that this is  Communist  talk\r\n\r\nbecause  the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  has put forward the same argument.  Under\r\n\r\nsection   18,  subsection  (3) ,  I  believe,   of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance,  a  secret  ballot  is\r\n\r\nordered if the employer on whom a claim has been  made,\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  negotiate with the trade union  which  has\r\n\r\nmade  the claim because he is of the opinion that  that\r\n\r\nunion  does  not represent a majority. It then  follows\r\n\r\nwith  a  secret  ballot which can  be  ordered  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour. Sir, there  are  two  points\r\n\r\nhere.  One, as to when a secret ballot should be  held,\r\n\r\nand  secondly,  - I will deal with the first point first,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records of the disputes relating to this handled\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry of Labour show that  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\ncompletely disregarded this particular section  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. There have been instances where unions  have\r\n\r\nasked for a secret ballot and the Minister has refused.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, there have been instances where the\r\n\r\nMinister  has imposed secret ballots. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nquote one example - C. K. Tang. The workers of C. K. Tang\r\n\r\nwere  members  of  the  Manual and  Mercantile  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion,  a  P.A.P. union. On the 5th of December.  1961,\r\n\r\nthe  workers  left  the Manual and  Mercantile  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion.  A  majority of them - 85 to be  precise,  out  of\r\n\r\n120 - joined  the  Singapore Business  Houses  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  On  the 5th of December, 1961, and ever  since,\r\n\r\nthe  Business  Houses  Employees' Union  requested  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  hold  a secret ballot  to  determine  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation, because the employer refused to concede\r\n\r\nthat  we  had  a majority. He was doubtful  as  to  our\r\n\r\nmajority  and  he asked the Ministry  also  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nsecret ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, the secret ballot was only held a\r\n\r\nfew  weeks  back. This was held a few  weeks  back  not\r\n\r\nbecause  they  liked it, but because we  threatened  to\r\n\r\ntake civil action ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> That is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Whether it is true or not, I believe the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary will be in a position to say if\r\n\r\nhe consults his Commissioner for Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of this question. Just now the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance quoted the names of companies  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who have gone over to their side, and  two  of\r\n\r\nthe  names  he quoted were Tiger Breweries  and  Anchor\r\n\r\nBreweries.  Sir, here, the Singapore General Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  had  served claims on the management. The  rival\r\n\r\nunion,  the  Singapore  Manual and  Mercantile  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion,  sought recognition. Acting under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance,  the  employer\r\n\r\nsaid  he  was  not  sure whether the Singapore  General\r\n\r\nEmployees Union represented the majority, and they went\r\n\r\nto  the  Labour Ministry. We asked for a secret ballot.\r\n\r\nAt  first,  they refused to hold a secret ballot.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  relevant section, as it is now, allows a  certain\r\n\r\namount of discretion to the Commissioner. But while the\r\n\r\nlaw  allows this discretion to the Commissioner, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  for  the Commissioner to abuse the law. On reading\r\n\r\nthe  provision, it is clear that if the employer  says.\r\n\r\n\"I  do  not want to negotiate with you because I am  of\r\n\r\nthe opinion that you do not represent the majority,\" or\r\n\r\nif  \"I  am  doubtful that you represent the  majority,\"\r\n\r\nthen  it is for the Commissioner to consult and hold  a\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot. No, they did not want to hold a  secret\r\n\r\nballot.  They marked time. They allowed the Manual  and\r\n\r\nMercantile Workers Union to make excessive claims, just\r\n\r\non paper, promising quarters for the workers, one house\r\n\r\nfor  each worker, $100 increases, just to try  and  get\r\n\r\nthe  support of the workers. And finally, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nsecret   ballot   was  held,  they   included   certain\r\n\r\ncategories  of  workers  who  should  not   have   been\r\n\r\nincluded,  in the same way as they sought to include  a\r\n\r\ncertain  category of nurses in the secret  ballot  that\r\n\r\nthey  wanted to impose on the nurses to determine union\r\n\r\nrepresentation. In this case, Sir, it was a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. member, the Parliamentary Secretary, who opposed\r\n\r\nthe  decision of the Government to hold such  a  secret\r\n\r\nballot to include categories on whose behalf the claims\r\n\r\nwere  not made. Of course, in the case of the A.U.P.E.,\r\n\r\nthey  dare  not press the point for fear  that  he  may\r\n\r\ncross  the  Floor  quicker. But in the  case  of  Tiger\r\n\r\nBreweries,  no, they pressed on, and held a ballot.  It\r\n\r\nis true we lost. But anyway, that is one other example.\r\n\r\nI  do not want to go on quoting more and more examples.\r\n\r\nI  can only say that there are many and perhaps in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of the debate, there will be some more quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One favourite thing that is said by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters,  which  was repeated earlier  today  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health, is that we call a strike, get into\r\n\r\ntrouble, then we go to the Labour Ministry. This is not\r\n\r\ntrue.  And  to prove this is not true, I just  want  to\r\n\r\nelaborate  on what I have said earlier on  today.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere has been a very recent case. This will be a  good\r\n\r\ntest  of the Government's sincerely in wanting to  help\r\n\r\nthe  workers. The Prime Minister that day  defended  Ho\r\n\r\nSee  Beng in getting a gold medal -  some award, I do not\r\n\r\nknow  what:  whether  it is gold,  silver  or  bronze - a\r\n\r\npublic service award or whatever it was. Ho See Beng is\r\n\r\ninvolved.  Ho  See  Beng's name was  read  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance just now. All the names  that  he\r\n\r\nread  out merely confirmed what I said, that the Labour\r\n\r\nResearch Unit is a P.A.P. outfit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 43 workers of the Straits Times were sacked by\r\n\r\nthe   management  for  having  gone  to  have   cholera\r\n\r\ninoculations. They were called casual workers, but they\r\n\r\nhave  been working in the Straits Times for years. They\r\n\r\nare  not members of the P.A.P. union. The P.A.P. union\r\n\r\nthere  is  led by Ho See Beng, the man who is now  paid\r\n\r\nout  of  Government  funds as a seconded  officer  from\r\n\r\nprivate  employment.  They were  not  members  of  this\r\n\r\nunion.  When  they  asked  the  management  to  provide\r\n\r\ninoculation  facilities, the management  refused.  They\r\n\r\ntold  the  management they were going to  a  Government\r\n\r\nclinic  to get inoculations. They went in the  morning.\r\n\r\nWhen they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturned, an official of this union, the right-hand man\r\n\r\nof  Mr  Ho See Beng, told them they were sacked.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey   are  still  out.  This  afternoon  they  did   a\r\n\r\ndemonstration, and the union which now represents these\r\n\r\nworkers  is  called the Singapore Bookshop  Publication\r\n\r\nand  Printing Press Workers Union. The dispute is being\r\n\r\nreferred to the Labour Ministry. [Interruption]  No,  we\r\n\r\ntell the Minister. There is no strike, nothing. If  the\r\n\r\nworkers were sacked, they were sacked for answering the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  call to get inoculated. Let  us  see  how\r\n\r\nsincere  they are if they want to settle this.  Let  us\r\n\r\nsee  if  they want to help this union. This is  a  non-P.A.P. union; \r\n\r\nit rejects the P.A.P.'s control. Let  us\r\n\r\nsee if they want to help. If they cannot settle it, let\r\n\r\nthem  at  least  refer this dispute to arbitration.  We\r\n\r\nwill  fight  it  out. That will prove a further  point,\r\n\r\nthat we are not anti-Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to conclude by saying that we\r\n\r\nrealise  that the P.A.P. has a vested interest  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement. They are not as naive as Members\r\n\r\nof  the S.P.A. They know, Sir, though they have to play\r\n\r\nthe   Right-wing  game  to  please  maybe  the  British\r\n\r\nmasters,  the Tunku basically, they have to  count  on\r\n\r\nthe support of the workers to come back here. They know\r\n\r\nthat.  They know that by numbers the workers are  more.\r\n\r\nThere  are over 600,000 electors, the majority of  whom\r\n\r\nare  workers  and their dependants. They  have  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  support.  They know they have vested  interests,\r\n\r\nand  they know that if they are to survive politically,\r\n\r\nthey must try to get the workers' support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They are all coming to us all the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Well, that is fine, if all the workers want\r\n\r\nto go over to their side, if the workers want to choose\r\n\r\nto  do so of their own free will, we say jolly good. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter to us, because we are not  as  short-sighted as the Minister for Finance. We believe in  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  of  the  workers.  Whether  the  workers  are\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Manual and Mercantile Workers Union  or\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore General Employees' Union does  not  make\r\n\r\nvery much difference, because the struggle against  the\r\n\r\nemployers goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  the  Minister is a good socialist, as he claims  to\r\n\r\nbe,  he  must accept this to be correct. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nare  not  bothered. We are not like the P.A.P. running\r\n\r\naround  trying to grab the workers. We do not do  these\r\n\r\nthings. On the other hand, we do not sit back and  say,\r\n\r\n\"All right, you come and poach on our members.\" No,  we\r\n\r\nfight.  But  if we think we do not have a majority,  we\r\n\r\nconcede  defeat.  We will say, \"Jolly good,  go  over.\"\r\n\r\nT.V.  Gomez - one of their star performers in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion field  - was not given a Public Service Star,  Sir.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know for what reason. Perhaps it was because\r\n\r\nhis  questionable character is very well known to  many\r\n\r\nworkers and employers. Anyway, Mr Speaker, T.V.  Gomez\r\n\r\nwent  to  the  Arbitration Court and in  front  of  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court, in front of the Deputy President, he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I have a majority. I have 119 members.\" He  was\r\n\r\ncaught  out  lying in the case of Plywood.  The  Deputy\r\n\r\nPresident was sympathetic: he knew the problem; he  did\r\n\r\nnot  want  to embarrass him more and he held  a  secret\r\n\r\nballot.  On the other hand, if the Court had agreed  to\r\n\r\nour suggestion and put Mr Gomez in the witness box, he\r\n\r\nwould have been proved a liar and a perjurer. They  had\r\n\r\nthe  cheek  to go to court. We do not do this  sort  of\r\n\r\nthing.  To  drive home this point, we  say,  today  the\r\n\r\nnurses  who go on strike, the bank workers  who  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike, and the insurance workers who go on strike  are\r\n\r\nnot  members  of what they call Communist unions.  This\r\n\r\nis,  from  our  point  of view, an  indication  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  class consciousness. We say, jolly  good,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are under P.A.P. unions, S.P.A. unions. [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not short-sighted as they are. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nare not worried if the Minister says that thousands and\r\n\r\nthousands of workers have gone over. The first proof is\r\n\r\n`that  since  May Day last year, they have been  saying\r\n\r\nthousands  have gone over. They have a very unique  way\r\n\r\nof  making propaganda. First, they say that 50  workers\r\n\r\nfrom  one  company went over. Then two weeks later,  20\r\n\r\nworkers went over, and so on - individual items. Then  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of two months, they put all the total together\r\n\r\nand say that so many hundreds have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngone  over.  And they start all over again.  After  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  they put the grand total together and  say  so\r\n\r\nmany  thousands have gone over. We are not denying that\r\n\r\nworkers have gone over. Yes, some of our branches. This\r\n\r\nis an open secret. We do not deny it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Half\r\n\r\nmeans 40,000. Foreign correspondents and local Pressmen\r\n\r\nwere  there as witnesses. But the Ministry of Culture's\r\n\r\nofficial  estimation of the Jalan Besar rally at  which\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister was given a star by the Secretary-General  of  the  N.T.U.C., Mr  Devan  Nair - the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  who  reciprocated by giving on  National  Day\r\n\r\nanother  star to Mr Devan Nair - was first, 3,000;  then\r\n\r\nthey increased it to 7,000. But let us be generous  and\r\n\r\nsay 7,000. Last year, the Ministry of Culture estimated\r\n\r\ntheir  last  year's  crowd to  be  15,000.  Surely  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  is  not  going  to  put  forward\r\n\r\nCommunist propaganda, and they could not have  computed\r\n\r\nthis  figure  because  they are  pro-Communists.  Well,\r\n\r\nthere it is, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress this point: so long as the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Labour does not conduct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitself as a Ministry of Labour should and  it  is\r\n\r\nnot genuinely and sincerely non-political in wanting to\r\n\r\nsolve  problems  arising  from  industrial  grievances,\r\n\r\nthere  can be no industrial peace; it can only help  to\r\n\r\nincrease industrial strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum to be allocated for Head 45 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (1)  of subhead 1.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTun Lim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sure the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson cannot be serious when he says  that\r\n\r\nhe   has  been  intimidated  by  me  or  that  I   have\r\n\r\nintimidated him, for the simple reason that I happen to\r\n\r\nbe also the Minister for Home Affairs.

Far from the Government having deviated from its pro-labour policy, I think the Member for Thomson has deviated from his political stand. He was elected on the P.A.P. Five-Year Plan, but since 1961 he has\r\n\r\ngone  over to the other side, and if at all any  person\r\n\r\nhas  deviated from his stand I think it is  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the best way to answer the criticism of the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Thomson  is  to  narrate  the   concrete\r\n\r\nachievements  of the Government during  the  past  four\r\n\r\nyears. Sir, the P.AP. Government's policy on labour and\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  was clearly laid down in  the  Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan  entitled The Tasks Ahead. In all our approach  to\r\n\r\nlabour  problems our guiding principle has always  been\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice. During  the  last  four\r\n\r\nyears,  because of our enlightened policy and our  open\r\n\r\nstand  on  the  side  of the workers,  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have benefited considerably\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the form of monetary wages and fringe benefits. Many\r\n\r\nof  the  laws which worked to the disadvantage  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were  removed  and new  laws  to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the workers were introduced, so  much  so\r\n\r\nthat today our labour legislation has been acclaimed to\r\n\r\nbe  the  most progressive in South-East Asia by  labour\r\n\r\nexperts and trade unionists who visited Singapore. When\r\n\r\nthe present Government assumed office in June 1959,  we\r\n\r\ntook  strong  action to stop evasion of  the  statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions   by   employers,  with  the   result   that\r\n\r\nwidespread  evasion of statutory obligations,  such  as\r\n\r\npayment  of overtime wages, holidays with pay and  rest\r\n\r\nday  pay, etc., was eliminated. The Government, through\r\n\r\nthe Labour Department, has up to date recovered through\r\n\r\nits Labour Inspectorate alone the sum of almost half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars and paid it to the workers  concerned.\r\n\r\nEncouraged   by   the  pro-labour   attitude   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  many of the workmen took their  claims  to\r\n\r\nthe Labour Courts set up by the Government to deal with\r\n\r\nthese  problems  and, as a result, from  June  1959  to\r\n\r\ndate,  the Labour Courts have recovered a total sum  of\r\n\r\nalmost  half  a  million dollars and  paid  it  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  In the same period, through the good  offices\r\n\r\nof  the  Labour  Courts,  a sum  of  $50,000  was  also\r\n\r\nrecovered on behalf of domestic servants. What is  more\r\n\r\nimportant, Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from these  monetary\r\n\r\ngains,  is  the fact that the employers  have  come  to\r\n\r\nrealise their statutory obligations and are willing  to\r\n\r\nmeet  them, and the workmen are aware of the  statutory\r\n\r\nbenefits they are entitled to and are no longer  afraid\r\n\r\nto bring their grievances to the Labour Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the means of achieving industrial peace with\r\n\r\njustice  is  the enactment of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance   and   the  setting-up  of  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Courts. The achievement and the  confidence\r\n\r\nwith  which  the  workmen and  employers  have  in  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Courts is  well  known  to  the\r\n\r\npeople and need no further elaboration. Suffice  it  to\r\n\r\nsay  that the Industrial Arbitration Court has now come\r\n\r\nto  be generally accepted by both employers and workers\r\n\r\nas an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvaluable machinery in resolving industrial  disputes.\r\n\r\nLast  year  the  two  Courts arbitrated  31  cases  and\r\n\r\ncertified 264 agreements, compared with 9 cases and 121\r\n\r\nagreements for the 1960/1961 period. This goes to prove\r\n\r\nthat  the workers and their employers have come to have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the industrial machinery of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mention was made by the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nregarding  the Conciliation Service. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Conciliation Service of the Labour Department  has\r\n\r\ndone extremely well in settling labour disputes in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of both the employers and the workers. For the\r\n\r\nperiod  from  1960  to  1962, the Conciliation  Service\r\n\r\nsettled a total of about 3,000 disputes and disposed of\r\n\r\n600  disputes in other ways. This Conciliation  Service\r\n\r\nis  available  to  both the employers and  the  workers\r\n\r\nwithout  any distinction. For that matter,  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment  has served all trade unions, employers  and\r\n\r\nindividual  workmen without distinction. In  1962,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  out of a total of 1,064 disputes  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by the Labour Ministry, 603 disputes were brought\r\n\r\nby  unions,  12  by  employers and  449  by  individual\r\n\r\nworkers,  and out of the 603 disputes brought by  trade\r\n\r\nunions  in  1962. 382 were brought by unions affiliated\r\n\r\nto  or  associated with the group of trade unions which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson belongs to;  while  221  were\r\n\r\nbrought  by  other  unions. Now,  if  the  Conciliation\r\n\r\nService  had not been fair and partial. I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group of unions would not have brought  their\r\n\r\ncases  to the Labour Ministry. Mr Speaker, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nwere   only   two  occasions  on  which  requests   for\r\n\r\nassistance  from  the  Labour  Department  had  to   be\r\n\r\nrefused.  The  first was a request from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral Employees' Union in November 1962 to pursue its\r\n\r\ndemand  for  the  dismissal of a  workman  employed  by\r\n\r\nTithes  Dental and Photo Supply Limited. In that  case,\r\n\r\nit  was explained that the Labour Department could  not\r\n\r\nbe a party to any negotiation, the sole object of which\r\n\r\nwas  to  obtain the dismissal of a worker. Briefly,  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1962 two workers employed by the Company had a\r\n\r\nfight in the Company's premises during their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking  hours.  One  of the workers  concerned  was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Singapore General Employees' Union  and\r\n\r\nthe  other  was  not a member of any union.  After  the\r\n\r\nfight  the Company warned both the workers, in writing,\r\n\r\nthat if they fought again they would be dismissed.  The\r\n\r\naction taken by the Company was reasonable, but it  did\r\n\r\nnot satisfy the Union. The Union demanded the dismissal\r\n\r\nof  the  worker  who was a non-union member.  When  the\r\n\r\nCompany rejected the Union's demand, the Union called a\r\n\r\nstrike of its 32 members employed in the establishment.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the strike, the Union had not availed\r\n\r\nitself  of  the  conciliation machinery in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment.  It was only on 19th November,  1962,  that\r\n\r\nis,  two weeks after the strike had occurred, that  the\r\n\r\nUnion  first  asked  for  assistance  from  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment.  By then the Company's board  of  directors\r\n\r\nhad  already  passed a resolution  to  close  down  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  However, on the persuasion of  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nthe   company  eventually  did  not  proceed  with  its\r\n\r\nintention to close down. The strike eventually came  to\r\n\r\nan end on 4th of December, 1962, when the Union dropped\r\n\r\nthe  demand for the dismissal of a non-union member and\r\n\r\nagreed  to  a return of work by the strikers.  Now,  in\r\n\r\nthis particular case, the Union concerned had sought to\r\n\r\nuse Government machinery, the State machinery which the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson has accused of being partial, to put\r\n\r\npressure  on  the employer to get one of the  non-union\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  company out of employment.  Now,  the\r\n\r\nstrike  which lasted from 5th November to 4th December,\r\n\r\n1962,  achieved nothing, but did a lot of harm. Besides\r\n\r\ndepriving 32 union members and 18 non-union members  of\r\n\r\nearning  their livelihood for about a month, it  nearly\r\n\r\nled  to the closing down of the establishment. And what\r\n\r\nis  the term of agreement eventually? Each union member\r\n\r\nhas to send a letter of apology to the management. They\r\n\r\nreceive no strike pay and no bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other case that was mentioned just now was the\r\n\r\ncase in connection with secret ballots conducted in  C.\r\n\r\nK.  Tang Ltd. Mr Speaker, Sir, in this particular case\r\n\r\nthere was already at that time in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforce  a certified collective agreement between  C.

The Commissioner for Labour did  advise\r\n\r\nat  that  time that a secret ballot could not  be  held\r\n\r\nbecause  there was this certified collective  agreement\r\n\r\nin  force  and, according to the legal advice  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  so long as a certified collective agreement  was\r\n\r\nin force, no secret ballot could be conducted. However,\r\n\r\nin  April this year, the matter was reviewed again  and\r\n\r\nlegal advice was given that the Commissioner for Labour\r\n\r\ncould,   even  during  the  currency  of  a   certified\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement, call for a secret ballot  to  be\r\n\r\nheld,  and  immediately upon the receipt of  the  legal\r\n\r\nadvice a secret ballot was conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has criticised just now that the Labour Research Unit is a P.A.P. outfit. The setting up of a Labour Research Unit was one of the election pledges that we made during the election, and it was upon this pledge that the Member for Thomson was elected. Perhaps he has now forgotten.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, trade unionists  have  complained\r\n\r\nthat while employers have excellent research facilities\r\n\r\nand  qualified personnel at their disposal to help them\r\n\r\nwith the presentation of their cases in the Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt, trade unions have been at a disadvantage.  Trade\r\n\r\nunionists    with   the   necessary   experience    and\r\n\r\nqualifications to help trade unions are few in  number,\r\n\r\nand  trade unions possess no great research facilities.\r\n\r\nOn the representations of the trade unions made through\r\n\r\nthe  National  Trades  Union Congress,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecided to set up this Labour Research Unit staffed  by\r\n\r\nqualified economists, accountants and legal men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Unit is primarily concerned with advising any union seeking its assistance on matters concerning the\r\n\r\nformulation  of  claims   for collective agreements, adjustments\r\n\r\naffecting   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting or expiring collective agreements, and the\r\n\r\npreparation  of  cases  for  presentation  before   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court. Since its  inception  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1963,  the  Unit has  been  inundated  with  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  requests touching on labour  problems.  To\r\n\r\ndate  it  has  been consulted by various unions  in  89\r\n\r\nmajor cases, the benefits of which will accrue for some\r\n\r\n10,000 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Labour Research Unit is independent of official control and exists primarily to serve trade unions. All trade unions in Singapore, irrespective of their political or other affiliations, are eligible to call on the services of the Unit. Some of the unions affiliated to S.A.T.U. and others belonging to neither S.A.T.U. nor the N.T.U.C. group\r\n\r\nthat  have  made  use  of the services  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nResearch   Unit  are  the  Singapore  General  Printing\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union in connection with their  dispute  with\r\n\r\nQalam  Press and the Malayan Airways and Qantas  Empire\r\n\r\nAirways  Local Employees' Union versus Air India  case.\r\n\r\nNow,  these  two unions belong neither to the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nnor S.A.T.U. Then there is the Industrial Workers Union\r\n\r\nof  Singapore (N.A.A.F.I. Branch) which belongs to  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group and the Member for Thomson is an adviser\r\n\r\nof  this union. This union too consulted and sought the\r\n\r\nadvice  of the Labour Research Unit. Then the Mansfield\r\n\r\nLocal  Employees' Union, whose adviser is Mr S.  Wood-hull,  too  consulted  the  Labour  Research  Unit  for\r\n\r\nadvice. Finally, the Singapore National Seamen's Union,\r\n\r\nanother  union  belonging to the S.A.T.U. group,  also\r\n\r\nsought  assistance from the Labour Research  Unit.  And\r\n\r\nassistance and advice were duly given to them.  Now  it\r\n\r\nwould appear that the S.A.T.U. group of unions have not\r\n\r\nbeen  forthcoming  in calling on the services  of  this\r\n\r\nUnit.  However, I need not labour the reasons for this.\r\n\r\nThe  pro-Communist leaders of the S.A.T.U. group cannot\r\n\r\nbe  expected to conduct research for the benefit of the\r\n\r\nworkers. And the Labour Research Unit, from their point\r\n\r\nof  view,  is  bad  because it only  does  research  to\r\n\r\njustify  the claims of labour and maintains no  contact\r\n\r\nwith foreign Communist Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the stock accusations of the Member for Thomson is that the Government has failed to support the unification of the trade union movement. Now, when the pro-Communists talk about the unification of the trade union movement, they mean the control of the movement by the front agents of the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party of Malaya. It is surely impossible  to\r\n\r\nexpect  the Government to help the Communists  to  gain\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the trade union movement under the  pretext\r\n\r\nof  unification  and  to  surrender  the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the workers of Singapore  to  the  tender\r\n\r\nmercies of foreign inspired anti-national elements.  In\r\n\r\nthe circumstances, it is better that there should be  a\r\n\r\nclear  demarcation  between  pro-Communists  and   non-Communists  in  the  trade  union  movement.  And   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  continue  to  encourage  the  genuine\r\n\r\nunification  of  the trade union movement  but  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of democratic and independent trade unionism.  We\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt  that in the final  result  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement of Singapore will be so unified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, after hearing a\r\n\r\nlong  recital  by the Acting Minister for  Labour,  one\r\n\r\nwould  feel  that the P.A.P. is really pro-labour.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been trying to make out to the  workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that it is a good Government for them. It\r\n\r\nclaims  that  it has a labour policy that is  in  their\r\n\r\ninterests. This means that the Government knows that it\r\n\r\nhas  a  lot of things to do in order to implement  that\r\n\r\npolicy.  And  yet, after the death of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim, last  August,  the\r\n\r\npost  of Minister for Labour has been left vacant  with\r\n\r\nonly  a  Minister acting in his place. That shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has not given labour its due  place  in\r\n\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has mentioned that it is\r\n\r\nsignificant that the Acting Minister for Labour is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs. This is  because  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  trade unionists belonging to  the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\ngroup  are now in gaol as a result of the orders signed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Home Affairs, concurrently Acting\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour. But what is more important to  the\r\n\r\nissue is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.  Both  the  P.A.P. and the Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nplaying  party politics in the trade union field.  Both\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  capture trade union organisations  for\r\n\r\ntheir own selfish political ends. And to listen in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  the  exchange  of  mud-slinging  by   the\r\n\r\ncontestants, who are both guilty, would make one  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  whole trade union movement hangs around  the\r\n\r\nactivities of the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have maintained that a strong trade union movement\r\n\r\ncan only emerge if it is free of political control.  If\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis really believe  in\r\n\r\nthis,  then  they  should put an end to  the  political\r\n\r\nwarfare  that they have been waging in the trade  union\r\n\r\nworld. If Barisan Sosialis speakers bring attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  strikes  that have been organised  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions,  then  the  Acting Minister for  Labour  brings\r\n\r\nattention  to  the strikes that have been organised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan-controlled trade unions. All this  is  not\r\n\r\nhelpful  nor conducive to the industrialisation  policy\r\n\r\nof the Government. Many industrialists would have liked\r\n\r\nto  come  to Singapore and open up factories, but  they\r\n\r\nhave been deterred by the fact that there has been this\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest  engendered  by  opposing  political\r\n\r\nParties  for political ends. I say, put an end to  this\r\n\r\nstrife  in the trade union movement. If this  is  done,\r\n\r\nthe  industrialisation policy of the Government can  be\r\n\r\neasier implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Mr Bani.

The Minister explains  how\r\n\r\nat  one time the legal advice was that you cannot hold\r\n\r\na  secret ballot if there is a collective agreement  in\r\n\r\nforce.

They do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  hold  a  secret ballot when it  is  to  their\r\n\r\ndisadvantage. They hold a secret ballot when it  is  to\r\n\r\ntheir   advantage.  There  is  no  coherent  consistent\r\n\r\npolicy. This is a policy based on the whims and fancies\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. interest and of the P.A.P.

Sir, we say the Labour Research Unit  is  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. outfit because it is loaded with P.A.P. men. And\r\n\r\nwhat  is  more, public funds are used to sustain  these\r\n\r\npeople. And it is in the interest of the P.A.P. to  try\r\n\r\nand  tell the workers, \"Yes, we want to help you.\"  and\r\n\r\ntherefore they offer their services to all unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are genuine about wanting to set up a\r\n\r\nResearch Unit for the unions, then why not consult  the\r\n\r\n40 odd unions which are not P.A.P. unions? They want to\r\n\r\nfight  these  unions because they say  that  these  are\r\n\r\nCommunist unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can only say that these 40 unions are\r\n\r\nregistered according to the laws of the country and are\r\n\r\nregistered   organisations.  So  long   as   they   are\r\n\r\nregistered  bodies, their rights must be respected.  If\r\n\r\nthe   Government  think  that  all  these  unions   are\r\n\r\nCommunist and therefore should not exist, they have the\r\n\r\npower  to take action. I am sure they must have thought\r\n\r\nof the possibility of banning some of the unions. Well,\r\n\r\nthat is a different proposition altogether. So long  as\r\n\r\nthe   unions   exist,  it  is  hypocritical   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  on the one hand, to say, \"All  right,  you\r\n\r\noperate as a registered union,\" and, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nto  say, \"You cannot appoint a member to the employees'\r\n\r\npanel in the Arbitration Court because you are a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunist union; you cannot have your representative in\r\n\r\nthe Research Bureau because you are a Communist union.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is hypocrisy. This proves further that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  trying  to use Government  organs  and\r\n\r\nGovernment funds for the purposes of P.A.P. interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I quite\r\n\r\nappreciate  and understand how the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nhas  to  put up so hard a defence for the misdeeds  and\r\n\r\nevils that they have done to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> We will come to them one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Just now, he mentioned that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs was asked to take  over  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  because  he  will  be  there   to\r\n\r\nintimidate  the  workers. This is far  from  being  the\r\n\r\ncase. You will remember that during the Roneo case, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson's closest colleague, Mr  Foo  Yong\r\n\r\nFong ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Borneo?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> --- Roneo.

Now,\r\n\r\nsimilarly members of his union who were on strike there\r\n\r\nlodged   a   complaint   with   the   police   alleging\r\n\r\nintimidation  from the manager. Similarly,  the  police\r\n\r\nalso  took  up  the investigation and the  manager  was\r\n\r\nproduced before the court and prosecuted, but  in  that\r\n\r\ncase there was no case and the manager was acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that their own S.A.T.U. unions came\r\n\r\npersonally  to me with a request for police protection.\r\n\r\nThey  said  that when they were on strike the employers\r\n\r\nused thugs to intimidate them. Yes, we asked the police\r\n\r\nto give them the necessary protection. So where is this\r\n\r\nintimidation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon.

Earlier  I  said  that  the  majority   of   the\r\n\r\nConciliation  Officers in the Ministry  of  Labour  are\r\n\r\ndoing  a good job. In fact, the Minister - I do not blame\r\n\r\nhim, because he was reading from the Annual Report  - was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  answer a point that I never  made.  He  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  explain how the conciliation officers  work\r\n\r\nhard and settle the disputes. I agree with him. I never\r\n\r\ndeny  this. The majority of them do so. But  there  are\r\n\r\none  or two - and this man, Mr Pang Tee Pow, who is  now\r\n\r\nin Geneva making political speeches, is one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange that the P.A.P. has made so many\r\n\r\nappointments, since it came into office, to the post of\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour. Mr Kok Ah Loy transferred,\r\n\r\nMr  Goh Koh Pui transferred, now Mr Pang Tee  Pow  is\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner for Labour. Sir, I was  referring  to\r\n\r\nMr Francis Seow yesterday as a gold medallist. This is\r\n\r\nobviously  a degree lesser; Mr Pang Tee Pow is  silver\r\n\r\nmedallist.  The  Government has  shown  recognition  by\r\n\r\ngiving   him   a   medal,   but,   unfortunately,   his\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the P.A.P. interest has  not  been  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  that given by Mr Francis Seow and therefore,\r\n\r\ninstead of a gold medal, he received a silver medal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not want to go around threatening civil\r\n\r\nservants.  We do not do this sort of thing which  is  a\r\n\r\nhabit  of  the  P.A.P.  But we say  this  to  them:  we\r\n\r\nunderstand  the problems that the civil servants  face.\r\n\r\nWe have a Government which is devoid of all decency and\r\n\r\ndoes not respect the independence of the civil service.\r\n\r\nIt  uses threats, intimidation and bribery in the  form\r\n\r\nof  medals, etc., to get the civil servants to do  what\r\n\r\nthey want them to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we realise the predicament of the civil\r\n\r\nservants,  and  we say that we do not blame  them.  But\r\n\r\nthere are certain individuals like Mr Pang Tee Pow who\r\n\r\nbend backwards to please the Ministers. And we say that\r\n\r\ntoday the side-drum to the Minister for Labour and  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, who constitute the  political\r\n\r\nwing  in  the  Ministry of Labour,  is  Mr  Pang,  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour. He is the third  person  who\r\n\r\nacts as if he is a P.A.P. cadre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take the case of C. K. Tang, for example. Just\r\n\r\nnow  the Minister was trying to explain how and why the\r\n\r\nC.  K, rang  secret  ballot was  not  held.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour, since December 1961,  did  not\r\n\r\noffer  any  explanation at all to the  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union for refusing to hold a secret  ballot.\r\n\r\nArrogance, trying to please the Minister - therefore,  he\r\n\r\njust   did  not  care  less  for  the  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union. A public servant whose duty to us was\r\n\r\nto  consider  the  holding of  a  secret  ballot,  when\r\n\r\nrepeated  requests  were made,  did  not  even  give  a\r\n\r\nreason - let alone a reason, Sir, there have been letters\r\n\r\nwhich he has not even replied to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we say that the P.A.P. Government is not going\r\n\r\nto  be  in force for ever and ever. The time will  come\r\n\r\nsooner or later, when the P.A.P. is going to disappear,\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries  and\r\n\r\ntheir  cadres  are going to disappear. When  that  time\r\n\r\ncomes,  the people who played politics when  they  were\r\n\r\nnot supposed to play politics, will have to pay for all\r\n\r\ntheir actions. And we hope that wisdom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill prevail, and that there will not be these attempts\r\n\r\nby   individuals  to  bend  backwards  to  please   the\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Would the Minister or the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary like to speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now\r\n\r\nI was stopped because of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Thomson wishes to pursue the\r\n\r\ncase of C. K. Tang, then may I take this opportunity to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  the legal opinion given  by  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General? All this is on record in  the  files.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Member for Thomson wishes to pursue the matter\r\n\r\nfurther,  by  all  means.
