The compensation\r\n\r\nis  related to the loss of earning capacity and  is\r\n\r\nintended  to be a substitute income contributed  by\r\n\r\nthe employer. In addition, the employer is required\r\n\r\nto  bear  medical costs arising out of a  workman's\r\n\r\nhospitalisation and treatment, including artificial\r\n\r\nand surgical appliances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Act, the injured worker is\r\n\r\nentitled to compensation, regardless of whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  he  is  responsible for the accident.  Members\r\n\r\nwill  no  doubt agree that this is a practical  and\r\n\r\nrealistic approach to the question of compensation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the worker has the option of proceeding to\r\n\r\nclaim damages in the Civil Courts if he feels  that\r\n\r\nthe liability for the accident can be attributed to\r\n\r\nthe employer or a third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang will no doubt agree that\r\n\r\nwhatever the quantum of compensation, it can  never\r\n\r\nfully  compensate the worker who sustains an injury\r\n\r\nresulting   in  permanent  disablement.   Moreover,\r\n\r\ncompensation on the lines suggested by  the  Member\r\n\r\nwill  present  numerous difficulties  in  practice,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  quantifying the compensation payable  for\r\n\r\nsuch   intangible  ill-effects  like  pain,  shock,\r\n\r\nmortification, humiliation and loss of standing  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity.  However, may I assure the  Member  that\r\n\r\npractical  suggestions from  him  would  always  be\r\n\r\ngiven due consideration by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Members will recall that the Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  (Amendment)  Act,  1971,  passed   by\r\n\r\nParliament on the 19th October, 1971, had increased\r\n\r\nconsiderably, in fact, threefold in most cases  the\r\n\r\nquantum   of  workmen's  compensation  payable   to\r\n\r\nworkmen  and  their dependants. Under  the  amended\r\n\r\nprovisions,  a workman above the age  of  18  years\r\n\r\nwould  be entitled to a sum of $28,800, or  a  lump\r\n\r\nsum equivalent to 60 months' earnings, whichever is\r\n\r\nthe less, for injuries resulting in total permanent\r\n\r\nincapacity.  The Act also specifies separate  rates\r\n\r\nof compensation payable to workmen below the age of\r\n\r\n18  years  and those below the age of 16 years.

In order to streamline\r\n\r\nthe  driving  licence  records  and  to  facilitate\r\n\r\nissuance  of  driving licences, the  classification\r\n\r\nfor  motor  vehicles was at the same  time  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom nine to five classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that persons issued with Class IV\r\n\r\nlicences under the old rules were allowed to  drive\r\n\r\nheavy  motor-cars  with no  maximum  limit  in  the\r\n\r\nunladen  weight, whereas persons issued with  Class\r\n\r\nIV licences under the new rules are not licensed to\r\n\r\ndrive heavy motorcars above seven tons, for which a\r\n\r\nClass  V  licence is required. This, however,  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that  under the Motor Vehicles  (Driving\r\n\r\nLicences) Rules, 1969, those who had acquired Class\r\n\r\nIV  driving licences before 1st February, 1969  are\r\n\r\nbeing automatically disqualified and debarred  from\r\n\r\ndriving  heavy  motor-cars above  seven  tons.  The\r\n\r\nvalidity of licences issued under the 1948 Rules is\r\n\r\nnot affected, as the 1969 Rules were not introduced\r\n\r\nwith retrospective effect. In addition, there is  a\r\n\r\nsaving  clause  under  Rule 17  (3)  of  the  Motor\r\n\r\nVehicles (Driving Licences)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRules,  1969, which provides that the new rules  do\r\n\r\nnot  alter  the classes of motor vehicles  which  a\r\n\r\nholder  of  a  licence has been licensed  to  drive\r\n\r\nbefore  the  date  when the  new  rules  come  into\r\n\r\noperation.  Those  issued with  Class  1V  licences\r\n\r\nbefore  1st February, 1969 are, therefore,  legally\r\n\r\nentitled  to  drive  heavy motor-cars  above  seven\r\n\r\ntons.

In  this\r\n\r\ndescription, Class IV vehicles are defined as heavy\r\n\r\nmotor-cars above 2j tons up to seven tons, although\r\n\r\nthese  people are legally entitled to  drive  heavy\r\n\r\nmotor-cars  above seven tons as  they  had  X  been\r\n\r\ngranted licences prior to 1st February, 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my gratitude\r\n\r\nand  thanks to the Member for Kallang for being  so\r\n\r\nalert and drawing the attention of my Department to\r\n\r\nthis  anomaly.

As a statutory board, the  P.S.A, must\r\n\r\nconform generally to Government's policy on matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to remuneration, terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.   This  means  that  bonuses  for   P.S.A.\r\n\r\nemployees  cannot be considered, but any betterment\r\n\r\nin  the  remuneration and terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice of Government employees might, as far as is\r\n\r\napplicable, be extended to P.S.A, employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADMISSIONS TO PRIMARY 1</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CLASSES IN 1972</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Mohd.

In  1969,  however,   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  changed  its financial  year  from  the\r\n\r\ncalendar year to 1st April - 31st March, the  Board\r\n\r\ndid  likewise  because it is  wholly  dependent  on\r\n\r\nGovernment funds for its operation, and adopting  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  accounting system was both  practical  and\r\n\r\nconvenient for purposes of control. It is necessary\r\n\r\nnow  to make provision through clause 3 of the Eco.\r\n\r\nnomic Development Board (Amendment) Bill, 1972,  to\r\n\r\nenable  the Board to adopt as its financial year  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  12  months ending on the 31st  day  `of\r\n\r\nMarch  in  each  year and to prepare  its  accounts\r\n\r\naccordingly. There is a transitional provision  for\r\n\r\nthe  Board's financial year in 1969 to be 15 months\r\n\r\ncommencing  on  the 1st day of January,  1969,  and\r\n\r\nending  on  the 31st day of March, 1970.  Following\r\n\r\nthe change in the financial year, the submission of\r\n\r\nthe  Board's Annual Report will have to  he-amended\r\n\r\naccordingly,  and  this is being  provided  for  in\r\n\r\nclause 4 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also being taken to\r\n\r\nincorporate  a  provision in  clause  2.  -for  the\r\n\r\nappointment   of  the  Chairman  of  the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to be either full-time  or  part-time, since at -present there is provision only for\r\n\r\na  full-time officer.

I  was\r\n\r\nfairly  confident that the general policies we  had\r\n\r\nadopted, including our emphasis on the major growth\r\n\r\nsectors   including  export-oriented  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries,  were  basically  correct   for   rapid\r\n\r\neconomic growth but warned against possible adverse\r\n\r\nfactors which might upset our carefully laid plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary figures show that, in the event, with\r\n\r\na  14  per  cent G.D.P, increase, we did not  quite\r\n\r\nattain the 15 per cent growth target, although  the\r\n\r\noutcome   of  the  last  year's  working  must   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  highly satisfactory. With the  momentum\r\n\r\ngenerated  during the preceding year,  the  economy\r\n\r\ninitially   moved   forward   rapidly    but    was\r\n\r\nsubsequently slowed down by the instability  caused\r\n\r\nby the international monetary crises which occurred\r\n\r\nin the latter part of 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Survey of International Economic Events</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That year will probably go down in the annals of\r\n\r\neconomic  and financial history as a turning  point\r\n\r\nfor  the world monetary system. For the first  time\r\n\r\nsince  it established its complete dominance  after\r\n\r\nthe  Second  World War, the strength  of  the  U.S.\r\n\r\nDollar  was  called  seriously  into  question.  At\r\n\r\nfirst, it was suggested that the U.S, should favour\r\n\r\na  policy  of  \"benign  neglect\"  of  the  dollar's\r\n\r\nweakness. This casual attitude soon disappeared. In\r\n\r\nMay,  the  first  indications of potential  trouble\r\n\r\ncame  with the free floating upwards of the  German\r\n\r\nMark,  and  the revaluation of the Swiss Franc  and\r\n\r\nthe  Austrian  Schilling. This was  followed  by  a\r\n\r\nperiod of intense speculation in the Mark, the Yen,\r\n\r\nand finally against the U.S. Dollar, which resulted\r\n\r\nin  a rapid deterioration of the dollar's position.\r\n\r\nFinally, the international monetary system  devised\r\n\r\nat  Bretton-Woods,  of internationally  agreed  par\r\n\r\nvalues and strictly maintained exchange margins  of\r\n\r\nnot more than 2 per cent, collapsed with the \"Nixon\r\n\r\nshock\" in August, announcing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspension of the convertibility of the dollar  and\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of a 10 per cent surcharge  on  all\r\n\r\nU.S, imports.  The draconian measures  adopted  to\r\n\r\nshore  up  the dollar's crumbling defences  and  to\r\n\r\nexact  trade concessions from her trading  partners\r\n\r\n(including  restraints  in  textile  exports  under\r\n\r\n\"voluntary\"     agreements)     had      widespread\r\n\r\nrepercussions  on world economies.  Many  countries\r\n\r\nwere  obliged  to  float  their  currencies  or  to\r\n\r\nrestrict dealings in their currency exchanges,  and\r\n\r\nthe   resultant  uncertainties  on  prices  had   a\r\n\r\ndepressive effect upon world trade. There was  even\r\n\r\ntalk  of  retaliatory  restrictions  being  imposed\r\n\r\nagainst  U.S, goods. By the end of the year,  wiser\r\n\r\ncounsels  prevailed and the crisis began to  recede\r\n\r\nwith an agreement for the devaluation of the dollar\r\n\r\nagainst  gold  and realignment of all  other  major\r\n\r\ncurrencies on new parities or central rates  either\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  the U.S, dollar or gold.  To  ensure\r\n\r\nfurther stability, the limits within which currency\r\n\r\nrates were allowed to fluctuate were widened from 1\r\n\r\nper  cent to 2\ufffd per cent on either side of  parity.\r\n\r\nThis wider band should, theoretically, give greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  governments  intending  to  defend\r\n\r\ntheir   central  rates  against  speculation.   The\r\n\r\nfinancial  world has therefore been  given  respite\r\n\r\nfrom  impending  disaster, but the  basic  problems\r\n\r\nunderlying  the  monetary  crisis  remain   to   be\r\n\r\nresolved. The year 1972 may yet see a recrudescence\r\n\r\nof  the  old  symptoms  and  a  recurrence  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the general realignment of currencies when the\r\n\r\ndollar  was devalued in terms of gold by  8.57  per\r\n\r\ncent,  Singapore  followed  the  British  Pound  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  its gold parity. In other  words,  the\r\n\r\nPound  Sterling  was revalued upwards  against  the\r\n\r\nAmerican Dollar by 8.57 per cent, and the Singapore\r\n\r\nDollar maintained its parity with Sterling and  was\r\n\r\nalso revalued upwards by 8.57 per cent against  the\r\n\r\nU.S.  Dollar.  However,  in  relation  to  all   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  world trading partners  the  effective\r\n\r\nnet revaluation for the Singapore Dollar has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalculated to be only 0.53 per cent. Our trade with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will be completely unaffected  as  parity\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Singapore and Malaysian  dollars  has\r\n\r\nbeen maintained, but one consequence of Singapore's\r\n\r\ndecision   not   to   follow  the-American   Dollar\r\n\r\ndownwards may be some small increase in the overall\r\n\r\ncost  of  imports. However, this increase could  be\r\n\r\nreduced  if  trade  and  capital  transactions  are\r\n\r\nchanged  in  direction  to take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\naltered  currency rates. Thus, unless  prices  also\r\n\r\nchange,  imports from Japan and Germany  which  are\r\n\r\nnow relatively more expensive as suppliers, may  be\r\n\r\nreduced  while  imports  from  the  United  States,\r\n\r\ncheaper   because   of  devaluations,   should   be\r\n\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary uncertainty had a deleterious effect\r\n\r\non  trade last year. In a preliminary assessment of\r\n\r\ninternational trade in 1971, the General  Agreement\r\n\r\non   Tariffs   and  Trade  (G.A.T.T.)   Secretariat\r\n\r\nindicated that there was a marked slowdown  in  the\r\n\r\nrate  of growth of world trade in 1971. The  volume\r\n\r\nof trade grew by a mere 5 per cent - well below the\r\n\r\naverage  annual  growth of the sixties.  In  dollar\r\n\r\nvalues,  the  increase in trade was  close  to  the\r\n\r\naverage  of  9.3  per -cent for  the  last  decade.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  value figures are  inflated  by  the\r\n\r\nparity  changes during the year and  even  so,  the\r\n\r\nrise  remains well below that recorded in 1969  and\r\n\r\n1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government's decade-long quest to\r\n\r\njoin  the  European Economic Community (E.E.C.)  on\r\n\r\nacceptable terms has finally succeeded. The British\r\n\r\nParliament  endorsed  by  a  sizable  majority   in\r\n\r\nOctober 1971 the principle of Britain's entry  into\r\n\r\nthe E.E.C. In spite of the narrow majority recently\r\n\r\non  the Second Reading of the legislation to effect\r\n\r\nsuch entry, we must expect that Britain will be  in\r\n\r\nthe European Common Market in January 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain's move to identify herself more with the\r\n\r\nEuropean  community  of  nations  will  have  major\r\n\r\neffects on her relationship with other Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries and on the role and status of the Pound\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSterling  as  an  international  currency  and  the\r\n\r\nmonetary  reserve  assets of  other  Sterling  Area\r\n\r\ncountries.  Singapore  will  now,  therefore,  like\r\n\r\nother  members  of  the  Commonwealth  and  of  the\r\n\r\nSterling  Area,  have to consider her  position  in\r\n\r\nrelation to these two matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in regard to the change in its trading\r\n\r\nrelationship with Commonwealth countries under  the\r\n\r\npresent  system  of Commonwealth  preferences,  the\r\n\r\nBritish entry into an outward-looking E.E.C, should\r\n\r\nnot have too serious effects on Singapore's trading\r\n\r\nposition. The main dislocation is likely  to  arise\r\n\r\nfrom the application of the common external tariffs\r\n\r\nof the E.E.C, which the United Kingdom will have to\r\n\r\nimplement  in  stages  on imports  from  non-E.E.C.\r\n\r\ncountries.  The  ultimate  situation  will  be  the\r\n\r\neventual   elimination   of  preferential   tariffs\r\n\r\nenjoyed by Commonwealth members in their trade with\r\n\r\nBritain  in the past. While our entrepot trade  may\r\n\r\nbe  affected in volume and our earnings reduced  on\r\n\r\nthe  export  of entrepot trade commodities  to  the\r\n\r\nE.E.C.,  it  is  mainly our domestic  exports  into\r\n\r\nBritain  which  will be affected by the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the Commonwealth preference rates and  the\r\n\r\nE.E.C, common external tariff. Less than one-third\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's present exports to Britain  are  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  origin,  but this is likely  to  increase\r\n\r\nconsiderably in the future. Singapore would benefit\r\n\r\nfrom freer entry into an enlarged E.E.C, market for\r\n\r\nits  goods.  It  is  therefore  our  intention,  by\r\n\r\nestablishing  an  official  representation  to  the\r\n\r\nE.E.C, in    Brussels,   to   investigate    the\r\n\r\npossibilities  of  negotiating an associate  member\r\n\r\nstatus  or a trade agreement with the E.E.C, which\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate  such entry. This  could  be  done\r\n\r\nbilaterally and also, as has been suggested,  in  a\r\n\r\ncommon  approach  with other ASEAN (Association  of\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian Nations) countries, on the 1ineX of\r\n\r\nthe  South American Andean Common Market talks with\r\n\r\nthe E.E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the question of Singapore's\r\n\r\nSterling reserves.

Special Drawing  Rights  (or\r\n\r\nS.D.Rs). The latter is the more likely in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe British Chancellor of the Exchequer's Speech at\r\n\r\nthe I.M.F./ I.B.R.D.

In consideration\r\n\r\nof  this  obligation, 90 per cent of such. Sterling\r\n\r\nreserves  are  guaranteed  by  Britain  against   a\r\n\r\ndevaluation of the British Pound by more than 1 per\r\n\r\ncent  from  its old parity of US$2.40  to  1.  The\r\n\r\ncurrency realignment after the recent international\r\n\r\nmonetary  crisis  resulted in.  Sterling  having  a\r\n\r\nparity  or  central rate-of US$2.6057 to the  Pound\r\n\r\nand a wider margin of 2\ufffd per cent on either side of\r\n\r\nparity,   which   clearly  renders   the   Sterling\r\n\r\nGuarantee  Agreement  inapplicable  without   major\r\n\r\namendment. To meet the new situation, therefore,  I\r\n\r\npropose  to  initiate discussions with the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment for the cancellation or amendment of the\r\n\r\nSterling  Guarantee Agreement in  order  that  some\r\n\r\nfurther diversification of our external assets may,\r\n\r\nif necessary, be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore's Economy in 1971</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss in some -detail the\r\n\r\nperformance   of   our   economy.   I   am    again\r\n\r\ndistributing,  for the convenience  of  Members,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of statistical tables (See Appendix, cols. 553-88), upon which I  shall partly base my remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1972/19720307/19720307-HA-0310553.pdf\"\">Appendix to Annual Budget Statement(Cols. 553-588)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously mentioned the figure of 14 per\r\n\r\ncent in connection with our preliminary figures for\r\n\r\nG.D.P, growth  in  1971. The  more  commonly  used\r\n\r\nindicator  of  overall growth, the  Gross  National\r\n\r\nProduct  (G.N.P.)  has  also been  calculated  this\r\n\r\nyear.  Preliminary estimates of G.N.P, at  current\r\n\r\nprices  for  the year show that it rose  by  $860.8\r\n\r\nmillion to reach the level of $7,000.8 million.  In\r\n\r\npercentage  terms, this represented an increase  of\r\n\r\nsome  14.0  per  cent which, though somewhat  lower\r\n\r\nthan   the   17.2  per  cent  recorded  for   1970,\r\n\r\nnevertheless compared favourably with  the  average\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate of around 14.1 per cent per annum  for\r\n\r\nthe period 1966-70. Estimates of G.N.P, at constant\r\n\r\nprices  are  not  yet  available  at  this  moment.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the general price levels except  for\r\n\r\ncertain  lines of consumer goods have been observed\r\n\r\nto show mild increases, it can be expected that the\r\n\r\nreal growth in G.N.P., discounting price increases,\r\n\r\nwould  not  deviate significantly from the  current\r\n\r\nprice  estimation.  Growth was, therefore,  in  the\r\n\r\nmain non-inflationary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the population growth of nearly 2 per cent\r\n\r\nin  1971,  the per capita G.N.P, at current  market\r\n\r\nprices  advanced by about 12.1 per cent from $2,960\r\n\r\nin  1970 to $3,317 in 1971. At these levels the per\r\n\r\ncapita  G.N.P, is the second highest in Asia  after\r\n\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting indicator is that for Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic Expenditure (G.D.E.) representing resource\r\n\r\nuse.   Preliminary   estimates   of   G.D.E, also\r\n\r\nregistered a comparable high rate of increase.  The\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  all goods and  services  for  1971\r\n\r\namounted to $6,759.3 million, which is about $1,000\r\n\r\nmillion,  or 17.4 per cent higher compared  to  the\r\n\r\n1970  estimates. As for G.N.P., the  G.D.E, growth\r\n\r\nrate was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslightly  below the level experienced  in  1970  of\r\n\r\naround 21.0 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase was contributed by both components,\r\n\r\nnamely,  consumption  and  gross  domestic  capital\r\n\r\nformation. Capital formation rose substantially  by\r\n\r\n$383.6  million, or 27.9 per cent, to reach a  high\r\n\r\nlevel  of $1,759.3 million, which consumption  rose\r\n\r\nmore moderately hut still at a sizable rate of 14.1\r\n\r\nper  cent  to  reach $5,000 million.  The  rise  in\r\n\r\ncapital  formation, though somewhat less than  that\r\n\r\nachieved in 1970 of $421 million, or 44.2 per cent,\r\n\r\nwas  still  substantial, and it can  be  said  with\r\n\r\nconfidence that Singapore's political stability and\r\n\r\nits  potential for profitable economic  development\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be recognised by investors both  local\r\n\r\nand abroad. Economic Development Board estimates of\r\n\r\ncommitments  for additional foreign  investment  in\r\n\r\nnew  industries or for expansion of  existing  ones\r\n\r\nindicate  that  this will total $930  million,  not\r\n\r\nmuch less than the $1,000 million for 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross Domestic Capital Formation, which registered\r\n\r\na  growth rate of 27.0 per cent per annum  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  1967- 69, rose sharply to a peak  level  of\r\n\r\n44.2  per  cent  in  1970 over 1969.  Although  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  for  1971 of 27.9 per cent  was  noticeably\r\n\r\nbelow the rate experienced in 1970, nevertheless it\r\n\r\nmeasures up to the trend of growth for the  earlier\r\n\r\nperiod  1967-69.  The  lower  growth  rate  of  new\r\n\r\ninvestments in 1971 can be explained partly by  the\r\n\r\nslowing   down   of  construction   activity,   due\r\n\r\nprimarily to the shortage of capacity - labour  and\r\n\r\nmaterial  resources - in the industry generated  by\r\n\r\nthe  boom in building activity during the past  two\r\n\r\nto  three years. This lack of capacity has also led\r\n\r\nto   the  control  of  urban  renewal  development.\r\n\r\nFurther,  a  relatively  smaller  growth  rate   in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  machinery and equipment  was  also\r\n\r\nregistered  compared to 1970,  and  this  has  also\r\n\r\ncontributed to the smaller growth rate in the Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Capital Formation during the  year.  This\r\n\r\nwas due to the establishment in 1970 of a number of\r\n\r\nlarge   industries   where  expensive   plant   and\r\n\r\nmachinery have been set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial expansion in Gross Domestic\r\n\r\nCapital  Formation in 1971 reflected the  increased\r\n\r\npace of development efforts in both the public  and\r\n\r\nprivate   sectors.   Private   sector   investments\r\n\r\nincreased by 29.3 per cent to $1,304.3 million  and\r\n\r\npublic sector by 23.9 per cent to $455 million.  As\r\n\r\nin  previous years, the private sector's  share  of\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure was maintained at a high level,\r\n\r\naccounting for about 74 per cent in 1970 and  1971,\r\n\r\nas  against 26 per cent for the public sector.  The\r\n\r\nincrease  for  the  private sector  was  mainly  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of expenditure on transport equipment  and\r\n\r\nconstruction    of    non-residential    buildings,\r\n\r\nprimarily   of  offices,  shopping  complexes   and\r\n\r\nfactories,  whereas for the public sector,  it  was\r\n\r\nmainly  in  respect of machinery and equipment  and\r\n\r\npublic housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on transport equipment by the private\r\n\r\nsector  increased  very substantially  from  $108.2\r\n\r\nmillion  to  $271.5 million, giving an increase  of\r\n\r\n150.0  per  cent,  and  this comprised  largely  of\r\n\r\npurchases of ships and air--craft by Neptune Orient\r\n\r\nLines and Malaysia-Singapore Airlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of consumption, public sector\r\n\r\nexpenditure rose much more sharply by 35.1 per cent\r\n\r\nthan did private consumption expenditure (10.2  per\r\n\r\ncent).   The  increase  in  Government  consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure, which has been expanding rapidly since\r\n\r\n1969,  far  exceeded the rate achieved in  1970  of\r\n\r\n25.5  per  cent,  whereas for  private  consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure it was below the 1970 level of 13.5 per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net result of these changes is that the share\r\n\r\ncomposition of private consumption expenditure fell\r\n\r\nfrom  64.3  per cent in 1970 to 60.4  per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1971,   whilst   that  of  Government   consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  Gross Domestic Capital  Formation\r\n\r\nrose  from 11.8 per cent and 23.9 per cent to  13.6\r\n\r\nper  cent  and  26.0 per cent respectively.  It  is\r\n\r\nsignificant   that   the   share   of   consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure (both private and public) to total\r\n\r\n-expenditure  fell from 93.4 per cent  in  1960  to\r\n\r\n74.0 per cent in 1971, whereas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   Gross  Domestic  Capital  Formation  it  rose\r\n\r\nmarkedly  from 6.6 per cent to 26.0  per  cent,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of nearly four times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest increase in private consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in 1971 was registered in  expenditure\r\n\r\non  clothing, furniture and durables,  housing  and\r\n\r\ntransport,  which  was  in  line  with  the   trend\r\n\r\nexperienced during the past few years. The  outcome\r\n\r\nof  this is that the share of expenditure on  basic\r\n\r\nnecessities, primarily food, has fallen  from  32.3\r\n\r\nper  cent in 1960 to 25.4 per cent in 1971,  whilst\r\n\r\nthe  shares for other items have risen accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis  is a reflection of the rising economic  well-being  of  the population. With respect  to  public\r\n\r\nsector consumption, the sharp increase of 35.1  per\r\n\r\ncent  in 1971 as well as for the previous two years\r\n\r\nof  over  20  per cent was largely for the  defence\r\n\r\nbuild-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Product by Industrial Origin</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we turn to review the Republic's\r\n\r\nperformance  in the various sectors of the  economy\r\n\r\nin 1971, it is perhaps in order to mention that the\r\n\r\nrapid  growth,  particularly during the  past  five\r\n\r\nyears,  has  been  accompanied by  some  degree  of\r\n\r\nstructural  transformation  of  the  economy.   The\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and construction sectors  registered\r\n\r\nrapid growth particularly during the last five-year\r\n\r\nperiod whereas the trade and other services sectors\r\n\r\nhad  a  relatively lower rate of  growth.  The  net\r\n\r\nresult  was  that  the  share  composition  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and construction sectors jointly rose\r\n\r\nsharply from 11.2 per cent in 1960 to 25.5 per cent\r\n\r\nin  1970  and 28.5 per cent in 1971. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  ratio of the trade and  other  services\r\n\r\nsectors  to  the G.D.P, has slipped from  70.7  per\r\n\r\ncent in 1960 to only 58.6 per cent in 1970 and 55.5\r\n\r\nper cent in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to review the development of the\r\n\r\nmajor     sectors,     primarily     manufacturing,\r\n\r\nconstruction,   trade,  Government   services   and\r\n\r\nutilities,  and  other  services  sectors,  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and their impact on the overall growth  of\r\n\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i)    Manufacturing Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1971, manufacturing industries generated an\r\n\r\nincome contribution of $1,490.9 million to G.D.P.,\r\n\r\nan  increase of 30.3 per cent compared to 27.5 per\r\n\r\ncent  in 1970. This was nearly eight times as much\r\n\r\nas  in 1960, while G.D.P, grew by three times over\r\n\r\nthis period. This rapid development has raised the\r\n\r\nshare  composition of the manufacturing sector  to\r\n\r\ntotal G.D.P, from 9.2 per cent in 1960 to 23.0 per\r\n\r\ncent in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries are becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly characterised by orientation  towards\r\n\r\nexports  and  by  the  higher  quality  of   their\r\n\r\nproducts.  Overall,  some  40  per  cent  of   our\r\n\r\ndomestic  manufactures is exported. Among  pioneer\r\n\r\ncompanies, exports account for some two-thirds  of\r\n\r\ntheir  output. Last year, more than  one-third  of\r\n\r\nour  domestic exports went to developed countries,\r\n\r\nas  compared with less than one-fifth  five  years\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest growth was recorded by the petroleum\r\n\r\nrefining, manufacture of electrical machinery  and\r\n\r\napparatus,   and  ship  building   and   repairing\r\n\r\nindustries   where  increases   in   value   added\r\n\r\naveraging  around 40.0 per cent were recorded.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  these industries, other  sub-sectors\r\n\r\nalso  registered favourable growth during 1971  as\r\n\r\ncompared to 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major obstacles in industrial growth\r\n\r\nexperienced  in  1971 was the  acute  shortage  of\r\n\r\nskilled  labour  for specific  industries.  Up  to\r\n\r\n1971,   increases  in  output  were   matched   by\r\n\r\nincreases   in  employment.  The  average   labour\r\n\r\nproductivity  in  manufacturing  appears  to  have\r\n\r\nrisen  very little and rapid industrial  expansion\r\n\r\nhas  been  wholly  dependent on a  growing  labour\r\n\r\ninput.  However,  this is not likely  to  continue\r\n\r\nsince  the rapid restructuring of the economy  and\r\n\r\nthe  raising  of the technological  level  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour   force   through   retraining   and    the\r\n\r\nacquisition  of new skills are now being  actively\r\n\r\npromoted, as I shall describe later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of the industry will also-have to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  higher  productivity and  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy is aimed at achieving this target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from the Census of Industrial Production\r\n\r\nshowed  that the largest industrial sector in  the\r\n\r\neconomy is petroleum refining which accounted  for\r\n\r\nabout  33.4-per  cent  of  total  output  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector in 1971. By the end of  1970,\r\n\r\ntotal  refining capacity in Singapore amounted  to\r\n\r\n368,000  barrels daily. In 1971 the  capacity  was\r\n\r\nincreased by a, further 250,000 barrels  per  day.\r\n\r\nHowever,  although petroleum refining is a, major\r\n\r\nactivity  in  terms of output, in terms  of  value\r\n\r\nadded  the contribution of this industry to  total\r\n\r\nvalue  added  of manufacturing is  only  20.2  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with the oil industry and.

Of the more traditional  industries,\r\n\r\nfood,  beverage  and  tobacco  industries  jointly\r\n\r\naccounted  for another 9.4 per cent of the  total.\r\n\r\nvalue added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii)   Construction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution by the construction industry,\r\n\r\nwhich has been growing rapidly since 1967, rose by\r\n\r\nabout  16.6 per cent, to $352.5 million  in  1971.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the growth rate was much lower  compared\r\n\r\nto  the  previous year of 47.1 per  cent,  it  was\r\n\r\nnevertheless among the highest rates-registered by\r\n\r\nthe  other sectors and was-well above the 14.0 per\r\n\r\ncent for the-overall G.D.P.

The lower growth rate  for\r\n\r\n1971 compared to 1970 can be largely attributed to\r\n\r\nthe  shortage  of capacity faced by  the  industry\r\n\r\nboth in terms of labour and contracting skills and\r\n\r\nmaterials which have been developing for some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  now.

The situation was aggravated\r\n\r\nby speculators moving in to corner the market, and\r\n\r\nGovernment had to step in on a number of occasions\r\n\r\nto  authorize  controlled  imports  of  restricted\r\n\r\nbuilding materials to meet the shortage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceleration of the growth in this sector\r\n\r\nduring  1971  was  primarily in  respect  of  non-residential  buildings in the private  sector  due\r\n\r\nlargely  to the curtailment of sales of sites  for\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  projects.  Construction  of   non-residential  buildings comprising mainly  shopping\r\n\r\nand  office  complexes undertaken by  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  registered a relatively small increase  of\r\n\r\n21.9  per cent compared to 121.6 per cent in 1970.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, construction of  residential\r\n\r\nbuildings  forged ahead with a higher growth  rate\r\n\r\nof  32.6  per  cent compared to 28.4 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1970.  The increase has been primarily in  respect\r\n\r\nof public housing and, to a lesser extent, private\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii) Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth rate for the entrepot and domestic\r\n\r\ntrade sector, which formed nearly one-third of the\r\n\r\nG.D.P., reflected a slight declining trend  during\r\n\r\nthe past decade, except for 1968 and 1969 when the\r\n\r\naccelerated  growth reflected  the  resumption  of\r\n\r\ntrade with Indonesia. In line with this trend, the\r\n\r\ncontribution of this sector increased by only  9.6\r\n\r\nper cent or $166.7 million in 1971, representing a\r\n\r\nslower rate of growth compared to 12.6 per cent in\r\n\r\n1970.  This  lag  could  be attributed  to,  among\r\n\r\nothers,  the pursuit of a direct trade  policy  by\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, the general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecline in produce prices primarily of rubber, the\r\n\r\nde-escalation of the war in Vietnam and, last  but\r\n\r\nnot  least, the-uncertain trading conditions which\r\n\r\nprevailed during the recent international monetary\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total increase in the trade sector,\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  accounted for 3.6  per  cent  and\r\n\r\ndomestic  trade  for  6.0 per cent.  The  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade component, which showed a declining trend in\r\n\r\ngrowth  over the past decade, virtually maintained\r\n\r\nthe  same low rate of growth of 3.0 per cent.  The\r\n\r\ndomestic  trade sector increased by 13.8 per  cent\r\n\r\nwhich,  though higher than the entrepot trade  was\r\n\r\nbelow the level recorded in 1970 of 20.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe  increase in domestic trade sector was however\r\n\r\nclose  to  the overall rate for the  G.D.P.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the ratio of the entrepot trade to  total\r\n\r\nG.D.P, declined further from 12.0 per cent in 1970\r\n\r\nto  10.9  per  cent in 1971, whereas for  domestic\r\n\r\ntrade  the same ratio of around 18 per cent as  in\r\n\r\nthe previous year was maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that within the trade\r\n\r\nsector  there  has also been a shift  in  emphasis\r\n\r\nwith  domestic  trade  gaining  in  importance  as\r\n\r\ncompared to entrepot trade. Entrepot trade,  which\r\n\r\nin the earlier sixties formed 18.6 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntrade  sector, dropped to only 10.9  per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1971,  while  domestic trade gained in importance,\r\n\r\nparticularly  from 1968. In value terms,  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  amounted to $703.6 million in 1971  against\r\n\r\n$1,206.0 million for domestic trade, and  this  is\r\n\r\nin  sharp  contrast to 1960 where  entrepot  trade\r\n\r\namounted  to $381.1 million and domestic trade  to\r\n\r\n$269.0  million, The declining trend  of  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  may  be  largely attributed,  as  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, to an increasing participation of  direct\r\n\r\nforeign  trade by neighbouring countries  and  the\r\n\r\nlow  level, of produce prices. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  rapid growth in the domestic trade sub-sector\r\n\r\nhas  been propelled by the rising purchasing power\r\n\r\nof  the population and increased earnings from the\r\n\r\ndistribution of domestic export which has shown  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  growth  during the  past  few  years.\r\n\r\nContinued expansion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this sub-sector can be expected in the next few\r\n\r\nyears in line with the general economic growth.  On\r\n\r\nbalance   it   is  envisaged  that  the   declining\r\n\r\nimportance of the entrepot trade in the years ahead\r\n\r\nwill  be offset by the growth of the domestic trade\r\n\r\nsector  and  the  trade sector as a  whole  can  be\r\n\r\nexpected  at the minimum to maintain the  trend  of\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate recorded for the period 1970 and  1971\r\n\r\nof around 11.1 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total external trade reached a record level\r\n\r\nof  about $14,026.3 million in 1971, an increase of\r\n\r\n$1,736.7  million or 14.1 per cent as against  11.9\r\n\r\nper cent in 1970. Exports rose by 12.9 per cent  to\r\n\r\n$5,371.3 million in 1971, while imports advanced at\r\n\r\na faster rate of 14.9 per cent to $8,655.0 million,\r\n\r\ncompared with the respective rates of 0.3 per  cent\r\n\r\nand  20.7 per cent for the previous year. The  most\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase was observed  in  imports  of\r\n\r\ncapital  goods and materials to meet the  increased\r\n\r\npace of development in the industrial sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of exports, the increase came\r\n\r\nprimarily from domestic exports which rose by  29.6\r\n\r\nper  cent to the level -of $2,368.2 million as  new\r\n\r\nmarkets are found for the products manufactured  by\r\n\r\nlocal  industries.  The rising  trend  in  domestic\r\n\r\nexports  is  expected  to  continue  as  increasing\r\n\r\npromotional efforts are being made to establish new\r\n\r\nmarkets  overseas. Re-exports or entrepot  exports,\r\n\r\nhowever,  stagnated  at the 1970  level  of  around\r\n\r\n$3,003.1  million  which may be attributed  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  slump  in  prices of primary  commodities,\r\n\r\nprimarily of rubber and the increased participation\r\n\r\nin  direct  trade by our neighbours. To the  extent\r\n\r\nthat our neighbours continue to pursue their direct\r\n\r\ntrade  policies and world prices of primary produce\r\n\r\nremain  at low levels, it can be expected that  re-exports  will  decline  in  the  years  ahead   and\r\n\r\naccordingly the contribution of the entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nsector to the G.D.P, would also decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorded trade deficit in 1971 amounted to\r\n\r\nsome  $3,283.7 million compared to $2,778.0 million\r\n\r\nin   1970.  The  ever-widening  trade  deficit   as\r\n\r\nrecorded,  particularly in recent years,  has  been\r\n\r\naggravated  by  higher  costs  of  imported  goods.\r\n\r\nUnlike other industrial countries such as Japan and\r\n\r\nGermany,   which  have  accumulated   large   trade\r\n\r\nsurpluses,  Singapore has run  a  persistent  trade\r\n\r\ndeficit  and  this  has been  largely  financed  by\r\n\r\nearnings   from  \"invisibles\"  and  large   capital\r\n\r\ninflows  which have gone into meeting the costs  of\r\n\r\nsubstantial imports of machinery and equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there may be concern at the consequences\r\n\r\nof  our  growing  trade deficit in the  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments,  I  have explained in the  Budget  Speech\r\n\r\nlast  year  that  there is basically  no  need  for\r\n\r\nalarm.  Our  preliminary estimates  of  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments  indicate  that the  balance  of  payments\r\n\r\nsurplus  would amount to $844.6 million, which  far\r\n\r\nexceeds the surplus for 1970 by $383.3 million.  In\r\n\r\nthe  coming year or two, however, it is  felt  that\r\n\r\nunless large capital inflows continue and increase,\r\n\r\nthe balance of payments position may be strained as\r\n\r\nthe   Republic  would  be  faced  with  the   total\r\n\r\nreduction   of  British  military  expenditure   in\r\n\r\nSingapore which would undoubtedly have a big impact\r\n\r\non  Singapore's external financial position.  Also,\r\n\r\npayments  for machinery and equipment and materials\r\n\r\nfor  industrial  development as  well  as  for  the\r\n\r\npublic   sector   infrastructure  development   are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  increase in the  next  two  to  three\r\n\r\nyears.  Thus,  the  pressure  on  the  balance   of\r\n\r\npayments may, in certain circumstances, be expected\r\n\r\nto  continue till such time when new industries are\r\n\r\nfully   operational  and  have  established  export\r\n\r\nmarkets for their products and when the anticipated\r\n\r\nlarger    earnings   from   tourism    and    other\r\n\r\n\"invisibles\", such as ship-repairing,  materialise.\r\n\r\nThus,  it is of utmost priority that efforts should\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  increase  our  domestic  exports  and\r\n\r\ninvisible earnings and Government's policy is aimed\r\n\r\nat fostering this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iv)   Government Services and Public Utilities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution by Government services in 1971\r\n\r\nto  the  G.D.P, increased by 15.9 per  cent,  which\r\n\r\nfollows  the  trend of growth for the  past  decade\r\n\r\nwhere an annual average growth rate of about 14 per\r\n\r\ncent  was  registered.  The  contribution  of  this\r\n\r\nsector to G.D.P, in 1971 was $452 million. At  this\r\n\r\nlevel,  Government services accounted for  about  7\r\n\r\nper  cent of the G.D.P. It is interesting  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the share composition of this sector  to  the\r\n\r\nG.D.P, has been maintained at a steady 7 per  cent\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  entire period. The main  increases\r\n\r\nare in respect of expenditure on defence, education\r\n\r\nand health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of Government services, public\r\n\r\nutilities showed a steady growth i-ate of 13.7  per\r\n\r\ncent  for  the year under review and its  share  to\r\n\r\nG.D.P, has  been maintained at around 2  per  cent\r\n\r\nsince  1966.  The contribution of  this  sector  to\r\n\r\nG.D.P, stood at $157.3 million in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(v) Other Services</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(a) Tourism</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told you in the last Budget Speech, it is\r\n\r\nour  intention to develop the tourist  industry  to\r\n\r\nincrease the flow of foreign exchange earnings  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen   the  balance  of  payments   position.\r\n\r\nHowever,  care has to be exercised to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe investment is in those facilities and amenities\r\n\r\nwhich do not tax the already short supply of labour\r\n\r\nresources. To this end, the massive hotel  building\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  the last few years  has  had  to  be\r\n\r\nslowed   down  to  provide  for  a  more   balanced\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and  the  reallocation  of   building\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  other  capacity  to  development\r\n\r\nprojects of higher priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouraging signs of success in our efforts\r\n\r\nin  promoting tourism is evidenced by  the  growing\r\n\r\nnumber of visitors who come to Singapore each year.\r\n\r\nIn  1971, 632,000 tourists visited the Republic, as\r\n\r\nagainst  522,000  in  1970  and  409,000  in  1969.\r\n\r\nAlthough the growth rate for 1971 of 21.0 per  cent\r\n\r\nis lower than the 27.6 per cent for 1970,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich was partly due to the post-Expo `70 influx of\r\n\r\ntourists, the growth rate of tourist arrivals is  a\r\n\r\nfairly respectable rate by international standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings from tourism continued to grow and\r\n\r\nreached  $323  million in 1971 compared  to  $275.6\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1970, or an increase of some  17.2  per\r\n\r\ncent.  This was ten times higher than 1960, thereby\r\n\r\nraising the share composition from 1.5 per cent  in\r\n\r\n1960  to 5.0 per cent in 1971. The average stay  of\r\n\r\nvisitors also rose slightly from about 3.3 days  in\r\n\r\n1967 to about 3.9 days in 1970 and 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite our past efforts to promote\r\n\r\ntourism  there  remains much to  be  done.  A  more\r\n\r\nintensive programme is required to attract tourists\r\n\r\nto  Singapore especially from those countries whose\r\n\r\nnationals  are  now providing the  major  share  of\r\n\r\nworld  tourists. By these, I mean Japan, Australia,\r\n\r\nthe   United   States,  and  the  richer   European\r\n\r\ncountries. The occupancy rate for hotels has fallen\r\n\r\nfrom 73.5 per cent in 1969 to 70.7 per cent in 1970\r\n\r\nand 65.4 per cent in 1971. One of the objectives of\r\n\r\ntourist  promotion will, therefore, be to  get  the\r\n\r\noccupancy rate back to something like the level  of\r\n\r\nthe  late sixties, and the hotel industry  and  the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board will each have to play  its\r\n\r\npart  to  achieve  this end. On the  infrastructure\r\n\r\nside  and the provision of amenities and facilities\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Development Budget for the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  1972-73 makes provisions for the  development\r\n\r\nof  a large number of projects which should go some\r\n\r\nway  to  encouraging  tourists  to  increase  their\r\n\r\nlength of stay in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, with greater promotional efforts, I expect\r\n\r\nthat   the  tourist  industry  will  increase   its\r\n\r\nearnings in the current and ensuing years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(b) Foreign Military Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimates for foreign military\r\n\r\nexpenditure in 1971 covering both British  military\r\n\r\nexpenditure    and   expenditure   by    A.N.Z.U.K.\r\n\r\n(Australia-New   Zealand-United   Kingdom)   Forces\r\n\r\nindicate that there is practically no change in the\r\n\r\nlevel of expenditure from that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregistered  in  1970. The expenditure  remained  at\r\n\r\naround  $420  million.  The  phased  reduction   in\r\n\r\nBritish   military  expenditure,  which  was   only\r\n\r\ncompleted   by   the  later  part  of   1971,   was\r\n\r\ncounterbalanced  by  a  corresponding  increase  in\r\n\r\nA.N.Z.U.K. Forces expenditure during the year.  The\r\n\r\nfull  impact  of the withdrawal has  not  therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  felt in 1971. When the expenditure  for  this\r\n\r\nsub-sector is reduced to less than $100 million  in\r\n\r\n1972, it is hoped that any dampening effect on  the\r\n\r\neconomy   particularly  on  domestic   demand   and\r\n\r\nemployment  can  be counteracted. Since  the  major\r\n\r\ngrowth    sectors    of   the   economy,    namely,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, construction, tourism,  banking  and\r\n\r\nport  activity,  are expected to forge  ahead  with\r\n\r\nsustained efforts at expansion, the delayed effects\r\n\r\nof  the complete British military withdrawal in the\r\n\r\ncurrent year can be fully mitigated and the economy\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n-continue to grow, though perhaps at a lower  level\r\n\r\nthan in the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(c)    Banking and Insurance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to conclude this sectoral\r\n\r\nanalysis  with  a reference to that sector  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  -  banking and insurance - which  embraces\r\n\r\nthe   financial  operations  of  the  economy.  The\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  banking  and  insurance  to   the\r\n\r\nG.D.P.,  which  has  consistently  shown  a  rising\r\n\r\ntrend,  further expanded by 15.0 per cent to $112.6\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1971.  The share in  G.D.P, has  been\r\n\r\nmaintained  at  around 1.7 per cent throughout  the\r\n\r\npast decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking continued to grow in 1971 along the lines\r\n\r\nof  Government  policy which is to encourage  Swiss\r\n\r\ntype  banking  procedures as part  of  the  overall\r\n\r\nprogramme  of developing Singapore into a financial\r\n\r\ncentre for Southeast Asia. By the end of 1971,  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  banks  totalled  42  with  192  branch\r\n\r\noffices. Total deposits rose from $3,194.9  million\r\n\r\nin  1970 to $3,745.8 million, giving a growth  rate\r\n\r\nof 17.2 per cent. Of total deposits, fixed deposits\r\n\r\ncomprised 57.9 per cent, indicating that banks have\r\n\r\nfunds to lend on a long-term basis. During the same\r\n\r\nperiod, bank loans and advances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased from $2,167.7 million to $2,615  million,\r\n\r\nan overall growth rate of 20.6 per cent. Banks have\r\n\r\ngradually moved into industrial financing though  a\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion of total loans  and  advances  is\r\n\r\nstill  made to trade and commerce. The latest  data\r\n\r\navailable  shows that by December 1971,  out  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal of $2,615 million in loans and advances, 31.3\r\n\r\nper  cent was made to the commercial sector,  while\r\n\r\n31.4 per cent was made to the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indicator of the growth of banking is\r\n\r\nreflected   by  the  increasing  share  of   demand\r\n\r\ndeposits  to  the total money supply.  On  average,\r\n\r\nabout  55 per cent of the total money supply, which\r\n\r\nis  a significant ratio by international standards,\r\n\r\nwas raised out of demand deposits. The fact that it\r\n\r\nforms  slightly more than half of the  total  money\r\n\r\nsupply  shows  that  banking facilities  are  being\r\n\r\nincreasingly made use of by the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Dollar Market continued to attract\r\n\r\nforeign funds. There are now 19 banks authorised to\r\n\r\ndeal in Asian Dollars as compared to 16 at the  end\r\n\r\nof  1970.  Total liabilities of the Asian  Currency\r\n\r\nUnits by the end of 1971 aggregated to nearly  US$1\r\n\r\nbillion as compared to US$400 million at the end of\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year  -  an increase  of  l\ufffd  times.\r\n\r\nInterest rates on Asian Dollar deposits have fallen\r\n\r\nin  sympathy with world interest rates and are  now\r\n\r\nearning   depositors  6.5  per  cent  for  one-year\r\n\r\ndeposits, 5 per cent to 6 per cent for three to six\r\n\r\nmonths  and  4.75  per  cent  for  one  month.   To\r\n\r\nstimulate  its  further expansion,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  encourage the development of an Asian  Dollar\r\n\r\nBond Market.

It is intended to  encourage\r\n\r\nfurther  borrowings in the Asian Dollar  Market  by\r\n\r\nreputable  financial institutions of good  standing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  the  ASEAN region  and  even  other\r\n\r\ncountries in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Future Prospects</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now future prospects: what is the ,outlook for\r\n\r\n1972 and beyond?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen from our survey of the international\r\n\r\neconomic  setting  and  our analysis  of  the  main\r\n\r\neconomic indicators and their growth rates that the\r\n\r\nperformance  of the Singapore economy was  affected\r\n\r\nlast  year  and will depend again this year  partly\r\n\r\nupon  the  turn  of international  events.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  of some concern that in spite  of  what\r\n\r\nwas thought at the time to be a valid settlement of\r\n\r\ninternational  monetary problems, we  should  still\r\n\r\nhave  continuing uncertainty, with weakness in  the\r\n\r\nU.S.  Dollar and volatility in exchange markets  in\r\n\r\nall  the  major financial centres. The  ability  of\r\n\r\nworld  trade  to  expand will  be  reduced  if  the\r\n\r\ndomestic problems of high unemployment at the  same\r\n\r\ntime  as inflation persist in many major economies;\r\n\r\nor  if the dollar reflow is delayed and the balance\r\n\r\nof payments problem continues in the United States;\r\n\r\nor  if  the  uncertainty and exchange  restrictions\r\n\r\narising   from   the  currency   crises   and   the\r\n\r\npossibility  so  soon  after  the  realignment   of\r\n\r\nDecember  of  yet another revaluation continues  to\r\n\r\naffect even the strong economy of Japan; or if  its\r\n\r\nslower  growth  rate, which only it  could  call  a\r\n\r\n\"recession\",   results  in   reduced   imports   of\r\n\r\npetroleum  products  from  the  Middle  East   (and\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  refining  centre)  and   of   raw\r\n\r\nmaterials such as iron ore and other minerals  from\r\n\r\nAustralia. The success of the domestic policies  of\r\n\r\nall  these  countries and, in  particular,  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  in solving their  problems  and  -\r\n\r\nstimulating growth would give a powerful uplift  to\r\n\r\nother  economies. It is to be hoped therefore that,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  gloomier predictions  since  then,\r\n\r\nthe  forecast  by most U.S, economists  during  the\r\n\r\nbeginning -of the year of a 5.5 to 6 per cent real\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth to about $1,150 billion or twice as much  as\r\n\r\nlast  year, with a price rise of some 3.1 -3.4  per\r\n\r\ncent only as measured by the G.N.P, deflator, and a\r\n\r\nreduction  of unemployment to under 5.5  per  cent,\r\n\r\ncan  be  realised. Certainly the presently  buoyant\r\n\r\nmarket  in  U.S. Stock Exchanges and the resumption\r\n\r\nof   consumer  spending  are  favourable  signs  of\r\n\r\nrecovery  in  the U.S, economy. It is to  be  hoped\r\n\r\nalso   that   the   optimistic  estimate   of   the\r\n\r\nOrganisation    for   Economic   Cooperation    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment   (O.E.C.D.),   which   includes   most\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  including  Japan,   will   be\r\n\r\ncorrect  for a 5 per cent growth rate for  1972  as\r\n\r\nagainst 3 per cent for 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international trade picture is, however,\r\n\r\nobscure. The G.A.T.T, prediction of world trade for\r\n\r\n1972  contented itself on 15th February, 1972, with\r\n\r\nthe statement that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is difficult to forecast developments in 1972\r\n\r\nin  terms  of value with any confidence.  It  seems\r\n\r\nlikely,  however,  that the rise in  export  prices\r\n\r\nexpressed in U.S, dollars will be greater  in  1972\r\n\r\nthan in 1971.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  volume  terms,  however,  it  was  prepared  to\r\n\r\nforecast a 5 per cent increase at best against  the\r\n\r\n8.5  per cent increase in 1970, and the 5 per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the general uncertainty and of the\r\n\r\nmore restricted trade and economic growth rates  in\r\n\r\nother countries, sustained growth for Singapore  in\r\n\r\n1972 may, as during the last year, lie largely with\r\n\r\nour  manufacturing sector and its ability to export\r\n\r\nits products. Our hope is that our vulnerability to\r\n\r\nthese adverse influences has been avoided, to  some\r\n\r\nextent,   by   our  selection  and  promotion,   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with our optimum investment policy,  of\r\n\r\nmulti-national  manufacturing  companies  having  a\r\n\r\nscope   for  progressive  growth  in  technological\r\n\r\ncontent in their manufactures, and, consequently, a\r\n\r\ngreater  capacity for development of modern  skills\r\n\r\nat  all  levels.  Unlike  simple  manufacturing  or\r\n\r\nassembly-type  industry  depending  upon  low  cost\r\n\r\nlabour,  these  industries are less  likely  to  be\r\n\r\ndisplaced  by  sudden competition in  their  export\r\n\r\nmarkets from new manufacturers from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  countries.  In any case, by  their  nature,\r\n\r\nmulti-national  companies  have  diversified   and\r\n\r\nestablished markets overseas and can operate also,\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary, largely independently of  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange requirements and variable currency rates,\r\n\r\nor  are  even  able  to take  advantage  of  them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  partly  for the reasons mentioned  above,\r\n\r\nour  leading growth sector, manufacturing, managed\r\n\r\nto grow by 30 per cent in 1971, a faster rate than\r\n\r\nin  1970,  in  spite  of the rather  more  adverse\r\n\r\ninternational  trading conditions in  1971,  which\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  Survey  of  Business  Opinions\r\n\r\ncovering  a  sample of industrial  establishments,\r\n\r\ncurbed the growth of some manufacturers during the\r\n\r\nfourth  quarter.  In short, we shall  do  well  to\r\n\r\npress on with the promotion and establishments  of\r\n\r\nmore, progressively higher, technology and export-oriented industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the achievement of higher levels of\r\n\r\nsophistication  in  industry is  correlated  to  a\r\n\r\ndiligent  and  disciplined  striving  for   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity.  This requires not  only  management\r\n\r\nefficiency  as  well as labour  productivity,  but\r\n\r\nalso an equitable sharing of the fruits of greater\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  upgraded  skills  in  an  orderly\r\n\r\nmanner. Among other matters, the determination  of\r\n\r\nequitable  shares will now be the concern  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council which has been set up  with\r\n\r\ntripartite  representation from labour,  employers\r\n\r\nand   the  Government.  The  Council's  role  will\r\n\r\ninclude  assisting in the formulation  of  general\r\n\r\nguidelines on wages policy, recommending necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments  in  wage structure, with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping a coherent wage system consistent  with\r\n\r\nlong-term  economic  and social  development,  and\r\n\r\nadvising  on desirable incentive systems  for  the\r\n\r\npromotion    of    operational   efficiency    and\r\n\r\nproductivity in various enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of higher technology and the work\r\n\r\nof  the Council both fall within Singapore's long-term  objective or strategy for the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nmodernisation in all sectors of our economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   its   transformation  into  an  increasingly\r\n\r\noutward-looking   cross-roads   of   international\r\n\r\neconomic  activities. Such a  long-term  objective\r\n\r\nwould   be   assisted  by  a  plan  for  long-term\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I have accordingly asked my  Ministry\r\n\r\nto  formulate such a plan for the l970s. In  order\r\n\r\nthat targets for the plan should be set which  are\r\n\r\nsufficiently  ambitious and yet perfectly  capable\r\n\r\nof realisation, the plan would project a sustained\r\n\r\nrapid  economic  growth of 15 per cent  per  annum\r\n\r\nwith  a doubling of the per capita income by 1975,\r\n\r\non  a  population growth checked by sensible small\r\n\r\nfamilies. With full employment, a goal that seemed\r\n\r\nunattainable in the 1960s, labour will  become  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly scarce resource, and the  development\r\n\r\nplan will also seek to maximise the income derived\r\n\r\nby   the  use  of  labour  through  the  expensive\r\n\r\ndevelopment of high skills and productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development plan will be supported by a\r\n\r\nprogramme for public sector action, which will not\r\n\r\nbe  to  a  rigid  framework but will  be  flexible\r\n\r\nenough to accommodate contingencies and unforeseen\r\n\r\ncircumstances. Five basic elements  or  components\r\n\r\nto  the  plan  have  been identified  for  special\r\n\r\nattention  and  for implementation in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector programme. These are manpower, science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,    infrastructure,    taxation     and\r\n\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to manpower, the intention will be\r\n\r\nto  build  up  a  large pool of  professional  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel through  upgrading  of  local\r\n\r\ntalents and skills, and selective immigration. Our\r\n\r\nindustrial  training  policies  will   be   geared\r\n\r\ntowards producing the necessary skills, while  our\r\n\r\nimmigration  policies  will  be  more  liberal  in\r\n\r\nselected  categories of skilled workers. We  shall\r\n\r\npresently  be  setting up an  Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nBoard   to   co-ordinate   and   rationalise   all\r\n\r\nindustrial training. Industrial training would  be\r\n\r\nboth  institution  based and  industry-based.  The\r\n\r\ninstitution-based industrial training will seek to\r\n\r\nimprove   technical  teaching   in   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools,  vocational   and   technical\r\n\r\ninstitutions  as  well  as  to  provide  technical\r\n\r\nteacher-training. The industry-based\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining  programme  will   include\r\n\r\napprenticeship  schemes,  off-the  job  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining,  overseas  training  schemes  and  joint\r\n\r\nindustry  /  Government  training.  The  Technical\r\n\r\nEducation    Department   will    be    finalising\r\n\r\narrangements for the apprenticeship schemes to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  co-operation  with   the   longer\r\n\r\nestablished firms in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to overseas training schemes, some\r\n\r\nare  sponsored  by  international  companies  with\r\n\r\noperations in Singapore. 412 trainees have already\r\n\r\ncompleted   their   training   and   returned   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Today,  there are 316  such  trainees,\r\n\r\nmostly in Germany and Japan. It is expected  that,\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of this year, the companies  will\r\n\r\nsend a further 400 abroad. Apart from these, which\r\n\r\nare  sponsored by the manufacturers, we have  also\r\n\r\nemplaced 53 trainees in precision engineering  and\r\n\r\nother  metal  trades in apprentice  programmes  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  while the Economic Development Board  has\r\n\r\nreceived firm offers for a further 206 to be  sent\r\n\r\nthis  year. For training at home, under the  joint\r\n\r\nindustry/Government training programmes, the first\r\n\r\ncentre  will  be located at the Jurong  Vocational\r\n\r\nInstitute and is expected to have its first intake\r\n\r\nof  50  trainees in a few months' time,  with  the\r\n\r\nintake  increasing to 100 a year  from  the  third\r\n\r\nyear.  Arrangements with three other international\r\n\r\ncompanies  for  similar joint  industry/Government\r\n\r\ntraining centres are also expected to be concluded\r\n\r\nwithin the next three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hon, may I interrupt you at this\r\n\r\nstage?

These  centres, will  be  located\r\n\r\neither  within  the premises, of other  vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes  or adjacent to the plants  themselves.\r\n\r\nThe  total  annual intake of these  three  centres\r\n\r\nwill  initially be 268 trainees. Under the-scheme,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will contribute 50  per  cent  of\r\n\r\ntraining costs provided the organisation assisted,\r\n\r\ntrains twice-its requirements and releases 50  per\r\n\r\ncent, of the trainees to Government for upgrading\r\n\r\nskills. In this way, we hope to produce sufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers   of   well-trained   persons.   As    for\r\n\r\nimmigration,   our   procedures   are   undergoing\r\n\r\nstreamlining  to  ensure  that  persons  who   can\r\n\r\ncontribute to the economy are not turned, away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards science and technology,, the aim is to\r\n\r\npromote practical research and development both at\r\n\r\nthe  universities-and by international and  multi-national  companies. The Universities of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Nanyang  as well as the Polytechnic-and  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  Technical  College will, under  our  strategy\r\n\r\nhave  a  major  part  to  play  in  research   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment. We will further develop the Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute of Standards and Industrial Research. We\r\n\r\nare now considering the setting up of a Centre for\r\n\r\nApplied  Research  under  the  auspices   of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Science and Technology  whereby  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  our  scholars from the  institutions  of\r\n\r\nhigher learning and private industry can be  drawn\r\n\r\nupon   to, provide  research   and   consultancy\r\n\r\nservices,   both  within  and  outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThrough  selective use of taxation, we hope,  too,\r\n\r\nto  encourage international companies  to  conduct\r\n\r\ntheir research and development here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to infrastructure, much has already been\r\n\r\naccomplished  in  the  last few  years.  Under  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment plan, further improvement and expansion\r\n\r\nof  infrastructure  for efficient  distribution  of\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services from Singapore is  vital.  The\r\n\r\ntransport and communications sector in our  economy\r\n\r\nwill have to be strengthened. We have already taken\r\n\r\nsteps  in  this direction. Capital expenditure  for\r\n\r\nport  development will amount to  $153  million  in\r\n\r\n1972  and  this  will be spent  on  development  of\r\n\r\ncontainerizations  at the East Lagoon,  warehousing\r\n\r\nat  Pasir Panjang and the Ocean Terminal at Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  With regard to air communications,  Mercury\r\n\r\nSingapore Airlines will be taking over, on payment,\r\n\r\nsubstantial  assets and facilities  from  Malaysia-Singapore Airlines and will continue to expand  and\r\n\r\nmaintain  their services. We are also looking  into\r\n\r\nimprovements  and developments of the airports  and\r\n\r\nrelated  services.  As  regards  transportation  on\r\n\r\nland, a feasibility study on a Mass Rapid Transport\r\n\r\nSystem  will be undertaken shortly with the  United\r\n\r\nNations   Development  Programme  and  World   Bank\r\n\r\nassistance. It is hoped that the study will provide\r\n\r\nthe guidelines in solving the increasing congestion\r\n\r\non our roads. In the\r\n\r\nelectronics  and  telecommunications  sector,   an\r\n\r\nautonomous  statutory corporation will  be  set  up\r\n\r\nthis  year  to  take  over  the  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department, A 10-year  programme\r\n\r\nhas   been   formulated  to  meet  the   Republic's\r\n\r\ntelecommunications requirements,  particularly  for\r\n\r\ntelex  machines  and  telex  services.  Further   -\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  telephone  services  is  also\r\n\r\nenvisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the development plan, emphasis will be\r\n\r\nplaced  on  developing tourist infrastructure  with\r\n\r\nthe  aim of developing Singapore into an \"entrepot\"\r\n\r\ncentre for tourism, and as a centre for regional  -\r\n\r\nand  international conventions. The development  of\r\n\r\nSentosa  will be the major undertaking  under  this\r\n\r\nheading.  Over  the coming 10 years, 31  Government\r\n\r\nprojects and eight projects by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  private sector are planned for the  island.  A\r\n\r\ncorporation  to be known as the Sentosa Development\r\n\r\nCorporation   will   be  established   shortly   to\r\n\r\nundertake  the  entire  development  and  to   turn\r\n\r\nSentosa  into  a resort of quality  in  a  tropical\r\n\r\nsetting.  As for the promotion of conventions,  the\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion  Board  has  set  up  a  special\r\n\r\nconventions unit specifically for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan to develop as a centre for brain\r\n\r\nservices   will   require   the   examination   and\r\n\r\nmodification  of present taxation laws.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the  overall development of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  and  monetary  centre.  A  committee  of\r\n\r\ntaxation experts has already been convened to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  possibility  of using  tax  measures  to\r\n\r\nattract cram service industries and industries with\r\n\r\nvery  high-level  technology  and  to  promote  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of a regional money market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present promotion programme of the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  is geared to  attracting  high-level   technology   industries.   This   will   be\r\n\r\nindemnified.  Besides this,  we  are  promoting  a!\r\n\r\ntypes  of  brain services in Singapore -engineering\r\n\r\nand  consultancy, marketing, physical planning  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  international  sales  and  servicing,\r\n\r\neducation,  medicine  and especially,  banking  and\r\n\r\nfinancing  services. Under the programme, Singapore\r\n\r\nwilt  develop  into  an international  banking  and\r\n\r\nfinancial   centre.  Hence,  measures   are   being\r\n\r\nintroduced to stimulate our banking sector and  the\r\n\r\ncapital  and  money markets. To bring international\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  our financial  centre,  we  have\r\n\r\napproved  a number of licence for foreign banks  to\r\n\r\noperate  in Singapore and will be liberalising  our\r\n\r\nexchange controls further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elements comprise our development plan for\r\n\r\nthe  l970s. In broad terms the goal is to transform\r\n\r\nSingapore   within  ten  years,  at   an   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment growth rate of 15 per cent  per  annum,\r\n\r\ninto a regional centre for brain services and brain\r\n\r\nservice  industries. Success will depend  upon  the\r\n\r\nquality of our people, their capacity to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprove themselves through education, training and\r\n\r\nexperience.

It is unnecessary therefore\r\n\r\nfor  me  to do more than make general observations\r\n\r\non   those  areas  of  expenditure  which  involve\r\n\r\nchanges  in  policy and comment  on  broad  policy\r\n\r\nmeasures  for greater efficiency and effectiveness\r\n\r\nin government administration.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing needs of the economy in the 1970s\r\n\r\nwill  require  the Government to reappraise,  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time,  the policies and  priorities  for\r\n\r\nallocation of funds as well as manpower  resources\r\n\r\nto  the various sectors. Further, there is a  need\r\n\r\nalso   to   review  our  administrative  machinery\r\n\r\nincluding   the   present  system  of   Government\r\n\r\nbudgeting  and financial control. The emphasis  in\r\n\r\nthe  present  system  has  hitherto  been  on  the\r\n\r\nbalancing of the budget and the diversion of  more\r\n\r\nof our resources towards economic development and,\r\n\r\nlatterly,  also towards defence. This  system  has\r\n\r\nserved  us  well in the 1960s during  the  initial\r\n\r\nphases  of our economic development. In the l970s,\r\n\r\nhowever,  with rising labour costs in a  situation\r\n\r\nof full employment, the budget should be used also\r\n\r\nto effect mechanisation and introduce other labour-saving  methods,  and generally to  modernise  and\r\n\r\nimprove Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadministration.  Set  up  originally  to   provide\r\n\r\nminimal  services  at  least  cost,  many  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  are  not equipped  for  developmental\r\n\r\nactivities or for active interventionist  policies\r\n\r\nand  are  unable  to cope with the increasing  new\r\n\r\ndemands  for  their services. During  the  current\r\n\r\nfinancial    year,   therefore,   a   number    of\r\n\r\norganisational  and structural changes  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced in several Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the following statutory authorities\r\n\r\nhave been or are in the process of being set up by\r\n\r\nlegislation -the National Sports Promotion  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  National  Stadium Corporation,  the  National\r\n\r\nStatistical  Commission, the Post  Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank  Board,  the Telecommunication  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Commercial  and   Industrial\r\n\r\nSecurity Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various measures have also been introduced for\r\n\r\nthe   general   improvement  of  the   terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service in the  Civil  Service.  A\r\n\r\nsystematic reappraisal has been made of the  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions  of  service of various  services,\r\n\r\nnotably  the  Technical  Services,  the  Education\r\n\r\nService and the Police Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a general reorganisation of\r\n\r\nthe Administrative Service under which, in future,\r\n\r\nall  recruits will be appointed as Cadet  Trainees\r\n\r\nfor  a period of two years during which time  they\r\n\r\nwill be given specific postings covering different\r\n\r\nspheres    of   Government   administration    and\r\n\r\noperations. A scheme for the training  of  Medical\r\n\r\nOfficers  in the various medical specialities  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  introduced.  Provisions  for  overseas\r\n\r\nscholarships, training and study awards have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  substantially increased in the new financial\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are designed to bring about\r\n\r\nnot  only  an improvement in the quality of  Civil\r\n\r\nService  personnel, but also to ensure a permanent\r\n\r\nService  with  a  lower  turnover  of  experienced\r\n\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in an expanding economy and with a\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector,  particularly,  growing  in\r\n\r\nsize and complexity, managerial talent is in short\r\n\r\nsupply. Handsome inducements are often offered  to\r\n\r\nattract the best. Consequently, what appear to  be\r\n\r\nfresher and greener pastures often tempt some  men\r\n\r\nof  experience and promise from the Civil  Service\r\n\r\nto  the private sector. Whilst some mobility  must\r\n\r\nbe   expected,  the  public  service  is   already\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  an acute shortage of  experienced\r\n\r\nadministrators  and professional cadres,  and  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing loss of trained men must be checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that one difficulty in\r\n\r\nretaining them is due to the widening gap  in  pay\r\n\r\nbetween the private and public sector for  men  of\r\n\r\ncomparable  grades. Our public service  is  widely\r\n\r\nrecognised, and rightly so, as second to  none  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world. If our economic growth has\r\n\r\nbeen sustained in recent years at an unprecedented\r\n\r\nhigh  level,  if our economy today is buoyant  and\r\n\r\nfull  employment  is a reality, a  major  part  of\r\n\r\nthese  achievements  can  be  attributed  to   our\r\n\r\nefficient public service. If we do not wish to see\r\n\r\na  collapse  of  this service, an  improvement  in\r\n\r\nterms  and conditions of employment must be  made.\r\n\r\nAt  the very least, therefore, we must do what  we\r\n\r\ncan  to prevent the gap in pay from widening.  The\r\n\r\npayment  of  a  non-pensionable  annual  allowance\r\n\r\nwhich the Prime Minister has already announced two\r\n\r\ndays ago is the first step towards this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this allowance, it is intended\r\n\r\nthat   the   process   of   rationalisation    and\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the salary scales  of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  will  continue. Some of the disparity  in\r\n\r\nwages  between daily-rated skilled workers in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector and in Government has  been  under\r\n\r\nexamination for some time by a Review Committee on\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated Employment. We shall effect  necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments  in wages, taking into account  the  -\r\n\r\nannual allowances - already -announced. The Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  will, moreover,  continue  to\r\n\r\nconduct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregular and frequent promotion exercises in  order\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the brightest and most  promising\r\n\r\nofficers will receive accelerated promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the day-to-day operations of Government.\r\n\r\nThe Government intends to gradually introduce more\r\n\r\nmodern  and  efficient  systems  and  methods   of\r\n\r\noperation.  Greater emphasis  will  be  placed  on\r\n\r\nmechanisation.  Budgetary support has  been  given\r\n\r\nfor the increased use of office machines and other\r\n\r\nmechanical  aids  in  the  day-to-day  operations.\r\n\r\nIncreases  in  personnel have  been  kept  to  the\r\n\r\nminimum. Consideration has also been given to  the\r\n\r\ncomputerisation   of  operations   of   Government\r\n\r\nDepartments. A Management Services Unit  has  been\r\n\r\nformed  in  the Treasury which will systematically\r\n\r\nstudy  Government Ministries and  Departments  and\r\n\r\nwill  suggest  improvements  in  organisation  and\r\n\r\nmethods. It will do this in co-ordination with the\r\n\r\nElectronic Data Processing Unit in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance    which   has   been   reorganised    and\r\n\r\nreconstituted as the Computer Services  Department\r\n\r\nto   cope   with   the  increasing   demands   for\r\n\r\ncomputerisation   from   all   Ministries.

In comparison with  the  \r\n\r\nestimated  revised expenditure  for  1971-72,  the\r\n\r\nprovision is only 6.1 per cent higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total provision, 38.9 per cent is for\r\n\r\nDefence  and Internal Security, 26.6 per cent  for\r\n\r\nSocial  Services,  15.1  per  cent  for  Statutory\r\n\r\nExpenditure   and  7.8  per  cent   for   Economic\r\n\r\nServices.

The total allocation for\r\n\r\nEconomic  Services does not show  any  significant\r\n\r\nchange.  The  somewhat  lower  figure  of  $113.14\r\n\r\nmillion as compared to $131.42 million for 1971-72\r\n\r\nfor Economic Services is due to the deletion of\r\n\r\nthe   provision   of   $19.4   million   for   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department which is to become a\r\n\r\nstatutory  authority early in  the  new  financial\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main Heads of Expenditure which have been\r\n\r\nallotted  sizable increases in funds are:  Defence\r\n\r\n($72.8 million), Education ($18.7 million), Health\r\n\r\n($16.2  million), Home Affairs ($7.1 million)  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development ($3.3  million).

An\r\n\r\namount of $10.26 million is provided to finance the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Sentosa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In transport and communications, a major\r\n\r\ndevelopment  project  is  the  expansion   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Airport. Since its inception in 1955, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airport  has seen  tremendous  increases\r\n\r\nboth in number of passengers and volume of freight.\r\n\r\nTo  cater  for  the  rapidly increasing  number  of\r\n\r\npassengers and volume of freight the Airport has to\r\n\r\nhandle, a development plan has been formulated. The\r\n\r\nimmediate   phase   involves  the   extension   and\r\n\r\nrenovation  of  the  existing  passenger   terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding.  It  has  now  been  completed.  In   the\r\n\r\nintermediate  phase,  a new passenger  terminal,  a\r\n\r\nfreight terminal, a Boeing hangar, the extension of\r\n\r\nthe   runway,   new  parking  aprons  and   various\r\n\r\nnavigational  and  landing aids will  be  provided.\r\n\r\nThis phase is scheduled to be completed by 1976. It\r\n\r\nwill  require  a  sum  of $105  million.  An  Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank Loan of $60 million  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing volume of vehicular traffic is a\r\n\r\nnever-ending  problem, not -only of  traffic  flow,\r\n\r\nbut   also   of   availability  of  parking   space\r\n\r\nparticularly   in   the  city.  This   necessitates\r\n\r\nimprovements to existing roads and construction  of\r\n\r\nnew  roads  and  car  parks.  Thus,  a  substantial\r\n\r\nprovision  is  made for the vote on  Transport  and\r\n\r\nCommunications for 1972-73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land development constitutes a sizable part of\r\n\r\ndirect expenditure by Government Ministries in the\r\n\r\neconomic-sector. With limited land  resources,  it\r\n\r\nis  imperative that we should put them  to  utmost\r\n\r\nuse. Part of the provision for land development is\r\n\r\nfor the acquisition of land required in connection\r\n\r\nwith  various  public  development  projects.  Our\r\n\r\nmajor reclamation scheme, the East Coast Foreshore\r\n\r\nReclamation Scheme, is now in its third  phase  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We seek to build what  we  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen endowed with by Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans to statutory boards falling under the\r\n\r\neconomic sector amount to $221.10 million for 1972-73. These comprise mainly loans to the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation,  the  Public  Utilities  Board,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board and to  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial enterprises wholly or partly  owned  by\r\n\r\nthe Government. The provision in respect of this\r\n\r\n-for  1971-72  was  $248.55  million.  Loans   for\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  commercial enterprises,  however,\r\n\r\nshow  a reduction amounting to $96.10 million  for\r\n\r\n1972-73 as compared to $198.55 million for 1971-72.  This is attributable to the fact that as more\r\n\r\nof these enterprises become well established, they\r\n\r\nare  better able to draw upon their own  resources\r\n\r\nand   require  less  external  finance  for  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total sum of $263.33 million is provided for\r\n\r\nthe social sector as compared with $161.74 million\r\n\r\nprovided for 1971-72. Of this provision of $263.33\r\n\r\nmillion for 1972-73, $77.33 million is for  direct\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on development projects  and  $186.00\r\n\r\nmillion is for loans to statutory boards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the social sector, including $180.00 million\r\n\r\nfor the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of $77.33 million for direct\r\n\r\nexpenditure by Government Ministries is as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                              $ million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation                        23.95\r\n\r\nHealth                           12.71\r\n\r\nSewerage                         20.05\r\n\r\nCommunity & Welfare Services     20.62\r\n\r\n                              --------\r\n\r\n                              $  77.33\r\n\r\n                              ========\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the provision for Education has dropped\r\n\r\nslightly from $27.14 million for 1971-72 to $23.95\r\n\r\nmillion  for  1972-73, emphasis  continues  to  be\r\n\r\nplaced  on  expanding the level of  technical  and\r\n\r\nvocational   education  in  order  to   meet   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  demand  for  skilled,  technical   and\r\n\r\nprofessional  manpower. The past  few  years  have\r\n\r\nseen  the  restructuring  of  secondary  education\r\n\r\ntowards  technical and vocational education.  This\r\n\r\nemphasis  will  be  extended to education  at  the\r\n\r\ntertiary  level.  Thus  a great  portion  of  this\r\n\r\nyear's  provision is for development  of  the  new\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore campus at Kent  Ridge  in\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang, development of the new campus  for\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic,  and expansion  at  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and the Ngee Ann Technical College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Health projects has increased\r\n\r\nby  more than two-fold from $5.57 million in 1971-72  to  $12.71 million for 1972-73. The relatively\r\n\r\nlow  level  of expenditure for Health  development\r\n\r\nprojects  in the past few years has reflected  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  industrialisation and  defence.  The\r\n\r\n1972-73    provision   will   cater    for    more\r\n\r\nsophisticated health services as well as  improved\r\n\r\nenvironmental health services. The Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided    to   provide   highly-skilled   medical\r\n\r\nspecialists with the necessary facilities to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a medical specialities  centre  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world. The first phase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this  programme  is the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\ninterim  development  of four  medical  specialised\r\n\r\nunits,  Nephrology,  Neurosurgery,  Cardio-Thoracic\r\n\r\nSurgery,  and  Plastic and Reconstructive  Surgery.\r\n\r\nWork on them will be completed in two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds are also provided under Public Health for a\r\n\r\npilot project for mechanisation of street cleansing\r\n\r\noperations and for additional vehicles required  to\r\n\r\nprovide  efficient  refuse collection  services.  A\r\n\r\nconsiderable sum is also being provided to  develop\r\n\r\nhawker   -centres  and  markets   to   resite   the\r\n\r\nunhygienic stalls and markets now proliferating  in\r\n\r\nvarious places in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of sewerage facilities in 1972-73\r\n\r\naccounts for $20.05 million. Modern sanitation  and\r\n\r\nbetter-sewerage facilities are necessary for better\r\n\r\nenvironmental   health  to  check   pollution   and\r\n\r\nincrease  our water resources. The system  will  be\r\n\r\nextended throughout Singapore as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has, under the Garden `City Campaign\r\n\r\nfor the past two years, developed a great number of\r\n\r\nopen  spaces into beautiful parks and spots.  Trees\r\n\r\nand  shrubs  have  been  planted  .along  the  main\r\n\r\nthoroughfares. Government is continuing its efforts\r\n\r\nin  its  Garden City Campaign for which  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$6.30  million  is  earmarked  for  1972-73.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  the  park developments  at  Mount  Faber,\r\n\r\nCentral Park and East Coast Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for urban and rural-services has\r\n\r\nincreased  to $3.25 million this year, as  compared\r\n\r\nwith  $2.48  million for 1971-72.  More  funds  are\r\n\r\nrequired in 1972-73 so as to provide kampong roads,\r\n\r\nstreet  lighting, drainage and extension of  public\r\n\r\nutilities supply in the rural areas. An interesting\r\n\r\nproject  of  immense  educational  value   is   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  the proposed  Science  Centre  at\r\n\r\nJurong. This Centre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  opened  throughout the  year  and  should\r\n\r\nstimulate  and educate our students in the  science\r\n\r\nand technical streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater portion of the loans to the statutory\r\n\r\nboards in the social sector goes to the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. The Board has embarked  on  its\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Building Programme with  the  target  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  100,000 units of flats  during  the  plan\r\n\r\nperiod.  For  1972-73, a total  of  20,000  housing\r\n\r\nunits  is  expected to be built.  To  achieve  this\r\n\r\ntarget,  an  amount of $180 million  has  been  set\r\n\r\naside as a loan to the Board in 1972-73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for defence and public\r\n\r\nadministration amounts to $145.21 million, of which\r\n\r\n$11.23  million  is  for public administration.  We\r\n\r\nmust defend what we have built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main share of the provision for public\r\n\r\nadministration  goes  to  the  development  of  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts New Building at Havelock  Road,\r\n\r\nand improvements to other Government buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Estimates of Revenue. Without\r\n\r\nadditional  taxation, or changes in present  rates,\r\n\r\nthe   estimated  revenue  for  the  financial  year\r\n\r\n1972-73  is  $1,449.1 million. This  represents  an\r\n\r\noverall increase of $142.1 million or 10.9 per cent\r\n\r\nover the estimated revenue of $1,307.2 million  for\r\n\r\n1971-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue yield from direct taxes is\r\n\r\n$537.7  million  which  is an  increase  of  $106.7\r\n\r\nmillion or 22.5 per cent over the estimated revenue\r\n\r\nfor  197 1-72. The main items in this category  are\r\n\r\nincome  tax and property tax. The yield from income\r\n\r\ntax  is expected to increase by about $70.0 million\r\n\r\nand  from  property  tax  by  $31.7  million.  This\r\n\r\nrepresents  an increase of about 25 per  cent  over\r\n\r\nthe  estimated revenue for 1971-72, and is  largely\r\n\r\nthe  result of the satisfactory growth rate of  the\r\n\r\neconomy by about 14 per cent in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue earnings from indirect taxes and other\r\n\r\ntaxes  on  outlay  are  expected  to  bring  in  an\r\n\r\nadditional  yield of $26.0 million. The main  items\r\n\r\nincluded under this category are customs and excise\r\n\r\nduties    and   revenues   from   motor   vehicles'\r\n\r\nregistration  and  licensing  fees.  Revenue   from\r\n\r\ncustoms  duties is expected to yield an  additional\r\n\r\namount  of  $18 million or an increase of  6.4  per\r\n\r\ncent  over  the estimated figure for  1971-72.  The\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  earnings from this group  of  items  is\r\n\r\ndependent  on the overall growth in consumption  of\r\n\r\npetroleum,  liquor  and  cigarettes,  and  reflects\r\n\r\nlargely  normal  growth  rates.  Protective  import\r\n\r\nduties which accounted for part of the increases in\r\n\r\nprevious years have declined in importance  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  revision of duties and the removal of  tariffs\r\n\r\non many items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main sources of revenue include sales\r\n\r\nof  goods  and  services by Government Departments,\r\n\r\nsales  of  land  and  land  premium,  income   from\r\n\r\nproperty  and  from investments, and earnings  from\r\n\r\ncurrency  surplus. This group of items is  expected\r\n\r\nto  bring  in some incises in revenue  in  the  new\r\n\r\nfinancial  year. The changes in yields  from  these\r\n\r\nintern, however, vary significantly from  item  to\r\n\r\nitem   and   are  dependent  on  actual  plans   of\r\n\r\noperations  rather than on normal growth  patterns.\r\n\r\nThe  main  chances affecting the yield from  \"Other\r\n\r\nSources\"  are  due to variations in  the  group  of\r\n\r\nitems  covered.  The  main  items  that  have  been\r\n\r\nexcluded  from  this  category  are  receipts  from\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Services and  Japanese  Special\r\n\r\nAid,  both  of which accounted for the  substantial\r\n\r\namount  of  $54 million in revenue last  year.  The\r\n\r\ndecline  in  revenue due to this  has  been  partly\r\n\r\ncompensated by an increase in revenue from interest\r\n\r\non  investments  and  currency surplus  which  will\r\n\r\njointly yield an additional revenue of about  $33.1\r\n\r\nmillion in 1972-73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to consider the question of what\r\n\r\nadditional taxation should be imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, our tax policy has been very simply\r\n\r\nthe  stimulation of rapid economic growth to lay  a\r\n\r\nwider   tax  base  which  would  provide  increased\r\n\r\nrevenue  sufficiently to meet new requirements  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  expenditures.  This  has  been   almost\r\n\r\ncompletely successful. Since independence, we  have\r\n\r\nhad  need, in our direct taxation, only in 1966  to\r\n\r\nincrease the maximum rate of personal tax  from  50\r\n\r\nper cent to 55 per cent for incomes above $100,000.\r\n\r\nIn  indirect taxation, only four minor  taxes  were\r\n\r\nintroduced  and three existing ones  were  revised,\r\n\r\nthese  being  duties on tobacco,  beer,  stout  and\r\n\r\nsamsu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next financial year also, I propose to\r\n\r\ncontinue  this policy. No new taxes are, therefore,\r\n\r\nbeing  introduced. There will, however, be a number\r\n\r\nof  changes which will assist Government's economic\r\n\r\nand  social  policies. They  will  be  tax  reliefs\r\n\r\nrelating to the following:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) stamp duty on certain negotiable\r\n\r\ncertificates  of  deposits  transacted   through\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) income tax allowance for earned income for\r\n\r\nlow income salary earners;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) income tax on the imputed income of owner-occupied houses, other than toe largest homes;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) income tax deduction of expenditure on\r\n\r\nmaintenance of gardens;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) estate duty on small estates;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) income tax depreciation allowance on\r\n\r\nexpenditure   by  industries  on   antipollution\r\n\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the tax reliefs are as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(1) Abolition of Stamp Duty on Negotiable Certificates of Deposits and Bills of Exchange</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention, as-part of the\r\n\r\nplan  for  assisting the development  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  a  regional financial centre,  to  promote  a\r\n\r\nshort-term  money market. This is at  present  non-existent  because  the  stamp  duty  on  Bills   of\r\n\r\nExchange and Negotiable Certificates of Deposit  is\r\n\r\ninordinately  high.

This relief is, however, limited  to\r\n\r\n20  per cent of the earned income, and subject also\r\n\r\nto  a  maximum deduction of $1,000. For  the  small\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  earning  less  than  $5,000  per   annum,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the maximum deduction is determined  only\r\n\r\nby  the  first limit of 20 per cent of  the  earned\r\n\r\nincome. I propose to remove this 20 per cent  limit\r\n\r\nso that the deduction will be of full earned income\r\n\r\nsubject  only to the maximum deduction  of  $1,000.\r\n\r\nThis  will  benefit  about  33,000  taxpayers.

Following these  increases  in\r\n\r\nrentals,  the revaluation of the annual  values  of\r\n\r\nproperties has been undertaken by the Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,  but  has  been  the  cause   of   much\r\n\r\ncomplaint  by  owner-occupiers, some of  whom  have\r\n\r\nclaimed  that  it may soon become too expensive  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  their  own  houses!

Such  exemption  will\r\n\r\ngive  avoidance  from payment of additional  income\r\n\r\ntax  to  the large majority of owners who  live  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own houses.

This  remission  is   confined   to\r\n\r\nindividuals;    companies   can    already    treat\r\n\r\nexpenditure  incurred  on gardens  like  any  other\r\n\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government spends considerable sums of money\r\n\r\nin  planting trees, flowers and bushes along  roads\r\n\r\nand  in public places. The public has responded  to\r\n\r\nthe  campaign and Government's example by improving\r\n\r\ntheir  gardens  through planting  flowers,  bushes,\r\n\r\nhedges  and  creepers. As the garden city  campaign\r\n\r\nmust  be  further  encouraged I  propose,  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  giving a remission of income  tax,  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the maximum from $100 to $300  per  annum\r\n\r\nfor   the   expenditure  on  gardens.  Whilst   the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  eligibility  for  remission   would\r\n\r\nremain  the same, I am prepared to consider  easing\r\n\r\nthe procedure for making such claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i> (5) Remission  from  Estate  Duty  on  Estates between $10,000 and $25,000</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first $10,000, there is now no duty on\r\n\r\nthe estate of a deceased person.

I  propose  to  restore  the  position   by\r\n\r\nremitting  the  estate  duty  between  $10,000  and\r\n\r\n$25,000.  This  will ensure that poor beneficiaries\r\n\r\ninheriting small estates do not suffer  by  having\r\n\r\nto  sell  or  mortgage their modest  dwellings  and\r\n\r\npossessions on the death of the bread-winner.

Under the existing  law,  a  parent\r\n\r\nunder  25 years of age cannot adopt his or her  own\r\n\r\nchild,  particularly where the infant concerned  is\r\n\r\nan  illegitimate issue, and the parent subsequently\r\n\r\nmarries and desires to adopt the child jointly with\r\n\r\nhis  or  her  spouse.  The  same  restriction  also\r\n\r\napplies to the adoption of an orphan by an uncle or\r\n\r\nan  aunt  who  is less than 25 years  of  age.  The\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment to remove the above restriction\r\n\r\nwill not only apply to cases involving illegitimate\r\n\r\nchildren  but  will also apply to  cases  involving\r\n\r\nlegitimate  children, for example,  a  young  widow\r\n\r\nunder the age of 25 years remarries and desires her\r\n\r\nchild by the deceased husband to be recognised  not\r\n\r\nonly  as  her  own but also as that of her  present\r\n\r\nspouse,  through the process of legal adoption.

The  existing  provision  does   not\r\n\r\nelaborate sufficiently the circumstances where  the\r\n\r\nCourt  may dispense with the consent of the natural\r\n\r\nparents. The present provision has sometimes  given\r\n\r\nrise to difficulties in interpretation, and because\r\n\r\nof  the generality of this proviso, the Courts have\r\n\r\non  occasions been reluctant to dispense  with  the\r\n\r\nconsent even when the circumstances warranted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there is at present no provision for\r\n\r\ndispensation   of  consent  when   a   parent   has\r\n\r\npersistently ill-treated the infant, or has  failed\r\n\r\nto  exercise normal parental duties, or has  placed\r\n\r\nthe  infant  in  the  care of  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  and has shown little or no interest  in\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of the infant except perhaps  a  rare\r\n\r\nvisit once in a long while. Dispensation of consent\r\n\r\nunder such circumstances is considered justifiable - \r\n\r\nand  in  the  interest of such children,  who-would\r\n\r\notherwise be deprived of a chance to be adopted  by\r\n\r\nsuitable  families who can offer them  good  homes.\r\n\r\nMany  children presently under the care  of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  homes  and  other  voluntary  institutions\r\n\r\ncould have been adopted and brought up in a happier\r\n\r\nand more secure home atmosphere, if not for the non-availability  or  wilful  withholding  of  parental\r\n\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizenship status of the adopted infant is\r\n\r\nnot  spelt  out in the Act.

Amendment to section\r\n\r\n6  of  the  principal  Act  seeks  to  clarify  the\r\n\r\nposition   that  adoption  does  not   affect   the\r\n\r\nnationality  or citizenship of the adopted  infant.\r\n\r\nThis amendment will bring the Act in line with  the\r\n\r\nlocal  citizenship law under which even  a  natural\r\n\r\nchild  of a Singapore citizen parent, born  outside\r\n\r\nthe  Republic, does  not automatically  assume-the\r\n\r\ncitizenship of his parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present practice of issuing an extract from\r\n\r\nthe  Register of Adopted Children for  all  adopted\r\n\r\ninfants  is  unsatisfactory  and  has  caused  much\r\n\r\nembarrassment and unhappiness to both the  adoptive\r\n\r\nparents  and  the adopted children.  Many  adoptive\r\n\r\nparents have found it most difficult to explain  to\r\n\r\nthe  adopted  child why his \"birth certificate\"  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  his  other siblings.  The  adopted\r\n\r\nchild himself has also suffered countless ridicules\r\n\r\nfrom  his  fellow school-mates on  account  of  his\r\n\r\nbeing  known as an adopted child, having no natural\r\n\r\nparents.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, if you will  recollect,\r\n\r\nthis has been the -common subject of complaints  of\r\n\r\nmany  adopted parents, made in writing to both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the local press. Since section 6  of\r\n\r\nthe  Adoption  of  Children Act  has  accorded  the\r\n\r\nstatus of a natural child to the adopted child,  it\r\n\r\nseems,  therefore,  a logical  step  to  amend  the\r\n\r\npresent legislation to provide for registration  of\r\n\r\nadoption  and  the  issue  of  an  ordinary   birth\r\n\r\ncertificate to the adopted child, thus enabling his\r\n\r\ncomplete integration into the adoptive family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause S of the Bill repeals section 11 of the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Act  and re-enacts a new  section  which\r\n\r\ndeals  fully with the whole process of registration\r\n\r\nof legal adoption to enable all adopted children to\r\n\r\nhave  a  birth certificate which is similar in  all\r\n\r\nrespects  to  that  of a child  who  has  not  been\r\n\r\nadopted. It also ensures that all adoption  records\r\n\r\nmaintained  by the Registrar of Births  and  Deaths\r\n\r\nare treated as confidential matters, and access  to\r\n\r\nthem  is only possible under a court order.  Unless\r\n\r\nreference is made to these records, it will not  be\r\n\r\npossible  to  know  from  the  new  form  of  birth\r\n\r\ncertificate whether or not its holder is an adopted\r\n\r\nchild.    The    amendment   also   provides    for\r\n\r\nretrospective issue of such certificates to adopted\r\n\r\nchildren  upon  application made  by  the  adoptive\r\n\r\nparents when the legislation becomes operative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new section 11 relating to the issue of a new\r\n\r\nbirth certificate is modelled on similar\r\n\r\nlegislation which was first introduced in New\r\n\r\nZealand in 1915.

These amendments prohibit a\r\n\r\nperson  from describing his business or activities\r\n\r\nas  a  tourist or travel agency, without the prior\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Tourist  Promotion  Board.  The\r\n\r\namendments also restrict a person from  using  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"tourist\" or \"travel\" except with the prior\r\n\r\npermission of the Board. The purpose of this is to\r\n\r\nprevent  those  persons  operating  social  escort\r\n\r\nagencies  from  describing  their  activities   as\r\n\r\ntourist  services.  Further, to  keep  the  travel\r\n\r\nbusiness  in Singapore in a healthy state,  travel\r\n\r\nagencies  will  in  future be licensed.

With\r\n\r\nthe  passing of time, it has been found  necessary\r\n\r\nto  introduce  various amendments to  the  Act  to\r\n\r\nprevent tax evasion and unauthorised collection of\r\n\r\ncess,  as  well as to enable the process  of  cess\r\n\r\ncollection to be undertaken more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, it is proposed to incorporate\r\n\r\nwithin a single Bill all legislation pertaining to\r\n\r\nthe  imposition and collection of cess which  will\r\n\r\nalso repeal the existing provisions on cess in the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change in the rate of cess\r\n\r\nlevied.

This\r\n\r\nlegislation, which was passed nine years ago, gave\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  locally-trained  accountants  and\r\n\r\naccorded  them professional standing in line  with\r\n\r\nthe other professions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8 of the Accountants Act provides that\r\n\r\nthe  Society of Accountants may, with the approval\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance, make rules for  the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Act. This is cumbersome  and\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  as, in effect, it means  that  all\r\n\r\nsuch  rules  have to be considered and deliberated\r\n\r\non by the general body of the Society at a general\r\n\r\nmeeting. In most other professional Acts  as,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the Legal Profession Act, the  authority\r\n\r\nfor  the making of such rules lies with the  Board\r\n\r\nof  Legal  Education. It is therefore proposed  to\r\n\r\namend section 8 of the Act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  provide for the Council of the Society  to  be\r\n\r\nvested  with  this function.

Both    the   Universities    award\r\n\r\nAccountancy  degrees which are recognised  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Society of Accountants. It is therefore\r\n\r\nlogical  that  Nanyang University should  also  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  on  the Council. Accordingly,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed to amend section 9 of the Act to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  representation by the Nanyang  University  on\r\n\r\nthe   Council   of   the  Singapore   Society   of\r\n\r\nAccountants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 of the Act, which gave specific\r\n\r\npowers  to  the  first  Council  of  he  Singapore\r\n\r\nSociety   of   Accountants  hen  the  Act   became\r\n\r\noperational   in1963,   is   now   obsolete    and\r\n\r\nopportunity   therefore  taken  to   repeal   this\r\n\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Tang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause 1 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year 1971\", appearing\r\n\r\nin page 1, line 4, is to be altered to \"1972\".\r\n\r\nThis will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third\r\n\r\ntime and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Thursday,\r\n\r\n16th March, 1972.\"- [Mr E.
