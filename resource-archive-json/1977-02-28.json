For  the  months when the  meters  are  not  read,\r\n\r\nconsumptions are estimated and these estimates  are  based\r\n\r\non  the  average of previous actual consumptions. For  the\r\n\r\ngreat  majority of consumers whose consumptions are fairly\r\n\r\nstable and fluctuate only marginally, these estimates  are\r\n\r\naccurate.  However,  because  the  utility  meters  record\r\n\r\nconsumptions progressively, any deviation is automatically\r\n\r\nadjusted when the meters are next read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had previously spoken of the PUB's campaign to\r\n\r\nencourage  consumers  to read their own  meters.

There  was also less  inflation  in  most\r\n\r\ncountries, with the OECD as a whole registering  8%, down\r\n\r\nfrom  11.2% in 1975. Singapore benefited from the  world\r\n\r\neconomic  revival, with real growth at  7.0%.  At  current\r\n\r\nprices,  growth was 9.6%. The GDP deflator  was  a  modest\r\n\r\n2.4%, indicating the stable price conditions in 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More remarkable, the Consumer Price Index fell by 2% in\r\n\r\n1976.  This  was, in large measure, due to the  relatively\r\n\r\nstable  food  and  oil  prices.  But  Government's   anti-profiteering measures and consumers' efforts also played a\r\n\r\nrole  in  keeping prices down. The unemployment  rate  for\r\n\r\n1976  remained  at  a low 4.5%, the same  as  a  year  ago\r\n\r\nUnemployment,  measured by the number of  persons  seeking\r\n\r\nwork  at  the  Labour Exchange, fell from  39,500  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the year to 30,750 at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries, with the exception of\r\n\r\nshipbuilding, staged a comeback, with a real growth of 10%\r\n\r\nin 1976 in contrast to the negative 2% in 1975. Trade also\r\n\r\nincreased a welcome 21% after a decline of 7% the previous\r\n\r\nyear. Tourism remained buoyant. Tourist arrivals increased\r\n\r\nby  13%,  very near the average growth rate of the  pre-energy crisis years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although below the average growth for the past five\r\n\r\nyears, our  7%  economic growth in 1976  may  perhaps  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  not unsatisfactory. The policy of diversifying\r\n\r\nour economic activities has made us less vulnerable to the\r\n\r\nviolent fluctuations of the world economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prospects for 1977</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World economic recovery, which was strong in the first\r\n\r\nhalf  of 1976, slowed down in the second half as the major\r\n\r\nindustrialised  countries feared, by setting  too  fast  a\r\n\r\npace, to trigger off another round of inflation. As a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresult,  there was some stagnation in growth and increased\r\n\r\nunemployment.  However, the  Governments  of  the   major\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries have since considered measures to\r\n\r\nstimulate their economies again to provide more  jobs  and\r\n\r\nreduce  unemployment  in their own  countries.  For  their\r\n\r\ntrading partners, such renewed growth will have the effect\r\n\r\nof providing an increased demand in export markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of causing unacceptable increases in inflation,\r\n\r\nhowever,  remains. The recent two-tier oil price increases\r\n\r\nby  the  OPEC countries will impose further restraints  to\r\n\r\neconomic stimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, therefore, the world may grow more slowly\r\n\r\nthis year than in 1976. The OECD countries are expected to\r\n\r\nmake only 3 3/4% in real GNP growth, down 1 1/4% from\r\n\r\n1976. Inflation is forecast to increase by\r\n\r\n7 1/2%, the  same as last year. World trade is  expected  to\r\n\r\ngrow at 6%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's own performance in 1977 will naturally be\r\n\r\naffected by these external circumstances. We can, however,\r\n\r\ntry  to take advantage of differences which appear now  to\r\n\r\nexist   between  the  developed  countries  in  the   less\r\n\r\nsynchronised economic conditions of 1977. We can also,  by\r\n\r\nappropriate domestic policies, counteract some of the more\r\n\r\nnegative effects of a world economic slowdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Strategy Programme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been five years since I announced in this House\r\n\r\nour  Economic Strategy Programme for the 1 970s. This  was\r\n\r\naimed at modernising and transforming Singapore's economic\r\n\r\nstructure  so  that  it would become  a  `brain'  services\r\n\r\ncentre.  A  package  of public policies  was  designed  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  the  five  basic objectives of  the  Programme  in\r\n\r\nmanpower, science and technology, infrastructure, taxation\r\n\r\nand  promotion. The Programme was intended to be flexible.\r\n\r\nIn  the event, it had to accommodate the energy crisis and\r\n\r\nthe worldwide recession which followed it. We had to scale\r\n\r\ndown  our  expectations. It may be useful  to  review  the\r\n\r\npresent status of the Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with our manpower development programmes in\r\n\r\neducation  and industrial training. The annual  output  of\r\n\r\ngraduates  from the technical institutions, including  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Polytechnic,  Ngee  Ann   Technical   College.\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Training  Board  and  the  Joint   Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining  Centres administered by the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  has increased from 5,240 in 1972 to 8,930 in  1976.\r\n\r\nThe training of skills was concentrated on the engineering\r\n\r\ntrades,  metal  machining and fabrication as  well  as  on\r\n\r\nselected  fields of precision engineering. There  are  now\r\n\r\n5,155  apprentices  under training in  various  industries\r\n\r\ncompared  to  574  five years ago The demand  for  skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower  by  our  industries is being  largely  met.  The\r\n\r\ntechnical  bias  introduced a year ago  in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  will  further  provide the  essential  element  of\r\n\r\ncorrect  work  attitudes to complement the inculcation  of\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for development of science and technology, our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries have become  more  technological\r\n\r\nand  sophisticated. A good indicator of this technological\r\n\r\nadvancement  is  the  value-added  per  worker.  This  has\r\n\r\nincreased in real terms from $8,814 per worker in 1972  to\r\n\r\n$10,088  in  1976. Investment commitments  in  the  higher\r\n\r\nvalue-added  industries  accounted  for  84.7%  of   total\r\n\r\ninvestments  compared  to  78.2%  five  years  ago.   Such\r\n\r\nadvancement was achieved across a wide range of industries\r\n\r\nfrom   electrical  machinery  and  appliances, transport\r\n\r\nequipment, and textiles to metal fabrication and precision\r\n\r\nengineering.  Our industrial base has also been  broadened\r\n\r\nby  greater  diversification which  gives  flexibility  in\r\n\r\nmeeting ever fluctuating external demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps more visible are the results in infrastructure\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We  have now adequate  industrial  land  and\r\n\r\nbuildings  to  meet the demands of investors.  The  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown Corporation has in the past five years prepared 1,800\r\n\r\nhectares  of  industrial land and completed  252  standard\r\n\r\nfactory buildings and 207,200 square metres of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflatted  factory  space.  Communication  links  have  been\r\n\r\nexpanded  to meet the needs of our manufacturing, trading\r\n\r\nand  business  communities. They can now communicate  with\r\n\r\n175  countries through the much improved telecommunication\r\n\r\nfacilities. Automatic telex services are now available  to\r\n\r\n88  countries. Such services are well used. The number  of\r\n\r\noutgoing  telex  calls  rose  from  356,000  in  1972   to\r\n\r\n2,312,000  last year. Domestically, there are now  374,000\r\n\r\ntelephone  links, almost doubling the number in 1972.  The\r\n\r\nrapid  growth  in  the industrial and  commercial  sectors\r\n\r\nwould   also  not  have  been  possible  without  expanded\r\n\r\nutilities supplies. The Public Utilities Board has now  at\r\n\r\nits disposal an installed capacity of 1.390 MW electricity\r\n\r\ncompared  to 704 MW five years ago. We are now in  a  much\r\n\r\nbetter position to meet demand for infrastructure services\r\n\r\nat short notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our efforts to promote Singapore as a centre of\r\n\r\ninternational finance and tourism have also achieved  some\r\n\r\nsuccess.  Financial operations have expanded  greatly  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of banks established in Singapore was 72 in  1976.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  swing  towards  offshore  and  international\r\n\r\nbanking  with  the  setting up of  offshore  and  merchant\r\n\r\nbanks. The Asian Dollar Market is now serviced by 69 Asian\r\n\r\nCurrency  Units and has expanded from US$2,980 million  of\r\n\r\ndeposits  in  1972 to the present US$17,350 million.  With\r\n\r\nthe  raising  of  15 Asian Dollar Bonds, our  financial\r\n\r\ncentre  may  be  said  to  have  attained  maturity.  Such\r\n\r\ndevelopment  has  been made possible by fiscal  incentives\r\n\r\nand by rationalisation of banking procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid growth of the tourist industry is shown in\r\n\r\ntourist arrivals, which increased from 880,200 in 1972  to\r\n\r\n1,492,200 last year. We should now be adding to our 10,255\r\n\r\nhotel  rooms. Of interest also is the convention  business\r\n\r\nwhich  has  expanded  significantly. 133  conventions  and\r\n\r\nexhibitions were held last year compared to 80 in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, therefore, we have laid a sound foundation for\r\n\r\nsustained growth through the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfive basic elements of our long-term development strategy.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry's Economic Planning Model predicts  that,  on\r\n\r\nthis  strategy and barring major upheavals  in  the  world\r\n\r\neconomy, we should be able to achieve an annual growth  of\r\n\r\n6 - 8%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning from consideration of our development strategy,\r\n\r\nI  would  now like to discuss the tactics we can adopt  to\r\n\r\nfoster economic growth in 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite difficulties and by employing many of its best\r\n\r\nstaff overseas, the Economic Development Board's promotion\r\n\r\nefforts succeeded in attracting investment commitments  of\r\n\r\n$364.2  million  in  1976. However, 58%  of  this  is  for\r\n\r\nexpansion  by  industries  already  operating  here  Large\r\n\r\nunused  production capacity and high unemployment  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries no doubt affected the drop in new\r\n\r\ninvestments   from  overseas.  The  task   of   investment\r\n\r\npromotion for the coming year remains difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can only sometimes offset adverse external\r\n\r\ndevelopments,  we  must continue  to  press  on  with  our\r\n\r\npromotion efforts in the United States, Japan and  Western\r\n\r\nEurope.  On  the home front, however, we shall maintain  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  investment climate. We shall do what  we  can  to\r\n\r\nkeep  our  major production costs stable, and ensure  that\r\n\r\nindustrial   facilities  and  services  will  be   readily\r\n\r\navailable for investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall pay special attention to the relatively smaller\r\n\r\nbut  more  technology-oriented industries. More industrial\r\n\r\nfinance  will  be  given  through the  Capital  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme  beyond  the  $16  million so  far  approved.  Such\r\n\r\nfinance   will  also  be  available  through   the   Small\r\n\r\nIndustries Finance Scheme, in which 14 cases have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  approved, involving a total of $1.73  million.  This\r\n\r\nScheme  should  gather greater momentum this  year.  As  a\r\n\r\nfurther  step, the Jurong Town Corporation will  construct\r\n\r\nsmaller  factory  buildings to suit supporting  industries\r\n\r\nand services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard our economic interests, our trade,\r\n\r\ninvestment and diplomatic offices will be strengthened  in\r\n\r\nkey  centres.  Government and traders  must  work  closely\r\n\r\ntogether   if   we   are  to  counter   the   increasingly\r\n\r\nprotectionistic  attitude of some  of  our  major  trading\r\n\r\npartners,  consolidate  our  established  markets  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, Japan and Western Europe, and explore  new\r\n\r\nmarkets especially in West Asia. In the development of new\r\n\r\nmarkets, it is vital that we build up as many contacts  as\r\n\r\npossible. We shall therefore consider setting up permanent\r\n\r\nexhibition  centres in West Asian markets to  promote  our\r\n\r\nmanufactured products and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist our exporters to meet the very keen\r\n\r\ncompetition in international trade, cheaper export finance\r\n\r\nis  being  made available. The MAS rate to the  Banks  for\r\n\r\nrediscounting  export bills has been made more  attractive\r\n\r\nby pegging it at 2% below the average prime rate. Further.\r\n\r\nthe  rate  is now being adjusted frequently to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the regular fluctuations in the prime  rate.  Our\r\n\r\nexporters  should  also make more use  of  the  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided  since  June  last  year  by  the  Export  Credit\r\n\r\nInsurance  Corporation, especially  for  sales  to  lesser\r\n\r\nknown new markets and customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Conference of ASEAN Heads of Government held\r\n\r\nin  Bali  a  year  ago, some progress  has  been  made  by\r\n\r\nEconomic  Ministers  and officials  of  the  five  member-countries  on  the establishment of five ASEAN  industrial\r\n\r\nprojects  and  on  the  terms  for  according  each  other\r\n\r\npreferential  trading  arrangements.  The  ASEAN  Economic\r\n\r\nMinisters have approved an Agreement on ASEAN Preferential\r\n\r\nTrading  Arrangements and have defined  in  the  Rules  of\r\n\r\nOrigin   the   nature  of  the  products  to  which   such\r\n\r\npreferential  arrangements may be extended. The  Agreement\r\n\r\nwill  provide  the  framework  for  any  multilateral   or\r\n\r\nbilateral  agreements  for  preferences  between   member-countries. Accordingly, our bilateral agreements with  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines and Thailand respectively for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  mutual  across-the-board reduction of 10%  of  existing\r\n\r\ntariffs  on all products traded between us will be brought\r\n\r\nwithin  the  framework of the Agreement  for  Preferential\r\n\r\nTrading  Arrangements. Under the terms of  the  Agreement,\r\n\r\nhowever, any  bilateral Preferential Trading Arrangements\r\n\r\nmust  also  be  extended, if so desired,  to  other  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore made some modest beginnings in ASEAN\r\n\r\neconomic cooperation. If there were a sense of urgency  in\r\n\r\nthe  political Ieaderships of the ASEAN countries to  meet\r\n\r\nour long term problems, then I am confident there will  be\r\n\r\nthe political will and a spirit of give and take, and much\r\n\r\nmore development may be expected in the coming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Services Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By improving transportation and communications\r\n\r\nfacilities,  as  well  as finance and insurance  services,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  developed rapidly as a  regional  services\r\n\r\ncentre. We are now well organised in the offshore banking,\r\n\r\ninsurance  and oil businesses. We are equally  well-placed\r\n\r\nto   become   a  centre  for  regional  and  international\r\n\r\nwarehousing activities, especially for capital  goods  and\r\n\r\nequipment.  We shall therefore try to encourage  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years international corporations  to  establish\r\n\r\ntheir   distribution  operations  here.  As  some   fiscal\r\n\r\nincentive  may be necessary for this purpose,  the  Fiscal\r\n\r\nPolicy Implementation Committee has been asked to consider\r\n\r\nappropriate measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be further development of our\r\n\r\nFinancial  Centre,  Facilities in the forward  market  for\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange will be further expanded  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nsufficiently  large market in foreign exchange  to  enable\r\n\r\ncommerce  and industry to hedge their future receipts  and\r\n\r\npayments in foreign currencies. The Monetary Authority  is\r\n\r\nalso considering further measures to develop the secondary\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  fixed  interest securities and  Asian  Dollar\r\n\r\nNegotiable Certificates of Deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tourism, we shall encourage more convention\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore by both regional and international\r\n\r\ngroups.  We  would therefore have to expand our convention\r\n\r\nfacilities  with  more hotel rooms and  convention  halls,\r\n\r\nwith  perhaps  one  large convention centre  which  hotels\r\n\r\nmight   participate  jointly  in  developing.   Convention\r\n\r\nbusiness  can best be secured at source and our hoteliers,\r\n\r\nairlines  and travel agents must redouble their  promotion\r\n\r\nefforts  overseas  to woo more such business.  Government.\r\n\r\nthrough  the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and Sentosa\r\n\r\nDevelopment Corporation, will supplement their efforts  by\r\n\r\ndeveloping more tourist facilities and attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wages Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our past performance in manufacturing, trade and\r\n\r\nservices  has  been assisted by policies of  orderly  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  and good labour-management relations.  We  must\r\n\r\nensure  that this situation continues, The National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  should now consider the full offsetting from  the\r\n\r\nannual single wage increase award of all increases granted\r\n\r\nsince  the  last award whether from increments granted  in\r\n\r\nwage  scales or from any form of fringe benefits. In  this\r\n\r\nway,  we  can perhaps hope to keep our wages at reasonable\r\n\r\nrates  for  industries competing in an extremely difficult\r\n\r\nworld   market,   against  countries   beset   with   high\r\n\r\nunemployment and spare manufacturing capacities  Countries\r\n\r\nso  afflicted will provide stiff competition not  only  to\r\n\r\nthe  products  but  also  to the  services  we  sell.  Our\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and shiprepair industries know this only  too\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While workers must put in their best efforts, employers\r\n\r\nhave  an  equal responsibility to improve their management\r\n\r\nof  personnel  or  of  plant  and  machinery  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity.  Employers should consider the  introduction\r\n\r\nof  appropriate  incentive  schemes  to  reward  efficient\r\n\r\nworkers   for  their  productivity.  The  initiative   for\r\n\r\nformulating  such schemes is clearly their  responsibility\r\n\r\nas  they have the greater resources and experience in this\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manpower Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manpower development programmes must now emphasise\r\n\r\ntraining  in more and more specialised skills,  To  instil\r\n\r\ncorrect  work  attitudes  in our workers,  employers  must\r\n\r\nprovide  a  proper  working  environment,  Good  employers\r\n\r\nusually have hardworking dedicated workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With basic manpower needs largely met, we should next\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  quality  of  our  managerial  and  executive\r\n\r\ngrades.   The  new  managers  should  possess   not   only\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  entrepreneurial  capabilities,  but  also\r\n\r\ntechnical competence in the new industries. These managers\r\n\r\nmay  need  to learn their skills by working their  way  up\r\n\r\nthrough  as many plant operations as possible.  They  will\r\n\r\nafter all merely be repeating the experience of so many of\r\n\r\nthe  top  management  executives  in  the  biggest  multi-national corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall continue to pursue our long term economic\r\n\r\nstrategy programme for our economy's transformation to  an\r\n\r\nindustrial   centre   and   a  base   for   regional   and\r\n\r\ninternational  services. In dealing with the uncertainties\r\n\r\nand  difficulties of the next few years, we shall  need  a\r\n\r\nmore  flexible approach to developments in the  region  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  major  industrialised countries.  To  react\r\n\r\nquickly to unfavourable trends, our manufacturers, traders\r\n\r\nand  businessmen must devote more effort  to  develop  new\r\n\r\nmarkets,  Government will, on its part, do all it  can  to\r\n\r\nassist  and to safeguard and promote Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>FY 77 Budget Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to move on to the Main\r\n\r\nand Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed analysis in the Memorandum on the Main and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, together with the review of  public\r\n\r\nfinance  in the Economic Survey, should provide Honourable\r\n\r\nMembers   with  all  necessary  information.   I   propose\r\n\r\ntherefore to be brief in my remarks. But I should  perhaps\r\n\r\nfirst comment on the changes in format that have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  to the Establishment List.  These  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  necessary because the Government establishment\r\n\r\nsystem  has been improved. It has been found desirable  to\r\n\r\ndo away with the system of grading of appointments and the\r\n\r\npayment   of  acting  allowances  for  such  appointments.\r\n\r\nOfficers  will now hold appointments in their  substantive\r\n\r\ngrades.  Promotions will not depend on  vacancies  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil   service  but  be  on  the  basis  of  merit.   The\r\n\r\nEstablishment List for FY 77 will therefore no longer show\r\n\r\ngrades  of appointment under Heads of Expenditure. Instead\r\n\r\nthe  authorised  manpower of each Ministry  is  classified\r\n\r\naccording  to  Personnel groups and the  number  of  posts\r\n\r\napproved  for  each  group is shown in  the  Establishment\r\n\r\nList.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure being budgeted for FY 77 is $5,459\r\n\r\nmillion,  but  almost  half  of  this  will  be  spent  on\r\n\r\nDevelopment. This is in line with the rate of  expenditure\r\n\r\non  development that has occurred over the past few years.\r\n\r\nIn  FY  75, budgeted development expenditure  was  $2,188\r\n\r\nmillion and in FY 76, $2,610 million. In FY 77 it will  be\r\n\r\n$2,708  million.  The  object is  to  help  stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy and accelerate economic recovery. To this end  the\r\n\r\nmajor  expenditures  have been allocated  to  those  areas\r\n\r\nwhere Government spending has been most effective in pump-priming  the economy, that is, to public housing which  at\r\n\r\n$980  million represents 18% of total expenditure  and  to\r\n\r\nairport  and  road  development at  $394  million,  Direct\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure on economic services will be $1,174\r\n\r\nmillion or 43% of expenditure on development. Of this.$553\r\n\r\nmillion  will  be spent to further promote  public  sector\r\n\r\ninvestment  in industrial and commercial development.  The\r\n\r\nmoney  will  be disbursed largely as loans to  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown   Corporation  and  to  industrial   and   commercial\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large expenditure on development will be made\r\n\r\npossible  because  of stringent pruning of  the  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure estimates especially on staff and manpower  in\r\n\r\nthe civil service. This will enable a transfer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof $611 million to be made from the Main Estimates to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund.  The amount of $611  million  compares\r\n\r\nwith  $625  million in FY 76 and $500  million  in  FY  75\r\n\r\nExcluding  the  $61  1 million transfer,  total  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  under  the Main Estimates  will  be  $2,751.1\r\n\r\nmillion. This is only 11% higher than for FY 76. It is the\r\n\r\nminimum   required  to  maintain  the  present  level   of\r\n\r\nGovernment services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff increases have been provided only for new\r\n\r\nfunctions or the expansion of present activities. The  net\r\n\r\nincrease in the permanent establishment for FY 77  is  144\r\n\r\nposts  or 0.2% over the FY 76 establishment, a record  low\r\n\r\nfor  the civil service for the past few years. At the same\r\n\r\ntime, it must be recognised that the posts which have been\r\n\r\napproved  are  essential and must be filled  substantively\r\n\r\nThe organisation and staffing of the civil service plays a\r\n\r\ncrucial  role  in  the  ability of the  administration  to\r\n\r\nexpand judiciously and economically the very large sums of\r\n\r\nmoney  allocated  in the Budget. There  are  shortages  of\r\n\r\nofficers  in a number of Ministries, especially Education,\r\n\r\nHome   Affairs,   Health  and  Defence.   Recruitment   is\r\n\r\nprogressing  and  will be closer to establishment  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Other Operating Expenditure the increase\r\n\r\nof $239.4 million or 13.8% has been kept down by stringent\r\n\r\ncontrols over expenditure and the more stable price levels\r\n\r\nthat have prevailed in FY 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now consider how the large expenditures in FY 77\r\n\r\nare to be financed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue for FY 77 at existing tax\r\n\r\nrates  is $3,362 million This represents an increase  over\r\n\r\nthe  revised estimate for FY 76 of 6.3% and an improvement\r\n\r\nover the expected growth rate for FY 75 of 2.3%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncome tax is still the largest single source of revenue,\r\n\r\nwith 41% of total receipts, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$1,380 million for FY 77, up 15% over expected receipts in FY 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue of $3,362 million will be sufficient to\r\n\r\ncover the current expenditure and leave a balance of $611\r\n\r\nmillion   which   will  be  available  for   transfer   to\r\n\r\ndevelopment account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this large contribution from revenue account\r\n\r\nof  $611 million to finance development, there remains  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $1,505 million. Would it not be  possible  to\r\n\r\ncover part of this by new or increased taxes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members who have read the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nAddendum to the President's speech already know that  this\r\n\r\npossibility   would   make  no  more   than   a   marginal\r\n\r\ncontribution towards reducing the large deficit. For  this\r\n\r\nFY 77 Budget I am not introducing any new taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

However, I also  intend  to  give\r\n\r\nseveral  tax  concessions, the cost of which  will  partly\r\n\r\noffset this increased revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Increases</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take the two tax increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Measures introduced by the Government to discourage\r\n\r\nsmoking as a grave health hazard appear to be losing  much\r\n\r\nof  their  earlier effect and now need reinforcing.  I  am\r\n\r\ntherefore  increasing the duty on tobacco and  cigarettes.\r\n\r\nDuty  on leaf tobacco will rise from $35 to $36 per  kilo.\r\n\r\nImport  duty on cigarettes will rise from $43 to  $45  per\r\n\r\nkilo while excise duty will increase from $3.70 to $4  per\r\n\r\nkilo Cigars and cheroots will rise from $40.60 to $45  per\r\n\r\nkilo  and  pipe tobacco retail and pipe tobacco bulk  will\r\n\r\nrise  from $28 to $30 per kilo and $22.40 to $25 per  kilo\r\n\r\nrespectively.  Increases are also made  on  other  tobacco\r\n\r\nproducts,  namely, beedies, snuff, cut rag, ang  hoon  and\r\n\r\ntobacco which is not elsewhere specified or included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision of duty which is expected to yield an\r\n\r\nadditional  $2.3 million in revenue will come into  effect\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)With effect from today also, I am raising the import\r\n\r\nduty  on intoxicating liquors. Import duty on brandy  will\r\n\r\nrise  from $165 to $200 per decalitre (dal) while the duty\r\n\r\non whisky will rise from $165 to $190 per dal. Rum and gin\r\n\r\nwill  also  increase from $165 to $190 per  dal,  liqueurs\r\n\r\nfrom  $165 to $185 per dal and other spirit beverages from\r\n\r\n$215  to $240 per proof dal. Import duties on malt liquors\r\n\r\nand  samsu will also increase. Beer will rise from $25  to\r\n\r\n$27  per  dal, stout from $25 to $26 per dal and samsu  at\r\n\r\n60%  proof  strength  from  $125  to  $130  per  dal.  The\r\n\r\nadditional revenue yield is $6.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Concessions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be four tax concessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To encourage home ownership and the more stable\r\n\r\nsociety comprised of home owners, the present tax rates on\r\n\r\nestate duty will be revised with effect from 1 April  1977\r\n\r\nThe  exemption  limit will be increased  from  $50,000  to\r\n\r\n$100,000   and   the   remission  limit   will   also   be\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly  raised  from $230,000  to  $280,000.  The\r\n\r\neffect  of  this  concession will be that  all  properties\r\n\r\nunder $100,000 will pay no estate duty at all. This should\r\n\r\ncover  all  HDB  and  most HUDC flats  and  possibly  some\r\n\r\nterrace houses. For properties valued between $100,000 and\r\n\r\n$280,000, the  raising of the remission limit  will  also\r\n\r\nmean  a  reduction  of tax from what  would  presently  be\r\n\r\npayable. For example, a $200,000 house would be taxed at\r\n\r\n$3,337.50  only, instead of $8,837.50, payable  under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  estate  duty  liability.  The  easing   of   the\r\n\r\nexemption  and  remission limits  on  estate  duty  should\r\n\r\nensure  that in almost all cases, families will  not  lose\r\n\r\ntheir houses because of too heavy estate duties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This concession is for about 1,700 resident\r\n\r\npensioners  who  are paying income tax  on  the  pensions\r\n\r\nthey receive, mostly as Government pensioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to revise the basis of the tax on their\r\n\r\npensions. The pension periodically paid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  them  is  similar  to the annuity  paid  by  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  for  which  Members  will  remember   the   tax\r\n\r\nconcession I previously gave by remitting the tax  on  the\r\n\r\nportion of it representing a capital repayment. Similarly,\r\n\r\nthe  pension  payment  may be treated  as  comprising  two\r\n\r\nelements, one element being part repayment of capital  and\r\n\r\nthe other, payment of interest on the capital. At present.\r\n\r\nboth elements are subject to income tax. Only the interest\r\n\r\nportion should properly be considered as income and  taxed\r\n\r\naccordingly. This I therefore propose to do. For  purposes\r\n\r\nof  assessment,  it  will be convenient  if  the  interest\r\n\r\nelement   is   treated  as  one  half  of   the   pension.\r\n\r\nEffectively, therefore, tax will be payable on  only  half\r\n\r\nof  the pension. This concession will, however, only apply\r\n\r\nto  resident pensioners. The revenue loss is estimated  at\r\n\r\n$600,000 per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take effect from Year of Assessment 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To further develop Singapore as a financial centre\r\n\r\nand its Asian Dollar Market from its present gross size of\r\n\r\nUS$17.3  billion, the tax on income derived  from  Asian\r\n\r\nDollar  Market  operations will be  streamlined.  The  10%\r\n\r\nconcessionary  tax  will  now be  extended  to  cover  all\r\n\r\noffshore   income   derived  from  Asian   Dollar   Market\r\n\r\noperations  other  than exchange profits and  transactions\r\n\r\nwith domestic banking units and residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, income derived from transactions amongst\r\n\r\nAsian   Currency  Units  (ACUs)  and  with  banks  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  taxed at the rate  of  10%, and  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  certification requirements from banks  overseas\r\n\r\nwill be abolished. Such transactions include dealings  and\r\n\r\nholdings  of foreign currency, negotiable certificates  of\r\n\r\ndeposits  and bankers acceptances, broking, and  dealings.\r\n\r\nholdings,  floatation  and underwriting  of  Asian  Dollar\r\n\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present formula of establishing profits to be taxed\r\n\r\nat  the  concessionary rate has not worked satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe  formula  will  be  modified to ensure  that  offshore\r\n\r\noperations will enjoy in full the concessionary  tax  rate\r\n\r\nof 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will take effect from Year of Assessment\r\n\r\n1978, that is, to cover earnings in 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Because of our locational advantage and good\r\n\r\nbusiness  infrastructure, Singapore has the  potential  to\r\n\r\nbecome  an  important  centre  for  reinsurance  business.\r\n\r\nHowever, the high tax rate of 40% imposed on the income of\r\n\r\nresident  companies, whether such income is earned  within\r\n\r\nor  outside  Singapore, has offered  little  incentive  to\r\n\r\nreinsurance   companies  to  retain  their   premiums   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I am therefore changing the tax on income  from\r\n\r\nreinsurance business to a concessionary rate of 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will take effect also from Year of\r\n\r\nAssessment 1978.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Government Borrowing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the yield from the two tax increases is partly offset\r\n\r\nby  the  loss  in tax concessions, the deficit  of  $1,505\r\n\r\nmillion  shown  in  the  Estimates  is  not  significantly\r\n\r\nchanged  in amount. To meet such deficit, there  could  be\r\n\r\nsome  drawing  down  from  the  Development  Fund  of  the\r\n\r\nsurpluses that have been accumulated over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother  possibility is for the Government  to  borrow  to\r\n\r\nmake up the shortfall. How much of this will eventually be\r\n\r\nmet  from  borrowings  and how much by  drawing  down  our\r\n\r\nreserves, it is too early to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our capacity to borrow is indicated by the increase in\r\n\r\n1976  in our domestic debt by $1,501 million, and  in  our\r\n\r\nexternal debt by $117 million. The recent Swiss  Loan  of\r\n\r\n50 million Swiss Francs which was successfully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfloated at a coupon rate of 5 1/2% and an issue price of  99\r\n\r\nshows our high credit standing in international markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have weathered severe economic\r\n\r\nstorms in the last 3 1/2 years I hope nothing as shocking  as\r\n\r\nthe  1973  oil embargo and quadrupling of oil prices  ever\r\n\r\nhappens  again.
