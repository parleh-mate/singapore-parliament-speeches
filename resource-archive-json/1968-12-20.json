Now\r\n\r\nthat the Museum is under the Ministry of Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology, I hope that it will be properly\r\n\r\ndeveloped, and since the Minister is a specialist in\r\n\r\nbiology, he will be able to get exhibits of animals\r\n\r\nand insects from all over the world to replenish the\r\n\r\npresent stock in the Museum.

Further, I wish to know whether sufficient\r\n\r\nfire hydrants are installed in all housing estates\r\n\r\nbelonging to the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru):</b> Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis an acceptable practice all over the world to grant\r\n\r\nexemption from certain requirements of the building\r\n\r\nbylaws to low-cost housing in order to bring down the\r\n\r\ncost. Similarly, the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nhas obtained exemption from the Chief Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor for the provision of fire-fighting\r\n\r\nequipment, among others, in our low-cost housing so\r\n\r\nthat the cost of these housing flats could be reduced\r\n\r\nto an acceptable level. There is provision under\r\n\r\nsection 169 of the Local Government Buildings\r\n\r\nRegulations, 1966, for giving such an exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last eight years, not a single case of\r\n\r\nfire has occurred in any of the Housing Board flats,\r\n\r\nwhich means that they are very safe and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small fires such as those caused by the tipping over\r\n\r\nof kerosene stoves have never been able to spread to\r\n\r\nthe next flats due to the sound design and non-\r\n\r\ninflammable materials used in these multi-storey\r\n\r\nbuildings. Moreover, adequate hydrants have been\r\n\r\nprovided in all the housing estates for use by the\r\n\r\nFire Brigade in the event of an emergency. The Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor considered these facts and agreed\r\n\r\nthat exemption from the building by-laws for the\r\n\r\nprovision of fire-fighting equipment could be granted\r\n\r\nto housing estates. Fire-fighting equipment is very\r\n\r\nexpensive and it is often tampered with or stolen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen it is stored in the Housing Board estates.

It is\r\n\r\nnot feasible or necessary to resettle these farmers.\r\n\r\nBut certain safeguards have to be carried out,\r\n\r\nnamely, the construction of latrines, cess-pits,\r\n\r\npigsties, and so on. This involves a total cost of\r\n\r\n$1.8 million, part of which is paid by the Government\r\n\r\nand part by the farmers. The scheme is being\r\n\r\nimplemented in stages. A sum of $454,000 has been\r\n\r\nspent this year and the balance will be spent next\r\n\r\nyear.

The  first scheme is to convert  the  present\r\n\r\ntraining  centre into a two-storey building  and  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  facilities will include class-rooms,  hotel\r\n\r\nbedrooms, a production kitchen, a training kitchen, a\r\n\r\nrestaurant,  a  bar,  a bakery,  a  hotel  office,  a\r\n\r\nlanguage  laboratory, a library, a communal room  for\r\n\r\ntrainees and staff, store-rooms and a swimming  pool.\r\n\r\nThe  hotel  bedrooms and the other public  rooms  are\r\n\r\nintended to be used for on-the-job training.

An increase should be made. As a graduate of Nanyang University, I have the responsibility of looking after its expansion. Twelve years have elapsed since the inception of Nantah in 1956. The number of\r\n\r\ngraduates  has already exceeded 3.700. At  least  240\r\n\r\nNanyang  graduates  have returned  from  abroad  with\r\n\r\nhigher degrees. Some of them have returned to Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  to take up teaching posts. The Government\r\n\r\nannounced   the  recognition  of  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ndegrees  sometime this year. Next year there will  be\r\n\r\nhonours  degree  courses in Nanyang  University.  All\r\n\r\nthis is very encouraging. In other words, Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity is up and coming. In a matter of  time  it\r\n\r\nwill  definitely  be able to make a more  significant\r\n\r\ncontribution  in the field of higher education.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the allocation for next year  is  only\r\n\r\n$100,000. I wonder whether such a small allocation is\r\n\r\nenough  for  the expansion of Nanyang  University.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister for Education  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\npersuade the Finance Minister to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  a bigger allocation.

Firstly, it is understood that the Language Centre of Nanyang University was set up with Government funds. I want to know whether the present language laboratory has six-channel facilities as originally planned. If the answer is in\r\n\r\nthe negative, will there be any plans for its improve\r\n\r\nment?  Secondly, I wish to know whether there is  any\r\n\r\ntraining  scheme  for  higher  studies  for  graduate\r\n\r\nassistants to take over those departments in  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   which  are  overwhelmingly  staffed   by\r\n\r\noversea  personnel; such as the Department of History\r\n\r\nand the Department of Government Administration. With\r\n\r\nsuch  a  training  scheme as part of the  development\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  Nanyang University, there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsufficient supply of highly qualified local staff  to\r\n\r\nman the various departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as a portion of the sum allocated for this\r\n\r\nsubhead  is  intended  for the  purchase  of  library\r\n\r\nbooks,  I  wish  to  know  whether  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  the  present  librarian  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity is able to maintain the balance  of  books\r\n\r\nconcerning  Chinese culture published in  Nationalist\r\n\r\nChina and the People's Republic of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   support  the  Member  for  Jurong.  I  wish   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can give more allocation to Nantah. When I\r\n\r\nread  the 1969-70 Development Estimates, I was  quite\r\n\r\nsurprised.  In the allocation for Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nfor the coming financial year, there is only $100,000\r\n\r\nfor  the  purchase  of equipment and  library  books.\r\n\r\nThere is no allocation for the extension of buildings\r\n\r\nand  the provision of other facilities. There is  not\r\n\r\neven  a  token provision. Does this mean that  Nantah\r\n\r\nhas  all  the facilities and, as such, does not  need\r\n\r\nany  allocation  for  further development  in  fields\r\n\r\nother than scientific equipment and library books? In\r\n\r\nmy opinion, there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill  many  fields in which Nantah needs improvement\r\n\r\nand  development. In the past, Nanyang University has\r\n\r\ndepended mainly on contributions from the people. Its\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  development has been  tuned  to  its\r\n\r\nfinancial resources. All development has been  on  an\r\n\r\nausterity basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nantah should be different now. In the light of our\r\n\r\npresent   national  development,  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ncould play an important part in education because  of\r\n\r\nthe  recognition  of the fact that  it  is  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel   of  the  educational  institutions  of   our\r\n\r\ncountry, it  has  a  great role to  play  in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding. All the defects that are existing should be\r\n\r\nrectified as soon as possible. In a very short  time,\r\n\r\nNantah   has  been  able  to  produce  many   eminent\r\n\r\nscholars.  Some  have gone abroad for higher  studies\r\n\r\nand have returned with the most up-to-date knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome  have  returned  to teach in Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nitself.  We should not allow the knowledge they  have\r\n\r\nacquired   to   be  wasted.  We  must  always   renew\r\n\r\nourselves. As the Chinese saying goes, \"One  must  be\r\n\r\nnewer  and newer 'day by day.\" These scholars  should\r\n\r\nnot just write articles on what they have learnt, but\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to put into practice what they  have\r\n\r\nlearnt. In view of the present scientific development\r\n\r\nin  the world, we should encourage them to move  with\r\n\r\nthe  times by providing them with research facilities\r\n\r\nso  that they can further advance their knowledge. We\r\n\r\nshould  not  let them be stagnant in their scientific\r\n\r\nfield.  Unless we provide them with such  facilities,\r\n\r\nour country will suffer a loss. There is not even  an\r\n\r\nelectronic  computer in Nanyang  University.  We  may\r\n\r\nconcede  the  fact that not all research necessitates\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of equipment, as in some Arts subjects.\r\n\r\nHowever,   equipment  is  essential   in   scientific\r\n\r\nresearch. This is how some Nantah scientific scholars\r\n\r\nfeel the need to have at least a small computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the quarters, too, are limited. The\r\n\r\nnumber  is  not enough for the teachers and students.\r\n\r\nThe  Nanyang  University  authorities  have  made  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for first-year students to  stay  in  the\r\n\r\nquarters. As a result, 95\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper cent of the students are staying in the quarters.\r\n\r\nOther  facilities,  too, are  not  adequate.  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is very far away from the city.  The  stu\r\n\r\ndents do not have ample opportunities to take part in\r\n\r\ncultural  and recreational activities. We are  trying\r\n\r\nto  evolve a rugged society. Yet when we look  around\r\n\r\nNanyang University, we find that there is not even  a\r\n\r\nstandard  playground for the students to exercise  or\r\n\r\nrelax themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has told us in this House that Nanyang University will introduce an honours degree course in the coming academic year. The sum allocated is only $100,000. This is the final part of the $1 million Government allocation. Will this sum of money be enough for the introduction and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of honours degree courses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the press that the Vice-Chancellor\r\n\r\nof  Nantah  will  be  retiring. Some  honours  degree\r\n\r\ncourses  will be introduced as from the next academic\r\n\r\nyear.  As Nanyang University is entering a new phase,\r\n\r\nit  is necessary to appoint a new Vice-Chancellor.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  know whether the Minister has been informed\r\n\r\nthat  the Nantah authorities have taken any steps  to\r\n\r\nappoint a new Vice-Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, sometime in the middle of  this  year,\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  did  submit  four  projects  for\r\n\r\nGovernment's consideration. The projects were for the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of additional student hostels  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  additional staff quarters.  These  two\r\n\r\nprojects  would  cost  about $3  million.  The  third\r\n\r\nproject was for the construction of a sports complex.\r\n\r\nThe  fourth  project  was  for  the  improvement   of\r\n\r\nventilation  for the Great Hall. The  sports  complex\r\n\r\nwas   estimated  to  cost  about  $620,000  and   the\r\n\r\nventilation  for  the  Great Hall  would  cost  about\r\n\r\n$20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to construct additional staff quarters\r\n\r\nwas not supported as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy is to encourage home  ownership.\r\n\r\nIt would be preferable to grant loans to the staff to\r\n\r\npurchase  their  own  houses.  As  regards  the   con\r\n\r\nstruction  of student hostels, about 80 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe students are already accommodated in the existing\r\n\r\nhostels.  Compared  with  other  universities,   this\r\n\r\npercentage  is  very high indeed and, therefore,  the\r\n\r\nneed for this project is not that urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects for the construction of a sports\r\n\r\ncomplex and improvement of the Great Hall were  still\r\n\r\nunder  consideration at the time when the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  were prepared. Since no decision  has  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  finalised, no provision was made in the Develop\r\n\r\nment Estimates as regards these two items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the financial stringency, it is likely\r\n\r\nthat in future only requests of high priority such as\r\n\r\nfunds  for  improvement of laboratories  for  honours\r\n\r\ndegree  courses and for research will  be  supported.\r\n\r\nSome of the equipment for honours degree courses will\r\n\r\nbe  arriving very soon. Some of it was purchased  out\r\n\r\nof  the $1 million grant for scientific equipment and\r\n\r\nlibrary  made in 1966. However, if this equipment  is\r\n\r\nfound  to  be inadequate, Government is always  quite\r\n\r\nprepared to consider further requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the language laboratory was first installed, it\r\n\r\nwas equipped with six channels. Later it was modified\r\n\r\nto  one channel because it was under-used. Should the\r\n\r\nneed  arise, the language laboratory can be  restored\r\n\r\nto the full six channels without any difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also mentioned further studies\r\n\r\nby  local staff. The policy to encourage further over\r\n\r\nseas  training  for  graduate  assistants  so  as  to\r\n\r\nfurther  enhance  the  academic standard  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   is   being  actively  pursued   by   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I was told that this year  two  graduate\r\n\r\nassistants  from  the Department  of  Government  and\r\n\r\nPublic  Administration were sent to Canada for higher\r\n\r\ntraining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder the Colombo Plan. Action is also being taken to\r\n\r\nselect  another six candidates, either  graduates  or\r\n\r\ngraduate assistants, from the Faculty of Commerce  to\r\n\r\ngo abroad for further training next year. Two of them\r\n\r\nwill  be  under the Colombo Plan and four on exchange\r\n\r\nprogrammes with American universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the purchase of library books for the\r\n\r\nUniversity, I think the Member for Jurong will  agree\r\n\r\nwith  me  that it is not realistic to adopt a  system\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  number of books purchased  from  Taiwan\r\n\r\nmatches  the  number purchased from  China.  In  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  surely  the criterion should  be  that  only\r\n\r\nbooks  which are considered necessary and useful  are\r\n\r\npurchased  for the library regardless of the  country\r\n\r\nof origin. There is a library committee headed by the\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor  which  decides  on  the   purchasing\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru mentioned the appointment\r\n\r\nof  a  ViceChancellor. Nanyang University is just  as\r\n\r\nanxious as the Member for Tiong Bahru that a suitably\r\n\r\nqualified  academician  and administrator  should  be\r\n\r\nappointed as Vice-Chancellor as soon as possible.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  this matter is being pursued actively  by  all\r\n\r\nconcerned. However, the Member for Tiong Bahru should\r\n\r\nrealise  that  the  financial  resources  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  do  not  permit  it  to  offer  the  same\r\n\r\nattractive  material terms obtaining in  universities\r\n\r\nin  the  United  States  or  other  Western  European\r\n\r\ncountries. Furthermore, I think the office  of  Vice-\r\n\r\nChancellor is now no longer that dignified and secure\r\n\r\nand isolated from the rough and tumble of the outside\r\n\r\nworld. Universities in many large cities of the world\r\n\r\nare embroiled in student strife and struggle. Some of\r\n\r\nthe    Vice-Chancellor's   offices   of   prestigious\r\n\r\nuniversities   were   even   seized   by    students.\r\n\r\nIllustrious   academicians   who   would   be   ideal\r\n\r\ncandidates for vice-chancellorship are, therefore, no\r\n\r\nlonger  enamoured of the post of Vice-Chancellor.  In\r\n\r\nthe  search for a well-qualified academician to  fill\r\n\r\nthe post of Vice-Chancellor, both the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents and staff of Nanyang University can  help  in\r\n\r\ncreating   a  congenial  atmosphere  for   study   and\r\n\r\nresearch. On the other hand, if students, periodically\r\n\r\nindulge    in   agitation   and   sometimes    violent\r\n\r\ndemonstration,  they  are only  helping  to  make  the\r\n\r\nsearch for a Vice-Chancellor more difficult and  would\r\n\r\nonly  be inviting the \"colonels\", since we do not have\r\n\r\n\"generals\", or, worse still, half-baked \"lieutenants\",\r\n\r\nto take charge of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): From the reply of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, it appears that he is still  interested\r\n\r\nin looking after Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 402.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency, there are about nine\r\n\r\nprimary schools of various streams and the pupils come\r\n\r\nto  about 1,000 per year from these schools.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, there is nothing for me to quarrel about. But\r\n\r\nthere   is  only  one  secondary  school,  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nIntegrated Secondary School, in my constituency.  This\r\n\r\nschool  was set up as a result of the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nvisit to Jurong Constituency and at the request of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should not be surprised when I say something\r\n\r\nabout this school. There are only eight classrooms and\r\n\r\nit  is  without  a  hall, or a library  or  laboratory\r\n\r\nfacilities. Obviously, Sir, in terms of capacity, this\r\n\r\nschool  is inadequate for the needs of my constituency\r\n\r\nand is unable to absorb the number who passes out from\r\n\r\nthe  primary  schools in my constituency. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nit  does not have all the necessary facilities that  a\r\n\r\nsecondary school should have. Notwithstanding the lack\r\n\r\nof  these  facilities, there is an advisory  committee\r\n\r\nand,  with  the  cooperation  of  the  principal,  the\r\n\r\nstudents and other people, they have been able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   carry   out   a  great  deal  of  extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities.

In fact, there is room for  16\r\n\r\nclasses   running  two  sessions  but  only  15   were\r\n\r\nfunctioning  at the end of last year.  None  of  these\r\n\r\nclasses has a full enrolment of 40 students. The  1968\r\n\r\nenrolment figures show a drop of about 11 per cent  as\r\n\r\ncompared with those of the previous year. Besides  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Integrated Secondary School, there  are  three\r\n\r\nother  Government secondary schools along or  slightly\r\n\r\noff  Jurong Road that are under-used. As these schools\r\n\r\ncan  provide  sufficient places for pupils  living  in\r\n\r\nthis  area, my Ministry does not intend to  build  any\r\n\r\nextension to the Jurong Integrated Secondary School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, That the total sum to  be\r\n\r\nallocated for Head 41 be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated for this Head is $30,850,070.\r\n\r\nApart from the sum required for the new administrative\r\n\r\nbuilding of the Ministry of Education, there are  five\r\n\r\nitems  of expenditure for higher education.

But  the  sum  allocated  for\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary education is very small.  From\r\n\r\nthe   various  allocations,  we  can  see  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  biased  towards  the  development  of\r\n\r\ntechnical    education.    From    the    rate     of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and the various  changes  that  are\r\n\r\ntaking  place, we realise that there  is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  technical education so that we will be  able\r\n\r\nto provide the necessary industrial personnel for our\r\n\r\ndevelopment needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   for  Education  on  his   successful\r\n\r\nachievement  in encouraging technical education.  How\r\n\r\never,  I wish to raise some questions. When will  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Southeast Asian Studies be established?\r\n\r\nWhen  will  work  on  it  be  started  and  when   is\r\n\r\ncompletion expected? How and when will enrolment take\r\n\r\nplace?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where will the vocational institutes be\r\n\r\nset  up?  Are there any plans for building vocational\r\n\r\nschools in the rural areas to look after the needs of\r\n\r\nthe students in these areas? If students in the rural\r\n\r\nareas  desire  to study in vocational  schools,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to travel all the way to the city because  voca\r\n\r\ntional  schools are built only in the city areas  and\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure on travelling will  mean  a  greater\r\n\r\nburden to their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what is the basis for the selection of\r\n\r\nprincipals  in integrated schools? In  my  view,  the\r\n\r\nprincipals  should be bilingual. But, at the  moment,\r\n\r\nthe  principals of many integrated schools  are  only\r\n\r\nmonolingual.  Therefore, they have difficulties  when\r\n\r\nconversing  with parents, and their senior assistants\r\n\r\nhave to act as interpreters. Sir, this arrangement is\r\n\r\nmost  unsatisfactory  and I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider   a  better  basis  for  the  selection   of\r\n\r\nprincipals in integrated schools.

At  the  moment,  I  am  aware   that   a\r\n\r\ncontractor  is  prepared to offer some  10  acres  of\r\n\r\nvacant  land  for the construction of a school.  Will\r\n\r\nthe Minister take prompt action to accept this offer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Paya Lebar had listened carefully to the  speech\r\n\r\nwhich  I  made on 12th December, 1968, he would  have\r\n\r\nrealised  that all new school building  programmes  -\r\n\r\nboth  for primary and secondary schools - have ceased\r\n\r\nsince  1967  and that there will be no more  academic\r\n\r\nsecondary school building programme.

I would like to say that the original\r\n\r\ncost  of  the extension to the airport runway  is  $5\r\n\r\nmillion,  but it has since been revised  and  brought\r\n\r\ndown  to  $3.8  million.  One  million  dollars   was\r\n\r\nexpended  last  year  and almost  $800,000  has  been\r\n\r\nexpended  this year. I can say that the extension  of\r\n\r\nthe  runway  from  9,000  to 11,000  feet  should  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  by  the middle of next year.  Seventy-five\r\n\r\nper cent of the work has been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next query raised by the Member was on the new\r\n\r\ncar  park  under subhead 305. I think I have  already\r\n\r\nanswered  this question a few days ago, but in  order\r\n\r\nto  meet the request of the Member, I shall give  him\r\n\r\nthe  answer again. This car park can accommodate  200\r\n\r\ncars  and has been in use since June this year. There\r\n\r\nis, however, a sum of $18,000 for next year which  is\r\n\r\nthe  estimated cost for the construction of  bus  and\r\n\r\ncar  park  attendant kiosks which will be built  next\r\n\r\nyear and rented out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's third question was when the jumbo jets,\r\n\r\nthe Boeing 747s, are expected to arrive in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  think  I  have  given this information  on  a  few\r\n\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do definitely know that some jumbo jets should\r\n\r\narrive at Singapore Airport around 1971.

But may I say  that\r\n\r\npersonally I had the opportunity to visit Seattle two\r\n\r\nmonths  ago? This is the place where the Boeing  747s\r\n\r\nare manufactured by the Boeing Company. I am given to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that, except for the number of passengers\r\n\r\ninvolved (that is, twice as many passengers  will  be\r\n\r\ndischarged  from the jumbo jets), no great difficulty\r\n\r\nshould  be  experienced, because the jumbo jets  have\r\n\r\nbeen  designed to take off and land on runways  which\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake the lighter Boeing 707s.

If I were the only one who could  make  a\r\n\r\ndecision to build the new Newton Post Office, I would\r\n\r\ngive  him  the assurance that it would be  done.  But\r\n\r\nsurely  he  knows that it is not just enough  for  my\r\n\r\nMinistry to say that we want it and it is done. There\r\n\r\nare  the  usual  difficulties, it is true  that  this\r\n\r\nparticular item which appeared in the Estimates  last\r\n\r\nyear may appear again in next year's Estimates and we\r\n\r\nmay  not have a post office even in 1970. This is not\r\n\r\nthe  fault of the Ministry of Communications.  It  is\r\n\r\njust because there are competing demands for sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to build a new post office for Newton\r\n\r\nis  well known. It was actually taken in October 1966\r\n\r\nby  the  Economic Planning Unit. In fact, a site  was\r\n\r\nselected  by the Public Works Department to have  the\r\n\r\nnew  post office somewhere around Clemenceau  Avenue,\r\n\r\nquite  close  to Newton Circus. Then a  request  came\r\n\r\nfrom  a  different section of the P.W.D, for  a  road\r\n\r\nimprovement scheme and, therefore, this site  had  to\r\n\r\nbe  given up to meet the request. In March 1967, the\r\n\r\nChief  Planner  thought  it  a  good  idea  that  the\r\n\r\ncontemplated  building  of  a  headquarters  for  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board in  the  Newton  area  could\r\n\r\nperhaps provide some space for a post office. Then in\r\n\r\nJuly  1968  - more than a year after that  suggestion\r\n\r\nwas  first  received - we were told that  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities   Board  had  decided  not   to   build   a\r\n\r\nheadquarters  in  that area.  A  site  has  now  been\r\n\r\nselected,  again  close  to the  Government  quarters\r\n\r\nbetween Monks Hill Terrace and Bukit Timah Road,  and\r\n\r\nquite  close  to the present Newton Post Office.  The\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Lands replied on the  2nd  of  this\r\n\r\nmonth that he was going to take up this proposal with\r\n\r\nthe  departments concerned. We are now waiting for  a\r\n\r\nreply  from the Chief Planner's Office. So I  suppose\r\n\r\nwe will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstart building when everybody is quite happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then moved on to the provision\r\n\r\nof  \"Mail Loading Pier\". He wants to know where it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be and when it is expected to be completed.\r\n\r\nIt  is planned to build the pier on the present  site\r\n\r\nbecause  the existing one is in a very bad  state  of\r\n\r\nrepair.

I feel  that\r\n\r\nwe have not achieved very much with the Defence Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should form a National Defence\r\n\r\nVoluntary  Fund on a permanent basis so  that  it  is\r\n\r\nopen  all  the time to anyone to make a donation.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, we can achieve better results with it than\r\n\r\nwith  the present Defence Fund. The donations to  the\r\n\r\nDefence Fund are dwindling. So we must encourage  the\r\n\r\nrich  people to donate to the National Defence  Volun\r\n\r\ntary Fund.

I  now\r\n\r\ncrave your indulgence, Mr Speaker, Sir, to say this.\r\n\r\nThe  National Defence Voluntary Fund Committee should\r\n\r\ntry  to encourage everyone to donate.

But\r\n\r\nup  till now there has been talk only and nothing has\r\n\r\nbeen built. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill not forget the promise made by his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  at that time. May I ask him when  the  two\r\n\r\ncommunity centres will be constructed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The Minister mentioned just now\r\n\r\nthat  I had turned down the proposed site.

Then  on\r\n\r\nhis  recommendation later on, we went  to  the  other\r\n\r\nsite. This was the site which will be affected by the\r\n\r\nroad-widening scheme. Therefore, the application  was\r\n\r\nrejected by the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> There seems to be some confusion.\r\n\r\nThe  present community centre was converted from  the\r\n\r\nKatong  Boys'  Club in 1959 before I was  elected  to\r\n\r\nthis  House. The selection of that site  was  not  my\r\n\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Minister's request for my assistance\r\n\r\nto  look  for  an alternative site, I will  certainly\r\n\r\nhelp  him  to  do  so.

We\r\n\r\nhave   people's  centres  in  the  form  of   various\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres all over the country.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nvote,  although  merely token at this  stage,  for  a\r\n\r\nPeople's   Centre.  I  believe  it   must   be   some\r\n\r\ncentralised  affair. I am sure the Minister  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  enlighten this House because even  at  this\r\n\r\nstage there must be some plan set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am ranging over amendments Nos. (2) and (3) ,\r\n\r\nmay  I ask this question? Now that we have a People's\r\n\r\nCentre,   why  do  we  need  a  People's  Hall?   The\r\n\r\nfacilities  might  be duplicated  or  they  might  be\r\n\r\ndifferent. In any case, how would the People's Centre\r\n\r\nand the People's Hall develop the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are token\r\n\r\nvotes. These are ideas which we have in mind. I shall\r\n\r\ntry  to  clarify what is meant by the People's Centre\r\n\r\nand  the  People's  Hall.  There  seems  to  be  some\r\n\r\nconfusion  that  since  we  have  so  many  community\r\n\r\ncentres  all over the island, why should we  want  to\r\n\r\nestablish a super community centre at Kallang itself?\r\n\r\nThis  is  not a super community centre. It  serves  a\r\n\r\ndifferent   purpose.  Its  objectives  are   slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent  in that in the People's Centre there  will\r\n\r\nbe  two lecture rooms, one with a seating capacity of\r\n\r\n100  persons,  and  the other  40  persons.  This  is\r\n\r\nlargely  to allow the People's Association to conduct\r\n\r\nclasses for the staff and seminars for the management\r\n\r\ncommittees, in this way, experiences can be exchanged\r\n\r\nbetween  members of the various management committees\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the staff of the People's  Association,\r\n\r\nwhich  number  between 1,500 and 1,700.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nexpected  that  we shall have a staff  club-house  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  1,500 odd members of our staff  to  have\r\n\r\nsome  recreation and a place to get together to  know\r\n\r\none another better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, the 1,500 or 1.700 members of our\r\n\r\nstaff  are spread all over the island and I think  it\r\n\r\nis  essential that, from time to time, they should be\r\n\r\nbrought  together in a central place where  they  can\r\n\r\nget  to  know one another and participate in sporting\r\n\r\nor cultural activities of their own interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed that we should have offices for\r\n\r\ncorporation members of the People's Association which\r\n\r\ncan  be  rented  out to them at an  economic  rental,\r\n\r\nbecause  we have found that quite a large  number  of\r\n\r\nyouth  associations, clubs and such  bodies  have  no\r\n\r\noffices  or  premises where they can work to  promote\r\n\r\ntheir various activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is put into the Development Estimates as two\r\n\r\nitems  - People's Centre and People's Hall. Actually,\r\n\r\nthey  are  two phases of the same project. The  first\r\n\r\nphase is the People's Centre and the second phase  is\r\n\r\nthe People's Hall. As regards the People's Flall, the\r\n\r\nidea  is to have a hall of this type to hold cultural\r\n\r\nshows that are usually seen or performed in community\r\n\r\ncentres.  We  have found that present facilities  for\r\n\r\nlarge-scale  performances  of  this  nature  are  not\r\n\r\nsuitable because the community centres cannot  afford\r\n\r\nthe rentals charged by the Victoria Memorial Hall  or\r\n\r\nthe  National Theatre. And it is intended that  shows\r\n\r\nor  activities which are encouraged by  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation can be performed in this hall at quite  a\r\n\r\nnominal rate. Moreover, annually, we hold conferences\r\n\r\nof management committees and conferences of the staff\r\n\r\nof  the People's Association and we find that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the space available for these conferences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is proposed that the People's  Hall  be\r\n\r\nused to hold these conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, it is just a token vote because,\r\n\r\nwhile  investigating into the possibility  of  having\r\n\r\nthis  centre  built,  we  came  across  problems   of\r\n\r\nfoundation.   There   would  have   to   be   further\r\n\r\ninvestigations into the feasibility of building  this\r\n\r\ncomplex and also, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview  of our financial stringency, it is more  likely\r\n\r\nthan not that the plans will not be proceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

May I request the Minister to build  a\r\n\r\nrural community centre in the Naval Base in future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that there is no provision for the\r\n\r\nbuilding   of   holiday  camps.

In addition, I wish to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  deal  with the expansion of kindergarten  classes\r\n\r\nrun  by  the People's Association. We know  that  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association was established  on  1st  July,\r\n\r\n1960,  with  a  view to serving the people.  After  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of eight years, the People's Association  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  make use of more than  180  community\r\n\r\ncentres  all over the island to serve the  people  by\r\n\r\npromoting  various useful activities which  are  very\r\n\r\npopular  with  them. At the same time, the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  have  also achieved the aim  of  becoming  a\r\n\r\nbridge   between  the  people  and  the   Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  can say that community  centres  have\r\n\r\nalready gained a place in the social structure of our\r\n\r\ncountry.  In  fact,  in  the  eyes  of  the   people,\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres have also taken root in the  daily\r\n\r\nlife  of  the people. It is because of these  achieve\r\n\r\nments  by  the People's Association that we can  make\r\n\r\nfurther  demands  on  the  Association.  We  ask  for\r\n\r\nfurther  expansion of the activities to be undertaken\r\n\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 17th of this month, the Minister for Defence,\r\n\r\nin  reply  to a question by the Member for Sembawang,\r\n\r\ndisclosed  that  the People's Association  have  been\r\n\r\nconducting  132 kindergarten classes in  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunity centres with an average yearly enrolment of\r\n\r\n12,000  students  who pay about $1  each  per  month.\r\n\r\nThese kindergarten classes are very popular with  the\r\n\r\nparents of the pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present juncture of its development, the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association cannot turn away from the  duty\r\n\r\nof  further  developing kindergarten education  which\r\n\r\nshould become a link in our whole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  structure.  My opinion  is  based  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  three reasons. Firstly, we all  know  that\r\n\r\npre-primary education plays a very important part  in\r\n\r\nthe  education of children. This is because  at  this\r\n\r\ntender  age,  children  are most  impressionable  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  is taught to them will have a great  impact\r\n\r\non  them  in  later years. The father of kindergarten\r\n\r\neducation, Mr F. W. A. Froebel, has said  that  with\r\n\r\nchildren  of  tender  age, you can  achieve  with  an\r\n\r\neffort  as light as a feather what you cannot achieve\r\n\r\nwith  an  effort so heavy as 10,000 pounds  in  later\r\n\r\nyears.  Therefore, children of tender age  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  proper  kindergarten education.  In  fact,  in\r\n\r\nadvanced countries, preprimary education has been put\r\n\r\nin  as an integral part of the whole education system\r\n\r\nin  order  to cater for the needs of the children  in\r\n\r\nthe  age  group  of four to six years who  should  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped intellectually, spiritually, physically and\r\n\r\nmorally. As the Member for Paya Lebar has mentioned a\r\n\r\nfew   days  ago, they  should  be  given  a   proper\r\n\r\nlinguistic  start.  Therefore, we  should  not  allow\r\n\r\nkindergarten education to sink or swim by itself.  It\r\n\r\nshould be given proper guidance and assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next reason is that, from the Estimates\r\n\r\npresented  by the Minister for Finance,  we  can  see that defence occupies the most important part and, as a  result  of  the  increase in defence  expenditure, other  estimates  are put on a standstill  basis.  We know  that the Ministry of Education requires a great deal  of  money  for educational reforms.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is  little money left for the  development  of\r\n\r\nkindergarten education. As a matter of expediency, we\r\n\r\ncan  make  use of available facilities. Organisations\r\n\r\nwhich  already  have  the  facilities  should  expand\r\n\r\nkindergarten  education and the People's Association,\r\n\r\nin my view, is the most ideal choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the People's Association has more than 180\r\n\r\ncommunity centres throughout the island and a nominal\r\n\r\nfee  of  $1  is  charged per pupil per  month.  These\r\n\r\nclasses are very popular amongst\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  parents. Furthermore, the community centres  are\r\n\r\nnot being made use of in the mornings, other than the\r\n\r\nrunning of kindergarten classes. Therefore, with  the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  some equipment and  facilities  the\r\n\r\nspace  available  can be converted into  very  useful\r\n\r\nkindergartens. Sir, the People's Association has  the\r\n\r\nbasic  facilities for the promotion  of  kindergarten\r\n\r\neducation. This is clear to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to raise some matters of detail in regard\r\n\r\nto  the implementation of the scheme I have in  mind.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  legislation should be introduced to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  kindergarten education becomes part and  parcel\r\n\r\nof  our educational structure to be undertaken by the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association.  We  are  aware  that  special\r\n\r\nclasses  to  cater for the failures  in  the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool Leaving Examination are conducted by the Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board because the Ministry of Education  is\r\n\r\nunable  to  conduct these special classes. Therefore,\r\n\r\non   the   same  basis,  we  can  ask  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation to run kindergarten classes. In fact,  it\r\n\r\nshould be proud to be able to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the present moment, there is only one\r\n\r\ncommittee  in the People's Association to  attend  to\r\n\r\nthe  affairs  of kindergarten education which  caters\r\n\r\nfor  12,000  pupils.  This is  obviously  inadequate.\r\n\r\nTherefore, an expansion is necessary. First, we  must\r\n\r\nform an advisory committee. We should also strengthen\r\n\r\nthe   administrative  organisation  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation. The advisory committee should consist of\r\n\r\nexperts from the Ministry of Education on pre-primary\r\n\r\neducation   and   representatives  from   educational\r\n\r\nbodies,  the  People's Association  and  teachers  of\r\n\r\nkindergarten classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in my view, the present facilities in the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  are inadequate  for  kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses. We should buy more teaching aids and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducational  toys for the children of these  classes,\r\n\r\nbecause children of this age learn better through the\r\n\r\nplay-and-learn  method  and  free  activities.   They\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  confined to  rigid  formal  teaching\r\n\r\nthroughout the three hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may be worried about the expenditure. I think his worry is unfounded. It can be overcome. In my view, there are many members of the public who are always ready to donate money for a good cause. If any additional expenditure is necessary, we can even go to the extent of increasing the school fees for these\r\n\r\nclasses. So long as the classes are properly  run,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the parents will not mind an increase in\r\n\r\nthe fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in my view, teachers in the kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses  should be given professional training.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  an  opportunity  to  study   child\r\n\r\npsychology and children's habits and special teaching\r\n\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the teachers in the community\r\n\r\ncentres have weekly discussions on Saturdays. This is\r\n\r\nvery  good.  But I think more can be done to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  teaching methods and the curriculum, and perhaps\r\n\r\nkindergarten  teachers can be sent on  a  study  tour\r\n\r\nabroad.  On the other hand, steps should be taken  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the supervision of kindergarten classes by\r\n\r\nsending   qualified  instructors  to  supervise   the\r\n\r\nteaching  of the kindergarten teachers. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they  can ensure that what the  teachers  have\r\n\r\nlearnt   theoretically  will  be  put  into  practice\r\n\r\nproperly.  Only  along these lines  can  kindergarten\r\n\r\neducation be put on the proper track. Sir,  with  co-operation   from   the  people   and   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,   kindergarten   education    will    be\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this head\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  People's Association  and  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  what has already been said.

This\r\n\r\nis  very unfair to Members of Parliament because they\r\n\r\nare  advisers  to  the community centres  and  advice\r\n\r\nshould be sought from them before such transfers  are\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The temporary Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock)</b>: Order.\r\n\r\nMr  Lee, these remarks would have been more relevant\r\n\r\nwhen this topic was debated in the Main Estimates.

The Member  very\r\n\r\nrightly  said  that  the  children  attending   these\r\n\r\nkindergarten  classes are at the most  impressionable\r\n\r\nage  and one must be very careful with what one  does\r\n\r\nwith  their education, and also kindergarten teachers\r\n\r\nshould be given very special training. All in all, it\r\n\r\nis a very specialised subject and in order to be able\r\n\r\nto  teach  these children well, we have to train  the\r\n\r\nteachers, and all this costs money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members that the main objective of the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  is  not  to  run  kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses.  The Association does it as an  adjunct  and\r\n\r\npartly  to  provide  a service to the  people.  After\r\n\r\nrunning these classes for some time, however, it  was\r\n\r\nfound  necessary  to  set up a committee  to  conduct\r\n\r\nthese  classes, and, having watched the results,  and\r\n\r\nespecially after listening to the Member for  Jurong,\r\n\r\nI  am  more  than ever convinced that the running  of\r\n\r\nkindergarten  classes  is not  the  function  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association.  Instead  of  benefiting   our\r\n\r\npopulation,  we  may  probably do  untold  damage  to\r\n\r\nchildren  of  tender age if the People's  Association\r\n\r\ntakes over this job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to differ when the Member for Jurong said that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  great demand for kindergarten  classes,\r\n\r\nbecause  when enrolment began this year some  of  the\r\n\r\nkindergarten  teachers had to go on a  house-to-house\r\n\r\nenrolment   campaign  in  order  to  get   sufficient\r\n\r\nchildren  to commence classes. In fact, some  of  the\r\n\r\nclasses  have to be closed down. I myself would  like\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association to run these classes,  but\r\n\r\nowing  to  its commitments and in order not  to  lose\r\n\r\nsight  of  our  main  objective, I  think  we  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate more on what we have set out to  do  than\r\n\r\ndo  something which we are not qualified to do,  that\r\n\r\nis,  running  kindergarten classes. I would  be  very\r\n\r\nloath  indeed  to damage our children  at  this  very\r\n\r\ntender age by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproviding  them with teachers who are  not  specially\r\n\r\nqualified  to  teach them. I do not know  whether  it\r\n\r\ncomes  within  the province of the  Ministry  of  Edu\r\n\r\ncation. But after listening to the Member for  Jurong\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  would like to repeat that I am  more  than\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the People's Association is  not  the\r\n\r\norganisation to run kindergarten classes. In fact, we\r\n\r\nwill be cutting down the number of classes very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan would like the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  be handed over to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Then it will be out of\r\n\r\nour hands!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I have no objection to this at all.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it will lighten my load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked what has happened\r\n\r\nto the holiday flats and why there is no provision to\r\n\r\nbuild these flats in the Development Estimates.  This\r\n\r\nproposition came about while members of the board  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association were dealing with a request\r\n\r\nfor  holiday bungalows from the staff of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation. They requested that since the  staff  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments  are  entitled  to   holiday\r\n\r\nbungalows,  why cannot they be provided with  holiday\r\n\r\nbungalows  also?  This proposition was  discussed  by\r\n\r\nmembers of the board of the People's Association  and\r\n\r\nwe  came  to  the conclusion that it would  be  worth\r\n\r\nwhile to try a new scheme, that is, instead of,  say,\r\n\r\nusing two acres of land for two bungalow houses which\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to accommodate only two families,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  better to build holiday flats so that  for\r\n\r\nthe  same  amount of money and using  the  same  land\r\n\r\narea,   more   members   of  the   staff   could   be\r\n\r\naccommodated: also it is possible to let these  flats\r\n\r\nout to members of the public. Since the holiday flats\r\n\r\nare  primarily for the use of members of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, the cost of building them will  have  to\r\n\r\ncome  from  whatever  funds the People's  Association\r\n\r\nhas.  This  is  the reason why the provision  is  not\r\n\r\nincluded in the Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates.

It was right that the sum\r\n\r\nof $92,000 provided for last year was not spent. I do\r\n\r\nnot know the exact figures expended in the drawing up\r\n\r\nof plans and investigation work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look into the question of building a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  at the Naval Base  when  the  time\r\n\r\ncomes, because the Naval Base has not yet been handed\r\n\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that answers all the issues brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Minister has not replied to my question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not the\r\n\r\nMinister who promised him two kindergarten classes in\r\n\r\nhis  constituency.

In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  should do less and less of this, and I have given\r\n\r\nmy   reasons.  Also  the  Member  for  Sembawang  has\r\n\r\nreinforced  the  reason why the People's  Association\r\n\r\nshould not be responsible for kindergarten classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nvery much regret that the Minister for Defence has  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  idea from mine.

Why is it that in  the  1969-70\r\n\r\nestimates  only a token vote is asked  for?  Does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that there is no longer a need to proceed  with\r\n\r\nthe  project?

With  the\r\n\r\nclosure\r\n\r\nof  the  Pulau Senang Settlement after  the  riot  in\r\n\r\n1963,  the  criminal law detainees from Pulau  Senang\r\n\r\nwere  transferred  to Outram Road Prison  and  Changi\r\n\r\nPrison,  thereby  causing congestion  in  both  these\r\n\r\nprisons. The congestion in Changi Prison became worse\r\n\r\nwith the demolition of the Outram Road Prison in 1965\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   its  substitution  by  the  Remand  Prison   at\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  which has accommodation  for  about  310\r\n\r\nprisoners. When the New Open Prison at Ulu  Bedok  is\r\n\r\ncompleted,    the   criminal   law   detainees    now\r\n\r\naccommodated  in Changi Prison and the Remand  Prison\r\n\r\nin  Queenstown  will be transferred there.  Accommoda\r\n\r\ntion  for  400 criminal law detainees is provided  in\r\n\r\nthe  New  Open  Prison at Ulu Bedok. Of  course,  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the prison is to rehabilitate  prisoners\r\n\r\nand not just to keep them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question on the female prison at\r\n\r\nChangi, the purpose of building a cellular block  for\r\n\r\nfemale  prisoners  is  to  relieve  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\naccommodation  at  the  female  prison  and   provide\r\n\r\ngreater security and conditions of segregation, where\r\n\r\nnecessary,  for female prisoners. It is  intended  to\r\n\r\nbuild  20 cells in the Cellular Block, Female  Prison\r\n\r\nat Changi, to provide accommodation for 20 prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt  the present moment, the female prisoners at  Moon\r\n\r\nCrescent  have only two dormitories, one for ordinary\r\n\r\nfemale  prisoners - that is those who  are  convicted\r\n\r\nprisoners, remand prisoners, aliens, etc. -  and  the\r\n\r\nother   is   for  female  political  detainees.   The\r\n\r\ndormitory  for  convicted  prisoners  has  a  maximum\r\n\r\naccommodation  of  30  persons  only,  and  that  for\r\n\r\npolitical detainees a maximum of 10 persons only. The\r\n\r\nfigure of female prisoners often exceeds this number,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  congestion. At present  there  are  35\r\n\r\nfemale   prisoners  in  the  dormitory  for  ordinary\r\n\r\nprisoners,  and  six  political  detainees   in   the\r\n\r\ndormitory for political detainees. The congestion  in\r\n\r\nthe dormitory for ordinary prisoners has been the\r\n\r\nsubject   of   comment  by  visiting   justices   who\r\n\r\nperiodically visit the female prison.\r\n\r\nIt  must be pointed out that the old female prison at\r\n\r\nOutram  Road,  which  was  demolished  in  1965,  had\r\n\r\naccommodation  for 140 female prisoners.  The  design\r\n\r\nfor  the  Cellular Block, Female Prison, will reflect\r\n\r\nan   improvement  in  prison  architecture  and  will\r\n\r\nprovide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull  security  cells to enable the prisoners  to  be\r\n\r\nsegregated if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why there is only a token vote of $10, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  because we have not had the full estimate of  how\r\n\r\nmuch it will cost to build this block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Madam\r\n\r\nChan Choy Siong ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 82 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 106.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

They will learn a\r\n\r\ntrade which will be useful to them in making a living\r\n\r\nafter  they have served their sentences.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nhave more details about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of\r\n\r\n$150,000  provided  for  in the  1969-70  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  is  for the continuation of  the  projects\r\n\r\nplanned  for,  but not completed in, 1968.  The  main\r\n\r\nprojects which the prison industries are expected  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  in  1969  are  as  follows:  purchase  of\r\n\r\nmachinery   for  the  manufacture  of  refuse   bins,\r\n\r\n$79,500; construction of a workshop to house the wood-\r\n\r\nwork  industry now under temporary roofing,  $40,000;\r\n\r\nand  the  setting  up of a new footwear  and  leather\r\n\r\nsection,  $17,500. The rest of the provision  is  for\r\n\r\nother  projects of a minor nature connected with  the\r\n\r\nfurther development of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaundry service, metal work section, printing\r\n\r\nsection, tailoring section and concrete casting\r\n\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An idea of the progress of prison industries, which\r\n\r\ncommenced  as  a  separate  organisation  under   the\r\n\r\nPrisons  Department  in 1955,  can  be  seen  in  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of workshops. When they  were\r\n\r\nfirst  started, the prison industries  had  only  six\r\n\r\nworkshops. Today there are 19 workshops catering  for\r\n\r\ntrades  ranging from laundry, woodwork, cane-work  to\r\n\r\nbakery and timber seasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the revenue earned and savings made by the\r\n\r\nprison industries had increased from $278,000 in 1956\r\n\r\nto  $701,000 in 1967 - two and a half times the  1956\r\n\r\nfigure  - it must be emphasised that revenue  is  not\r\n\r\nthe purpose for which prison industries were started.\r\n\r\nThe aim of prison industries is to give an occupation\r\n\r\nto the prisoner to help him in his rehabilitation and\r\n\r\ntrain  him  in a trade so as to enable  him  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment  on  his release. Through the  payment  of\r\n\r\nwages  at  fixed rates and industrial bonuses  commen\r\n\r\nsurate   with  their  skill  and  production  output,\r\n\r\nprisoners are encouraged to improve in the  job  they\r\n\r\ndo and strive to increase output. Under this system a\r\n\r\nprisoner can earn an average of $4 per week up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $10  per week.

Since the P.A.P. Government took  office,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  for ourselves vast areas  of  reclaimed\r\n\r\nland.  A great deal has been achieved in land reclama\r\n\r\ntion.  For example, in Jurong, we have been  able  to\r\n\r\ncut  down hills and make use of the earth to fill  up\r\n\r\nthe  sea. In order to increase the land area of Singapore,  which  is only a small island  of  224  square\r\n\r\nmiles,  we  have  to  carry out reclamation  schemes.\r\n\r\nThere  is no objection to these schemes and  I  under\r\n\r\nstand  that a great deal of money has been  spent  on\r\n\r\nreclamation  which  has been going on  satisfactorily\r\n\r\nfor  a  long period. The people of Singapore wish  to\r\n\r\nfind out whether Government has any plans for the use\r\n\r\nof  the reclaimed land and whether the projects  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  them. They are worried because a great  deal\r\n\r\nof public funds have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspent.  If the projects are beneficial to the people,\r\n\r\nthey  will be happy. And the people who are  affected\r\n\r\nby  the  land  reclamation schemes  will  not  regret\r\n\r\nhaving to move out from their places. People who  own\r\n\r\nbungalows  and  houses in the Katong  area  are  also\r\n\r\naffected  because  the value of  their  property  has\r\n\r\ndepreciated as a result of the loss of the sea front.\r\n\r\nIf   land  reclamation  can  give  the  people   more\r\n\r\nbenefits,  they  will  not  mind  making  sacrifices.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  want  the Minister to  answer  several\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the extent of land reclamation in\r\n\r\nSingapore? Secondly, has the Government any plans for\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  the land reclaimed under  the  existing\r\n\r\nschemes? Thirdly, are these reclaimed areas earmarked\r\n\r\nfor  industrial  purposes,  development  purposes  or\r\n\r\nresidential purposes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

Furthermore,   in   any\r\n\r\ndevelopment  scheme,  whether  multi-storey  flats  or\r\n\r\nfactories  are  to  be  built  in  place  of  existing\r\n\r\nbuildings,  I  would like to know  from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  preference could first be given to  residents\r\n\r\noccupying  existing buildings, and  if  the  residents\r\n\r\nrefuse  to develop their land in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  plan, then the offer  can  be  given  to\r\n\r\nother  local developers. If the other local developers\r\n\r\nare  unable to accept this offer, then it can be given\r\n\r\nto  foreign  developers. I appreciate that  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  is  needed for development, but an  opportunity\r\n\r\nshould  first  be  given  to local  developers  before\r\n\r\nforeign developers are invited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will  be futile to attract foreign capital  into\r\n\r\nthe country if our local capitalists develop projects\r\n\r\nin other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister enlighten me on whether local\r\n\r\ncapitalists  could be given preference in development\r\n\r\nprojects,  both in buildings and industries?  In  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas there are many old buildings  which  are\r\n\r\nabout  to  collapse,  but when  occupiers  apply  for\r\n\r\npermission   to   develop  and  rebuild   the   area,\r\n\r\npermission is not given. These old houses are on  Government  land  as  well as on private  land,  but  in\r\n\r\neither  case, the Government does not allow occupiers\r\n\r\nto  develop  the land nor has it any plan to  develop\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I wish to add a point about the\r\n\r\nflood  which occurred on 11th December, 1968.  Places\r\n\r\nlike  Anson  Circus,  the New Bridge  Road  area  and\r\n\r\nBernam Street were flooded, thereby causing a lot  of\r\n\r\ntrouble  to the people and traffic. I know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  trying its best  to  beat  the  flood\r\n\r\nsituation, but I hope it will increase its efforts in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon:</b> Sir, I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson   said  about  urban  renewal  is  not  exactly\r\n\r\ncorrect.  The Government, in selecting areas  for  re\r\n\r\ndevelopment, does not necessarily consider  only  the\r\n\r\nstructural condition of the buildings but also  other\r\n\r\nfactors such as general town planning and the  system\r\n\r\nof transportation. Hence, certain precincts have been\r\n\r\nmarked or mapped out for urban renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes buildings in these redeveloped areas or\r\n\r\nareas  to  be  developed are not necessarily  in  the\r\n\r\nworst condition. But, generally speaking, most of the\r\n\r\nbuildings  in  the  area  will  be  in  a  very   bad\r\n\r\ncondition. I am sure the Member understands that  the\r\n\r\npresent  urban renewal programme does not  cover  the\r\n\r\nwhole  island  of Singapore nor the whole  town,  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  are still many dilapidated  areas  which\r\n\r\nhave to remain for some time. Urban renewal is a very\r\n\r\nslow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand expensive process, and the redevelopment of these\r\n\r\ndilapidated areas must be properly phased out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's proposal that people living in a\r\n\r\nparticular area should be given the first opportunity\r\n\r\nto  rebuild on the spot, I will say that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  proposal. But, unfortunately, it does not  work\r\n\r\nout  in most cases because the financial backing that\r\n\r\nis  needed  to put up multi-storey flats is sometimes\r\n\r\ntoo  much  for one individual, and the urban  renewal\r\n\r\nexperts have had a difficult time trying to get  hold\r\n\r\nof  10 and 12 shopkeepers to combine and rebuild. But\r\n\r\nif any of them are prepared to combine and pool their\r\n\r\nresources, we always give them the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs  far as foreign participation in our urban renewal\r\n\r\nplan is concerned, we welcome foreign capital, but we\r\n\r\ndo  not give preference to foreign capital over local\r\n\r\ncapital. The Member will be pleased to hear  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  tenders of urban renewal sites  where  14\r\n\r\nsites  were  offered to the public, eight were  taken\r\n\r\nup.  Of the eight taken up, six were completely being\r\n\r\ndone  by  local capital. In two cases,  there  was  a\r\n\r\njoint  effort by local and foreign capital. What  the\r\n\r\noutcome  of the second tender system will  be,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I cannot say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more point which I have not dealt with,\r\n\r\nand that is the floods which disturbed the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson and some of his constituents a week or so  ago.\r\n\r\nI must apologise for these floods. But there is quite\r\n\r\na lot of work going on at the moment along and around\r\n\r\nOutram  Road.  There is a Housing Board complex,  new\r\n\r\ndrains are being made, and new roads are being  laid.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was a very heavy shower on  that\r\n\r\nday  and one of the drains along New Bridge Road  was\r\n\r\nblocked. As a result, the water rose. I also have  to\r\n\r\ntender my apologies to the Member for Queenstown  who\r\n\r\napparently was stuck along Outram Road. But I  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson that we will do  our  best  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  these  floods  as  far  as  possible,  but\r\n\r\nbuilding  operations somehow always  lead  to  floods\r\n\r\neven if it is for a short period of half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Farming in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nextremely  intensive and many varieties of  vegetable\r\n\r\ncrops are grown in rapid succession each year in very\r\n\r\nsmall  units. Under such a system, an efficient crop,\r\n\r\nhusbandry and farm management are of the utmost impor\r\n\r\ntance. In the intensive farm improvement schemes, the\r\n\r\nbasic objectives are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to carry out a programme of applied research\r\n\r\ninto  problems of vegetable farming with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nincreasing agricultural productivity; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to find ways of improving the fertility of swamp\r\n\r\nland reclaimed for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these objectives, three research units\r\n\r\nwill  be established: (1) a Soil and Fertiliser Unit;\r\n\r\n(2)  a  Plant  Breeding and Soil and  Seed  Selection\r\n\r\nUnit; and (3) a Pest and Disease Control Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soil and Fertiliser Unit will undertake\r\n\r\ninvestigations   into   the  feasibility   of   using\r\n\r\nreclaimed  swamp  land  for agricultural  production,\r\n\r\nsoil  improvement and deciding fertiliser regimes  to\r\n\r\nincrease production.

Member:</b> Both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps both are correct. The\r\n\r\ncultivation  of orchids, particularly the  export  of\r\n\r\ncut  orchid flowers, is contributing considerably  to\r\n\r\nthe  national economy of the Republic. Orchids  bring\r\n\r\nin  foreign  exchange.  In 1967  orchids  brought  to\r\n\r\nSingapore more than $650,000 in foreign exchange.  It\r\n\r\nis  envisaged that this figure will bc exceeded  this\r\n\r\nyear.  In fact, for the first eleven months  of  this\r\n\r\nyear, more  than  a million stalks  of  cut  flowers\r\n\r\nvalued  at  about $575,000 were exported. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  peak period of export will be December. In order\r\n\r\nto  sustain the growth of this industry and  to  keep\r\n\r\nahead  of other competing countries, like Hawaii  and\r\n\r\nSouth  Africa,  there  is need to  inject  scientific\r\n\r\nmethods into the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that, in contrast to the orchid trade,\r\n\r\nthe  stage of development in many other horticultural\r\n\r\ncrops  is  far behind, for instance, the  growing  of\r\n\r\nfruits. We import more than 95 per cent of the fruits\r\n\r\nconsumed in Singapore. We have encouraged farmers  to\r\n\r\ngrow orchids. Some have done it with success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  success with orchid means that they abandon  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  of  vegetables. I hope  that  satisfies  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Ho Swee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu was a little concerned\r\n\r\nthat  we  put our efforts into helping orchid growers\r\n\r\nbut  do  nothing for the farmers who  rear  pigs  and\r\n\r\nchickens. I can assure him that this is not the case.\r\n\r\nWe have been helping farmers much longer than we have\r\n\r\nbeen helping orchid growers. In fact, the Member will\r\n\r\nbe  interested to know that we have about one million\r\n\r\npigs in Singapore. This means we have one pig for two\r\n\r\npersons.  One  million pigs on this small  island  is\r\n\r\nquite a big number. We have millions of chickens.  We\r\n\r\nexport  chickens and eggs. But I am  ashamed  to  say\r\n\r\nthat we import three-quarters of our requirements  of\r\n\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own view is that, had it not been for the efforts\r\n\r\nof the Primary Production Department about a year ago\r\n\r\nwhen  the swine fever epidemic was at its height,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  lost  most  of  our  pigs.  The  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department sends out teams every  day  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  Jalan Kayu but also to Jurong. These  teams\r\n\r\nhelp  the farmers not only in respect of disease  but\r\n\r\nalso provide them with better stock. This is what the\r\n\r\nSembawang Research Station does. They rear  pigs  and\r\n\r\nsell  stud  boars to the farmers. I do not  think  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  right  to say that the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  concentrating on orchid  growers  and\r\n\r\nforgetting the farmers who rear pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  was  saying  was that the export  facilities\r\n\r\nmight  well  be inadequate. As the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment   steps   up   its   extension   services,\r\n\r\nproductivity  goes up. We are going to  produce  more\r\n\r\nand  more pigs. But the existing marketing facilities\r\n\r\nmight  well  be insufficient and we might finish  off\r\n\r\nwith  far too many pigs here. As a result, the  price\r\n\r\nis  bound to go down.

But at the\r\n\r\nmoment there is no organisation as far as the sale or\r\n\r\nexport  of pigs is concerned. The export of pigs  was\r\n\r\nsuspended for some time because of the swine fever in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the export of chickens and eggs, there have\r\n\r\nbeen efforts by the Primary Production Department  to\r\n\r\nhelp  farmers export eggs. The trouble is  that  some\r\n\r\nfarmers have cheated the importers. When you  have  a\r\n\r\ncombined  effort at exporting eggs, one  must  assure\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  importer that the eggs  are  good.  The\r\n\r\nexperience  of the Primary Production Department  has\r\n\r\nbeen  that one or two rogues or scallywags  have  put\r\n\r\nbad  eggs  into the boxes, with the result  that  the\r\n\r\nimporter   abroad  was  not  interested  further   in\r\n\r\nimporting  from Singapore. But we have got over  that\r\n\r\nphase.  I  can  assure the Member that  whenever  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  eggs goes down, I have to answer questions\r\n\r\nin  Parliament why we do not organise things  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  producers of eggs so that they can export  them.\r\n\r\nAnd  when the price of eggs goes up, I have to answer\r\n\r\nquestions  in  Parliament  why  I  do  not  help  the\r\n\r\nconsumers in getting the price of eggs down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 206.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our stringent financial policy for\r\n\r\n1969, it is gratifying and encouraging to note that a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  sum of $250,000 is being set  aside  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of conducting an agricultural survey and\r\n\r\nin the setting up of an Agricultural Statistics Unit.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose of my moving the amendment  is  to  seek\r\n\r\ninformation relating to the formation of the proposed\r\n\r\nAgricultural  Statistics  Unit.

The  modest\r\n\r\nachievement  in  intensive  agriculture  and   animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry in recent years demonstrates that intensive\r\n\r\nfarming  can  play  some part in  our  economic  deve\r\n\r\nlopment  and, with proper planning, it can supplement\r\n\r\nconsiderably our efforts in industrialisation and the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of trade and services. However, in  order\r\n\r\nto   formulate   any  plans,  much   more   essential\r\n\r\ninformation on agriculture and animal husbandry  than\r\n\r\nthe  present scanty information we have is  required.\r\n\r\nIt  is  proposed to set up an Agricultural Statistics\r\n\r\nUnit  in the Primary Production Department to collect\r\n\r\ndata for the purpose of formulating plans for agricultural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, it is also proposed to conduct a nation-wide agricultural census apart from the licensing of\r\n\r\nall  farmers engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry\r\n\r\nand fisheries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed unit will be manned by highly qualified\r\n\r\npersonnel  with  academic and practical  training  in\r\n\r\nstatistical work. It will be responsible for planning\r\n\r\nand  conducting  the  census,  sampling  surveys  and\r\n\r\nmarket  research  on all aspects of animal,  fishery,\r\n\r\nvegetable and horticultural production in the island.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing the personnel, I will bear in mind  the\r\n\r\nremarks of the Member for Jalan Kayu. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nation-wide\r\n\r\nfarm  licensing  campaign, which  was  launched   in\r\n\r\nOctober  this  year, provided reliable and  essential\r\n\r\ninformation on the existing structure of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe  campaign  has  also enabled us  to  ensure  more\r\n\r\neffective use of limited land resources for farming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes.

We  are\r\n\r\naware that flooding is a serious problem in the Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  area  and in my constituency.  The  people  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas have suffered great hardship.  Sometimes\r\n\r\nthey  are unable to sleep at night because they  fear\r\n\r\nthat they might be caught unawares by flooding. There\r\n\r\nfore,  I urge the Minister to provide funds for flood\r\n\r\nalleviation schemes and to instruct the Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  redouble their  efforts.  The  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nshould either raise the road level\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  deepen the drains in order to alleviate flooding.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, the monsoon drains in the Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nRoad  and Holland Road areas should be deepened. Only\r\n\r\nthen  will the people in my constituency be safe from\r\n\r\nflooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our country is said to be well known for its\r\n\r\nwide  and  clean roads. But in the Bukit Timah  area,\r\n\r\nflooding  takes place quite often. Malaysians  coming\r\n\r\ndown  from  West Malaysia are inconvenienced  because\r\n\r\nthey  make  frequent  use of Bukit  Timah  Road.  Our\r\n\r\nMinister  also goes that way quite often  because  he\r\n\r\nlives  in  my  constituency. I am sure he  knows  the\r\n\r\nsituation  quite well. I therefore urge  him  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I answer the\r\n\r\nMember  for Ulu Pandan first and then get on  to  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  subject of hydroponics. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure him that I am paying attention to the question\r\n\r\nof  flooding,  and  I  have paid  attention  to  this\r\n\r\nquestion  ever  since September 1963. When  there  is\r\n\r\nheavy   rain  which  coincides  with  a  high   tide,\r\n\r\nespecially  a  high spring tide in  Singapore,  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah gets flooded, which means the constituencies of\r\n\r\nTanglin  and Ulu Pandan get flooded. And  I  have  to\r\n\r\nrescue  my  constituents,  just  as  the  Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament for Ulu Pandan has to rescue his. We  have\r\n\r\ntaken  measures  to alleviate, if not eradicate,  the\r\n\r\nfloods. Bukit Timah has been raised in parts by about\r\n\r\none  and  a  half to two feet. But this is  not  good\r\n\r\nenough.  We are cutting two canals in this  area  and\r\n\r\none  in  the Member's constituency itself. One  canal\r\n\r\nwill  be cut from Bukit Timah Road to Ulu Pandan  and\r\n\r\nanother  canal from Bukit Timah Road to Kallang.  The\r\n\r\nobject  of  these  two canals is to drain  the  flood\r\n\r\nwaters  to Ulu Pandan and to the Kallang swamps.  The\r\n\r\nMember  will realise that the cutting of these canals\r\n\r\nis  quite  a  big  matter. If he goes  round  to  his\r\n\r\nconstituency,  he  will  see the  construction  of  a\r\n\r\ncanal.  That is quite a big job. In fact,  there  are\r\n\r\nseveral\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontractors with different contracts doing  the  work\r\n\r\nin several parts. But I am afraid we will have to put\r\n\r\nup  with  the floods next year. By 1970, both  canals\r\n\r\nwill have been completed and the floods in Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nwill be alleviated, if not eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can go on to hydroponics, I confess I too know\r\n\r\nlittle  about  this  subject. I am  told  hydroponics\r\n\r\nmeans  soilless culture or the art of growing  plants\r\n\r\nwithout  soil  in  water impregnated with  chemicals.\r\n\r\nHydroponics has been employed in the study  of  plant\r\n\r\nphysiology  for many years and has been adopted  more\r\n\r\nrecently by commercial and amateur growers as a means\r\n\r\nof  producing  crops of high yields  and  quality  at\r\n\r\nlower  cost.  It  has been successfully  experimented\r\n\r\nwith   in  growing  all  kinds  of  vegetable  crops,\r\n\r\nparticularly in Israel, Japan and South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the experts, hydroponics has the\r\n\r\nfollowing  advantages. Higher yields than  in  normal\r\n\r\nfarming due to better nutrient and water control.  In\r\n\r\nSouth  Africa,  apparently, yields of over  20  times\r\n\r\nthose obtained in ordinary soil have been obtained in\r\n\r\nvermiculite  culture.  Less labour  is  required.  In\r\n\r\nJapan, for example, the labour required is only  half\r\n\r\nof  that of normal farming. Secondly, less wastage of\r\n\r\nwater  and  fertilisers and freedom  from  soil-borne\r\n\r\ndiseases.  Further, hydroponics is  not  affected  by\r\n\r\nsoil conditions and any land, whether eroded or hilly\r\n\r\nor  tidal  swamp unsuited to normal farming,  can  be\r\n\r\nused in the hydroponics system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hydroponics project requires the construction of\r\n\r\nconcrete   tanks   or  other  types  of   structures,\r\n\r\nirrigation and feeding systems, shade and, of course,\r\n\r\noffices-cum-store  rooms. Laboratory  facilities  for\r\n\r\nchemical  analysis must also be available. These  are\r\n\r\nbeing  set  up in the Sembawang Research Station  for\r\n\r\nwhich a sum of $50,000 is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due course, it is hoped that if the research\r\n\r\nsucceeds, what is learnt at the Research Station will\r\n\r\nbe  communicated  to our farmers  in  the  hope  that\r\n\r\nproduction  in Singapore can be increased  with  less\r\n\r\nlabour and cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his most interesting lecture and I beg\r\n\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,547,780 for Head 93 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 95 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr L.\r\n\r\nP.

The  Minister  for  Law   and\r\n\r\nNational  Development  again  told  the  House   that\r\n\r\nseveral major as well as minor schemes to offer  both\r\n\r\nsimple and sophisticated seaside facilities had  been\r\n\r\nprepared    and    the   Government   had    accepted\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  assist  with  the  infrastructure\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  make these schemes possible.  He  then\r\n\r\nassured  the  House that 1968 would see  cleaner  and\r\n\r\nmore  attractive beaches. His statement can be  found\r\n\r\nin  Hansard, No. 14 of Volume 26, column  966,  dated\r\n\r\n20th December, 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Development Estimates for 1969-70 now under discussion, you will find that this item comes under the Ministry of Health and the same amount is revoted for the third time. The responsibility to develop and improve our beaches has changed hands two times -- from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs to the Ministry of Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and now to the Ministry of Health. What I\r\n\r\ndo  not understand, Sir, is that why, during a  lapse\r\n\r\nof  two  years, no beach resorts have been  developed\r\n\r\naccording to plan. Is this project considered  to  be\r\n\r\nof low priority as compared with other projects? Sir,\r\n\r\nI can predict that no development will take place now\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Health is in  charge  of  this\r\n\r\nproject.  Surely  the Public Health Division  is  not\r\n\r\nexpected  to develop the beaches except to clean  and\r\n\r\ntidy them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to give his comments\r\n\r\non this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten is correct in saying that the  \"buck\"  is\r\n\r\nnow  with the Ministry of Health. We have taken  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility, but solely to keep the beaches clean.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as this subhead is concerned, it has nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with  building  or improving  beach  resorts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  I  may take this opportunity  to  give  some\r\n\r\nfacts  to  the Member for Mountbatten.  They  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board, which since last year\r\n\r\nhas   been   charged  with  the  responsibility   for\r\n\r\nimprovement of beaches, let out on contract in  March\r\n\r\nthis year the work of cleaning the beaches at Changi,\r\n\r\nLoyang  and  Pasir Ris in Singapore island,  and  the\r\n\r\nbeaches in 12 smaller islands around Singapore.  This\r\n\r\ncontract  is  still in force and will continue  until\r\n\r\nMarch  1969.  In  November, the Ministry  of  Health,\r\n\r\nafter consultation with the Ministry of Finance,  was\r\n\r\ncharged  with  the responsibility for  cleansing  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of these beaches. The present  contract,\r\n\r\nwhich will be allowed to run its full term till March\r\n\r\n1969,  essentially covers only, as I have  said,  the\r\n\r\ncleansing  and  maintenance aspects of beach  improve\r\n\r\nment in the areas referred to, which include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) clearing and cleansing of beaches and the\r\n\r\nbeach area;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) clearing and cleansing of parks and open\r\n\r\nspaces used for rest and recreation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) cutting grass, trimming trees, shrubs and\r\n\r\nhedges;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) removal of refuse from dustbins placed on\r\n\r\nthe  beaches  and  in the islands  in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nkampongs off Changi beach;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) cleaning of all lavatories, bathrooms and\r\n\r\nmaintaining these in a sanitary condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately half of this vote, that is, $48,500 is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  spent this year  to  reimburse  the\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion Board for the sum it has paid  out\r\n\r\nto  the contractor since March this year. The balance\r\n\r\nwill be available for use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1969 and it will be utilised essentially for  the\r\n\r\nsame  purpose,  that  is, cleansing  and  maintaining\r\n\r\nthese  beaches. Fresh tenders will be called in March\r\n\r\n1969  on  expiry  of  the present contract.  This  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be more economical and  operationally\r\n\r\nmore   feasible  than  undertaking  the   task   with\r\n\r\ndepartmental labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of other developments of the\r\n\r\nbeaches, such as the construction of beach resorts  -\r\n\r\nas   stated  by  the  Member  for  Mountbatten - this\r\n\r\nresponsibility will not devolve upon the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.  It is, however, understood that there  is  a\r\n\r\nFacilitations  Committee  comprising  representatives\r\n\r\nfrom   various  Government  authorities   under   the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of  the  Chairman,  Tourist   Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard,  which is making recommendations to the  Board\r\n\r\non  schemes for developing and improving beaches  and\r\n\r\nbeach resorts. It is further understood that a number\r\n\r\nof  such  schemes  have  been  submitted  by  various\r\n\r\ninterested  parties  and that  these  are  now  being\r\n\r\nconsidered  by  the  Board. This is  the  information\r\n\r\nwhich  I have got with the compliments of the Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as our responsibility is\r\n\r\nconcerned in respect of keeping the beaches clean,  \r\n\r\nI assure  the Member for Mountbatten that they will  \r\n\r\nbe kept clean.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\ninformation.
