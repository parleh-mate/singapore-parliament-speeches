For working people, they are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  keeping  their  jobs.   For  retrenched\r\n\r\npeople,  they are searching high and low for a job.   For\r\n\r\nyoung  people, they are worried about whether  there  are\r\n\r\nvacancies  for them after 12 or more years in  our  rigid\r\n\r\nand rigorous education system.  Furthermore, as the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was quoted recently in the papers, the  outlook\r\n\r\nis  not  getting any better any time soon.  The worse  is\r\n\r\nyet to come.  As a result, the confidence of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nabout  our economy has reached a bottom unprecedented  in\r\n\r\nrecent years.  Confidence in the PAP leadership's ability\r\n\r\nto  lead  us  through  this downturn, especially  amongst\r\n\r\nthose   in   the   category   of   so-called   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment, is also diminishing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On job creation and confidence, the Budget Statement\r\n\r\ndid  not  take  the  opportunity to  address  them  in  a\r\n\r\nsufficiently strong and forceful manner to make an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact.   To me, Sir, it is basically a response  to  the\r\n\r\nERC Report issued on 7th February.  True, more than 1,000\r\n\r\npeople,  amongst them some of the brightest and the  best\r\n\r\nSingapore has to offer, have contributed their ideas  and\r\n\r\nenergies   to  the  deliberations  of  the  ERC   Report.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gestation period of the Report is one  year,\r\n\r\nwhich  is,  indeed, a very long time -  one  year  during\r\n\r\nwhich   the   Government  has  ample  time  to  formulate\r\n\r\nresponses to some of those recommendations, many of which\r\n\r\nare not new, as Mr Khaw pointed out to us yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those hoping that this Budget will provide some\r\n\r\nmagic  prescriptions to bring us out  of  the  recession,\r\n\r\nthey  are  disappointed at the lack of any  major  policy\r\n\r\nannouncements or bold moves.  Mr Inderjit Singh expressed\r\n\r\nthis sentiment in his trademark way very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the key thread that runs through\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  Report  is  the  lack  of  entrepreneurship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   There  are  many  recommendations  to   make\r\n\r\nSingapore  society more entrepreneurial.  It is important\r\n\r\nenough for the Government to appoint Mr Raymond Lim to be\r\n\r\nthe  Minister-in-charge.  Sir, we do not envy Mr  Lim  in\r\n\r\nhis  new job as he has the most unenviable task.  How  to\r\n\r\nconvert  a  nation  of  salary earners  to  a  nation  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs?   He recognised that our education  system\r\n\r\nis  not  geared to provide creativity and mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthe  school system is being changed to cater to this  new\r\n\r\nrequirement.   Even  if  we do everything  right  in  the\r\n\r\nschools,  how  long would it take us  to  turn  the  ship\r\n\r\naround?   How  about all those who have left  the  school\r\n\r\nsystem  and  have already joined the workforce?   It  is,\r\n\r\nindeed,  a Herculean task.  Furthermore, it is not  clear\r\n\r\nwhat are Mr Lim's powers to make changes and what are his\r\n\r\nmeasures  of success.  Perhaps Mr Lim could find  another\r\n\r\nopportunity to clarify these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we were to depend on new entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nto  help us in the short term, especially in the area  of\r\n\r\nunemployment, our hope would be misguided.   The  problem\r\n\r\nis a big one.  Let us look at some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnumbers.   We  have  close to 80,000 unemployed.   If  we\r\n\r\nassume  that every new start-up would employ 10  persons,\r\n\r\nwe  would  need 8,000 new start-ups.  Since  the  success\r\n\r\nrate of new start-ups is not very high, the number of new\r\n\r\nenterprises in order to address this problem  would  have\r\n\r\nto  be  in  the tens of thousands.  From the Registry  of\r\n\r\nCompanies' records, we can clearly see that new companies\r\n\r\nare  not being formed fast enough, and we are years  away\r\n\r\nfrom  making a dent in the problem if we were  to  depend\r\n\r\nsolely on new start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly we have to find some alternative means,\r\n\r\neven  if  they were the old and outmoded means to address\r\n\r\nthe unemployment situation.  Singaporeans are so used  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government's ability to tackle the problems at  hand\r\n\r\nand  to make some policy changes and, presto! - we  would\r\n\r\nbe  back  on  the normal growth path within a very  short\r\n\r\nperiod of time.  So much so that we in Government believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government holds the key to job  creation  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  of our nation.  That is also why  our  people\r\n\r\naccept  the  salaries of our Ministers and  senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants to be pegged to the private sector.  That is why\r\n\r\nwe have the best paid Cabinet in the world.  But based on\r\n\r\nthis Budget Statement, there is indeed a mismatch between\r\n\r\nour   people's  expectations  and  the  ability  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to deliver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, Sir, the Feedback Unit conducts dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions prior to the Budget day.  Unlike previous years,\r\n\r\nparticipants  in  our dialogues did  not  have  many  new\r\n\r\nideas.   Perhaps  all  the new ideas  have  already  been\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  the  ERC.  In a fact sheet  given  to  the\r\n\r\nparticipants  as pre-reading, we asked a  question:  what\r\n\r\nwould  you do if you were the Finance Minister?   Perhaps\r\n\r\nit  was  a  wrong  way  to  prepare  the  audience.   The\r\n\r\nresponses  we  got  could  be  summarised  in  this   one\r\n\r\nstatement:  \"If the doctor does not know how to treat the\r\n\r\npatient, it is time to change the doctor.\"  In short, our\r\n\r\npeople  are  depending on the Finance  Minister  to  pull\r\n\r\nrabbits  out of the hat.  However, on one issue, which  I\r\n\r\nthink we have unanimous conclusion, and that is, everyone\r\n\r\nfelt strongly that the Government should not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplan  for  a  budget surplus in this  fiscal  year.   The\r\n\r\nground  reaction would have been extremely  negative  had\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  presented  a  conservative  budget   with\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  Now that the Budget is a deficit one,  people\r\n\r\nare  more relieved.  On the other hand, some have pointed\r\n\r\nout  that we could have even a bigger deficit.  Mr  Leong\r\n\r\nHorn  Kee had brought this up yesterday.  But I think  we\r\n\r\nall know that we cannot spend our way out of a recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we can ask: why would the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister present a budget in this way?  This is the first\r\n\r\nbudget he presented after chairing the ERC.  Had it  been\r\n\r\npossible,  he  would probably like to  make  this  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  a  dramatic one.  If it had been  possible  to\r\n\r\nturn  the  economy around by one simple Budget Statement,\r\n\r\nhe  would  have  then left an indelible  imprint  on  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  The bond between the new generation  leaders\r\n\r\nand the younger generation of Singaporeans would then  be\r\n\r\ncemented.   Thus,  the  lack of  new  measures  providing\r\n\r\nimmediate  relief in the Budget speaks volumes about  the\r\n\r\nchallenges facing us.  It should be clear that there  are\r\n\r\nno   quick  fixes.   This  should  be  humbling  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to realise that when the tide is against  us,\r\n\r\neven  the  best Cabinet in the world could not  buck  the\r\n\r\ntrend.   On  the  other hand, I must give credit  to  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister for not adopting  any  quick  fix\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  would dig us deeper into the  hole,  from\r\n\r\nwhich  we would then have to work harder to climb out  of\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Government must take charge in\r\n\r\nleading  our  people out of the current depression,  both\r\n\r\nwith regard to the economy and also the confidence of our\r\n\r\npeople.  Government is the only institute we have that is\r\n\r\nable  and  could do the task.  Mr Khaw has  spoken  about\r\n\r\ncomplacency yesterday.  He warned that we would fail as a\r\n\r\nnation  if  we were complacent.  I would go even  further\r\n\r\nand  say  that we fail if the Government does not,  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  rise  to  the occasion.  However,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\npursued  the  same formulae of success for so  long  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  our  mindsets  and  institutions  might  not  be\r\n\r\nsuitable  or appropriate to deal with the new  challenges\r\n\r\nfacing us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaving no stone unturned, we could draw some\r\n\r\nlessons on how successful MNCs react to a changing world.\r\n\r\nOr   rather   we  can  learn  more  lessons  from   those\r\n\r\noutstanding companies that failed to respond to  changes.\r\n\r\nIt is true that if we look at the corporate records, some\r\n\r\nof  best companies in the world languish when the  market\r\n\r\nchanges.   Why?   It is not that the management  did  not\r\n\r\nforesee  the  challenges.  It is not that the  management\r\n\r\ndid  not  formulate  the  proper response.   They  failed\r\n\r\nbecause  they continued to carry out the counter-measures\r\n\r\nusing  the  organisational structures and  the  processes\r\n\r\nthat  had  worked in the past.  They failed because  they\r\n\r\ndid    not   question   whether   those   processes   and\r\n\r\norganisations   will  continue  to  work   in   the   new\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Indeed, some of them went into  overdrive,\r\n\r\nlaunching  programme  after  programme  to  check   their\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  I think, as a government, we have to  avoid\r\n\r\nsimilar  pitfalls.   We should relook at  all  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments,  agencies, both regulatory  and  promotional\r\n\r\nones, to see what needs to be refocused and what needs to\r\n\r\nbe  restructured.   We should go beyond fashionable  name\r\n\r\nchanges such as A*Star, SPRING, and IES - with the result\r\n\r\nthat  nowadays people find it difficult to even  remember\r\n\r\nwhat they stand for.  Again, in the spirit of leaving  no\r\n\r\nstone   unturned,   I   suggest   that   the   Government\r\n\r\nadministration,  in  general, should  ask  the  following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether strategic frames that have helped us\r\n\r\nto  succeed  in  the  past have  become  blinders?   Such\r\n\r\nparadigms shape how policymakers view the world and allow\r\n\r\nus  to make quick policy decisions.  The same frames  can\r\n\r\nalso blind us to emerging threats and opportunities.  One\r\n\r\nexample I would like to give here is our land use policy.\r\n\r\nIn  the  boom time, the Government adopted the policy  of\r\n\r\nassigning  a  value  to  every piece  of  land  based  on\r\n\r\nalternative use.  Doing so seems logical when  such  land\r\n\r\ncould be converted to residential use, for instance.  But\r\n\r\nadopting   this   policy  universally  means   that   our\r\n\r\ninfrastructures, such as power generating plants, have to\r\n\r\npay  high  land use fees.  Our port authority,  the  PSA,\r\n\r\nalso  has to pay high land use fees.  We did not  foresee\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemerging threat of Tanjung Pelepas where the operator  is\r\n\r\ngiven effectively free land by the government.  While  it\r\n\r\nwould  seem that it was the PSA management that lost  its\r\n\r\ntwo  top customers, ultimately, I think, it is still  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's land use policy that drives up the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing business for PSA.  Recognising this, the ERC Report\r\n\r\nhas  proposed the concept of competitive factor  pricing,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been accepted in principle by the Government,\r\n\r\nand  we  look  forward to the detailed implementation  of\r\n\r\nsuch a policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question we should ask is whether proven\r\n\r\nprocesses  have hardened into routines.  We  are  getting\r\n\r\ninfamous  for  Government  rules  and  regulations.    Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond Lim had already addressed this and he proposed to\r\n\r\ntime-stamp  every rule in the Government.  I think  also,\r\n\r\nin  this  respect,  we should ask ourselves  whether  our\r\n\r\nMinistries  and agencies are fortresses onto  themselves.\r\n\r\nHas  the division of labour become so clear that what  is\r\n\r\nundefined  is  left unattended in the no-man  land?   For\r\n\r\ninstance, let us ask the question: how could we help  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers?  MOM's response would be  coming  up\r\n\r\nwith  programmes  for  retraining and  upgrading.   MTI's\r\n\r\nresponse  would  be looking for more investments.   EDB's\r\n\r\nresponse  would  be  life sciences.  The  ERC's  response\r\n\r\nwould  be  to  create more entrepreneurs.  But  who  will\r\n\r\nreally  help the unemployed to help themselves?  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  question is left unanswered.  In the South West CDC,\r\n\r\nMayor  Yu-Foo has been trying to create a people's market\r\n\r\nwhere  the  unemployed could somehow become self-reliant.\r\n\r\nBut the problems she encountered are indeed monumental.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question we should ask ourselves is\r\n\r\nwhether  values, that we have, have hardened into dogmas.\r\n\r\nIt  is true that our values inspire and unify our people.\r\n\r\nHowever,  they  too can harden into rigid, self-defeating\r\n\r\npolicies.    For  instance,  the  HDB's  housing   policy\r\n\r\nprovides  two  bites  of the cherry for  every  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen.  However, by pursuing it without putting on  our\r\n\r\nthinking hat, the Government is today left with a backlog\r\n\r\nof thousands of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunsold flats.  This brought the building programme of HDB\r\n\r\nto  a  halt.   The  building contractors that  have  been\r\n\r\ndependent on HDB's building programme are all now  facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  some  are facing  bankruptcy.   The  other\r\n\r\nexample is the CPF contribution rates.  On the one  hand,\r\n\r\nwe  say that CPF should return to the basics of providing\r\n\r\nfor  retirement.  On the other hand, we somehow  convince\r\n\r\nourselves that the proper CPF total contribution rate  is\r\n\r\n40%.   So, when the economy turns around, we pledge  that\r\n\r\nwe  should restore that number to 40%.  Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\npointed   out  yesterday  that  such  a  policy   creates\r\n\r\nuncertainties  with regard to the cost of doing  business\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only the promotional agencies, such as\r\n\r\nEDB, JTC, IES and STB, that should subject themselves  to\r\n\r\nthis  particular  review by asking themselves  the  three\r\n\r\nquestions  I  have  proposed.   I  have  also   in   mind\r\n\r\nregulatory   agencies,   such   as   Immigration,    Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment,  URA,  etc.  In fact,  one  of  my  favourite\r\n\r\ngripes  is the hurdle imposed by immigration on  visitors\r\n\r\nfrom  emerging countries, like India and China.  It might\r\n\r\nhave  been  true  that, in the past, many  visitors  from\r\n\r\nthese  countries ended up as over-stayers.  But to  treat\r\n\r\nevery applicant from these countries who visits Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  potential  over-stayer would indeed  deprive  many\r\n\r\nbusiness   opportunities  for   tourism   and   education\r\n\r\nenterprises in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the changes that we propose\r\n\r\nwill involve pain.  When the Government promises that  no\r\n\r\nstone  will  be left unturned, no one expected  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will respond to some of the worms under  those\r\n\r\nstones by restructuring the Government agencies, such  as\r\n\r\nPSA  and  HDB,  through  massive  retrenchment  or  early\r\n\r\nunemployment.    While  shedding  surplus   manpower   is\r\n\r\noftentimes the right approach, making jobs redundant,  in\r\n\r\nparticular by the Government, should be the last resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a job is more than just a person receiving a\r\n\r\npay  cheque.  A job indeed defines the role of the person\r\n\r\nin  society.   It gives the person respect  and  dignity.\r\n\r\nOften times, the workers are not at fault.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAgain,  let us come back to the case of PSA.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  that  lost  the  top  two  customers  through\r\n\r\ninflexibility  or insensitivity.  However,  if  you  look\r\n\r\nfurther,  as  I  said earlier, it is also the  Government\r\n\r\nland  use policy that saddles PSA with a burdensome  land\r\n\r\ncost that PSA must recover from its customers.  Thus, the\r\n\r\nGovernment is ultimately responsible for PSA's  troubles.\r\n\r\nExtending  this idea to all businesses, it is also  clear\r\n\r\nthat  Government land use policy has played a major  role\r\n\r\nin  bringing  us to our current difficulties.   Only  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  unwind  the situation  that  we  found\r\n\r\nourselves in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my comments, I\r\n\r\nfound  the  Budget indeed to be a very carefully  crafted\r\n\r\none,  balancing the short term needs as well as the  long\r\n\r\nterm  goals  of  our  country.  It is  a  deficit  budget\r\n\r\ndesigned   to  maintain  Government  expenditure   in   a\r\n\r\nshrinking  economy.   It maintains the  support  for  the\r\n\r\nlower  income groups.  And furthermore, the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has been bold to introduce several new measures,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  tax  exemption for foreign-sourced  income  and\r\n\r\ninterest on local bank deposits.  The first exemption has\r\n\r\nbeen  proposed  repeatedly in the past by  Feedback  Unit\r\n\r\nparticipants.  I am indeed very glad that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas finally agreed to this suggestion.  The tax exemption\r\n\r\non  interest  on  local  bank deposits  is  indeed  quite\r\n\r\nunexpected.  It is indeed quite uncommon in this world to\r\n\r\nfind  a  government that is prepared to exempt  taxes  on\r\n\r\ninterest  from savings account.  I believe this exemption\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to promote the habit of saving  and  will\r\n\r\nprovide  great  relief to our retirees  who  are  largely\r\n\r\ndependent   on   their  savings  to  see   them   through\r\n\r\nretirement.  I would like to thank the Minister on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the prescription of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  our  economy  reminds  me of  the  approach  between\r\n\r\nwestern  medicine and herbal medicine.  Western  medicine\r\n\r\nprovides  quick  and effective relief but  sometimes  has\r\n\r\nsevere  side effects.  On the other hand, herbal medicine\r\n\r\nmust  be  taken  over a long time.  It  is  also  a  more\r\n\r\nholistic approach that probably would bring about  better\r\n\r\nlong term health.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have been expecting western medicine in this\r\n\r\nBudget,  but the Minister has prescribed herbal medicine.\r\n\r\nIt  would have been ideal if the Minister could prescribe\r\n\r\na  blend of western and herbal medicines so that we would\r\n\r\nhave the best of both worlds from both practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our economy is indeed in\r\n\r\ntransition.   As  Mr  Raymond  Lim  pointed  out,  in   a\r\n\r\nknowledge era, those resource-endowed countries  are  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  those that would emerge as  winners.   Often\r\n\r\ntimes,  the  resource-deprived countries are  those  that\r\n\r\nwould vault ahead of the others.  In this respect,  I  am\r\n\r\nreminded  of  the  analogy of the evolution  of  species.\r\n\r\nSpecies  evolved from a small population are  subject  to\r\n\r\nrapid  and severe change in the environment.  The  weaker\r\n\r\nones  are  eliminated and only those who can adapt  would\r\n\r\nsurvive.    Our   economy  is  now  subject   to   severe\r\n\r\nchallenges.   Elimination  of  the  weaker  companies  is\r\n\r\npainful but necessary.  Sir, I believe that so long as we\r\n\r\ntake  care  to  maintain social cohesion through  helping\r\n\r\nthose  unfortunate  amongst  us,  Singapore  will  emerge\r\n\r\nstronger and fitter at the end of this journey.  I  thank\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  a thoughtful Budget  that  strikes  a\r\n\r\nbalance between the diverse needs of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in his name.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I be allowed to make a clarification on what I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday in respect of the cost of the bypass operation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Provided it is a clarification and no\r\n\r\ndebate.

Both operations were done in\r\n\r\n1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have checked with NUH this morning that, for\r\n\r\na  C class patient in NUH who has undergone a bypass, the\r\n\r\nestimated  cost is about S$3,500 and the  stay  is  about\r\n\r\nseven  days.   So  even  if  we  compare  hospital   with\r\n\r\nhospital, Singapore's cost is more than ten times that of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Finance Minister labelled this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget  as  \"Seizing  Opportunity in  Uncertainty\".   The\r\n\r\nheadline  caption in the Lianhe Zaobao  described  it  as\r\n\r\n\"Relieving   current   concerns   to   build    long-term\r\n\r\nadvantage\".  But, to the general public, this is a budget\r\n\r\nthat  cares  not  for the predicament of the  people  and\r\n\r\noffers no help to them at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ordinary people, the utilities, SC&CC rebates\r\n\r\nare  merely  some meagre favours.  At the time  when  the\r\n\r\neconomic growth was good, and the Government  accumulated\r\n\r\nhuge  surpluses,  they gave just a  little  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nrebates,  and  glorified  them  by   declaring  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was sharing the wealth with the people. Today,\r\n\r\nwith  an  unemployment rate as high as  4.5%,  and  still\r\n\r\nmounting continuously, the rebates remain the same.  Take\r\n\r\nthe  utilities rebate as an example.  In the 1996 Budget,\r\n\r\nthe utilities rebate amounted to $73 million.  This year,\r\n\r\nwith a situation where  retrenchments are escalating, and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are lucky enough to keep their  jobs  get  no\r\n\r\nbonus  and even suffer a pay cut, the rebates package  is\r\n\r\n$71  million.  Not only has it not been increased, it  is\r\n\r\nactually reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that the present economic\r\n\r\ndifficulty has not bottomed out yet and that we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared for  the worst to come. In his Budget Statement,\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister urged our people to help one another\r\n\r\nand put in concerted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nefforts  to pull through the difficult times. But  having\r\n\r\nsaid that, does the Minister lead by extending his nimble\r\n\r\nand  agile  hand  to prevent those who were falling  from\r\n\r\ndropping  into  the  water, or pull  out  those  who  are\r\n\r\nalready  in  the water and drowning? Absolutely  NO,  the\r\n\r\nMinister is merely stretching his fingers at his original\r\n\r\nposition.   These  utilities rebates and SC&CC  exemption\r\n\r\ncannot  effectively relieve the anxiety.  As it was  said\r\n\r\nby    an  economist,  the short-term rebates  are  indeed\r\n\r\nlacking in bearing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister for Finance may say proudly\r\n\r\nthat    he   had   issued  to  our  people  the  Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares, and two-thirds of the  shareholders\r\n\r\nhave  already cashed out their shares.  But we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that  the  ERS are only given as a sugar  coating\r\n\r\nover  the poison of increasing the GST.  With higher GST,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  pay more tax each day, be  it  at  the  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets,  supermarkets,  hospitals  or  on  the  road.  .\r\n\r\nThree years down the road, I am sure that there would not\r\n\r\nbe  any  more  ERS  to be issued. Will the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   lift the GST then?  Surely not!   We  may  even\r\n\r\nexpect a heavier GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister may say that one cannot make\r\n\r\nbricks  without straw. There is no growth in our economy,\r\n\r\nthe Government's revenue is reduced. All that can be done\r\n\r\nhas  already  been done. But I am sure the  hand  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister is certainly more nimble and agile  than\r\n\r\nthose  of  the families where the breadwinners have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs, and  those who are struggling for  survival.\r\n\r\nThe  PAP  Ministers are well known for their  ability  to\r\n\r\ncreate wealth and preparing for the rainy days. Now  that\r\n\r\nthe rain has come, if the Finance Minister is sympathetic\r\n\r\nto the people on their present predicament, surely he can\r\n\r\nbring  the  initiative of his wisdom and creativity  into\r\n\r\nfull play and do more for the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that he was afraid that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   various rebates given to help  the  people\r\n\r\nlighten  their  financial burden may be habitually  taken\r\n\r\nfor  granted  by the people. The people's dependency   on\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  only causes him to be worried, but also to feel that\r\n\r\nit  is  dangerous.  He sincerely and earnestly urged  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  move away from the dependency mentality,  and\r\n\r\nmake  every  attempt  to   resolve  their  own  problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wish to remind the Government that when we see\r\n\r\na  80-year-old granny bending her fragile body  to  glean\r\n\r\nand  collect scraps from the rubbish heap, when we see  a\r\n\r\nuniversity graduate putting aside his academic excellence\r\n\r\nto  roast  chestnuts for sale, when we  see  a  youngster\r\n\r\nconcealing his MA qualification to apply for a job  as  a\r\n\r\nwarehouse assistant, we know that most Singaporeans  want\r\n\r\nto live with dignity. They will certainly seek to be self-reliant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government should not use the conduct of a\r\n\r\nsmall  group of Singaporeans as a criterion, and use  the\r\n\r\nexcuse of not wanting the people to degenerate and forget\r\n\r\nabout  the  promises they made during  the  last  General\r\n\r\nElection.  Do not forget that the Prime Minister has also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  people's problems are his  problems  and\r\n\r\ntheir concerns are his concerns too.   The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nis  going to retire to give way to a younger person soon.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  the Minister for Finance who is  going  to\r\n\r\nsucceed him as Prime Minister will remember what he said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with the threat of retrenchment, pay cut,\r\n\r\nzero  bonus, uncertain economic prospect, I feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  even  more important that the Government should  give\r\n\r\nthe  people a clear signal, to let the people  know  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is resolute in wanting to lower their cost\r\n\r\nof  living.  Today, the burden on the people's  shoulders\r\n\r\nis so heavy that they could hardly breathe.  According to\r\n\r\na  recent  report  by  Goldman Sachs, the  debt-to-income\r\n\r\nratio of an average Singaporean family is the highest  in\r\n\r\nthe   world.   Singaporeans  consider  owning  their  own\r\n\r\nresidential property as their first priority. With 93% of\r\n\r\nthe   families owning their own home, every family is  in\r\n\r\ndebt.  With the series of impacts since 1996, the debt-to-income  ratio of an average Singaporean family has  risen\r\n\r\nfrom 122% to 174%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with a whole series of retrenchment exercises,\r\n\r\nuncertainty in job security\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  the  heavy debts, the  people's  worry  is\r\n\r\nindeed understandable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these years, I have been repeatedly asking\r\n\r\nthe  Government to carefully review its policy on  public\r\n\r\nservice  charges.  Even in the good years, we should  not\r\n\r\nuse  market  forces as a cover, raising the  standard  of\r\n\r\nservices as an excuse, and affordability of the people as\r\n\r\nthe logic to keep on raising public service charges.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should have exercised control over the cost of\r\n\r\nliving,  give people a chance to catch their breath,  and\r\n\r\nkeep  the wealth with the people.  HDB flat pricing is  a\r\n\r\ngood example. It causes people to be up to their ears  in\r\n\r\ndebt.   But the Government turned a deaf ear to all these\r\n\r\nappeals.   Even  in current bad times, on the  excuse  of\r\n\r\nraising   the  standard  of  service,  public   transport\r\n\r\ncharges,  medical fees and all sorts of charges  such  as\r\n\r\ntaxi licence fees, etc, have been adjusted upwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, the People's Action Party Government\r\n\r\nwill   never  commit to freeze charges over a long period\r\n\r\nof  time,  this will cut off its sources of revenue. Once\r\n\r\nthe  economy recovers, the Government will go back to its\r\n\r\nold  tricks   of using free-market policy as a  cover  to\r\n\r\nincrease its charges.  Did the Finance Minister not point\r\n\r\nout  in  his  Budget Statement that in  good  times,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  accumulate  surpluses  to  offset   the\r\n\r\ndeficits.  Increasing public service charges  has been  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  means  for  the  Government  to   accumulate\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  The only difference from now onwards is  that\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost cannot be increased by a large margin  for\r\n\r\nfear  of frightening away the foreign investors and  with\r\n\r\nsuch constraints, the PAP Government will surely turn  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  for  their  revenue,  like  increasing  GST.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  in  order to maintain its  competitiveness,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will also  control tightly the wage level\r\n\r\nof  the people. Under such circumstances, the predicament\r\n\r\nof the people is clearly imaginable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to, once again, appeal to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to    take the high cost  of  living  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  seriously and  to change the policy and principle\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic   service  charges,  reconvene  the  Cost   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee to identify the problems, prescribe the correct\r\n\r\nmedicine,  and relieve the real concerns of  the  people,\r\n\r\nrather   than  distributing  shares  before  the  General\r\n\r\nElection,  and  then  increasing  the  various  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges after the General Election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance repeatedly emphasised that\r\n\r\nthe  main  aim and strategy of this budget is  to  create\r\n\r\nopportunities  for enhancing productivity and  increasing\r\n\r\njob  opportunities.   Can I ask  the  Minister  how  many\r\n\r\npeople  have  lost  their  jobs since  the  last  General\r\n\r\nElection,  and  how  many  job  opportunities  have   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   created?  Among  these  newly  created   job\r\n\r\nopportunities,  how many are taken up by foreign  talents\r\n\r\nbecause  Singaporeans are not competent  enough  to  take\r\n\r\nthem  on?   The Government says that there are plenty  of\r\n\r\nvacancies in our labour market, but Singaporeans are  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  lower their expectations to take  on  these\r\n\r\njobs. Has the Government made any attempt to find out why\r\n\r\nthere is such an anomaly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of skill upgrading and retraining is\r\n\r\nnothing  new.  But, why is it progressing so slowly?   If\r\n\r\nthe employment situation is not improved, and batches and\r\n\r\nbatches  of graduates are pouring into the labour market,\r\n\r\nwhat  counter measures does the Government  have?   After\r\n\r\nimplementing  the recommendations of the Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee,  what  is  the Government's  forecast  on  the\r\n\r\nlabour   market?   Will  the  situation   of   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment  improve with the Government's  decision  to\r\n\r\ndevelop life sciences and the service industry?   In  its\r\n\r\nestimate,  how  many  years will it take  for  the  whole\r\n\r\neconomic  transformation to complete? Can the  Government\r\n\r\ngive our people a definite answer?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing the recently released Economic Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  Report to the February 1986 Economic Committee\r\n\r\nReport, the fundamental issue remains the same, that  is,\r\n\r\nthe  weak international and regional demand coupled  with\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndomestic structural problems, such as high cost resulting\r\n\r\nin  the  loss  of  competitiveness, the  inflexible  wage\r\n\r\nstructure,  high  savings  being  put  into  unproductive\r\n\r\ninvestments like properties, and the reaction to external\r\n\r\nchanges being slow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1986 report said that Singaporeans would rather\r\n\r\nstay  unemployed than to take up lower-paid or  demanding\r\n\r\njobs  because  they  do not understand  that  times  have\r\n\r\nchanged.   Now, the Government is saying the same  thing.\r\n\r\nHave  we changed?  For counter-measures, the 1986  report\r\n\r\nset   a   precedent  by  reducing  the   employers'   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions by 15%, freezing the wages for  two  years,\r\n\r\nreforming the salary structure, introducing the  variable\r\n\r\nwage  component,  controlling the Government's  revenues,\r\n\r\nlowering  corporate tax, developing the service industry,\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  private  enterprises,  developing  local\r\n\r\nenterprises, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ERC has left no stone unturned, then we can\r\n\r\nsay  that  these stones had already been turned  some  16\r\n\r\nyears  ago. Yet 16 years later, they are being picked  up\r\n\r\nfrom  the  same localities, and  most probably  put  back\r\n\r\ninto  their original positions again. The only difference\r\n\r\nis that the then Minister of State for Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nwho  led  the Economic Committee is now the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  cum Minister for Finance, who is again  leading\r\n\r\nan  Economic  Review Committee. And in the  report  then,\r\n\r\nthere  was no mention of China at all, yet it is now  one\r\n\r\nof the major factors contributing to our being in such  a\r\n\r\npredicament today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DPM Lee met the union and grassroots leaders,\r\n\r\nhe said, \"If the Government had  anticipated that China's\r\n\r\neconomy  would  take off so rapidly, it  would  not  have\r\n\r\nallowed our wages to escalate so fast.\" The strange thing\r\n\r\nwas  following China's economic reform and opening to the\r\n\r\noutside world in 1979, our leaders have been making trips\r\n\r\nto  China  every now and then, and were received  by  the\r\n\r\nparamount leaders of China.  When did our farsighted  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment first realise that China was going  to  emerge\r\n\r\nrapidly?  Have they adjusted their strategies then?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past may not be remonstrated with, but we can\r\n\r\nstill  pursue  the future.  We can forget about  accusing\r\n\r\nthe  Government for  its past mistakes, but we  must  ask\r\n\r\nthis  Government, which it has claimed to  be  formed  by\r\n\r\nroping  in the top talents and the most farsighted elites\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, this question: when the time was good, you\r\n\r\nkept  adding on to the burden of living of the people  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle that the people could afford it. Now  that\r\n\r\nthe   economy  has  gone  into  a  predicament,  you  cut\r\n\r\nsalaries,  cut  CPF under the cover of lowering  business\r\n\r\ncost.  The  people's income is diminishing, why  has  the\r\n\r\ncost of living still not gone down yet?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic development being internationalised,\r\n\r\nthe  changes  in  the economic  landscape  in  East  Asia\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  emergence  of China's  economy,  and  the\r\n\r\nenhanced  competitiveness of our neighbouring  economies,\r\n\r\nI  am  not  too optimistic with our medium-term  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Review the Government's principle  of  fund\r\n\r\nallocation  for the public service, find ways  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  various  charges, lighten the burden of  the  people\r\n\r\nand, at the same time, bring down business cost, are  the\r\n\r\nimmediate tasks of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a little puzzled after listening to\r\n\r\nthe  speech by Mr Low Thia Khiang.  Mr Low said that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not understand the difficulties faced  by\r\n\r\nthe  people, and that the Government has not sent a clear\r\n\r\nsignal  to  the  people.  I think  this  is  a  distorted\r\n\r\nopinion.   We  must  not forget that the  Government  has\r\n\r\npostponed the 1% increase in GST by one year.  This shows\r\n\r\nthat the Government understands the difficulties faced by\r\n\r\nthe  people.   This  year's budget is a  deficit  budget.\r\n\r\nDoes  it  not send a clear signal to the people that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cares?  Mr Low also said that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas not done much for the unemployed.  Perhaps he has not\r\n\r\nread the newspapers or heard the Minister's speeches that\r\n\r\nwe  have  put  in tremendous efforts  to attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments, and by so doing to create  more jobs for our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are problems in our economy, and these\r\n\r\nproblems must be solved.  I would liken our economy to  a\r\n\r\npregnant lady in labour.  When my wife was in the  labour\r\n\r\nroom, I was there to accompany her, and the labour took a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 18-hours.  During child birth, the mother  must\r\n\r\nexperience  labour  pain.   Without  going  through  such\r\n\r\nlabour  pain,  there would be no joy of a new-born  baby.\r\n\r\nLikewise, our economy is like going through child  birth.\r\n\r\nIf  we are not prepared to face some pain, and if we  try\r\n\r\nto  take  short cuts, our new economy will not  be  born.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I urge all the MPs, including our  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers,  to  work  together  to  endure  this  pain   of\r\n\r\nchildbirth,  and  to look forward to  receiving  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 2002 was a very difficult year.\r\n\r\nThe   economic  recovery  which  the  people  have   been\r\n\r\nexpecting did not materialise. The unemployment situation\r\n\r\nhas  worsened,  externally there were  squabbles  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia, and the bombing in Bali has  made\r\n\r\nus keenly aware of the terrorist threats right before our\r\n\r\neyes.   On the whole, 2002 was a difficult year that  has\r\n\r\nbrought us few good news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for 2003 is still fraught with\r\n\r\nuncertainties.    Externally,  the   tension   that   has\r\n\r\nbedevilled  relations  with  our  neighbour   has   eased\r\n\r\nsomewhat although the bilateral issues have not yet to be\r\n\r\nsolved.  The situation in Iraq is unstable, with the  war\r\n\r\nthreatening to break out any moment.  Our economy remains\r\n\r\nweak.   With  the successive retrenchments recently,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment rate is likely to go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in his recent interview, warned\r\n\r\nthe  people that the bad time is not quite over. He  said\r\n\r\nthat  while  we  should not lose hope, we  must  also  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for  the  worst.  Hence,  when  discussing  the\r\n\r\nbudget,  we  must  be  aware of the  uncertain  prospects\r\n\r\nfacing us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepted almost all the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the ERC.  These include postponing the\r\n\r\nrestoration of the employers' CPF contributions, lowering\r\n\r\nthe salary ceiling of CPF contributions,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlowering the CPF contribution rates for workers  aged  50\r\n\r\nand  above.   All these  measures are aimed at  enhancing\r\n\r\nSingapore's  competitiveness  and  preserving  jobs.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has also put forward specific measures to help\r\n\r\nrevive  our  economy,  such  as  setting  up  a  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee to be chaired by DPM Lee, and the Committee  on\r\n\r\nPromoting Entrepreneurial Spirit with Mr Raymond  Lim  in\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is apparently lacking in the Budget are some\r\n\r\ngoodies  people  were hoping to get  to  alleviate  their\r\n\r\npresent financial difficulties.  Their disappointment  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable.   They had expected  both  corporate  and\r\n\r\npersonal income tax rates to come down further.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to focus on the long term strategic objectives,\r\n\r\nand this is precisely what this budget seeks to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although restructuring is painful, it is the most\r\n\r\neffective  way to help upgrade our economy  to  a  higher\r\n\r\nplane.  While the budget is generally on the right track,\r\n\r\nI think we could do more in the following aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, build up an external economy. Secondly,\r\n\r\nhelp our local companies and, thirdly, we must change our\r\n\r\nmindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build up an external economy. We have a very small\r\n\r\neconomy  with  a population of 3.5 million.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend   on foreign markets.  Our only choice is to  stay\r\n\r\nconnected  to  the world while at the same time  minimise\r\n\r\nthe  negative  impact  of external factors.   The  Budget\r\n\r\nfocuses  on  lowering  business  cost  to  maintain   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  However, I am afraid the world  economy\r\n\r\nhas  changed structurally.  It is not enough to be merely\r\n\r\ncost-competitive.  Many economies offer  more  than  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  They offer a huge domestic  market  and\r\n\r\nan inexhaustible pool of technical professionals and rich\r\n\r\nnatural resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot offer the same thing, but does it mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  finished?   Of course  not.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nidentify and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleverage on our competitive advantages, for example,  our\r\n\r\npeople,  our  most important resource.   Our  people  are\r\n\r\nnimble,   quick   to  exploit  opportunities,   creative,\r\n\r\nresilient  and  our workers are full of  aspirations  and\r\n\r\nambitions. These are essential ingredients in the make-up\r\n\r\nof  any  successful entrepreneur.  In addition,  we  have\r\n\r\nstrong  financial  resources.  Even  during  the  current\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown, many of our companies, both GLCs  and\r\n\r\nprivate  companies, remain financially  healthy  compared\r\n\r\nto  many  foreign companies.  Thirdly, we have  a  stable\r\n\r\npolitical and social environment which ensures  that  our\r\n\r\nenterprises can develop and grow unimpeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have all the conditions for\r\n\r\nsuccess.  I am of the view that if we are to continue  to\r\n\r\nprosper  in  a rapidly globalising environment,  what  we\r\n\r\nneed is not just a Singapore economy. We have to build  a\r\n\r\nvibrant  and  growing  external  economy  that   is   not\r\n\r\nconstrained by our own limitations. We have to open a new\r\n\r\nwindow, build new channels, develop new networks  and  be\r\n\r\ndirectly involved in the world economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an economy cannot be constrained by our own\r\n\r\ngeopolitical  boundaries.  Let me give an  example.  Over\r\n\r\nthe  years, my company has been investing in some Chinese\r\n\r\ncities  and  most of the businesses have  done  well.  We\r\n\r\nnaturally  began to consider expanding our businesses  to\r\n\r\nother  parts of China.  There was one critical  obstacle.\r\n\r\nOur  local  partner  was  not  prepared  to  join  us  in\r\n\r\ninvesting  in places outside their province.   They  felt\r\n\r\nthat  their  duty  was to attract foreign  investment  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own  province so that jobs could  be  created  for\r\n\r\ntheir local people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them, investing in places outside the province\r\n\r\nmeans  an  outflow of capital and would not  help  create\r\n\r\njobs  for  the people.  They are wrong.  In view  of  the\r\n\r\nreluctance  of  our local partner to go out  of  its  own\r\n\r\nprovince, we decided to venture out to other provinces on\r\n\r\nour  own.  With the passage of time, such new investments\r\n\r\nwill  become more attractive than the existing one.  When\r\n\r\nthat happens, we may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelocate  our  present factories  and  move  to  the  new\r\n\r\nlocation. Then the province where we originally  invested\r\n\r\nin will lose out eventually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if they are far-sighted, they\r\n\r\nwill  know  that to venture out and invest  with  us  may\r\n\r\nbring  them  more  profits and  would  also  benefit  the\r\n\r\nexisting joint venture business.  As a partner in  a  new\r\n\r\ninvestment,  their  partnership  position  will  be  more\r\n\r\nsecure.  They will become our strategic partner.  This is\r\n\r\nthe  same with Singapore, although investing overseas may\r\n\r\nresult  in capital outflow and will not create  jobs  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the short term.  I believe that this is a\r\n\r\nlong-term  strategy that will strengthen our economy  and\r\n\r\nwould   eventually  create  more  well-paying  jobs   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we recognise that investing overseas is an\r\n\r\nimportant strategy, then we have to help our companies do\r\n\r\nso.   In  this  connection, I would like  to  make  three\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, formulate direct incentives to encourage\r\n\r\nand  help  enterprises  to  go  overseas.   Investing  in\r\n\r\nforeign  countries entails high costs  at  the  start  up\r\n\r\nstage.    This   has  discouraged  many  companies   from\r\n\r\nventuring  overseas.  Through tax incentive and  rebates,\r\n\r\nwe could help to share some of the costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, set up a special seed fund to co-invest\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore companies.  Lack of capital is  a  common\r\n\r\nobstacle to companies going overseas.  Local banks may be\r\n\r\naverse  to lending them money to invest overseas  because\r\n\r\nthey are not familiar with the environment in the foreign\r\n\r\ncountry or they do not have the licence to lend money  in\r\n\r\nthese  countries.   Therefore,  companies  that  want  to\r\n\r\ninvest  overseas  have  to  look  for  new  banks.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment should set up some seed funds to provide  such\r\n\r\nfacilities. We must be prepared to take some  risks.   As\r\n\r\nit is said, \"no risk, no gain\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MTI should set up an agency to provide one-stop services to companies that intend to invest\r\n\r\noverseas,  as  what  the EDB has been  doing  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestments to Singapore.  Our many overseas offices  can\r\n\r\nalso  help  in this respect, but it would be  helpful  to\r\n\r\nhave a central coordinating agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs can also play a supplementary role in\r\n\r\nassisting such companies.  Many of these GLCs have  built\r\n\r\nup    international   networks   and   have   substantial\r\n\r\ninvestments  in China and other emerging  economies.   It\r\n\r\nwould  be  good if they can help our local  suppliers  by\r\n\r\nbringing them along so that they can establish a foothold\r\n\r\nin  overseas countries.  On their own, they would find it\r\n\r\ndifficult to compete with the low cost domestic suppliers\r\n\r\ninitially.   If we could help them overcome  the  initial\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  they would be able to  compete  with  them\r\n\r\neventually  and  they may well emerge as  another  global\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, giving Singapore companies a helping hand. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  we  have  to  be  aware  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  facing a grave challenge.   The  economic\r\n\r\nrecession  has  never been so grave and the  duration  so\r\n\r\nlong.  While focusing on the need to lower business cost,\r\n\r\nwe  must  also consider specific measures to  help  local\r\n\r\nenterprises pull through this difficult period,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  opportunity comes again, they can recover  and\r\n\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factor that is likely to constrain the\r\n\r\nrapid recovery among Singapore enterprises is the lack of\r\n\r\ncapital.  Due  to the economic crisis in the  past  three\r\n\r\nyears,  many of these companies have incurred losses  and\r\n\r\nheavy  debts.   With banks being  very cautious  at  this\r\n\r\ntime, even when the economy turns around, these companies\r\n\r\nwill  find it difficult to get working capital  from  the\r\n\r\nbanks.  Therefore, their recovery will be hampered.  Some\r\n\r\nof them may not even make it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look ahead in reviving the economy. First\r\n\r\nof all, we must ensure adequate liquidity.  Next, we must\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that the fund goes to those who need  it  and\r\n\r\ndeserve it.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to set up\r\n\r\na  special  bank  to  cater to the  needs  of  the  SMEs.\r\n\r\nWhether  this  bank  forms part of  our  present  banking\r\n\r\nsystem, and how it would be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrun, are details that warrant careful consideration.. The\r\n\r\nterms  of  lending  must  also  be  considered.   But  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, a decision must be taken to set up such a bank\r\n\r\nto  assist  the  SMEs to recover from  the  recession.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve this is viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is also important to change\r\n\r\npeople's  way  of thinking if we are to embrace  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   While  we  are making efforts  to  revive  the\r\n\r\neconomy, we could see three trends emerging:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As we build an external economy, we will see\r\n\r\nmore and more Singaporeans going overseas to work;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) With our economy going global, we can expect an\r\n\r\ninflux of foreign talents coming here to work; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The restructuring of the economy will continue\r\n\r\nand accelerate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to leave our comfort zone, be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take  risks,  be more  flexible  and,  when\r\n\r\nnecessary, free ourselves from past practices. The  world\r\n\r\nis  changing rapidly and we have to keep on changing too.\r\n\r\nI  remember Mr Lim Swee Say saying that our restructuring\r\n\r\nis  unlike mountain-climbing.  In mountain-climbing, when\r\n\r\nyou are tired, you can pitch a tent to take a rest and if\r\n\r\nyou  persist,  you  can  reach the  peak.   He  said  our\r\n\r\nrestructuring  is more like rowing a boat  in  a  stream,\r\n\r\nsurging with rapid currents. If we stop, we will regress.\r\n\r\nWe  must  get our people to expect changes.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nprogress with the times or we will be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must reform our seniority-based wage system and\r\n\r\nreplace  it  with  a  wage system with  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponents to give employers more flexibility.   We  must\r\n\r\nenhance  the employability of older workers so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  retain  their  jobs or look for new  jobs  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy is being restructured.  We must encourage  people\r\n\r\nto  be more flexible, be prepared to venture overseas and\r\n\r\nhelp them where we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget is a bold and balanced\r\n\r\none although it offers no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndesserts.  It has provided the necessary steps to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  keep our competitive advantage.  It is  like  a\r\n\r\nFerrari with its engine finely tuned and the best  driver\r\n\r\nbehind  the wheel, yet we still need to have  a  team  of\r\n\r\nengineers  and technicians working together at  the  crew\r\n\r\npit  to back up the machine. In this way, we will win the\r\n\r\nrace and bag the trophy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now, Mr\r\n\r\nGan  likened our new economy to a would-be mother at  the\r\n\r\nlabour ward.  When a woman is giving birth to a baby,  of\r\n\r\ncourse  she suffers labour pain, and she knows that  soon\r\n\r\nthe  pain will be over and joy will prevail when the baby\r\n\r\nis born. But, can the Government tell us clearly when the\r\n\r\npresent economic pain is going to be over?  Will the pain\r\n\r\nlast a long time?  In case there is no natural birth, can\r\n\r\nwe resort to birth by a caesarian section?  If a would-be\r\n\r\nmother cannot stand the pain any longer, she can ask  for\r\n\r\na  caesarian  section  to deliver  the  baby.   Can   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  do  a caesarian  section  to  ease  our\r\n\r\neconomic pain?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps Mr Low has\r\n\r\nnot  undergone this labour pain, neither have I.   But  I\r\n\r\ncan tell Mr Low very clearly that when my wife was giving\r\n\r\nbirth,  I was there with her.  In the beginning, she  was\r\n\r\nvery  nervous,  the  pain came again and  again,  and  it\r\n\r\ndragged  on for 18 hours before the baby was born.   Even\r\n\r\nthe doctors could not predict how long the pain would be.\r\n\r\nSo  for  us  to  predict when our economic recovery  will\r\n\r\ncome,   I   think  it  is  very  difficult.    Even   the\r\n\r\ngynaecologists could not predict it.  But  one  thing  we\r\n\r\ncan  say  for sure is that the baby is going to  be  born\r\n\r\neventually.   Whether it is natural  birth  or  caesarian\r\n\r\nbirth, so long as it is not an abortion, it is all right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if you are the Finance Minister faced  with\r\n\r\nthe  present  difficulty, what type of budget  would  you\r\n\r\npresent?   We should ask this question of the Member  for\r\n\r\nHougang.  He would only talk about caesarian birth or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnatural birth, but no delivery. My conclusion is that  he\r\n\r\nhas  just a lot of ideas, but no solution.  The important\r\n\r\nthing is that we must prescribe the correct medicine  for\r\n\r\nthe  ailment.  This year's budget is a  very  appropriate\r\n\r\none,  and  I believe most of the people would agree  with\r\n\r\nme.  In  fact,  many people are saying that  our  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister has prescribed the correct medicine, while  some\r\n\r\nwere  of  the  view  that the dosage may  not  be  strong\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah said this is a herbal\r\n\r\ncure  and  he has asked for a fusion between the  Western\r\n\r\nmedicine and Chinese medicine, and even that Mr  Low  did\r\n\r\nnot  agree.  He took it as just changing in form  without\r\n\r\nchanging  in substance. I think we need warm  hearts  and\r\n\r\ntough minds as mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  his  budget speech. This is  precisely  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  our  budget this year.  In other  words,  the\r\n\r\nprescription by the Finance Minister is that we must,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, have physiotherapy for our external  pains\r\n\r\nand,  on  the  other  hand, oral  medicine  for  internal\r\n\r\ntreatment.  Recently,  we have  been  talking  about  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  times  and  that we must change  our  mindset,\r\n\r\nupgrade  or re-skill. This is oral medicine. And  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  our people to move out of the comfort zone  where\r\n\r\nthey  have  been enjoying all their life to get  out  and\r\n\r\nventure into the unknown. This is difficult.  I think  we\r\n\r\nneed to give them some psychiatric counselling as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, whenever we visited our constituency,\r\n\r\nand I believe my parliamentary colleagues will agree with\r\n\r\nme,  and  faced a resident who was unemployed,  he  would\r\n\r\ntake it lightly as though he was just having a break. But\r\n\r\nnow,  when  they are unemployed, they are very depressed.\r\n\r\nThey told me they are prepared to take on any job offered\r\n\r\nto  them, because they know job openings are not easy  to\r\n\r\ncome by nowadays.  But when they are told that there  are\r\n\r\njobs in coffeeshops, they would give many excuses not  to\r\n\r\ntake up the offer..\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People must accept all sorts of training to cope\r\n\r\nwith the needs of the new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  fact that some still have not  taken  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step to adjust to the new reality is that they  do\r\n\r\nnot  realise  that the world around them has  changed  so\r\n\r\nmuch.  We  need to make them aware of the rapid  changes,\r\n\r\nand  make them realise that they do have a place  in  the\r\n\r\nnew economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people may have different reactions to\r\n\r\nthis  Budget presented by the Finance Minister. In  terms\r\n\r\nof  awareness  of  the  new  challenges  ahead,  I  would\r\n\r\ncategorise our people into four different types:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the foresighted. They know the problem, take\r\n\r\nproactive  action and be pre-emptive. The Government  and\r\n\r\nthe successful entrepreneurs belong to this group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have the normal-sighted. They know the\r\n\r\nreality  and  adjust themselves to the  new  environment.\r\n\r\nThey  upgrade themselves and are coping well in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy. Most of our workers belong to this group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have the short-sighted. They fail to\r\n\r\nrealise how fast the  world is changing and do not adjust\r\n\r\nthemselves  to adapt to the new environment.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  they lose their jobs and are not prepared to  take\r\n\r\non  new jobs but simply wait and hope for the old jobs to\r\n\r\ncome back to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we have the \"switched-off\". They are the so-called bo chap people. They do not care about what is\r\n\r\nhappening around them.  They do not know of the  imminent\r\n\r\ndanger  of losing their jobs and simply refuse to go  for\r\n\r\ntraining and retraining.  When they eventually lose their\r\n\r\njobs,  they  blame the Government for not  looking  after\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to educate the short-sighted\r\n\r\nand  the \"switched-off\" groups of people so as to enhance\r\n\r\ntheir awareness of the present situation before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked why there was no mention of\r\n\r\nthe likely emergence of China in our economic review some\r\n\r\n10 years ago.  He must not forget that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister Lee started visiting China in the 1970s,\r\n\r\neven  before China had adopted the \"economic  reform  and\r\n\r\nopening  to  the outside world\" in 1978.   He  encouraged\r\n\r\npeople  to  invest  in  Xiamen and some  of  the  coastal\r\n\r\ncities  in  China.   More than two decades  ago,  he  was\r\n\r\nalready  encouraging our people to take risks and venture\r\n\r\noverseas  and  some of our entrepreneurs  did  invest  in\r\n\r\nChina and faced the tough time initially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said, \"Let bygones be bygones, let us look at\r\n\r\nthe  future.\"  I think we should do more than  that.  Let\r\n\r\nthe  past be the past, but there is still a future  ahead\r\n\r\nof  us.  We have to make sure that the past mistakes  are\r\n\r\nnot  repeated.  I think the Government is caring too much\r\n\r\nfor  the  people, so much so that the people are becoming\r\n\r\nover dependent on the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we can see some undesirable trends\r\n\r\nin our society:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, giving a bit to everyone to make everyone\r\n\r\nhappy.  But, the question is: is everyone happy? When  we\r\n\r\ndistribute  ang  pows and the goodies, we  want  to  give\r\n\r\neverybody  a share so that everybody can be happy.   But,\r\n\r\nmany  people would say it is not enough.  Why is it  that\r\n\r\nyou have so much and I have so little? In the end, nobody\r\n\r\nis  happy.   Mr  Low  mentioned just  now  that  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  has a lot of means to make a lot  of  wealth,\r\n\r\nbut  he  was  being cynical.  So, I think the problem  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Government  is  being  too  efficient   and\r\n\r\ngenerous and has given away too many rebates and  shares.\r\n\r\nOn  top  of  this,  you do not need to  worry  about  the\r\n\r\nshortage of water even when there is no rain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are a lot of people who blame\r\n\r\neveryone  else  for  all  their  difficulties   but   not\r\n\r\nthemselves.    Globalisation  and  regionalisation   have\r\n\r\nbrought  about a lot of challenges.  The employers  would\r\n\r\nblame the employees for being too choosy, too lazy,  etc,\r\n\r\nand  the  employees will complain that the employers  are\r\n\r\nnot employing them.  Even though they know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery  well that they do not have the skill and competence\r\n\r\nto  take on the job, they would say the employers do  not\r\n\r\nwant  them  because they are old or because  they  cannot\r\n\r\nspeak English.  I know of one man who even remarked  that\r\n\r\nhe  was  not  employed because he was botak or  bald.   I\r\n\r\nreceived  some SMS citing money not enough  for  them  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate the Chinese New Year.  They complained that the\r\n\r\nemployers  had  money but would not pay them  more.  They\r\n\r\nblame  the  employers.  They blame the  Government.  They\r\n\r\nblame  everyone,  but they never blame themselves!   They\r\n\r\nwant  to have a job that pays well, but they do not  want\r\n\r\nto put in some efforts to acquire the necessary skills to\r\n\r\ndeserve  that job.  I think our workers should work  hard\r\n\r\nand try to upgrade their skills, for their own good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whenever there are activities, there are\r\n\r\nlucky  draws.  This is another strange phenomenon in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   In  the company dinners, and now even  at  our\r\n\r\nconstituency functions and grassroots activities,  people\r\n\r\nare attending  only because of the lucky draws.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot  come because of our activities that we are preparing\r\n\r\nfor  them.   So  I  hope that when we  are  planning  our\r\n\r\nfinancial policies we should not let the people fall into\r\n\r\nany of these categories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to face the new challenges in the new economy,\r\n\r\nI  urge  the  Government to foster the three new  spirits\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we should encourage our people to learn and\r\n\r\nadapt to changes.  When we are being threatened, we  must\r\n\r\nfind  ways  to  counter  the threats.   Just  as  we  are\r\n\r\nthreatened  with  the cut-off  of our water  supply,   we\r\n\r\nhave  new  alternatives, such as NEWater  or  desalinated\r\n\r\nwater.  Singapore is able to survive because we are  very\r\n\r\ngood in adapting to changes.  We must also cultivate  our\r\n\r\ncitizens of all ages and all stations of life to be ready\r\n\r\nand  able  to  adapt to changes.  We have to boost  their\r\n\r\nconfidence so that they have hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have also to encourage our people to\r\n\r\nmake  ours a learning nation. Last year, President Nathan\r\n\r\nmentioned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  he  started life as an office attendant and  worked\r\n\r\nhis  way  up to become a senior civil servant, a diplomat\r\n\r\nand  eventually the President.  Even our Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nstarted  learning to use the computer at  a  very  senior\r\n\r\nage.  So I think we should all learn.  We should have the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  lifelong learning among us, and  this  spirit\r\n\r\nmust be sustained.  We should provide the facilities  and\r\n\r\nconvenience  to motivate our citizens to become  learning\r\n\r\ncitizens. We may have to learn from McDonald's  how  they\r\n\r\ncreated this herd mentality that prompted people to queue\r\n\r\nup all over the island to buy their \"Hello Kitty\" toys!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must be more focused in helping the poor\r\n\r\nand  needy.   When we talk about the poor and  needy,  we\r\n\r\nwould  normally refer to the low-income families. But  in\r\n\r\nthe  present day situation, even the graduates are having\r\n\r\nproblems   making  ends  meet.  Mr  Low  mentioned   that\r\n\r\nnowadays, a university graduate had to work as  a  hawker\r\n\r\nselling roasted chestnuts.  Why  not ? If you can package\r\n\r\nthe  chestnuts in such a way that it becomes  a  national\r\n\r\nbrand, it could well be a good business proposition  too.\r\n\r\nSo  under  the  present situation, in some families,  the\r\n\r\nparents are unemployed, the children are unemployed, even\r\n\r\nthe  graduates cannot be spared. I think we have to focus\r\n\r\nour attention on the genuine cases of hardship, the truly\r\n\r\npoor  and needy, and move away from the past practice  of\r\n\r\n\"a piece of candy for everyone\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can adopt these new spirits quickly, I am\r\n\r\nconfident  that we will be able to get out  of  the  hard\r\n\r\ntimes  soon and I must say that this budget is  one  that\r\n\r\nprescribes the correct medicine for our present  economic\r\n\r\nailment.   With a bit of luck, we will be well  and  good\r\n\r\npretty soon!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>12.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nshall  speak in English and I shall not talk about labour\r\n\r\npains  although  I am quite experienced  here.   I  shall\r\n\r\nspeak from the point of view of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractising accountant, serving the business world.  And I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to applaud the Finance Minister for  what  I\r\n\r\nwould  call a progressive budget.  It contains some  very\r\n\r\nfar-sighted  elements  that  will  yield  us  significant\r\n\r\nresults  in the long term, although in the short term  we\r\n\r\nmay  not  have such good returns.  Still there  are  many\r\n\r\nsacred cows which have been slaughtered and also quite  a\r\n\r\nfew significant policy shifts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take Budgets 2002 and 2003 as a\r\n\r\npackage.   So I see Budget 2003 as continuing the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  decisiveness  and boldness which was  established  in\r\n\r\nBudget  2002.  And the two budgets really set  in  motion\r\n\r\nthe  transformation of our tax regime from one  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  considered somewhat insular, somewhat domestic,  to\r\n\r\none that clearly favours the globalisation of business in\r\n\r\na  global  world.  There are also efforts  to  level  the\r\n\r\ninternational playing field, and in so doing, would  also\r\n\r\nmake our environment, our tax regime, much more conducive\r\n\r\nfor foreign investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to applaud the Finance Minister and\r\n\r\nGovernment  for planning a budget deficit for  the  third\r\n\r\nyear  in  a row.  The Government has said that  a  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  would be inevitable in difficult times.   But  I\r\n\r\nhave  got to say that not every Singaporean believes that\r\n\r\nstatement  because  in  the past a  balanced  budget  has\r\n\r\nalways  been a long held Government sacred cow.  So  that\r\n\r\nhad  been slaughtered and I suppose we can slaughter  our\r\n\r\nown  scepticism  as well.  We do face very  extraordinary\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and you have articulated that  the  macro-economic  figures show that we have a small  growth  last\r\n\r\nyear,  and we will also have a forecasted smaller  growth\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as has been said by many, the mood on the\r\n\r\nground is rather gloomy because businesses are not  doing\r\n\r\nas well, and quite a few are on the verge of experiencing\r\n\r\ncollapse.  You also have bad news regarding unemployment,\r\n\r\nthe  PSA lay-offs, the HDB lay-offs and also the prospect\r\n\r\nof  war in Iraq and terrorism.  All these heightened  the\r\n\r\nfear of unemployment, uncertainty, as well as pessim-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nism.   So we do need some exceptional measures to counter\r\n\r\nthese extraordinary circumstances and we are glad that  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  budget has been planned, although some may  say,\r\n\r\nand  some  already had said, that perhaps the  Government\r\n\r\nhas been cautious, not entrepreneurial enough in taking a\r\n\r\nfew   risks  and  whether  the  budget  deficit  is   the\r\n\r\ninevitable  result of poorer revenue coming  out  from  a\r\n\r\npoorer  economy  and  also from a  smaller  rise  in  GST\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the results that could have  been  computed\r\n\r\nbased  on  deliberate efforts to boost  the  economy  and\r\n\r\nstimulate  businesses.  So there are some disappointments\r\n\r\nin Budget 2003, one of course is the non-reduction of the\r\n\r\ntax rates for corporate as well as for individuals.  Many\r\n\r\nhad  hoped  that there would be at least a one percentage\r\n\r\npoint  reduction in the rates, but I suppose those  hopes\r\n\r\nwere dashed on Budget day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think the disappointment has\r\n\r\nbeen  offset  by  some  real  concessions,  and  by   the\r\n\r\nslaughtering  of  yet  more  sacred  cows.   One  is  the\r\n\r\nexemption  from  tax  of  overseas  income  remitted   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  has  been  said  many  times  over  that\r\n\r\nbusinesses have long lobbied for this concession but, for\r\n\r\na  long time, the tax authority has tenaciously clung  on\r\n\r\nto  it,  and businesses have all but given up.  In  fact,\r\n\r\none  businessman said to me, \"Good luck to  you  guys  in\r\n\r\ntrying to push this one through.\"  So, we guys got  lucky\r\n\r\nthis time round, because it got introduced in the Budget.\r\n\r\nAnd, clearly, this is a bold step going forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption covers three areas - branch profits,\r\n\r\ndividend  income and service income.  And we  would  also\r\n\r\nask the Finance Minister to kindly consider the exemption\r\n\r\nof  interest  income  as  well,  since  we  have  already\r\n\r\nintroduced it for domestic interest income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exemption is very important, because it really\r\n\r\nnarrows   the  gap  between  us  and  Hong  Kong.    When\r\n\r\nbusinesses  consider the location of HQ  either  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  or  Singapore, the tax treatment of foreign sourced\r\n\r\nincome has always put\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  in a much more superior position.   So,  this\r\n\r\nexemption  closes the gap and I think we  deserve  a  big\r\n\r\ntick   instead  of  a  little  cross  in  our  analytical\r\n\r\nspreadsheet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not only attract businesses to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt will also heighten wealth management for the financial\r\n\r\nservices  industry and will also give the entrepreneurial\r\n\r\neffort  a  big  boost as businesses go out of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  more important to note here is, of course,  the\r\n\r\nchange   in  the  Government's  stance  of  not  allowing\r\n\r\nexemption  because we want to prevent abuse.   There  was\r\n\r\nsome  worry  of  round-tripping,   transfer  pricing  and\r\n\r\ndenying  revenue.  So, it is heartening to note that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  abandoned  this  so-called  \"punishment\r\n\r\nmentality\"  and  has  taken on a  much  more  enlightened\r\n\r\napproach   of  embracing  a  much   broader   vision   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  rather  than  the  narrower   vision   of\r\n\r\npreventing abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this sacred cow, a lot of the other items\r\n\r\non   the  business  wish  list,  together  with  the  ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  have also been  acceded  to.   The  ERC\r\n\r\ncomprises more than 1,000 people.  So, it is a tremendous\r\n\r\nfeat  to  go through the whole list of issues, ideas  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  I will record that as an achievement in\r\n\r\nits own right.  Amongst the many recommendations, the ERC\r\n\r\nseeks  to  see lower cost in doing business and  also  to\r\n\r\nspur  the  efforts in entrepreneurship.  I am happy  that\r\n\r\nboth areas have been adequately addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area is the CPF. The CPF comprises a major cost\r\n\r\ncomponent.   The decision to freeze the CPF  for  another\r\n\r\ntwo years is very much welcomed by businesses, because it\r\n\r\nprovides  that amount of certainty in structuring  costs.\r\n\r\nI  know CPF features very heavily in all aspects of   the\r\n\r\nlives  of  Singaporeans.   It  is  not  just  about   the\r\n\r\nretirement  nest-egg.   It  is about  the  stock  market,\r\n\r\nproperty  market  and  it is about businesses.   So,  any\r\n\r\npolicy  decision on the CPF must be consistently applied,\r\n\r\nso  that there is certainty and the Government should not\r\n\r\nflinch in the face of pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, we faced the Asian economic crisis. The\r\n\r\nGovernment reacted very well\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith a massive cut in the CPF.  That helped businesses  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal.   But it got restored quite quickly  at  the\r\n\r\nfirst  hint of recovery.  And with hindsight,  we  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  less haste should be applied because the  second\r\n\r\neconomic crisis came soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the Government for taking all the\r\n\r\nnecessary   measures   to  support   and   to   encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, and also the appointment of Mr  Raymond\r\n\r\nLim  as the Minister of State for Entrepreneurship.  This\r\n\r\nis  really what \"walking the talk\" is all about.  This is\r\n\r\nreal  commitment.  This is sponsorship  at  a  very  high\r\n\r\nlevel.   So,  businesses, both  new  and  old,  can  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  working with Mr Lim who will be rooting  for\r\n\r\ntheir cause, causing a mindset change, and also the swift\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  all the pro-business  measures  which\r\n\r\nhave been introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about start-up costs, which\r\n\r\nare  now allowed as a deduction against business revenue.\r\n\r\nThis  is clearly a step in the right direction.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  business is all about.  You have got to spend  your\r\n\r\ndollar  first  before you can earn a  dollar.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen have always wondered why they cannot get  the\r\n\r\ntaxman  to  think in the same way as  them   -   to  view\r\n\r\nbusiness  transactions  in the  same  way  as  they  view\r\n\r\nbusiness  transactions.  So, this is a move in the  right\r\n\r\ndirection,  alignment  of  thinking,  alignment  of   how\r\n\r\nbusinesses operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of start-up costs, I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister would also kindly consider extension\r\n\r\nof  this concept to look at group relief as well  as  the\r\n\r\npioneer incentive scheme.  For group relief, again on the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  drive,  whether  this  could  also   be\r\n\r\napplied  to  the  losses  of  overseas  subsidiaries  and\r\n\r\nwhether  they  could  be  used  against  the  income   of\r\n\r\ninvestors, both corporate as well as individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the pioneer incentive relief, it would also be\r\n\r\ngood if this could commence when businesses start to make\r\n\r\nmoney  rather than when they commence business.  This  is\r\n\r\nall in the concept of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstart-ups,  that costs would necessarily be  incurred  in\r\n\r\norder for businesses to make money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to move on to the specific tax\r\n\r\nmeasures  which I consider progressive.   First,  on  the\r\n\r\nAutomatic   Writing  Down  Allowances  for   intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty rights, and then on the Exemption of Withholding\r\n\r\nTax for Digitised Goods and Services.  We live in a world\r\n\r\nthat  is  powered  by  technology,  by  information,  and\r\n\r\ntogether  with e-commerce, every aspect of our  lives  is\r\n\r\ntouched  by  an  interplay of these three  elements.   We\r\n\r\ncould  either resist it by instituting protectionist  tax\r\n\r\nmeasures that would make our cost of business a lot  more\r\n\r\nexpensive in accessing the latest developments and really\r\n\r\nmake  ourselves much more efficient or we  could  embrace\r\n\r\nchange.   So,  I  am very happy in this regard  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has chosen to embrace change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the measures taken to ease and to\r\n\r\nencourage the ownership of intellectual property  rights,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  an  e-commerce environment,  everything  and\r\n\r\nanything  can  be  patented.   So,  by  encouraging   the\r\n\r\nownership  of  intellectual property rights,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nfighting chance to spawn and to sponsor the Amazon.com of\r\n\r\nthe  world.  And here, our status is clearly raised as  a\r\n\r\nhub  for intellectual property rights, because no  longer\r\n\r\ndo  businesses have to worry whether they will qualify or\r\n\r\nwhether  they will be favoured for writing down allowance\r\n\r\non a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption of withholding tax for digitised goods\r\n\r\nand services is also a very farsighted move to really put\r\n\r\nSingapore  businesses on the cutting edge of  technology.\r\n\r\nBecause  purchase of digitised goods and services becomes\r\n\r\npart  of  life  these days.  Information  reports,  data,\r\n\r\nanalytical tools are all delivered electronically, and it\r\n\r\nis  a  \"must have\" for businesses in order for businesses\r\n\r\nto  be  effective  and  to be efficient.   So,  with  the\r\n\r\nexemption of withholding tax, businesses can now have all\r\n\r\nthese \"must haves\" at affordable cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now also touch on Exemption from Withholding\r\n\r\nTax for Payments for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCable  Capacity  as well as Writing Down  Allowances  for\r\n\r\nIndefeasible  Rights of Use.  Again, in the international\r\n\r\ncommunication capacity, this is such a key building block\r\n\r\nto  our knowledge economy, and the world is getting  more\r\n\r\non-line, not less.  And it is good that we recognise  the\r\n\r\nvast  benefits that our economy  can tap into the  widest\r\n\r\nnetwork  of  capacities,  because all the countries  have\r\n\r\nalready  done  it.  The UK, Australia,  New  Zealand  and\r\n\r\nIreland  have introduced fiscal measures to favour  their\r\n\r\noperators.  So, if we do not do this quickly enough,  our\r\n\r\noperators  will be competing in a world which is  heavily\r\n\r\nstacked  against them.  We also benefit  because  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to tap into the benefits of an on-line world, which\r\n\r\nis already upon us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by saying that Budget 2003\r\n\r\nreally  paves  the  way for our businesses  to  be  truly\r\n\r\nglobal.  We have to rise to this occasion.  Sure, we have\r\n\r\nto  grapple with the economic problems which are right in\r\n\r\nfront  of  us,  but  there are also opportunities  abound\r\n\r\noutside there.  So, this Budget recognises the importance\r\n\r\nof  globalisation.   It  seeks  to  remove  some  of  the\r\n\r\nobstacles in the way of businesses and it also  seeks  to\r\n\r\nreward  those  businesses that overcome  these  problems.\r\n\r\nSo, it is now up to  businesses to progress from here and\r\n\r\nalso up to the Government officials to speedily implement\r\n\r\nthe pro-business measures that have been announced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in our pursuit of leisure and the good life, we must\r\n\r\nnot  only  raise  consumers' standard of living,  through\r\n\r\nproper  management of the economic system,  but  more  in\r\n\r\nline  with  a  young country's approach to  increase  the\r\n\r\ncollective national strength of our nation.  Our goal  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the nation remains independent and  self-sufficient,  and not for the sake of being  materialistic\r\n\r\nonly   -   a self-defeating habit that we too often  fall\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Budget, revealed by the DPM and Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, reflects the right path that our country  is\r\n\r\ntaking, especially\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  light of a slowdown in the world economy  and  a\r\n\r\nforeseeable difficult economic climate ahead.  The biased\r\n\r\nslant  in  the Budget towards helping existing businesses\r\n\r\ngrow  and  encouraging more to take the step of  starting\r\n\r\nnew  businesses, will surely spur the economy towards the\r\n\r\npath  of generating new income through goods and services\r\n\r\nwhich,   in   turn,   would  then   generate   more   job\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental purpose of any economy is to develop\r\n\r\nthe productive base of the country  -  the industries  no\r\n\r\nmatter where they may be, within the country or under the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the country's citizens around the world.  This\r\n\r\nway,  economic development will mean having more  choices\r\n\r\nfor   the   people,  more  leisure,  more  wealth,   more\r\n\r\nopportunities to pursue happiness, and society as a whole\r\n\r\nwill be successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience in the past years has taught us a\r\n\r\ndramatically  clear lesson that we must not  forget,  ie,\r\n\r\ngiving consumers too much and producers too little.   Our\r\n\r\nwages  were rising too quickly while our businesses  were\r\n\r\nbattling  to make ends meet.  Easy credit over the  years\r\n\r\nhas  encouraged spending.  Consumerism got out  of  hand,\r\n\r\nwhich was what happened during Japan's bubble economy  in\r\n\r\nthe  1980s,  leading  to  the eventual  collapse  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy in 1991 and 1992.  In Korea, the late 1980s  were\r\n\r\nheady,  pro-consumer years.  The 1988 Seoul Olympics  did\r\n\r\nfor the country what the 1964 Tokyo Olympics had done for\r\n\r\nJapan.   Anything  seemed possible.  By 1990,  the  trade\r\n\r\nsurplus  was  heading for the cellar, and the  government\r\n\r\nhad to fight back with a huge \"anti-luxury\" campaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, beyond all these economic cycles - and here I would like to assure Senior Minister of State\r\n\r\nKhaw  Boon  Wan  -  the human spirit is still strong  and\r\n\r\nresilient.   Singaporeans have more in mind than  getting\r\n\r\nthe  cheapest possible price and highest possible salary.\r\n\r\nThere are people who like to work hard and save and  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  Even lottery winners, who typically  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  society's most desirable jobs, do keep  on  working\r\n\r\neven\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafter  having cashed in.  In fact, people who  own  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  behave  in a self-exploitative,  economically\r\n\r\nirrational  way.  They typically work longer  hours  than\r\n\r\nnormal  employees and earn less money than they could  if\r\n\r\nthey sold their assets and invested the proceeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work culture must be preserved in order that\r\n\r\nour economy continues to grow and help spur on the spirit\r\n\r\nof  entrepreneurial drive in our people.  I am glad  that\r\n\r\nthis drive is getting strong support from the Government,\r\n\r\nstarting  from  our  education  system  right  up  to   a\r\n\r\ncommittee  looking into entrepreneurship led by  Minister\r\n\r\nof State, Mr Raymond Lim.  For a start, some cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  have  been  adopted,  such  as  the  employers'\r\n\r\ncontribution to CPF being capped at 16% for  another  two\r\n\r\nyears,  property tax rebates and certain  rental  rebates\r\n\r\namong  others.   Furthermore, a longer term  lowering  of\r\n\r\ncost  for entrepreneurs includes certain exemptions  from\r\n\r\nstatutory  audits and the use of limited partnership  and\r\n\r\nlimited liability partnership structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore moves towards a mature economy, it\r\n\r\nbecomes  harder to achieve growth based on  its  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy  which is constrained by the small  size  of  its\r\n\r\npopulation.  Our economic interest must then be to extend\r\n\r\nour  economic  boundary beyond our shores  to  the  world\r\n\r\nmarkets.    When  this  happens,  our  national  economic\r\n\r\ninterest  is at threat as Singapore companies  will  move\r\n\r\ntheir plants overseas to areas where labour and land  are\r\n\r\ncheaper.   As  pointed  out by  Robert  Reich,  a  former\r\n\r\nSecretary of Labour in the Clinton Administration in  his\r\n\r\nbook called \"The Work of Nations\", corporations had grown\r\n\r\npast  the  point where they could be considered American,\r\n\r\nGerman  or  Japanese.  With headquarters in one  country,\r\n\r\nresearch  centres  in  another, factories  in  yet  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  customers  all  around  the  world,  big\r\n\r\ndiversified corporations could be loyal only to their own\r\n\r\neconomic interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Porter, who was then President Bush's chief\r\n\r\ndomestic  policy  adviser in 1990, gave  a  speech  about\r\n\r\nAmerica's outlook on world trade.  Some people, he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaid, clung to the \"old notion of nations, companies, and\r\n\r\nmarkets  rigidly  defined by national borders\".   But  in\r\n\r\nthis  modern  age, he concluded that such  a  notion  was\r\n\r\n\"outdated and dangerous\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to still benefit from the scenario, we must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  refine our tax laws in ways  that  will  be\r\n\r\nattractive  for holding companies and their  headquarters\r\n\r\nto  be  sited in Singapore.  The move to exempt from  tax\r\n\r\nall  foreign  income  in the form  of  dividends,  branch\r\n\r\nprofits and services income from 1st June 2003 is a  good\r\n\r\nexample  in  making the case for local corporations  with\r\n\r\ninternational operations to have its base in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of continuing training and retraining\r\n\r\nof  Singapore workers as the economy restructures  itself\r\n\r\nis  a  commendable  move  by  the  Government.   It  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  even  when things get better.  As  an  example,\r\n\r\nnursing, though a very important function in the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession,  has  not  been popular  among  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nHowever,  through good collaboration between the  private\r\n\r\nhospitals  and training grants from the Government,  this\r\n\r\nprofession has now gained popularity as many educated and\r\n\r\nmature  workers,  who  have been  displaced  due  to  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of the economy, are now  turning  to  this\r\n\r\njob.   This  bold move is a far-reaching step with  great\r\n\r\nimplication for our economy, as corporations seek to move\r\n\r\ntowards  countries  that are more  educated  and  have  a\r\n\r\nskilled labour force.  Another example which I would like\r\n\r\nto   bring  to  Members'  attention  is  this.   Although\r\n\r\nChrysler  had its headquarters in Detroit and  Matsushita\r\n\r\nwas  based in Osaka, neither would necessarily care about\r\n\r\nthe government or labour force of its home country.  Each\r\n\r\nwould  go  wherever  the money, the market,  and  skilled\r\n\r\nworkforce drew it.  To quote Robert Reich again,  \"In  an\r\n\r\nage  of global corporations, a nation's well-being  rises\r\n\r\nor falls with the skills of its workers\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with increasing the wealth of its citizens,\r\n\r\nSingapore must be a place for present and future  wealthy\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  park their savings  and  assets.   These\r\n\r\nindividuals can be role models for budding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to emulate and overtake in wealth creation.\r\n\r\nThe  Budget  strives to achieve this.  Firstly,  interest\r\n\r\nwill  be  tax free in the hands of taxpayers irregardless\r\n\r\nof  which financial institution is used and the amount of\r\n\r\nmoney deposited.  Secondly, promoting the development  of\r\n\r\nworld-class  trustee and custodian services by  improving\r\n\r\nthe  tax environment for trusts.  However, Singapore will\r\n\r\nstill  find it difficult to compete with other  countries\r\n\r\nif  it  does not address the tax laws relating to  estate\r\n\r\nduty.   I  would  advocate that in developing  a  vibrant\r\n\r\ntrust industry, consideration should also be given to the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  abolishing death duties.   Beneficiaries\r\n\r\nwill then have the incentive to reinvest their wealth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore; thus, in turn, benefiting the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, for the present, capital\r\n\r\npreservation must be foremost in the minds in a declining\r\n\r\neconomy.   This  is  a  time when most  corporations  and\r\n\r\nindividuals   face   a   mismatch  between   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities.  In a period of growth, most businesses  and\r\n\r\nindividuals  are  less  concerned  if  their  liabilities\r\n\r\nexceed  their  assets as capital appreciation  will  soon\r\n\r\nreduce  the  gap  when their assets  increase  in  value.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when the economy reverses downwards, businesses\r\n\r\nand  individuals suffer from the deflationary effect  and\r\n\r\nthe  national economy will be pulled down as a result  of\r\n\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For individuals, most of their savings have been in\r\n\r\nthe  CPF.   Over  the good years, many have over-extended\r\n\r\ntheir  housing  needs by utilising their CPF  savings  on\r\n\r\nproperties  or  properties which would have  declined  in\r\n\r\nvalue  and,  in  some cases, below the  amount  of  their\r\n\r\nmortgage.  The same applies to those who have invested in\r\n\r\ndeclining equity markets.  The immediate response to such\r\n\r\ncircumstances  will  be  to  reduce  spending  and   lift\r\n\r\nsavings,  if  any.  When you get a greater  part  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  in  Singapore lifting  their  present  meagre\r\n\r\nratio  of savings to consumption, you will have  a  nasty\r\n\r\nimpact  on  demand and ultimately on the  health  of  the\r\n\r\ncorporate sector.  The size of the economy will shrink.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am happy to note that the Budget this year has\r\n\r\nstarted  the  process  of managing  the  rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nfactors of production, mainly, the cost of land, which in\r\n\r\nthe  longer term will help businesses and individuals  to\r\n\r\nbe  prudent  and match better their assets against  their\r\n\r\nliabilities.   When more businesses and  individuals  are\r\n\r\nless  highly geared with assets greater than liabilities,\r\n\r\nthen  the  ratio between savings to consumption  will  be\r\n\r\nmore manageable and demand will rise again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore can\r\n\r\novercome  its  problems in restructuring its  economy  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  we  have political stability and  the  will  to\r\n\r\novercome  difficulties.  The ability  for  a  country  to\r\n\r\nachieve a robust and vibrant economy need not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  from  a  country  big and rich in resources  as  past\r\n\r\neconomic  theory shows.  In this digital world,  size  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  barrier  to achieving prosperity.   Intelligence,\r\n\r\neducation and training, a stable pro-business Government,\r\n\r\nthe  ability  to adapt to a changing environment  and  to\r\n\r\ncapture   opportunities  are  now  the  key  to  national\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot had been spoken by the 30 speakers\r\n\r\nbefore  me.   I  will not belabour some of  the  positive\r\n\r\npoints  mentioned yesterday and today about  the  Budget,\r\n\r\nbut   will  instead  focus  on  what  I  believe  is  not\r\n\r\nadequately  addressed  by  the  Budget  or  the  Remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore  Committee.   These are ideas  that  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  make Singapore a better society  for  the\r\n\r\nlonger term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, budget deficit versus budget surplus.\r\n\r\nOverall,  this is a mildly acceptable budget.  There  are\r\n\r\nno   surprises  and  no  big  deficit  planned  to   help\r\n\r\nbusinesses and private individuals to tide over the  hard\r\n\r\ntimes  ahead.  Maybe the Minister is planning for another\r\n\r\noff-budget  deficit later in the year when things  really\r\n\r\nget  tough.   If not, the Government will have  lost  its\r\n\r\nmoral  right  to  demand and plan for huge  surpluses  in\r\n\r\nbetter years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the point for citizens to allow the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to accumulate huge reserves and surpluses  in\r\n\r\ngood  years, spend little of those surpluses in difficult\r\n\r\nyears,  and not give any report of the investment  return\r\n\r\non  the  accumulated surplus?  Nobody knows what  is  the\r\n\r\nreturn  on  investment  or the yield  till  date  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such figures were not disclosed. It will take many\r\n\r\nthousand  man-years to compile, we were  told.   This  is\r\n\r\nabsurd.  The Government can be a lot more transparent  to\r\n\r\nwin the people's trust.  It can also be more generous  by\r\n\r\nkeeping  the  GST  at  4%  till  the  economy  has  fully\r\n\r\nrecovered.   The  Government has the political  clout  to\r\n\r\nraise the GST if we ever get into a chronic deficit.  So,\r\n\r\nlet  us not worry too much about a chronic deficit  right\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Ministers should lead by example to send a\r\n\r\nstrong signal to investors by cutting their own high wage\r\n\r\ncost.   There is a lot of tweaking to the current  system\r\n\r\nto  lower business cost.  However, such tweaking does not\r\n\r\nsolve the fundamental problem of high and non-competitive\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost.   Like the recommended  CPF  wage  freeze\r\n\r\nproposed  for  workers, Government Ministers  and  senior\r\n\r\ncivil servants should take a similar 30% wage cut for two\r\n\r\nyears,  or  until the unemployment rate falls back  below\r\n\r\n3%.   If  the  Government  solves the  high  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem,  then  they deserve every right to  the  million\r\n\r\ndollar  salary  and  should get a performance  bonus  for\r\n\r\nthat.  But until that happens, there is no basis for such\r\n\r\nhigh  salary when unemployment is at a record high.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministers should be more  automatic  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like in the ERC Report, this will also send a strong\r\n\r\nsignal to all Singaporeans and foreign investors alike  - that  our  Government  leaders are  taking  the  personal\r\n\r\ninterest  to  decisively  reduce  high  wage  cost,   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  Singapore's competitive  position.   It  will\r\n\r\nalso  help  a  bit  in  reducing the Government's  feared\r\n\r\nchronic deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil service employees and Government officials\r\n\r\nhave long enjoyed security\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  employment.  Unlike workers from the private  sector,\r\n\r\nthey are less likely to be retrenched.  Even if they  are\r\n\r\nretrenched,   like   recently,   they   get   very   good\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits that so many actually  volunteered\r\n\r\nto be retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the 1994 salary revisions, the\r\n\r\ncompensation  for  the civil service has  reached  parity\r\n\r\nwith  the private sector.  Bonuses were paid without  the\r\n\r\nsame degree of rigorous benchmarking that is a feature of\r\n\r\nthe  commercial world.  They can get away with any honest\r\n\r\nmistake, while a private sector CEO will immediately  get\r\n\r\nthe boot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with an insecure and uncertain economy moving\r\n\r\nforward,  the  stability  of careers  for  senior  public\r\n\r\nsector  employees and Government officials  has  exceeded\r\n\r\nparity.  In fact, they are better off than many people in\r\n\r\nthe  private sector.  They have high wages and  a  secure\r\n\r\nincome  stream.  This is not correct.  The Budget  failed\r\n\r\nto address high civil service wage cost and this needs to\r\n\r\nbe corrected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the concept of retirement, jobs and the CPF.\r\n\r\nI  am happy to hear that the Deputy Speaker, Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua,  is in common agreement with me that the concept  of\r\n\r\nretirement needs to be corrected.  I will touch  on  more\r\n\r\nof   it  at  the  coming  Committee  of  Supply  debates.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I want to touch on the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government restructured the CPF to focus on the\r\n\r\nbasic retirement needs of Singaporeans.  The question is:\r\n\r\ncan Singaporeans afford to retire in Singapore?  I do not\r\n\r\nthink  so.   With  such high cost and high  standards  of\r\n\r\nliving - after deducting medical and housing needs -  how\r\n\r\nmany  years  can the limited amount in the  CPF  last  an\r\n\r\nemployee?  If the majority of Singaporeans are not  going\r\n\r\nto be able to retire with the limited savings in the CPF,\r\n\r\nplease  tell us so.  Stop kidding Singaporeans that  they\r\n\r\ncan   make  use  of  their  CPF  to  pull  through  their\r\n\r\nretirement needs.  It is not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the Singaporeans out there, retirement is\r\n\r\nonly  for the rich and financially able.  If you  do  not\r\n\r\nhave money to buy food and pay bills, you will need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork,  never mind that you have reached 65.  Even begging\r\n\r\nis  a form of work, though non-productive and not allowed\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  This is the reality of life in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  you  do not have money, retirement is not an  option.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  is  not  going  to  take  care  of  you.\r\n\r\nRetirement  is a luxury for the rich, and for  those  who\r\n\r\ncan afford to stay unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is job choosiness. If you are a responsible\r\n\r\nperson, with responsibility to fulfill and bills to  pay,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot be that choosy about the next job.   If  your\r\n\r\ncurrent  job is going to be gone, you will need to  start\r\n\r\nhunting  for the next stockpile of cheese.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nwelfare  in  Singapore, so stop looking to the Government\r\n\r\nfor handouts.  They are not giving us any.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn new skills while you can - where funds are\r\n\r\ncurrently provided by the Government.  Make good  use  of\r\n\r\nit  and  do  not be resistant to change - for  change  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a constant in our society.  Increase  your\r\n\r\nknowledge,  for  knowledge increases our economic  value.\r\n\r\nBe  gung-ho in trying out new ideas.  Who knows, you  may\r\n\r\nbe the next Olivia Lum in the making.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on my next point. The whole concept of CPF\r\n\r\nsavings for retirement also needs to be changed.  The ERC\r\n\r\nReport  has  failed  to  address this  foundation  stone.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is too hot for them to handle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory CPF savings is good. It is a prudent\r\n\r\npolicy to enforce savings on good working days.  But what\r\n\r\nhappens  when things go bad and there are rainy days  for\r\n\r\nmonths?   Before our citizens can retire to  enjoy  their\r\n\r\nretirement  savings, they might have died  of  stress  or\r\n\r\nhunger  due  to  lack of money and job.  So  let  us  not\r\n\r\nbegrudge what rightly belongs to our members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With certain safeguards and clear guidelines, the\r\n\r\nGovernment should allow our citizens to borrow from their\r\n\r\nown  CPF  savings for emergency and rainy days - to  tide\r\n\r\nthem  over their difficult period.  If members can borrow\r\n\r\nfrom their own CPF to buy depreciating property and money\r\n\r\nlosing stocks, there is no reason why they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare not allowed to borrow from their own CPF to buy their\r\n\r\nnext  meal or pay their next bill.  And when they  return\r\n\r\nto  the job market, they can start to repay back the loan\r\n\r\namount  over an instalment period.  If members  can  take\r\n\r\nprivate  bank loans, there is no reason why they are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to borrow from their own retirement savings  for\r\n\r\nneedy days.  This sacred cow needs to be slaughtered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, go beyond being a factory for others. 80%\r\n\r\nof  our  exports are manufactured products.  We had  done\r\n\r\nwell  as a centre for manufacturing excellence.  The  sad\r\n\r\nthing  is  that  little  of those  manufactured  products\r\n\r\nbelong  to Singaporeans.  We do not own the designs,  the\r\n\r\ninventions or the brands.  Being efficient and productive\r\n\r\nis  not  enough.  We must go beyond being a  factory  for\r\n\r\nothers.   We  need  to  be owners of  these  manufactured\r\n\r\nproducts  and  brands.  If we just rely on upgrading  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing with new technologies and capabilities,  we\r\n\r\nwill be heading for failure when other low cost countries\r\n\r\ncatch up with advanced technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to celebrate those businessmen who create\r\n\r\nnew  products, generate interest, create demands and make\r\n\r\ngood  profits along the way.  We, as a Singapore society,\r\n\r\nmust  generate new brands and repackage old products that\r\n\r\nwe  can  market to the whole world.  So, consumer brands,\r\n\r\nlike  Eu  Yan Sang, Osim, Tung Lok and BreadTalk must  be\r\n\r\ncelebrated, encouraged and expanded.  All these companies\r\n\r\nhave  one  common  thread.   They  have  the  ability  to\r\n\r\ngenerate   a   new   marketable  brand   following   from\r\n\r\nrepackaging a stale old product.  There are  a  lot  more\r\n\r\nlesser brands out there that can be helped to expand  and\r\n\r\ngrow regionally.  MTI and Spring Singapore can take on  a\r\n\r\nmore  strenuous  effort to identify and  give  them  more\r\n\r\npersonalised support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stupid of us to expand overseas by building\r\n\r\nfactories and industrial parks alone.  Aim higher and get\r\n\r\nothers  to  work  by manufacturing for us.   We  need  to\r\n\r\ngenerate   good  international  brand  names  with   good\r\n\r\nproducts that citizens of the world are willing  to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir pants - to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuy  from us.  That calls for good marketing and branding\r\n\r\n-   something  that  is  very  important,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has failed to recognise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, to my last point on benefits of being a\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizen.    Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   while   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seeks  to welcome international  talents  and\r\n\r\nskilled workers to reinforce our limited pool, and  build\r\n\r\na  critical mass of talents to contribute to our economy,\r\n\r\nwe  need to show greater appreciation of our own citizens\r\n\r\nand  offer them something more than what non-citizens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore can get.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership must have its privileges. Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust have greater privilege than non-citizens, so much so\r\n\r\nthat highly talented foreigners will queue up to sign  up\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship.  However, at the moment, the Government\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  taking  the support  of  Singaporeans  for\r\n\r\ngranted.   Foreigners seem to be wooed with  red  carpet,\r\n\r\nopen  arms  and  good pay to come to work  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, on the other hand, are getting  retrenched,\r\n\r\ngetting pay cut and told to lower their expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans complain to me that they only see\r\n\r\nliability  in  being  a citizen.   There  is  no  visible\r\n\r\nbenefit.  They say they cannot vote because it is  always\r\n\r\na   walkover   in  their  constituencies.   They   cannot\r\n\r\nparticipate  in policy making too because  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nwill  not  listen to them, ikan bilis.   They  feel  like\r\n\r\nbeing forced to live in a five-star hotel with no say  in\r\n\r\nhow  the hotel is run, while struggling hard to make ends\r\n\r\nmeet.  They were told to lower their expectations because\r\n\r\nthe Government invites lower cost skilled foreign workers\r\n\r\nand talents to come in and compete with them.  They asked\r\n\r\nwhat are the benefits of citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, for the male citizens, they need to give up 2\r\n\r\n1/2 years of their prime youth to do National Service  to\r\n\r\ndefend  their  country.  On top of  that,  it  is  up  to\r\n\r\nanother  40 days a year, away from building their  career\r\n\r\nto  do  reservist training.  Foreign talents and  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  do not.  They enjoy the peace and security  that\r\n\r\nSingapore men provide through offering\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNational  Service  and  they  get  good  pay  along  with\r\n\r\nbuilding their careers.  No wonder many male Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare   talking  about  migration  and  giving   up   their\r\n\r\ncitizenship if they have a choice.  Maybe they intend  to\r\n\r\ncome back as a foreign talent to work in Singapore, to be\r\n\r\nbetter  appreciated by the Government,  and  without  the\r\n\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is something wrong here that\r\n\r\nthis  Government  has failed to address.   Membership  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  have  its privileges.   Many  young  and\r\n\r\nmobile  Singaporeans  are saying  that  there  is  little\r\n\r\nprivilege  and  more  liability, and  it  is  better  off\r\n\r\nwithout.   This is not right and the Government needs  to\r\n\r\nget  this  corrected.  There must be strong economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  reasons for Singaporeans to be proud to  want  to\r\n\r\nremain as a Singapore citizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic reason could be in the form of lower\r\n\r\ntax  rate for working citizens, more so for male citizens\r\n\r\nstill  active in serving their NS liability.  The  social\r\n\r\nreason could be the concept of what does Singapore  stand\r\n\r\nfor.   The US stands for freedom and opportunity.   China\r\n\r\nstands  for  economic  progress.  India  stands  for  the\r\n\r\nlargest  democracy  in the world.   What  does  Singapore\r\n\r\nstand  for?  Currently, most Singaporeans think  that  it\r\n\r\nstands for PAP - poor also pay!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we can identify and agree on what truly we\r\n\r\nstand for as a society, we are not going to inspire pride\r\n\r\nin  our  citizens.  To me, Singapore must  aim  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsymbol for vibrancy, originality and affluence.  It is an\r\n\r\nideal  end-state that talented mobile citizens  can  look\r\n\r\nforward to and be inspired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the five\r\n\r\npoints  that are important ideas to make and help  remake\r\n\r\nSingapore towards the next level of prosperity.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government can take up these points and expand  from\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to seek some\r\n\r\nclarification from Mr Steve Chia.  Sir, he  mentioned  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech about what Singapore stands for and a lot  of\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomplaining  about not being able to participate  in  the\r\n\r\nelections  because  there was no  alternative  to  choose\r\n\r\nfrom.   Does he agree that, despite all these complaints,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  stand  for  and  without  the  opportunity   to\r\n\r\nparticipate,  Singaporeans  themselves  should  do  their\r\n\r\npart?  The basic thing is that you are born here, you are\r\n\r\ncitizens here, and you are masters of this land.  If  you\r\n\r\nsee  something wrong, does he not think that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  complain  should participate to make it  right?   If\r\n\r\nthey  find  there is not sufficient Opposition to  choose\r\n\r\nfrom  during the elections, then come forward to  support\r\n\r\nour   position,  join  the  Opposition  party  and  offer\r\n\r\nthemselves as candidates.  Then you have a choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, that is not a clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think you need to answer that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore  I  begin my speech, I would like to take  up  two\r\n\r\npoints that the NCMP Mr Steve Chia mentioned earlier.   I\r\n\r\nam  actually quite surprised that he felt that the Budget\r\n\r\nhas no plans to help businesses and individuals.  I think\r\n\r\nspeaker after speaker, as well as the people outside this\r\n\r\nHouse,  have spoken up about how the Budget aims to  help\r\n\r\nbusinesses, create jobs and preserve jobs.  In fact,  Mrs\r\n\r\nFang  Ai  Lian,  NMP, has also mentioned about  the  many\r\n\r\nbenefits  that  this  Budget will produce  and  the  many\r\n\r\nsacred  cows that the Budget has actually slaughtered  in\r\n\r\norder to lay the foundation to revitalise the economy and\r\n\r\nprepare the economy for the next phase of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the issue of chronic deficit, I think\r\n\r\nthat  we need look no further than Hong Kong to see  what\r\n\r\nthe problems are if you actually work on a budget deficit\r\n\r\nyear after year.  Hong Kong now, for instance, instead of\r\n\r\nreducing their income tax, has to increase the income tax\r\n\r\nbecause of the chronic budget deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd,  additionally, they are also thinking that they  may\r\n\r\nhave to impose GST to help them get over this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards benefits of being a Singapore citizen, I\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Steve Chia who is himself a Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nwould  remember that he must have benefited from the  ERS\r\n\r\nand  NSS,  as  well as the fact that NSmen  actually  get\r\n\r\nextra  ERS  and NSS shares.  There is also obviously  the\r\n\r\nupgrading benefit.  So I do not know why Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nsaying  that they do not get benefits.  In fact, when  we\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  constituency and do interim upgrading,  very\r\n\r\noften, it is the permanent resident who says that he does\r\n\r\nnot  get the benefits and why only the Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nactually get additional benefits.  So I think it is quite\r\n\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked what does Singapore stand for. I\r\n\r\nthink he has answered it himself.  He said that Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  city that stands for talent, vibrancy  and\r\n\r\naffluence.   I think that is what Singapore is  and  many\r\n\r\npeople will not disagree with that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget 2003 has aptly been entitled\r\n\r\n\"Seizing  Opportunity in Uncertainty\".  These  are  truly\r\n\r\nmomentous times facing us as a nation.  A recent piece by\r\n\r\nStraits  Times journalist, Ms Chua Lee Hoong,  warned  of\r\n\r\nthe  danger  of failing to recognise that the  challenges\r\n\r\nfacing us are vastly different from the ones before.  The\r\n\r\nsame  day  that Ms Chua wrote her article in the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  Streats  reported billionnaire,  Warren  Buffett,\r\n\r\nissuing a warning of the damage that derivatives -  which\r\n\r\nhe  calls \"financial weapons of mass destruction\"- can do\r\n\r\nto the global economy.  We are standing on the edge of  a\r\n\r\nprecipice,  with  a  coalition of  forces  conspiring  to\r\n\r\ncreate a vastly different world order.  Greed - Enron and\r\n\r\nWorld.com; malevolence - Iraq and the Al Qaeda  terrorist\r\n\r\nnetwork;  nuclear  brinkmanship -  North  Korea;  and  an\r\n\r\ninsatiable thirst for economic success - China  and  many\r\n\r\nother developing countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget may be construed by some as a\r\n\r\ndisappointing  one,  because the hoped-for  tax  cuts  or\r\n\r\npersonal rebates did\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot materialise.  But, in truth, Budget 2003 is a holding\r\n\r\nbudget, helping us to take the first few steps towards  a\r\n\r\nre-engineering of our social and economic DNA, so that we\r\n\r\ncan  better face the challenges of a different  and  more\r\n\r\nunpredictable world ahead.  Fiscal demand boosters,  such\r\n\r\nas  tax  cuts  or higher rebates, will not  be  effective\r\n\r\nagainst  a backdrop of the Middle East war that  has,  in\r\n\r\nsome ways, already begun.  Even in the scenario that  war\r\n\r\ndoes  not  break out, the UN debate has already polarised\r\n\r\nthe  world.  Therefore, we must not be seeking short-term\r\n\r\nsolutions to our longer-term problems, although there  is\r\n\r\nalso a need to hear the cries of the disenfranchised  and\r\n\r\nless well-off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Hong Kong - like I said earlier - because of its dire fiscal position, has been forced to\r\n\r\nraise  taxes, the first in nearly two decades, at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the economic outlook is perhaps more grim  than  we\r\n\r\ncan  imagine.   Yet, we cannot gloat over  their  present\r\n\r\npredicament,  because the resilience  of  the  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\npeople  is  legendary, and neither  must  we  forget  the\r\n\r\nsalivating prospect of Hong Kong being part of  the  vast\r\n\r\nPearl  River  Delta hinterland, one of  China's  economic\r\n\r\npowerhouses.  If the SAR Administration can get their act\r\n\r\ntogether,  they are well capable of overtaking us  again.\r\n\r\nSo,  the threat can come not only from newer competitors,\r\n\r\nlike  Tanjung  Pelapas  and  KLIA,  but  also  from   the\r\n\r\nresurgence of older competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am by no means an ardent football fan, but many of\r\n\r\nmy office colleagues - and I am sure many hon. Members in\r\n\r\nthis House - are.  I liken this competitive threat to the\r\n\r\nintense rivalry between top English Premier League teams,\r\n\r\nManchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, each of\r\n\r\nthem  jostling for primacy.  Even if one of  these  teams\r\n\r\nfalters  in  one  season, it would be a  grave  error  to\r\n\r\nignore  that  team, and that is because the  pedigree  of\r\n\r\nthese top teams means that any one of them is capable  of\r\n\r\nstaging  a comeback and winning top honours.  The  brutal\r\n\r\nrealities of global competition are here to stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with some specific areas in the\r\n\r\nbudget.  Taking the line of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nERC Report, I wish to speak, first of all, about the long-term   structural  issues  focusing  on   the   perennial\r\n\r\nfavourites - SMEs, enterprise promotion and the  role  of\r\n\r\nGovernment and Government-related organisations.  Then, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  say  something  on refining  the  measures  for\r\n\r\nalleviating the short-term pains of the current downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, SMEs and enterprise promotion. While MNCs\r\n\r\nhave  been  assiduously courted, it has  been  recognised\r\n\r\nthat  the  domestic  enterprise sector  still  employs  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively  larger  number of  workers  than  the  MNC\r\n\r\nsector,  but  lags significantly behind the  latter  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, needs help.  The hurdles SMEs face  are  well-known, and have already received an airing in this House.\r\n\r\nLack   of   access  to  capital,  inefficiency   business\r\n\r\npractices,  difficulty in attracting quality  staff  and,\r\n\r\nmost controversially, the threat of GLCs.  The budget has\r\n\r\nintroduced    many    welcome   measures    to    promote\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship and help domestic enterprises.  There is\r\n\r\nthe   Pro-Enterprise  Panel  to  act  on  feedback   from\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  on  Government rules  and  regulations  that\r\n\r\nmight  increase  business  cost  and  stifle  enterprise.\r\n\r\nThere  is  now even a rule about rules.  All  rules  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  5-year  shelf life and are renewable  only  upon\r\n\r\nadequate justification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in, these are laudable, wide-ranging and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive efforts by the Government.  But, as  in  so\r\n\r\nmany other things, the real test is in the implementation\r\n\r\nof  these  programmes.   Yesterday,  the  newly-appointed\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State for Entrepreneurship  noted  that  to\r\n\r\nshift mindsets, the Government should, when dealing  with\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  set  its default key at  \"Yes\"  rather  than\r\n\r\n\"No\".  I am indeed pleased that the Minister of State has\r\n\r\nmade this commitment.  However, Sir, I believe that, very\r\n\r\noften, whilst Ministers and top officials may have  their\r\n\r\ndefault  buttons set at \"Yes\", this may  not  be  so  for\r\n\r\nothers down the line.  For the officers executing policy,\r\n\r\na    \"Yes\"    default   button   does   mean   additional\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, greater fuzziness and a higher risk  of\r\n\r\nunintended outcomes - something antithetical to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   historically  low-risk  tolerance  of   the   civil\r\n\r\nservants.  But this is well worth the price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister of State to\r\n\r\nremind  all  officials at all levels  of  Government  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-related  organisations  who  deal   with   the\r\n\r\npublic, from the managers to the front-line officers,  to\r\n\r\nre-set their default button to \"Yes\", so that a truly pro-enterprise  environment can develop, and entrepreneurship\r\n\r\ncan flourish unfettered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my parliamentary colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee,\r\n\r\nmentioned NUTS in his speech yesterday.  Credit for  this\r\n\r\nphrase should also go to our doyen of Creativity, Mr  Sim\r\n\r\nWong Hoo, who wrote the book Chaotic Thoughts for the New\r\n\r\nMillennium.  In it, he described various situations  when\r\n\r\nthe  \"No\" default button characteristic of people with  a\r\n\r\nNUTS  mentality drove him nuts!  Let me read one  out  to\r\n\r\nyou:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When our corporate headquarters were completed in\r\n\r\n1997, we needed to give it a name.  The placeholder  name\r\n\r\nwas Creative Technology Centre.  Made sense, but it was a\r\n\r\nboring name that everybody had.  I wanted a special name,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  'creative'.  So the usual  names  like,\r\n\r\n'Creative  Building,  Plaza,  Complex,  House  ...'  were\r\n\r\nsuggested  on  the name list.  I rejected  all  of  them.\r\n\r\nFinally,  we  came out with a very good  name,  'Creative\r\n\r\nResource'  - the source of all creativity - and everybody\r\n\r\nloved it.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wait, before we could go ahead, we had to submit\r\n\r\nthe building name for approval.  What!  I was shocked.  I\r\n\r\nneeded  somebody else's approval for the name of  my  own\r\n\r\nbuilding  by some faceless committee that I did not  even\r\n\r\nknow existed.  Imagine having the name of your baby being\r\n\r\napproved by somebody you do not know.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, that is the regulation. OK, we submitted and\r\n\r\nno  prize for guessing the right answer.  The answer  was\r\n\r\nNO.   The reason given was that the name was not 'Centre,\r\n\r\nPlaza, Building, Complex, House, etc ...\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was actually a list of approved names in the\r\n\r\nrulebook  and we were only given the impression  that  we\r\n\r\ncould name our own building.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nearly jumped through the roof when I heard the\r\n\r\nanswer.   It was a very typical case of NUTS.  'Resource'\r\n\r\nwas  not in their rulebook, hence the standard answer was\r\n\r\nNO.   I  was not going to give up on this, right?  So  we\r\n\r\nfought back and wrote letters to appeal.  Finally,  after\r\n\r\na long process, our name was approved.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure hon. Members of this House will smile\r\n\r\nat this incident, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsetting our civil service default button to \"Yes\"  across\r\n\r\nall levels will be a challenge to very established habits\r\n\r\nof  mind,  but something we must not let up  on.   And  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  that  is  the  reason why this  issue  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought up year after year in this House.  But I am  more\r\n\r\noptimistic this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many SMEs have also complained of the need to deal\r\n\r\nwith  an  inordinately  large  number  of  agencies  when\r\n\r\napplying for various schemes.  The establishment  of  SME\r\n\r\nFirst  Stop, which is a call centre set up by  SPRING  to\r\n\r\nact  as a bridge connecting SMEs to the various agencies,\r\n\r\nhas  alleviated  the problem.  However, further  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  SMEs  is  that it will be better if the  First-Stop\r\n\r\nbecomes a One-Stop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING could be the one-stop centralised\r\n\r\ncoordinating agency charged to deal with all, or at least\r\n\r\nmost,  issues  faced by SMEs.  This would further  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  current  labyrinth of agencies and  conditions  that\r\n\r\nSMEs  have to navigate before they can get help for their\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, one could argue that entrepreneurs must\r\n\r\nmake the effort to seek assistance, and should not expect\r\n\r\neverything on a platter.  But there is a Cantonese saying\r\n\r\nthat  best sums up the spirit of what I want to say here,\r\n\r\nand  I  hope the Minister for Education and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Information, Communications and the Arts will forgive\r\n\r\nthis  lapse.  The Cantonese saying is: \"Pong yan pong  do\r\n\r\ntai,  song  fa  song do sei\", which means  that  when  we\r\n\r\nrender  help, we should go the distance and complete  the\r\n\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Minister of State for Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nhimself noted that countries like Taiwan and Hong Kong do\r\n\r\nhelp their entrepreneurs by creating the right conditions\r\n\r\nfor  start-ups,  and  even those in  Silicon  Valley  are\r\n\r\nindirectly assisted by the high defence spending  in  the\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pressing issue which Budget 2003 has not\r\n\r\nadequately  addressed  is access to affordable  financing\r\n\r\nfor  SMEs, especially start-ups.  Although the Government\r\n\r\nhas, over the years, made available\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvarious financial assistance schemes for SMEs, there  are\r\n\r\nstill  persistent  complaints about the accessibility  to\r\n\r\ncapital  and low cost financing.  Again, the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState,  Mr Raymond Lim, had noted in his speech that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  not \"throw money at the  problem\".   He\r\n\r\nsaid that it is like having an ATM machine, in which  you\r\n\r\nkey in the word 'entrepreneurs\" and out comes a stash  of\r\n\r\ncash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His analogy reminds me of my eldest daughter when\r\n\r\nshe  was  a 2-year old.  When I told her on one  occasion\r\n\r\nthat  I  did  not have the money to buy her the  toy  she\r\n\r\ndesired, she told me that I could just go to the  machine\r\n\r\non  the wall and press the buttons for cash!  In reality,\r\n\r\nmost  businessmen, unlike children, know that  they  will\r\n\r\nhave  to deposit some cash into the bank before they  can\r\n\r\nwithdraw the money. The philosophy that there is no  free\r\n\r\nlunch has been touted often enough, and most are under no\r\n\r\nillusion  that the Government will easily throw money  at\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these SMEs are appealing that there be a\r\n\r\nwider  spectrum  of financing options made  available  to\r\n\r\nthem and that the conditions for obtaining such loans are\r\n\r\nnot  made  unnecessarily onerous.  Many SMEs,  especially\r\n\r\nstart-ups, find it difficult to meet the requirements  of\r\n\r\na  secure  collateral,  track record  and  minimum  self-financing that are needed before any loan can be extended\r\n\r\nby  the banks.  Additionally, on the side of the lenders,\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  required to assess the viability  of  SME\r\n\r\nbusiness  proposals  by banks, or even  SPRING  Singapore\r\n\r\nofficials,  may  also be lacking.   To  this  end,  I  am\r\n\r\nproposing  that  perhaps a committee comprising  industry\r\n\r\npractitioners could be set up to assess such loans, where\r\n\r\nthe  industry  knowledge is lacking on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nlenders, particularly SPRING and other Government-related\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate this problem, there have also been\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  ranging from setting  up  a  SME  Bank,  to\r\n\r\nextending  the  Start-up  Enterprise  Development  Scheme\r\n\r\n(SEEDS)   which  is  administered  by  EDB  to   domestic\r\n\r\nenterprise.   Other  suggestions include  allowing  fully\r\n\r\npaid-up HDB flats to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  used as security for business loans, setting up of  a\r\n\r\nprivate  equity  exchange, encouraging local  enterprises\r\n\r\nand   GLCs  to  provide  venture  capital  to  SMEs,  and\r\n\r\npromoting the establishment of a SME credit bureau.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the newly-appointed Minister of\r\n\r\nState   for  Entrepreneurship  to  look  seriously   into\r\n\r\nimplementing   at   least   some   of   these   financing\r\n\r\nalternatives as soon as possible, as access  to  low-cost\r\n\r\nfinancing  is the lifeblood of business.  SMEs  will  not\r\n\r\ngrow, no matter how many SME-friendly measures are put in\r\n\r\nplace, without the lifeblood that is needed to keep  them\r\n\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the role of Government\r\n\r\nand  Government-related organisations.  Related  to  this\r\n\r\nwhole  issue  of SMEs is the influence of Government  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-related organisations.  The common grouse  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  that GLCs crowd out the private sector,  and\r\n\r\nthis  has  been the subject of vigorous debate  over  the\r\n\r\nmotion on the Temasek Charter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support the Government's move as\r\n\r\nannounced  in Budget 2003 to, among others, progressively\r\n\r\nstop  providing  services that  the  private  sector  can\r\n\r\nsupply, and review all Government-related companies every\r\n\r\nthree years.  In fact, I think many of these measures are\r\n\r\nlong  overdue, judging by the calls and appeals that  had\r\n\r\nbeen persistently made in the past, even in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some TLCs have added a multiplicity of businesses\r\n\r\nthat  it  seems incongruous to outsiders.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nwhat  business does PSB Corp now have in running  courses\r\n\r\nwhen  there are so many private education firms that  can\r\n\r\ndo  them?   By  the same token, why is HDBay involved  in\r\n\r\nproviding  interior designing services and developing  e-commerce  applications when there  are  already  so  many\r\n\r\nexisting  interior design firms competing  for  the  same\r\n\r\npie?   If errant renovation contractors were the problem,\r\n\r\nthen  the HDB's role should at most be one of accrediting\r\n\r\nrenovation contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministries and statutory boards therefore\r\n\r\nto  limit  the  scope of the activities  of  agencies  or\r\n\r\ncompanies they spawn.  Such agencies or companies should,\r\n\r\nunless  they  are of a strategic nature or operate  in  a\r\n\r\nsphere  where  the  private sector is deemed  not  ready,\r\n\r\nconfine  themselves  to policy and  promotion,  and  also\r\n\r\nchampion the involvement of the private sector to  supply\r\n\r\nservices  to realise its core mission.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nproposed  statutory  board for Continuing  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining,  which  I  fully  endorse,  should  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible  outsource the courses it plans rather than  try\r\n\r\nto  do  them itself.  The IDA and several other  agencies\r\n\r\nrecently issued a call for business collaboration to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  to  co-develop new business  models  for\r\n\r\nlocation-based  services based  on  Government  data.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is an excellent example of how  the  private\r\n\r\nsector can work with the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the recent appointment by SLA of a real\r\n\r\nestate  agent  to sell their property at  Tiong  Bahru  - unfortunately  it is not my firm - at what  was  an  eye-popping fee, demonstrates just how much cost savings  can\r\n\r\nbe  achieved  when  the Ministries and  statutory  boards\r\n\r\nassiduously   seek   private-sector   participation    in\r\n\r\nimplementing  its  policies.  Such  moves  would  further\r\n\r\nfacilitate  entrepreneurship and the growth of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, services sector. The Government's\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  the  ERC's recommendation  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Committee on Services to be chaired  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance is  an\r\n\r\nexcellent step forward to grow the services sector  which\r\n\r\nhitherto   has   largely  remained  the  step-sister   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.  However, several key issues still need to\r\n\r\nbe resolved if we are to grow our services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost is the issue of adequate and\r\n\r\nappropriate  manpower.  The service delivery standard  of\r\n\r\nmany  frontline workers in these services sector are also\r\n\r\nless than satisfactory, such as in the retail industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Retail Academy of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   spearheaded  by  the  Singapore   Retalier's\r\n\r\nAssociation, is a one-stop place to raise the quality  of\r\n\r\nour  retail staff to world-class standard and this  is  a\r\n\r\npositive step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, perhaps through the soon-to-be\r\n\r\nestablished  statutory  board on CET,  should  look  into\r\n\r\ntraining  and  job enhancement schemes  for  the  various\r\n\r\nservices  sector, including nursing assistants, cleaners,\r\n\r\nwaiters, chambermaids and waste collectors, to help these\r\n\r\njobs gain greater acceptance as well as raise the service\r\n\r\nstandards of such jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cleaning and waste collection companies I know\r\n\r\nof  have  often complained about their manpower problems.\r\n\r\nThey  say that it is very common for Singaporeans to pack\r\n\r\nup  and leave their jobs after three days, unable to take\r\n\r\nwhat they deem as the harsh and unpleasant conditions  of\r\n\r\nthe job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our retail sales staff are, for instance, famous for\r\n\r\ntheir  one-liner answers such as \"All here already, lah!\"\r\n\r\nwhen  you ask them if the product is available in another\r\n\r\ncolour  or  size.   One  also  wonders  why  it   is   so\r\n\r\ncoincidental that none of the waiters or waitresses at  a\r\n\r\nrestaurant is looking at your direction when you want  to\r\n\r\nask someone for help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major issue that should be tackled is the\r\n\r\nremoval of regulatory impediments that stifle the  growth\r\n\r\nof  the  services sector.  For instance, while we  remain\r\n\r\nunable  to  secure  adequate  numbers  of  trained  local\r\n\r\nworkers for, say, the spa industry which we are trying to\r\n\r\npromote, we should be open to relaxing our foreign worker\r\n\r\npolicies for such sectors. After all, as the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade  and Industry often put forth as justification  for\r\n\r\nthe presence of foreign workers, they help to ensure that\r\n\r\nthese  businesses remain viable and thus  along  the  way\r\n\r\nalso create jobs for our locals which would otherwise not\r\n\r\nbe available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, alleviating short-term pains. The Budget\r\n\r\ndoes have some goodies for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nordinary  Singaporeans  -  rent  and  conservancy  charge\r\n\r\nrebates,  property tax rebates, the ERS  shares  to  help\r\n\r\noffset the impact of the GST hike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to continue to move\r\n\r\ntowards  a more focused and perhaps community-based  help\r\n\r\nsystem.   A  one-size-fits-all  approach  does  not  work\r\n\r\nbecause  aid  does  not  go  where  it  is  most  needed.\r\n\r\nSpreading  wealth like distribution of  ERS  shares  when\r\n\r\nthere  are  surpluses or during times of strong  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  is  acceptable,  but in the  new  economy,  where\r\n\r\nincome  spread  will  widen, it is  more  appropriate  to\r\n\r\nrender  help  where help is more sorely  needed.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  very  reassuring  to  hear  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  say  that  the Government will  concentrate  its\r\n\r\nsocial  safety  nets on the minority of Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nneed  them  most. This will ensure that the help  reaches\r\n\r\nthe  neediest Singaporeans without undermining  our  work\r\n\r\nethic  and  culture of self-reliance.  It is  a  delicate\r\n\r\nbalance, but one which I judge could be finally met  with\r\n\r\nthis statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, as structural unemployment becomes a\r\n\r\nnorm rather than an exception, the Government should  put\r\n\r\nin  place  measures  to  help  this  group  of  displaced\r\n\r\nworkers.   Whilst  we do not want to encourage  a  crutch\r\n\r\nmentality, the reality is that structural unemployment is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  become  the  norm,  there  would  always   be\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers who desperately need help until  they\r\n\r\nfind the next job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, an interim financial package akin to the EDRS\r\n\r\nbut  with  more clearly defined and stringent  conditions\r\n\r\ncould  be set up to grant short-term financial assistance\r\n\r\nto those who are really in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premier Zhu Rongji, in his farewell address to the\r\n\r\nNational People's Congress, spoke on public servants  who\r\n\r\nuphold  the  law and truly serve the public  -  combining\r\n\r\naggressive pursuit of economic growth with compassion for\r\n\r\nthe laggards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers quoted him as saying, \"Government\r\n\r\nofficials at all levels should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  people  in their neighbourhoods  and  homes,\r\n\r\nlisten  to  their  views, care about their  hardship  and\r\n\r\npromptly attend to their grievances.\"  Indeed, this is  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  well-worth taking up for the   Government  and\r\n\r\nMembers of this House, including myself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the apparent \"tameness\",\r\n\r\nthis  Budget is, in reality, a watershed Budget.  I  also\r\n\r\nsee  this  Budget  as  a work-in-progress  of  the  ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for  Singapore's long-term  growth.   It\r\n\r\nmakes  an  unequivocal  call  for  the  Ministries,   the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards and the public sector to  change  their\r\n\r\npractices  where  they hinder private sector  enterprise.\r\n\r\nAs  DPM Lee noted, \"In Singapore, an entrepreneurial  and\r\n\r\ninnovative  civil  service  bureaucracy  must  not  be  a\r\n\r\ncontradiction  in  terms.\"  Indeed, many  of  the  policy\r\n\r\nchanges  announced  in Budget 2003, such  as  the  Yellow\r\n\r\nPages rule and public sector market testing, require  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and Government-linked organisations to  change\r\n\r\ntheir  mindsets  and venture out of their  comfort  zone.\r\n\r\nWithout minimising the importance of doing so, let us not\r\n\r\nbrush  aside the wrenching adjustments this will  require\r\n\r\nof the civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see this as the start of a journey to reform\r\n\r\nGovernment  thinking. We may be far from the destination,\r\n\r\nbut  it is at least a good start. At the same time,  this\r\n\r\nmust  be  matched by a national movement for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  discard  a crutch mentality of wanting handouts,  and\r\n\r\ninstead  be more adventurous, more daring, more  tolerant\r\n\r\nof  failure,  and  more resilient amidst  the  storms  of\r\n\r\nadversity.   At the grassroots level, often  we  see  the\r\n\r\nhandout  mentality manifesting itself, especially  during\r\n\r\nthese  challenging times, but I have every reason  to  be\r\n\r\nhopeful  that  the mindsets and the constitution  of  our\r\n\r\npeople, especially the young, are changing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily press nowadays have regular ventures of\r\n\r\nyoung Singaporeans who break traditional moulds and  have\r\n\r\nchosen to chart their own destinies.  Like Alison Ng, the\r\n\r\ngraduate  \"gao  luk\"  seller  or  the  two  NTU  graduate\r\n\r\nporridge sellers, as well as many others like Eugene  Low\r\n\r\nof Hardware Zone and the four 28-year-old\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNAFA  graduates, who despite all the problems  they  face\r\n\r\nwith starting a business, have made their shop \"Fourskin\"\r\n\r\nat Heeren selling T-shirts a success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Singaporeans are living proof that not all are\r\n\r\nwaiting  for handouts from the Government and are willing\r\n\r\nto  embrace  wholeheartedly the virtues of diligence  and\r\n\r\nenterprise.  In fact, the current adversity we are facing\r\n\r\nmay in the end turn out to be a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the not too distant future, when historians\r\n\r\ndocument this phase of our development, they may well dub\r\n\r\nit  as  a  baptism  of  fire, not just  for  the  younger\r\n\r\nMinisters but for Singaporeans as a whole, especially the\r\n\r\nyoung, and equipping them for the many challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need everybody on board the ship to not only work\r\n\r\ntogether but in the right place and doing the right thing\r\n\r\nin  order to continue to successfully steer and sail  the\r\n\r\nship.   This  in effect is what the ERC's recommendations\r\n\r\nand Budget 2003 have laid the ground for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have three points\r\n\r\nof  clarification.  First, with regard to  the  criticism\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  no plans to help business  and  private\r\n\r\nindividuals,  I think the MP for Hong Kah has  failed  to\r\n\r\nlisten to my speech carefully.  I said that there was  no\r\n\r\nbig   deficit   plan   to  help  business   and   private\r\n\r\nindividuals, and not that nothing was planned. The second\r\n\r\npoint  is  with  regard to chronic deficit.   Is  the  MP\r\n\r\ntelling  us that the Government is not going to  increase\r\n\r\nGST  when there is a series of deficits in the future  to\r\n\r\nrecover when the economy recovers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The second one is not a clarification.\r\n\r\nIt is a question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The third point is that\r\n\r\nthe  MP  can  disagree  with my comments  but  these  are\r\n\r\ncomments from the citizens that are reflected to me,  and\r\n\r\nI am reflecting the concerns of the citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  MP can disagree with that.  I have no problems  with\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Nobody is saying that you have problems\r\n\r\nwith that.  Dr Ong Seh Hong.\r\n\r\n<br>1.25 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing  me  to participate  in  this  debate.\r\n\r\nBefore I make my speech, I would like to take on a couple\r\n\r\nof  issues on what NCMP Mr Steve Chia has said.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat the Government is actually kidding Singaporeans that\r\n\r\nthey  can  retire comfortably with their CPF savings.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to bring to his attention pages 98 and 99  of\r\n\r\nthe  ERC Report on refocusing of the CPF system.  DPM and\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has also stated in this House that  CPF\r\n\r\nwould  be  refocused on the basic financial, housing  and\r\n\r\nmedical needs for retirement.  Also in the ERC Report, it\r\n\r\nis  clearly stated that, since its introduction in  1955,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF system is a sound framework for Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nsave  for  their  own retirement, reflecting  our  strong\r\n\r\nemphasis on individual responsibility.  It is our  belief\r\n\r\nthat  everyone  has  to take his own  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he commented that the Singapore Government did\r\n\r\nnot  promote  or  create any Singapore brand.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nSingapore  itself is already a brand internationally  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the hard work of a clean, capable and efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment led by PAP in the past four decades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take issue with his comments on\r\n\r\nhaving a chronic deficit.  Is he not aware that if we run\r\n\r\na  chronic deficit, as the hon. Member, Amy Khor has also\r\n\r\nmentioned,  we may end up in a situation like Hong  Kong?\r\n\r\nWorse  still, our Singapore dollar will also be  weakened\r\n\r\nand  it  will  affect the savings of our CPF members  and\r\n\r\nthus the long-term retirement nest-egg of our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also made the comment that PAP stands for \"Poor\r\n\r\nAlso  Pays\" which I differ.  Look at the rebates we  have\r\n\r\ngiven,  all the assistance schemes given by the CDCs  and\r\n\r\nall the Government agencies to help the less fortunate in\r\n\r\nsociety to tide them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nover  the  hard times.  Are they not assistance  for  our\r\n\r\npoor and needy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what Mr Steve Chia has\r\n\r\ncommented  from  his  dialogue with  some  residents  and\r\n\r\ngrassroots and from reports in the newspapers, I see that\r\n\r\nquite a number of Singaporeans are still complaining that\r\n\r\nthere are not enough goodies in this year's Budget.  They\r\n\r\nwant more and more handouts, like what Mr Steve Chia  has\r\n\r\njust suggested, from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nclarify.   I never said \"handout\".  I said that we  ought\r\n\r\nto  tell  Singaporeans not to look to the Government  for\r\n\r\nhandouts  or support or help, because they are not  going\r\n\r\nto get any.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> They want more and more handouts\r\n\r\nfrom the Government even though many of them are employed\r\n\r\nin  this  difficult time.  I am very worried  about  this\r\n\r\ntrend,  Mr  Speaker, Sir.  I am worried that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave   failed   to  see  the  impact  of   the   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring we are going through. They might  not  have\r\n\r\nseen  that  in  the  new economy.   There  will  be  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   who   may   actually   become    long-term\r\n\r\nunemployed. There will not be any lifelong employment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  every Singaporean has to expect  frequent\r\n\r\nchanges in job to stay gainfully employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to survive and to succeed, I think\r\n\r\nthe Singapore society as a whole must cultivate a mindset\r\n\r\nchange and to develop a culture that embraces change as a\r\n\r\nway of life.  As the Chinese saying goes, \"qiong ze bian,\r\n\r\nbian  ze tong\", which means when we are caught in extreme\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we must change and only change will  bring\r\n\r\nabout relief.  This Budget policy has painted the changes\r\n\r\nwe  are  expecting  ahead.  So it is now  for  us  -  the\r\n\r\npeople,  the  Government, the unions, the  companies  and\r\n\r\neveryone  who has a stake in Singapore - to pull together\r\n\r\nand face these changes together.  However, much has still\r\n\r\nto  be  done  to  bring  about this mindset  and  culture\r\n\r\nchange.  We have probably been cushioned too well in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomfy  zone and somehow we have this mentality of waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to do everything for us.  Maybe  that\r\n\r\nis  like  what  the hon. Member Mr Ong  Ah  Heng  quipped\r\n\r\nyesterday that we have a er shi si xiao government, ie, a\r\n\r\nGovernment that looks after everything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must grow up, like a teenager growing\r\n\r\ninto  an adult and getting out of the parental house  and\r\n\r\nbecoming more independent and self-reliant.  The  signals\r\n\r\nare  there for Singaporeans to see - changes in CPF, bank\r\n\r\noriginated loans for HDB, removal of restrictions on  car\r\n\r\nloans,  relaxation of CPF investments and so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   All these carry a similar underlying  message  - Singaporeans  have to make their own decisions  and  take\r\n\r\ntheir  own  risks.   However, from the  way  people  have\r\n\r\nrushed to take up bank originated loans to buy cars, I do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether they have realised the significance  of\r\n\r\nthe  impending changes.  To adapt to the changes, all  of\r\n\r\nus  must learn to be flexible, nimble, quick to act in  a\r\n\r\ncrisis, and responsive.  We must always be positive if we\r\n\r\nwant  to succeed in an environment of changes and to have\r\n\r\nthe confidence to overcome difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when we encourage our people to\r\n\r\nembrace changes, we ourselves must also be mindful of the\r\n\r\nconstant  stress level that our people would  go  through\r\n\r\nwith these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are by nature not fond of frequent\r\n\r\nchanges,  whether in their environment or  circumstances,\r\n\r\nbecause  change means uncertainty.  Uncertainty  makes  a\r\n\r\nperson worry.  Even for the employed, in the new economy,\r\n\r\nthey probably have to go through many transitions of jobs\r\n\r\nand during these transitions they would also have to look\r\n\r\nfor  some means to look after themselves while in-between\r\n\r\nthese  jobs.   So these are things that we will  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand and do something to help our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a lady in her 50s who has worked in\r\n\r\nSingTel  for  about  30 years.  She  was  always  in  the\r\n\r\nCustomer Services Department.  However, the call centre\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhandling  residential accounts was relocated to  Malacca.\r\n\r\nShe  has been transferred to another department to handle\r\n\r\ncommercial billing.  She told me that she was only  given\r\n\r\n4  days  to  train  and  2 days of  orientation  and  was\r\n\r\nexpected  to handle a different job scope.  Such  is  the\r\n\r\nspeed  of  change and the adaptations we must  face.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, she feels stressed with these changes but  anyway\r\n\r\nshe was lucky to still keep a job to go to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After restructuring the economy, we would probably\r\n\r\nexpect  a  small  group  of  Singaporeans  who  would  be\r\n\r\nstructurally  unemployed, not through  their  own  doing.\r\n\r\nThey might go for training and retraining and still could\r\n\r\nnot  get a job.  Maybe they are not up to par for the job\r\n\r\nor  there  is  just no job for them.   It  is  a  correct\r\n\r\napproach  that we should not give free handouts to  these\r\n\r\npeople  as  otherwise we may probably degenerate  into  a\r\n\r\nwelfare  state  and perpetuate the cycle  of  dependence.\r\n\r\nSo, how?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, for this group of people, we should encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to venture into some small businesses and services,\r\n\r\na  kind  of  \"cottage service industry\",  providing  some\r\n\r\ndomestic help, repair or delivery work.  However, we must\r\n\r\nhave  the legislation to help them keep the cost of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  to the very minimal.  For a start, for example,\r\n\r\nmaybe we should relax further by allowing them to use HDB\r\n\r\nflats   to   register  their  business.   Currently,   my\r\n\r\nunderstanding is that a HDB flat is only allowed for some\r\n\r\nIT-related  business  and to get approval  you  are  also\r\n\r\nsubject  to IDA support, and so on and so forth.   So  we\r\n\r\nmay  have to do something to relax this and to help these\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my grassroots people also suggested that to\r\n\r\nhelp  this  group of people get started, some small,  low\r\n\r\ninterest  or  interest-free loan, may be  given  to  them\r\n\r\nthrough  some  self-help groups or CDCs in order  to  get\r\n\r\nthem  started.   This equivalent to some sort  of  \"semi-informal sector\" will help to create some jobs and income\r\n\r\nopportunities for some of these people who may be out  of\r\n\r\njob or not able\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto get jobs.  And we should not forget that even Bengawan\r\n\r\nSolo, a successful confectionery and kueh maker, had  its\r\n\r\nhumble beginning in a HDB kitchen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call for a change and flexibility of our rules\r\n\r\nand the civil service has been much alluded to by many of\r\n\r\nmy  other parliamentary colleagues here, and I should not\r\n\r\ngo  further.  Mr Speaker, Sir, here I would like to  link\r\n\r\nit   to   the   role  of  the  Government  in   promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of the other Members here, I am very\r\n\r\nencouraged by the appointment of the Minister of State in\r\n\r\ncharge  of entrepreneurship.  I agree with what  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  job of the Government is to create an enabling\r\n\r\nenvironment for entrepreneurs to emerge and grow and  let\r\n\r\na  thousand  flowers bloom.  But we must  do  this  fast.\r\n\r\nSpeed is the essence if we want to succeed.  I would urge\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  expedite its  review  of  all  the\r\n\r\nstatutory requirements and regulations of doing  business\r\n\r\nhere  and to make it less restrictive and easier to start\r\n\r\nup  business.  One example that comes to my mind  is  the\r\n\r\nchange  of use of HDB shop space.  I notice that in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and Taiwan, if a business does not do well,  within\r\n\r\n24  hours you can see that the owner will change the shop\r\n\r\nfront  and  start a completely different trade.   But  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the change of use usually requires a lot  more\r\n\r\nwork and application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rigid mindset of \"do only if the rules permit\"\r\n\r\nis pervasive and is very bad for us.  It also affects the\r\n\r\noperation   of   work  even  at  the  grassroots   level.\r\n\r\nRecently, my Constituency Sports Club wanted to  organise\r\n\r\na   basketball  tournament  and  they  were  creative  or\r\n\r\ninnovative  enough  to  suggest that  they  want  to  get\r\n\r\nsponsors  to put up advertisements on the banners  around\r\n\r\nthe  basketball  courts.  I said, \"Good, brilliant  idea.\r\n\r\nWhy  not  go and do it?\"  But I was taken aback when  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the CSC suddenly asked me, \"Do PA rules allow\r\n\r\nus  to  do that?\"  I think everything that we have to  go\r\n\r\nback to the rule book is something like the NUTS syndrome\r\n\r\nthat  was  alluded to by Amy Khor just now.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencourage  more entrepreneurs.  We should  actually  move\r\n\r\naway from this checking the rule book mentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the funding of entrepreneurs and local\r\n\r\nenterprises.   It is good to see that the Government  has\r\n\r\nactually put in various schemes through SPRING,  IES,  to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singapore  companies to venture out.  But  we  must\r\n\r\nreview the way they are being given out and administered.\r\n\r\nIn this area, more flexibility and more customer-friendly\r\n\r\napproach  have  to  be  adopted.   I  will  give  another\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grassroots leader of mine told me that he went to\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines to bid for a contract to build  cellular\r\n\r\nphone  antenna  stations.  He told  me  that  there  were\r\n\r\nanother  three  Singaporean  firms  competing  with  him,\r\n\r\nincluding  a  listed  company.   Eventually  he  got  the\r\n\r\ncontract,   even  though  he  said  that  he   made   the\r\n\r\npresentation  wearing a T-shirt while  the  other  people\r\n\r\nwere wearing suits.  I asked him how did he make it.   He\r\n\r\nsaid he was able to do it, and he used Hokkien to say it,\r\n\r\nby  \"boo kia pang piow, boo kia char tan\".  Basically, he\r\n\r\nhad  a very gung-ho mentality.  He was not afraid of  the\r\n\r\nbombs and kidnappings there.  He also managed to keep his\r\n\r\noverheads   low   by  hiring  locals  compared   to   his\r\n\r\ncompetitors who used Singaporeans who had to fly there  3\r\n\r\nto  4  times  at 3 to 4 times the cost and they  have  to\r\n\r\ncheck  into a hotel.  But he said that when his  business\r\n\r\nexpanded  and he needed to get some help, he  was  turned\r\n\r\ndown  by  TDB for the simple reason that his company  was\r\n\r\nregistered  in the Philippines and not in  Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nthought in this sort of situation, our agency, even if it\r\n\r\ncannot give the grant, should point out the road and help\r\n\r\nthem  by  providing a one-stop customer service  to  tell\r\n\r\nthem  how they can navigate through the system and  where\r\n\r\nare  the  other fundings that are available.  If  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to help these people to spread their wings  to  the\r\n\r\nregion  or  internationally, in return, they will  plough\r\n\r\nsome benefits back to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that this policy statement has signalled that\r\n\r\nthese  mindset changes will be there and hope that  these\r\n\r\nchanges will happen sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch upon, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is on the concept of retirement.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  alluded  to  by  the  hon.  Member  Lim  Hwee   Hua\r\n\r\nyesterday,  and  I  support her  view  that  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  the concept of a pre-determined retirement  age\r\n\r\nis  probably no longer relevant.  I think we  should  let\r\n\r\neveryone  have a greater say.  If you want  to  encourage\r\n\r\nself-reliant and self-independent Singaporeans we  should\r\n\r\nallow  them  to have a greater say in when they  want  to\r\n\r\nstop  work  and, at the same time, we will let them  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  themselves, financially or otherwise.   So,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  rethink  this  idea of a legally  defined  pre-determined retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With better healthcare and social conditions we are\r\n\r\nliving  longer  and  healthier.  To  condemn  a  healthy,\r\n\r\nenergetic  62-year-old man to his home  or  spending  his\r\n\r\ntime  on  the  golf course is probably a waste  of  human\r\n\r\ncapital.   We should make better use of them  because  we\r\n\r\nalready  have  scarce  human  resources.   We  must  also\r\n\r\nunderstand that chronological age is no indication  of  a\r\n\r\nperson's physiological and mental health.  The concept of\r\n\r\nsetting a retirement age actually contradicts our move to\r\n\r\nmake  Singaporeans  to be more independent  and  to  take\r\n\r\ncharge of their own destiny.  By removing the concept  of\r\n\r\nretirement age, we can encourage Singaporeans to plan for\r\n\r\nthemselves  financially, psychologically and emotionally.\r\n\r\nAnd this is definitely a right signal sent to our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, together with this change of\r\n\r\nretirement age, we need to re-orientate the employers and\r\n\r\nemployees  towards,  for example,  redesigning  the  work\r\n\r\nenvironment, the job, redefining the work,  and  for  the\r\n\r\nemployees to be able to accept reduced working  hours  or\r\n\r\nsome  sort  of flexible working arrangement if  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  work beyond a certain age.  The  advantage  of\r\n\r\nhiring  older workers is manifold and I am not  going  to\r\n\r\nelaborate here.  For Singapore, it will also give us  the\r\n\r\nadded  advantage  of reduced reliance on foreign  workers\r\n\r\nand  we  are able to keep our citizens gainfully employed\r\n\r\nlonger,  promote their independence, dignity, confidence,\r\n\r\nself-worth and reduce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  dependence on the State for financial,  social  or\r\n\r\nmedical needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to manage these changes ahead calls\r\n\r\nfor  the  cohesion of the people and the  wisdom  of  our\r\n\r\nleaders.  If not managed properly, there would be  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  resentment  and it is a fertile ground for  extremist\r\n\r\nviews.    History  has  shown  that  difficult   economic\r\n\r\nsituations  have  often  led to profound  changes.   When\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  economic hardship,  the  social  fabric\r\n\r\nwoven into the society can be undone very quickly.  So we\r\n\r\nneed  to be very vigilant over such potential threats  to\r\n\r\nour  society.   This is especially so for a young  nation\r\n\r\nlike Singapore.  For example, the depression in 1929 sent\r\n\r\nthe German economy into extreme slump.  The German people\r\n\r\nimmediately began to blame the government for  the  state\r\n\r\nof  affairs.   They  were  then willing  to  buy  in  any\r\n\r\npolitical  party  that promised them changes,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  extremist  parties.  The rest was history,  and  how\r\n\r\nHitler  came  into power.  Sir, this is a gloomy  picture\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not  think the likelihood of it happening  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  high, but we have to  be  mindful  of  the\r\n\r\ndivide  that  economic  uncertainty  can  bring  to   our\r\n\r\nsociety.  In any case, this is a whole new world order we\r\n\r\nare  seeing  now.  All of us have to pull together  as  a\r\n\r\nunited people behind the strong and capable Government to\r\n\r\nsail  through  this  rough sea, as we  modify  the  ship,\r\n\r\nbecause there is no safe harbour for us to park our  ship\r\n\r\nand rebuild.  But, in the end, I believe we will emerge a\r\n\r\nstronger nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, the public finally got a\r\n\r\nglimpse  of  the  long awaited Economic Review  Committee\r\n\r\nReport.   Adorning  the  cover  of  the  Report  is   the\r\n\r\nbeautiful  and resplendent \"Esplanade\".  I  have  a  copy\r\n\r\nhere.   I like the cover.  This is, to me, an interesting\r\n\r\nparallel.   When  I saw the cover and  when  I  read  the\r\n\r\nReport, I thought the parallel was even more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappropriate.  The ERC Report provoked many reactions, the\r\n\r\nsame kind of reactions as the Esplanade.  Most people did\r\n\r\nnot  fall  in  love with the Esplanade  at  first  sight.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when the idea was conceived years ago, when  many\r\n\r\nof  us  saw  the  pictures  and the  models,  there  were\r\n\r\nscathing comments.  However, over time, most of  us  have\r\n\r\nfallen in love with our magnificent Durian.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reactions to the ERC Report were also\r\n\r\nmixed.   Different  people saw different  things  in  the\r\n\r\nReport.  Employers found relief in the non-restoration of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF.   Investors were encouraged  by  the  long-term\r\n\r\ndirection  of low taxes and cost.  Workers were reassured\r\n\r\nthat they will be given a helping hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, it is equally true that many on the\r\n\r\nground,  including many MPs in this House like  Dr  Wang,\r\n\r\nwere clearly disappointed.  Ignatius Low and Soh Wen  Lin\r\n\r\nof the Straits Times wrote on 8th February that many felt\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  \"blew a unique chance to rebuild  the  system.\"\r\n\r\nMano  Sabnani wrote in the Weekend Today on 8th  February\r\n\r\nthat his friends thought the \"visions and strategies were\r\n\r\nnot  all new.\"  They were old stuff.  Indeed, many of the\r\n\r\nideas have been around for some time.  But the difference\r\n\r\nbetween  then and now is that a collection of  ideas  has\r\n\r\nnow become a set of Government policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people react so differently to the ideas in\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  Report?   In part, because it is  a  voluminous\r\n\r\nreport.  After all, it is the product of 1,200 man-years.\r\n\r\nIn  part, because everybody was looking out for their own\r\n\r\nlittle  niches, their own little ideas, their own  little\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  When their ideas were there, their reaction\r\n\r\nwas, like Dr Wang said, \"It was an old idea; in any case,\r\n\r\nit  was  my idea.\"  When their ideas were not there,  the\r\n\r\nreaction  was, \"The Government didn't look  deep  enough.\r\n\r\nIt  was  a  waste of time and resources.\"  Just like  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade, Sir, each one of us sees a different facade of\r\n\r\nthe  monumental ERC Report and passed judgment.  How then\r\n\r\nshould we read the Report?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to illustrate this point, I want to bring you\r\n\r\non a journey to China, to a place call Jiang Xi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) where there is a famous mountain called Lu Shan ( ). Tourists and scholars flock there by the thousands -\r\n\r\nin fact, millions - to unravel the poem of one of China's\r\n\r\nmost famous poets, and his name is Su Shi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will probably know him as Su Dong Po (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). The title of the poem is Ti Xi Lin Bi ( ). It is a Song ( ) Dynasty poem. It reads like this:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heng kan cheng ling, ce cheng feng ( )\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yuan jin gao di ge bu tong ( )\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bu shi lu shan zhen mian mu ( )\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zhi yuan shen zai ci shan zhong ( )\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot translate the poem as well as I can\r\n\r\nappreciate it, but I will try.  The poem says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the mountain from the front, it looks\r\n\r\nlike a ridge.  When I look at the mountain from the side,\r\n\r\nit  looks like a cliff.  There are so many of them,  they\r\n\r\nare   near  and  far,  tall  and  short,  they  all  look\r\n\r\ndifferent.   I  cannot see the real face  of  Lu  Shan  (\r\n\r\n).   Because  I  am right in the middle of  the  mountain\r\n\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people rush to mountain tops only to be\r\n\r\ndisappointed  because they could not see the  majesty  of\r\n\r\nthe  mountain  or the ranges in the mountain  or  at  the\r\n\r\nsummit.   In  fact, we all know that the  most  beautiful\r\n\r\nview of Lu Shan (\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) or any beautiful mountain like Mount Fuji, is not\r\n\r\nin  the  mountain or at the summit but rather the majesty\r\n\r\nis gleaned from a far distance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Report, to me, is like Lu Shan (\r\n\r\n).    It  has many radical policies, the import of  which\r\n\r\ncan  only be appreciated from a far distance. You do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  be physically removed from Singapore,  but  you\r\n\r\nmust  read  it  with a mental detachment.  How  far  from\r\n\r\nSingapore must we read the ERC Report?  I think\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  have  to read it from really far, from outside  South\r\n\r\nEast Asia and beyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors looking at Singapore from outside\r\n\r\nSingapore will quickly differentiate Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  region.  It will then be  clear  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore mountain is quite different from those  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Report has many radical ideas. But to me,\r\n\r\nit  sends  a few, simple but clear messages.   The  first\r\n\r\nmessage is that Singapore is open for business.  It is  a\r\n\r\nsimple statement, but we go beyond that.  We say that  we\r\n\r\nare  not xenophobic.  We welcome talent, whether they are\r\n\r\nblack or white, and all shades in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I read in the Report is that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government will lower costs, the direction  of\r\n\r\ncosts  will  go  down,  both  corporate  income  tax  and\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax.  And this Government is  determined\r\n\r\nto    make   Singapore   an   affordable   business   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing centre by sweeping away as many  rules  and\r\n\r\nbureaucracies as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, individual factors of production will not be\r\n\r\nthe  cheapest in the region, but if investors look at the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost   -  the key words here are \"total  cost\"   - they will find that the total is less than the sum of its\r\n\r\nparts.   For  example, Matsushita's  Maris,  the  world's\r\n\r\nforemost manufacturer of refrigerator compressors,  found\r\n\r\nthat  while labour cost in Singapore is much higher  than\r\n\r\nin  the region and in China, Singapore is still a cheaper\r\n\r\nplace to manufacture its products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I gleaned from the Report is that,\r\n\r\ncollectively,  we  are  willing to  sacrifice  short-term\r\n\r\ngains  for  long-term benefits.  All of us will  moderate\r\n\r\nour pay increases, like deferring the CPF restoration for\r\n\r\ntwo  years  or  maybe even beyond, and  all  of  us  must\r\n\r\nupgrade  ourselves  and make ourselves  relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nworld outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM mentioned that the ERC Report is not just an\r\n\r\neconomic  roadmap for the future.  It is also an exercise\r\n\r\nin social bonding.  For this reason, Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  not  go  to  the streets to demonstrate,  unlike  our\r\n\r\nfriends  in  Hong  Kong, because here  we  need  to  make\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  our  lifestyle, to  make  a  living  for\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these, foreign investors have begun to\r\n\r\nnotice us from afar.  The ERC Report is like a lighthouse\r\n\r\nthat  beckons them to our shore.  Many foreign banks  are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  shift forex operations back  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  our  competitors like Hong Kong, Sydney and  Tokyo.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Tokyo and Credit Swiss First Boston are among\r\n\r\nthose  reported  to be moving major components  of  their\r\n\r\ncurrency  trading  operations from  Tokyo  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOthers  who are here like Citibank and ABN-AMRO  will  be\r\n\r\nadding  more forex and derivative businesses.   Germany's\r\n\r\nWestLB  Bank has recently started operating  here.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  trickle  will slowly turn into  a  tide.   Fidelity\r\n\r\nInvestment,  one  of the world's biggest  fund  managers,\r\n\r\nleft  Singapore  in a hurry immediately after  the  Asian\r\n\r\ncrisis  in  1997. Today, it has applied for a licence  to\r\n\r\nrestart its operations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we might well ask: how can all these new\r\n\r\nhappenings be attributed to the ERC Report which was only\r\n\r\nreleased  early this month, on 7th February?  The  answer\r\n\r\nis  that  many  of the key recommendations  were  already\r\n\r\nreleased  many months ago.  To me, the ERC Report  is  an\r\n\r\nanti-climax too, like MPs here have suggested, but  there\r\n\r\nare good reasons why it is so.  The ERC Report, to me, is\r\n\r\nlike  a  movie.  It is like a movie where the story  line\r\n\r\nhad  been  told many times.  In fact, over  the  last  12\r\n\r\nmonths,  we  were  also invited to  some  detailed  early\r\n\r\npreviews.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as if the whole nation was invited to sit\r\n\r\nnext  to  the director's chair while the ERC \"movie\"  was\r\n\r\nbeing  made.  Sir, while the ERC Report might be an anti-climax,  I cannot understand why many are not excited  by\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations in the Report.   Memories  are  very\r\n\r\nshort.  We have forgotten that some taboo policies, which\r\n\r\nonly a few years ago were held to be sacrosanct, have now\r\n\r\nbeen  bulldozed by the ERC.  For example, lowering  taxes\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  low  as  20% was an absolute no-no, even only  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  The argument then was that if the Government\r\n\r\nwere  to  lower  taxes  below  25%,  Singapore  could  be\r\n\r\nblacklisted  as a tax haven, an absurd answer  you  might\r\n\r\nthink.   Then, it was the holy grail, only  a  few  years\r\n\r\nago.  So, a major U-turn sign has been removed.  One  big\r\n\r\nnut has been cracked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are other taboos which have been swept\r\n\r\naway,  another one was the concession to exempt  selected\r\n\r\nforeign  income  remitted to Singapore from  taxes.   The\r\n\r\nBudget  will  now  give  such  income  remitted  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  tax free exemptions.  A smaller taboo  may  be\r\n\r\nexemption of interest of domestic deposits from taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the ERC Report has consigned these nuts to\r\n\r\nthe  incinerator.  So, I cannot understand why  Mr  Leong\r\n\r\nHong  Kee said that major U-turn signs have been  allowed\r\n\r\nto  stay.  These are radical policy U-turns which many of\r\n\r\nus,  including myself, have railed against 10 years  ago.\r\n\r\nMany  of  us failed then.  But, today, 10 years on,  they\r\n\r\nhave  become  policies.   The policies  have  come  about\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the ERC Committee meeting, deliberating  and\r\n\r\nfinalising the recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a major crisis, a new economic landscape post-September 11, and a new Finance Minister have made a\r\n\r\nhundred  flowers  bloom.  I celebrate these  U-turns.   I\r\n\r\nthink we can do with a few more of these U-turns, but let\r\n\r\nus  digest  the present lot of cracked nuts on our  plate\r\n\r\nbefore we move on to the next plate of cracked nuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Report serves a very important purpose.\r\n\r\nInvestors  take  a  long-term view of their  investments.\r\n\r\nThe  ERC  Report provides them with advanced intelligence\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's long-term policies.  The ERC prescription\r\n\r\nis  a  holistic  treatment to our current economic  ills.\r\n\r\nThis  kind  of treatment takes time.  But what  investors\r\n\r\nare seeing is something even more illuminating.  In spite\r\n\r\nof  a  major economic crisis, resulting in the Government\r\n\r\nrunning  three  years of deficit, Singapore  is  lowering\r\n\r\ntaxes.  This, by itself, may not be profound, but we are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlowering  taxes in the face of difficult economic  times,\r\n\r\nin  the  face of deficits.  When we compare this to  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  which  is raising taxes to cover their shortfalls,\r\n\r\nthis  move  by  Singapore, as opposed to  what  our  most\r\n\r\nfearsome  competitor  is  doing,  is  clear  evidence  to\r\n\r\ninvestors that Singapore, first, has the financial clout;\r\n\r\nand,  second,  the  social cohesion  to  restructure  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and reorganise ourselves in order to move  ahead\r\n\r\nof the crowd.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans caught up with the daily routine\r\n\r\nmay  not  appreciate these long-term policy implications.\r\n\r\nI  can understand that.  Like all MPs here, I do have the\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people sessions.  And in these MPS sessions,  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders and I have met many casualties of what\r\n\r\nI  would  call  this very severe economic downturn.   And\r\n\r\nmany  of  them have come with a begging bowl  asking  for\r\n\r\nhandouts.  My grassroots leaders and I cannot be  unmoved\r\n\r\nby  these  events.  We help them in any way we could.   I\r\n\r\nturn to my CCC.  I turn to my Mayor who is sitting there,\r\n\r\nand they all chip in and help them in one way or another.\r\n\r\nI  write to MOM.  I write to NTUC and some of these cases\r\n\r\nwere  successful.  In fact, the sad story is many  of  my\r\n\r\nkey  grassroots leaders themselves have been  retrenched,\r\n\r\nbut  they  are still with me.  They are still  doing  the\r\n\r\nMPS,  and they understand that their unemployment is  not\r\n\r\nthe fault of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us here understand the desire for more\r\n\r\nhandouts,  and we also understand the desire for  instant\r\n\r\ncures for our economic malaise.  But, really, there is no\r\n\r\nviagra  for our economic impotence.  Many people tell  me\r\n\r\nthere is - the economy will rise again, they say, if land\r\n\r\ncost  was  lowered.  I heard Mr Loh Meng See say business\r\n\r\ncost  in Singapore is high; land cost is one of the sins.\r\n\r\nMany  of them have told me that if the Government was  to\r\n\r\nlower  land cost, then all will be well.  But two  issues\r\n\r\nneed to be looked at very seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, artificially lowering land cost by flooding\r\n\r\nthe  market with land might well make land cheap, but the\r\n\r\nconsequence of taking large doses of this kind of strong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedicine  has  a  known medical side effect.   It  causes\r\n\r\nmassive  heart attacks.  For those saddled with  negative\r\n\r\nequity,  the disease might well be cured, but the patient\r\n\r\nwill  be  dead.  And negative equity works like a  virus.\r\n\r\nOnce   it  has  infected  a  critical  mass,  the  entire\r\n\r\npopulation is in peril.  In fact, much of Hong Kong today\r\n\r\nis trapped in negative equity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading the South China Morning Post last\r\n\r\nnight, and on the weekend issue, the Sunday Morning  Post\r\n\r\nissue of March 9th, there was a report which said that  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  by  Mastercard showed that Hongkongers were  more\r\n\r\ngloomy  in the middle of last year than Indonesians  were\r\n\r\nwhen  Indonesia  was  at  the height  of  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncrisis.  That was how depressing.  Hong Kong is a land of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  Today, it is more like the  land  of  the\r\n\r\ngloomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point is land cost in Singapore is\r\n\r\nnot  that expensive today.  It is not the cheapest in the\r\n\r\nregion,  but it is not that expensive.  Since  the  Asian\r\n\r\ncrisis,  market  forces  have  driven  down  land  prices\r\n\r\nconsiderably.   Compared to Shanghai, for  example,  good\r\n\r\nquality housing in Singapore might well be cheap.  I  was\r\n\r\nreading  the  Time  magazine last month.   Hannah  Beach,\r\n\r\nTime's  Shanghai correspondent, lamented that  she  could\r\n\r\nnot  find  a  decent - I repeat decent -  not  luxurious,\r\n\r\naccommodation for her housing budget.  What does she mean\r\n\r\nby  \"decent\"?   She means a flat or a house with  running\r\n\r\nwater, continuous lighting and heating, because she needs\r\n\r\nto  file  reports back to the States.  When she  found  a\r\n\r\ndecent place at US$5,000 per month, the agent immediately\r\n\r\ntold  her  that the asking rent had been up to  US$5,500.\r\n\r\nFor that kind of money (which is something like S$9,500),\r\n\r\nshe  could  have got a luxurious penthouse in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nPremium  grade office space in Singapore is  quite  cheap\r\n\r\ntoday.  One would easily get reports in the Straits Times\r\n\r\ntoday, but I got this figure sometime ago.  Premium grade\r\n\r\noffice  space  in Singapore could go as  low  as  $5  per\r\n\r\nsquare  foot.  I am talking about top grade office space.\r\n\r\nIf you bargained hard enough, you might even\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nget  it  lower - I do not know.  But for $5, you can  get\r\n\r\nreasonably very good office space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Guangzhou today - not Shanghai or Beijing - good\r\n\r\ngrade office space is already $3 per square foot.  We are\r\n\r\nonly  $3  difference,  but  we  are  Singapore.   In   my\r\n\r\nassessment,  land cost in Singapore is reasonably  cheap,\r\n\r\nand the same for industrial land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no need to artificially drive down\r\n\r\nland costs to be the cheapest in the region.  Competitive\r\n\r\npricing,  yes;  but fire sales, no.   Land  is  only  one\r\n\r\nfactor  of  production.  We can compensate  for  this  by\r\n\r\nmaking  the  total cost less than the sum  of  individual\r\n\r\ncosts.  I call this synergy in reverse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is in bear territory. We hear his roar,\r\n\r\nwe  see  his footprints.  But the marauding bear  is  not\r\n\r\njust  chasing us; the bear is chasing each and every  one\r\n\r\nof  our  neighbours  as well.  We do not  have  to  strip\r\n\r\nourselves naked - like selling everything on the cheap  - in order to out-run the bear.  All we need do, Sir, is to\r\n\r\nshed  enough baggage to out-run our neighbours.  In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  should not out-run the bear this time.  We need  some\r\n\r\nclothes on for the next bear run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us are unnecessarily gloomy. A few even\r\n\r\nthink that this is the end of Singapore.  Yet, during the\r\n\r\ngood  times,  many  of us thought the music  would  never\r\n\r\nstop.   Now  that  we are in bad times, the  same  people\r\n\r\nthink  the  music would never start again.  We have  been\r\n\r\nthrough this before in 1986-1987.  This is not the  first\r\n\r\neconomic downturn, nor will it be the last.  Memories are\r\n\r\nalways  short.   In  the  recession  of  1986  and  1987,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans went through the same emotional trauma.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to end my speech by quoting a familiar\r\n\r\nChinese idiom.  It says: Sai Weng shi ma, yan zhi fei  fu\r\n\r\n(\r\n\r\n).   Sai Weng was a horse trader.  One day, his favourite\r\n\r\nstallion ran away.  He was extremely sad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSoon  after,  the stallion brought back a  herd  of  wild\r\n\r\nthoroughbreds.   He was delirious.  The essence  of  this\r\n\r\nidiom is: do not despair, something good will come out of\r\n\r\nsomething bad.  The Chinese say: Yin huo de fu, huo fu wu\r\n\r\nchang                                                   (\r\n\r\n).  Nothing is forever.  I like to look at things with an\r\n\r\n\"Ah  Q\"  mentality.  Because of the economic crisis,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  reviewed and agreed to U-turn  on  major\r\n\r\npolicies, which were once immutable.  In fact, many  nuts\r\n\r\nwere cracked.  I see this as a sign that good things  are\r\n\r\non the way.  The crisis has injected in us all a sense of\r\n\r\nurgency  for  change.  Clearly, we  could  not  carry  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  the way we did.  The crisis gave birth  to  the\r\n\r\nERC.   And I think the ERC Report will guide us into  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br>1.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for giving me this opportunity to join in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making a Budget in the middle of many\r\n\r\ndevelopments.  The economy is weak.  Jobs are  harder  to\r\n\r\nfind and to keep, both for retrenched workers and for new\r\n\r\ngraduates.  Crime was up last year.  A war in Iraq looms,\r\n\r\ndriving  up oil prices and inflation worries.  Cut-throat\r\n\r\ncompetition   breathes  down  our  neck   both   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood and further afield.  And we  can  hear  the\r\n\r\nsucking  noises of the giant Chinese vacuum cleaner  that\r\n\r\ndraws  away investments, factories and jobs.  On  top  of\r\n\r\nall  that, terrorism tries to paralyse societies by  fear\r\n\r\nand by tearing up the social fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, more Singaporeans are feeling\r\n\r\nanxious.  The world seems to have turned very messy, very\r\n\r\nharsh.  There are changes upon changes.  Many wonder what\r\n\r\nis happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Singaporeans find courage and strength to\r\n\r\npress  on and face life's challenges, and see the ongoing\r\n\r\nstruggles  as  an investment in their future?   And  what\r\n\r\nfuture would that be?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these circumstances, I feel that our Budget\r\n\r\nmust  strengthen hope.  Realistic hope, to me, is central\r\n\r\nto our ability\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto   deal  decisively  and  effectively  with  the   many\r\n\r\nchallenges, and to emerge victorious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we strengthen hope? First, let us press on\r\n\r\nwith  all  efforts  to  inform  Singaporeans  about   the\r\n\r\ndevelopments  around us that affect us in  the  economic,\r\n\r\nsocial and political arena.  It is a natural tendency for\r\n\r\npeople  to avoid pain.  And one way to avoid pain  is  to\r\n\r\ntry  and block out unwelcome news and information.   Some\r\n\r\nmay  think  that  it is perhaps more merciful  and  maybe\r\n\r\neasier  to  keep morale up, if we shield our people  from\r\n\r\nhaving to face the increasingly harsh realities.  Yet, if\r\n\r\nwe  do  that, we dull our senses and lull ourselves  into\r\n\r\nwrongly believing that there is somehow an entitlement to\r\n\r\na  good  life,  and  that  would  be  counter-productive.\r\n\r\nClearly,  we  must not set out to demoralise our  people.\r\n\r\nBut  we must always call a spade a spade, so that by  and\r\n\r\nby,  Singaporeans  at large will adjust to  understanding\r\n\r\nthat  the world has changed in big and fundamental  ways.\r\n\r\nThen,  we  will be much more ready and able to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary adjustments and adaptations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I am glad that the Finance Minister has been\r\n\r\nforthright  in his analysis of the economic picture  that\r\n\r\nwe  face,  and  also  the fiscal position  that  we  must\r\n\r\nexpect,  going forward.  Specifically, he has pointed  to\r\n\r\nvolatile times ahead and tighter Government revenues.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, the days of what I would say cruise control\r\n\r\nlife  management  -  which is that  you  just  put  on  a\r\n\r\nconstant  setting and the car just moves  on  its  own  - assuming  that there will always be a job and that  there\r\n\r\nwill always be pay that goes up - those days are over  as\r\n\r\nwell  as any expectations that, whether in Government  or\r\n\r\nin  our  private life, we can spend freely  without  much\r\n\r\nthought.  Those days are also over.  The future is  about\r\n\r\nstaying nimble, making choices, taking chances and living\r\n\r\nwith  our own decisions and within our means, both  as  a\r\n\r\nnation  and as individuals.  And as these big changes  in\r\n\r\nthinking   and  behaviour  take  place,  we  would   have\r\n\r\npositioned Singapore and Singaporeans for a more  hopeful\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, hope rests on the confidence that things\r\n\r\nwill improve in the future.  This confidence must have  a\r\n\r\nproper  basis,  for otherwise it would  be  mere  wishful\r\n\r\nthinking.   Take the area of jobs, for example.   We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  this is now a key concern among  working  age\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  because of the restructuring,  relocations\r\n\r\nand  retrenchments.  How do we show Singaporeans who want\r\n\r\nto adapt that they would be helped?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or put it in another way: how do we explain to\r\n\r\nadaptable  Singaporeans  that the  Budget  measures  will\r\n\r\nbring more jobs to Singapore, and that they will have  an\r\n\r\nequal chance to take these jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with job creation. Jobs do not appear\r\n\r\nout  of the blue.  Jobs are created when companies invest\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and do business here.  Unless Singapore  is\r\n\r\nattractive  to investors, they will not put  their  money\r\n\r\nhere, and there will not be jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Singapore offer? Do we offer cheap land?\r\n\r\nNo.   Cheap  wages?  Not when compared to many developing\r\n\r\ncountries.  Do we have capabilities that companies  need?\r\n\r\nWell,  our workforce has been top-rated by BERI for  many\r\n\r\nyears, but our overall education profile, because of  our\r\n\r\nhistory,  trails  those of developed countries  in  whose\r\n\r\nleague  we  must  fight if we want a better  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  Our infrastructure?  Yes, we are rated well here\r\n\r\nand  it  gives  us  a certain edge.   And  then  we  have\r\n\r\nstrengths  in certain key intangible areas like political\r\n\r\nstability,   low  corruption,  effective  and   proactive\r\n\r\nGovernment,  hub  status offering  high  connectivity  in\r\n\r\nvarious areas, open trade links, industrial peace, and  a\r\n\r\npro-investment, pro-business tax environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all these, one may ask: why would companies\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  invest in Singapore?  And  the  answer  is\r\n\r\nbecause  every  other country wants that same  investment\r\n\r\ndollar,  and will compete fiercely for it.  So  companies\r\n\r\ncompare  the  packages  that  different  countries  offer\r\n\r\nbefore  making  their decisions.  Even companies  already\r\n\r\nhere  will do their sums to see whether they want to move\r\n\r\nor stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can we be hopeful of winning our share in\r\n\r\nthis  fierce competition?  The short answer  must  be  to\r\n\r\nreinforce our strengths and remedy our weaknesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on company and personal income taxes,\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister has introduced  changes  beginning\r\n\r\nlast  year that will see Singapore becoming progressively\r\n\r\nless  demanding.   Although  no  further  corporate   and\r\n\r\npersonal tax reductions were made in this year's  budget,\r\n\r\nthe   commitment  to  make  further  reductions  by  2005\r\n\r\nremains.  At the same time, the exemption from tax of all\r\n\r\nforeign  income in the form of dividends, branch  profits\r\n\r\nand  services income in this year's budget will encourage\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of capability building, the budget in\r\n\r\nfinancial  year 2002 saw another $500 million transferred\r\n\r\ninto  the  Lifelong Learning Fund.  The Fund,  which  now\r\n\r\nstands  at  $1.5  billion, is expected  to  generate  $60\r\n\r\nmillion  in income to pay for more worker retraining  and\r\n\r\nskills   upgrading.   There  are  also   additional   tax\r\n\r\nincentives for those who, on their own, take up  training\r\n\r\nand attend courses and seminars.  And of course there  is\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up  of  a  special agency  to  promote  and\r\n\r\ncoordinate   Continuous  Education  and  Training.    The\r\n\r\ncommitment of the Government to do everything possible on\r\n\r\nthe supply side to give Singaporean workers the chance to\r\n\r\ncompete  for the new good paying jobs is very  clear  and\r\n\r\nunwavering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to healthcare cost, which is another\r\n\r\nconcern,  especially among older Singaporeans and  lower-paid workers, the Government has transferred another $100\r\n\r\nmillion  into the MediFund, bringing it to $900  million.\r\n\r\nAnd  the interest income will help more poor Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndeal with high medical expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to me, it is the spur given to the introduction\r\n\r\nof  the  portable  medical benefits that deserve  special\r\n\r\nmention.  We have an aging workforce.  And when an  aging\r\n\r\nworkforce meets with the end of lifelong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployment, then it becomes obvious that many  are  going\r\n\r\nto be stuck financially if they fall ill in between jobs,\r\n\r\nor  if  their  employers  do not  provide  basic  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.    I  am  glad  that,  after  many   years   of\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  a  specific tax incentive is  now  given  to\r\n\r\npromote  the implementation of portable medical benefits.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  do  feel that the pace of progress  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is  too slow because there is not yet a  proposal\r\n\r\nwith defined terms and premiums for workers and employers\r\n\r\nto  adopt.   My  worry is that the longer  the  delay  in\r\n\r\nimplementing this, the more older workers will be  placed\r\n\r\nin  jeopardy.   So I urge the Government to  consider  an\r\n\r\naggressive  and specific timetable for the implementation\r\n\r\nof portable medical benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that I feel the Government can do more\r\n\r\nis  business  costs.   Cost levels  directly  impact  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of  companies.   Feedback  received   by\r\n\r\nunions   indicates  that  a  significant  proportion   of\r\n\r\nunionised  companies that had relocated part  or  all  of\r\n\r\ntheir operations to other countries in the past few years\r\n\r\nhad cited high cost of business as one of the reasons for\r\n\r\ntheir  decision.  Therefore, it is an important  item  to\r\n\r\npay attention to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the cost factors, wages and land are\r\n\r\ntwo  main  ones.   On wages, I would say that,  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  tripartite partners have worked closely to reform\r\n\r\nthe wage structure in Singapore.  When companies have  to\r\n\r\ndeal with increased volatility, the wage structure cannot\r\n\r\nbe  rigid.   Otherwise,  we will  be  forcing  many  more\r\n\r\ncompanies  to prematurely lose money, downsize  or  close\r\n\r\ndown and many more workers will lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But much work remains to be done. The seniority-based wage system will, in an increasingly volatile\r\n\r\noperating  environment, make our older workers  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  vulnerable.   The  lack of more  timely  adjustment\r\n\r\nmechanisms, such as the monthly variable component,  will\r\n\r\nalso  harm companies and their workers in times of sudden\r\n\r\npoor demand.  Other cost components that work against the\r\n\r\nemployability of older workers, such as high\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedical and statutory costs, must also be tackled  so  as\r\n\r\nto  minimise casualties.   We must press on with  reforms\r\n\r\nand  provide more flexibility in practical and  equitable\r\n\r\nways,   so   that  all  stakeholders  of  the  companies,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  workers, will be able  to  share  in  the\r\n\r\nsuccess and growth of their companies.  At the same time,\r\n\r\nwhen companies know that their manpower overheads are not\r\n\r\nlocked into rigid structures, but pegged to productivity,\r\n\r\nperformance and value, they will also be more willing  to\r\n\r\nhire when demand picks up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land cost, I just want to make a comment on\r\n\r\nindustrial  land  pricing because I  do  believe  that  a\r\n\r\ndifferent approach from that of the present will help  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our attractiveness as an investment  location.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  industrial land prices, I believe,  generally\r\n\r\nreflect their opportunity cost in Singapore.  That is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  the  valuation  of a piece of  industrial  land  is\r\n\r\ndetermined by the value of its alternative use.   As  the\r\n\r\nproperty market in Singapore has grown strongly for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  that has nudged up the price of industrial  land.\r\n\r\nBeyond  a  certain point, too high land costs  cannot  be\r\n\r\noffset   by  relative  productivity  factors,  and   some\r\n\r\nindustries may be prematurely priced out of the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.   And with their departure goes jobs.   Yet,  in\r\n\r\nthe long term, even property prices can only be sustained\r\n\r\nif  the  economy  does  well.  So therefore,  given  this\r\n\r\nnexus,  I really suggest we rethink how we want to  price\r\n\r\nindustrial land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the concept of opportunity cost. And I do\r\n\r\nthink  that it can be used in this case to benchmark  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  industrial land for given kinds of  industries\r\n\r\nagainst  relevant competing locations.  For instance,  if\r\n\r\nhaving  a  hub port, an air hub, or a chemical  industry,\r\n\r\nconsidered strategic to the interests of Singapore,  then\r\n\r\nthe   pricing  of  land  for  such  purposes  should   be\r\n\r\ndetermined  with  an  eye  on competing  locations.   The\r\n\r\npositive  multiplier effects in employment  and  spending\r\n\r\nwill, to some extent, compensate for any lower collection\r\n\r\nof land sales revenue upfront.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give an example. Arising out of the concern\r\n\r\nover terrorism, security at Jurong Island was stepped  up\r\n\r\nand  Police  had  to introduce a stricter  security  pass\r\n\r\ncontrol  system for that island.  As against the  initial\r\n\r\nestimate  of about 10,000 passes that they have to  issue\r\n\r\nfor  direct workers on the island, I am told that in  the\r\n\r\nend, they issued close to 100,000 passes.  So you can see\r\n\r\nthat  when you enable a hub like that to take place,  the\r\n\r\npositive  multiplier effects are significant.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  want to ask if we had charged condominium land prices\r\n\r\nfor the land in Jurong Island, for example, then could we\r\n\r\nhave  had the benefit of the 10,000 direct jobs  and  the\r\n\r\n100,000 indirect jobs created for Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our willingness and readiness to change and\r\n\r\nmake Singapore more attractive to investment, to business\r\n\r\nand to job creation will be the basis of a realistic hope\r\n\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the hopes of Singaporeans cannot rest\r\n\r\njust  on  what the Government does for us.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nchoose  to  ride the changes.  This is an  act  of  will.\r\n\r\nReturning  to the example of jobs, we must ask  ourselves\r\n\r\nthat  when  the Government pours in money on  the  supply\r\n\r\nside to create training places, what do we do?  Do we  do\r\n\r\nour part on the demand side by stepping forward and going\r\n\r\nfor  training  and  skills upgrading and  therefore  make\r\n\r\nourselves eligible for the new and restructured  jobs  of\r\n\r\nour current employers and future employers?  We must also\r\n\r\nask  ourselves what else are we doing to stay  employable\r\n\r\nin  the event that we are displaced.  In the light  of  a\r\n\r\nmore volatile environment, we must also ask ourselves how\r\n\r\nwe  can make better spending and investment decisions  as\r\n\r\nindividuals, especially on big ticket items, so  that  we\r\n\r\nwill be as unencumbered as possible financially, even  if\r\n\r\nwe are displaced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, informed individual choices and decisions,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  correct  policy  directions  and   speedy\r\n\r\nimplementation, give us confidence for the future.   This\r\n\r\nBudget promotes those outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Obviously, difficult times too.  But the  degree\r\n\r\ndiffers.   And this can be seen in the way  many  of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed and the retrenched behave.  Contrary  to  what\r\n\r\nhon.  Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang, said earlier, jobs  are\r\n\r\nstill available - plenty in fact - but not the ones  many\r\n\r\nof  the  retrenched or the unemployed are waiting for  or\r\n\r\nwilling to accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They give many and varied reasons why they chose not\r\n\r\nto  accept the jobs matched or assisted by the CDCs,  for\r\n\r\nexample.   Among  them:  \"Money no enough\";  \"Jauh  lo  - distance.  How can I work in Jurong?  I stay in  Punggol,\r\n\r\nyou  know?\";  \"No shift, please\"; \"Weekend free,  can  or\r\n\r\nnot?\";  \"Admin  job only, OK?\"  These  are  some  of  the\r\n\r\nresponses  that  we got from many of those  who  actually\r\n\r\ncame forward to seek help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand the low salary as being a not\r\n\r\nstrong  enough  pull, especially when  a  person,  having\r\n\r\nbenefited  from  the high wage policy and  earning  about\r\n\r\n$1,800-$2,000  after  working  for  about   10-15   years\r\n\r\nsuddenly  finds  himself retrenched,  with  two  kids  in\r\n\r\nschool and has recently upgraded to a 4- or 5-room  flat.\r\n\r\nThus, for someone like him - and there are many of them - the $1,000 salary, with a take-home of about $850, in the\r\n\r\nmind  of  such  a person, surely \"money no enough\".   But\r\n\r\nafter months of waiting, surely it is better to grab  the\r\n\r\n$850\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrather  than  no  money at all, except  for  the  interim\r\n\r\nassistance from Government, which is less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CDCs try. Nearly 5,000 applied\r\n\r\nfor  assistance last year at the North East CDC,  out  of\r\n\r\nwhich  65%  were matched, but only 14% placed with  jobs.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  macro  job fairs held with  the  help  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  to  a  more  focused  Compassvale\r\n\r\nlocality  and industry-based job fair, the CDC tried  and\r\n\r\ntried.   It  never gave up.  Even the GRC-based  approach\r\n\r\nwas  taken, through Pasir Ris-Punggol, for better  focus,\r\n\r\nwith  geographical  considerations  taken  into  account.\r\n\r\nTemporary employment through Town Councils too for  those\r\n\r\nin  arrears, pioneered by Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council,\r\n\r\nthanks to the hard work by its Chairman, the hon. Member,\r\n\r\nMr Charles Chong.  The scheme is now extended to Tampines\r\n\r\nand Aljunied Town Councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, times are bad, all right. My CDC\r\n\r\nofficers  now  tell me that there has been  a  change  in\r\n\r\nattitude lately.  More of those who came to seek help are\r\n\r\nless  choosy.   More desperate perhaps, savings  dry  up,\r\n\r\nrelatives'  help not as forthcoming, and  more  are  even\r\n\r\nprepared  for  training and retraining.  Before,  it  was\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  convince  them  to  go  for  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining, they were thinking that the Government,  with\r\n\r\nits  past track record, would be able to turn the economy\r\n\r\naround  in  no time, and they would go back to their  old\r\n\r\njobs.   I  personally know of cases of those who,  having\r\n\r\nworked as policemen, firemen, water boat men or tug  boat\r\n\r\nmen,  did  not see themselves in alternative work.   They\r\n\r\nwanted  to  work in the same jobs till retirement.   They\r\n\r\nare  proud  of  the  work they did, and  they  were  good\r\n\r\nworkers  indeed.  But those jobs are no longer available.\r\n\r\nThis  is the structural unemployment which the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been  trying to prepare Singaporeans for, especially\r\n\r\nin  terms of training and retraining.  But some,  perhaps\r\n\r\nmany, did not take heed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CDC experience shows how we\r\n\r\nhave  tried  and  how sad sometimes the stories  can  be.\r\n\r\nThey serve as a reality check as to how difficult times\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  be,  especially for those in need.  As hon. MP,  Mdm\r\n\r\nCynthia Phua, said yesterday, many have to tighten  their\r\n\r\nbelts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, reminds me of an anecdote, more like a\r\n\r\njoke.   There  was a time during the Cold War  days  when\r\n\r\nChina  used  to provide a lot of financial  aid  to  many\r\n\r\nAfrican countries.  One day, Chairman Mao got very  upset\r\n\r\nbecause  these  satellite countries were getting  spoilt.\r\n\r\nHe decided to give them a dose of reality check.  He sent\r\n\r\nthem a note:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Comrade, yes, times are bad, but we cannot go on\r\n\r\nlike this depending on others for help all the time.   We\r\n\r\nmust each do our part.  Tighten your belts.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came one reply:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Comrade Mao, you are right. We agree. We must\r\n\r\ntighten  our  belts.  Yes, Comrade, please  do  send  the\r\n\r\nbelts.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the situation faced by many of our\r\n\r\nretrenched and unemployed is no laughing matter.  Much of\r\n\r\nthe  interim assistance given out has been exhausted, and\r\n\r\neven those forced to take lower paying jobs are now faced\r\n\r\nwith  loans  and arrears beyond repair.   Money  owed  to\r\n\r\nSingapore Power for electricity and water has led to many\r\n\r\nnow  living without those amenities.  I do not  have  the\r\n\r\nnumbers, but perhaps during the Committee of Supply,  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministry would be able to give  us  an  update.\r\n\r\nBut  this  situation must have dented the level of  self-confidence and self-esteem in many of those affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say that many of those caught in this\r\n\r\npredicament  are  victims  of  their  own  situation  and\r\n\r\nfinancial mismanagement.  They will say that it  is  easy\r\n\r\nfor  people  like  us  to say that.  Nevertheless,  their\r\n\r\nproblems are real and they need urgent help.  I dare not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  say  that  we must provide more  of  Government\r\n\r\nassistance  to get them out of the deep hole.   Welfarism\r\n\r\nis not the way out.  But how do we fare as Government and\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans in the face of  these  needy  cases?\r\n\r\nThe  number  of fellow Singaporeans hauled to  court  for\r\n\r\nbankruptcy,  for example, must have risen, desperate  and\r\n\r\nnot  knowing  how  to save themselves.   All  these  will\r\n\r\ncertainly have an impact on their self-confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the number of those affected is large enough,\r\n\r\neither  from a social and low income group or,  worse,  a\r\n\r\nparticular  race - as a significant percentage  of  those\r\n\r\naffected  are  Malays and Indians - the  problem  becomes\r\n\r\nmore  acute.  There is a need to look at this problem  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  squeeze in the short term while we  pursue  to\r\n\r\nprepare  them to overcome their predicament for the  long\r\n\r\nterm through education and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member, Dr Wang Kai Yuen,\r\n\r\nearlier  this  morning described the situation  in  three\r\n\r\nwords:  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  I agree.  But may I  add  that\r\n\r\nthe  solution  is  in a 4-letter word,  an  abbreviation:\r\n\r\nJELL.   It  is not a signal for a short cut nor  a  quick\r\n\r\nfix.   But, indeed, it is to emphasise a longer term view\r\n\r\nfor  the future.  JELL stands for Jobs, Employability and\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning.   This is also the  approach  at  the\r\n\r\nNorth East CDC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore happy to welcome the decision by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to establish a statutory board in  charge  of\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning and Training.  MOM, NTUC, CDCs,  self-help groups and voluntary welfare organisations will tell\r\n\r\nus  that  there  are  serious  hurdles  to  overcome  for\r\n\r\ntraining  and retraining.  The untiring efforts shown  by\r\n\r\nMOM  and  other complementary agencies must continue  and\r\n\r\nshould  bear  fruit.   The Government,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  in  particular,  should  not  leave  any   stone\r\n\r\nunturned   here   to  provide  the  infrastructural   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  help needed to give the new board  a  fighting\r\n\r\nchance to succeed and to excel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mindsets and attitude problems on the ground are\r\n\r\nreal.   It could be as innocent as senior workers - those\r\n\r\n45  and  above  -  not  wanting  to  attend  classes  for\r\n\r\nperceived  fear  of  holding back  others,  to  the  more\r\n\r\nserious  ones like those having mental blocks to upgrade,\r\n\r\nespecially  with computer training.  The not-so-young  45\r\n\r\nand above, concept of retirement - for a long time pegged\r\n\r\nto  the  55-year mark - needs redressing, and their  grey\r\n\r\nmindset   about-one-job  whole-life  career   too   needs\r\n\r\nsensitive   overhauling.   Counselling  for  second   and\r\n\r\nalternative  careers needs to be looked at  carefully  as\r\n\r\nthere is a serious shortage of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncounsellors working on the ground, whether at  MOM,  CDCs\r\n\r\nor VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related but important new frontier, the\r\n\r\nGovernment's call for more entrepreneurs deserves  closer\r\n\r\nscrutiny  by  all for the opportunities they  come  with.\r\n\r\nMore can be done to upgrade and expand opportunities  and\r\n\r\nopen  up new fronts for employment.  We have often  heard\r\n\r\nthat not enough was done to support the nation's call for\r\n\r\nour  budding entrepreneurs.  From the stories we read  or\r\n\r\nheard or saw in the media, the new budding - and now more\r\n\r\nsuccessful  -  entrepreneurs did it on their  own  steam.\r\n\r\nThat  is what entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship are  all\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I personally believe that we could do\r\n\r\na  lot  more  to  sow the seeds for more  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nflowers  to bloom. While we would want to see more  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  succeed, creating  employment  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  I  feel  that it is equally important  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to nurture the spirit of enterprise in as many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, Sir, the North\r\n\r\nEast  CDC  believes so.  We start young, even at  primary\r\n\r\nschools.   In  fact, the need to instill  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nenterprise  should  cover all age groups.   Like  at  the\r\n\r\nNorth  East  CDC,  the Students Middle  Aged  and  Senior\r\n\r\nCitizens  (SMS) approach will provide opportunities  wide\r\n\r\nenough   for   all   to  realise  their   potential   for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and being enterprising.   Our  national\r\n\r\nefforts  at promoting entrepreneurship should also  cover\r\n\r\nas wide and as deep an area as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, jobs, JELL and entrepreneurship should\r\n\r\nprovide  us the glue that would bind the people  together\r\n\r\nin  good or in bad times. Economics, or livelihood, after\r\n\r\nall, is the best bond for social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to say that the Government should and\r\n\r\ncould do more but this is also an opportunity for us, the\r\n\r\npeople, to ask ourselves:  what have we done more to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhelp  ourselves and the economy in these uncertain times?\r\n\r\nYes,  the Government must and will have to take the  lead\r\n\r\nbut  the  people  must also have the will  to  learn  and\r\n\r\nunlearn  many  times  around what holds  for  the  future\r\n\r\neconomy and the challenges of uncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not swallow the Oliver Twist culture for more\r\n\r\nhook,  line  and  sinker  unthinkingly.   Instead,   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should stand up, fighting for - in the words\r\n\r\nof  SMS, Mr Khaw Boon Wan - a 'more than good' chance  to\r\n\r\nbe  the best through a competitive culture called  ERC  - Enterprising and Resourceful Culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to draw attention to two big areas of concern\r\n\r\nfor Singapore, both of which relate to our demographics - our aging population and our declining fertility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget addresses both subjects to varying\r\n\r\ndegrees - the aging population and the changes to the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rates, and in the measures to enhance  older\r\n\r\nworkers' employability.  With regard to fertility,  there\r\n\r\nis   one  solitary  item,  tax  exemption,  for  employer\r\n\r\nsubsidised  childcare benefits - not  much,  but  perhaps\r\n\r\njust a signal that the issue is not being forgotten.  For\r\n\r\ntoday, I will touch only on the first subject, leaving my\r\n\r\nobservations  on our pro-family efforts and policies  for\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Supply debate to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Marine Parade GRC, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua,\r\n\r\nspoke yesterday on the need for us to totally review  our\r\n\r\nconcept of retirement and the way that CPF is structured,\r\n\r\nagainst  the  background of CPF  withdrawal  age  of  55,\r\n\r\nretirement age of 62 and life expectancy of 78,  and  the\r\n\r\nrapidly  evolving  patterns of  employment  as  companies\r\n\r\ncompete  in  the globalised economy.   Many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  come  to  realise, with considerable consternation,\r\n\r\nthat  what  they had been taking for granted  or  assumed\r\n\r\nthat  somehow  CPF  would take care of  their  retirement\r\n\r\nneeds has been an illusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the\r\n\r\nAging Population found that only 24% of those turning  55\r\n\r\nhad  $60,000 in their Minimum Sum cash portion.  Now  the\r\n\r\nERC   estimates   that  even  of  new   account   holders\r\n\r\ncontributing for a full career span at current CPF rates,\r\n\r\nonly  50% would achieve the targeted $80,000 Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\nfor  the  cash  portion of $40,000.  The  Government  has\r\n\r\ntaken steps to limit the ceiling on CPF withdrawals to be\r\n\r\nmade  for  property purchases, and the DPM has  announced\r\n\r\nthat the rate of contribution to the Special Account will\r\n\r\nbe  raised  in  steps over the next three  years  towards\r\n\r\naddressing  the shortfall.  But even with  these,  it  is\r\n\r\nanticipated that only 60% of account holders  will  reach\r\n\r\nthe  target  Minimum  Sum level.   Further,  this  target\r\n\r\namount translates into an income stream of something like\r\n\r\n$600  per month, assuming a 4% interest rate for a period\r\n\r\nof  16 years, taking retirement at 62 and life expectancy\r\n\r\nat  78.   Thus, recognising that this amount may  not  be\r\n\r\nadequate  and, indeed, the ERC has recommended  that  the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum should be subsequently raised beyond $80,000.\r\n\r\nBut  truly,  how  much will we be  able  to  do  and,  if\r\n\r\nanything, at what pace?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, another major deficiency of the CPF\r\n\r\nmodel  in catering for Singaporeans' retirement needs  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  system  currently leaves out some  significant\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people - the self-employed,  workers  in  the\r\n\r\ninformal sector and home-makers - whose contributions are\r\n\r\nnot attributed economic value and are not included in its\r\n\r\ncover.  As the latter group is largely women, who will in\r\n\r\nall  probability outlive their husbands, their  financial\r\n\r\nsecurity in old age will be precarious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has taken the approach in its\r\n\r\nrecommendations that CPF should cater for the 10th to the\r\n\r\n80th  percentile  of  the  income  spectrum.   Now,  this\r\n\r\napproach makes eminent sense, as indeed the top  20%  can\r\n\r\nvery  well  look after itself and, truly, the bottom  10%\r\n\r\nwould   have   so   little  put  aside  through   regular\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates - as well as did  every  dollar  that\r\n\r\nthey   earned   to   meet   their  immediate   day-to-day\r\n\r\nexpenditures - that it does not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake sense to have them make an employee contribution  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, implicit in this recommendation is that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be 10% of the population who  will  have  no\r\n\r\nfinancial  provisions  for their  post-retirement  needs.\r\n\r\nThis is a very significant number.  Just some months ago,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Community Development and  Sports,  in\r\n\r\nanswer  to a question on the financial assistance schemes\r\n\r\navailable, shared that in the financial year 2001, almost\r\n\r\n15,000  beneficiaries were helped.  But on examining  the\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the numbers, one finds that the majority  of\r\n\r\nthese   were  either  in  interim  short-term  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes  or  for very specific purposes, such as  student\r\n\r\ncare  fee  assistance, and only 2,773 were  beneficiaries\r\n\r\nunder  the  main Public Assistance System.  Compare  this\r\n\r\nnumber to a full 10% of the population of workers as they\r\n\r\nreach retirement age. The DPM has mentioned in his Budget\r\n\r\nspeech  the  need  for  Government to  focus  its  social\r\n\r\nassistance  in  the future on only the truly  needy.   It\r\n\r\nappears  that  this group of truly needy may  be  a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant number.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has Government planned to provide for this\r\n\r\nbottom  10% in their retirement?  Is the intent to simply\r\n\r\ngear  up, so that more people will come under the current\r\n\r\nassistance schemes, coupled with continuing to depend  on\r\n\r\nfamilies   to  step  in the breach,  as  is  the  present\r\n\r\npractice and expectation?  Is this realistic, considering\r\n\r\nthe  trends  of  family formation that we  are  currently\r\n\r\nexperiencing?   Given this scenario of the  lack  of  any\r\n\r\nsavings  at  all for the bottom 10%, the full-time  home-makers not catered for in the CPF system, the anticipated\r\n\r\ninability of 40% of CPF account holders in the future  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  Minimum  Sum  target, and  indeed  the  likely\r\n\r\ninadequacy of that sum to generate enough monthly  income\r\n\r\nto  maintain  a desired living standard, it seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  a  critical  part  of  the  solution  must  be  the\r\n\r\ncontinued employability and employment of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us must be looking to being employed well\r\n\r\nbeyond  our current expectations, not only to keep active\r\n\r\nand engaged, but also to generate some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinuing income to supplement what we have been able to\r\n\r\nput  aside as savings.  In this, the Government has  been\r\n\r\nvery active and very visibly putting its money where  its\r\n\r\nmouth is, so to speak, with generous funding invested  in\r\n\r\nthe  Skills Redevelopment Programmes since 1996 and, more\r\n\r\ncurrently,  in the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme.\r\n\r\nThe  $0.5 billion that Government has just deposited into\r\n\r\nthe  Lifelong  Learning Fund in financial  year  2002  to\r\n\r\nbring  it  to  $1.5  billion to date  will  generate  $16\r\n\r\nmillion  of  interest income to continue to  support  the\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  and retraining  programmes.   This  is\r\n\r\ntruly  a  commitment that few governments  anywhere  else\r\n\r\nwould  make and something which  Singaporeans should  not\r\n\r\ntake  for  granted.   But  Government's  willingness   to\r\n\r\ngenerously fund skills upgrading and retraining alone  is\r\n\r\nnot enough. Workers and employers need also to play their\r\n\r\npart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the workers' part, while some are still refusing\r\n\r\nto accept the reality of Singapore's changing environment\r\n\r\nand  its implications and impact on them personally -  as\r\n\r\njust  been recounted by Mayor Zainul Abidin Rasheed  -  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that there are many more people now who are  much\r\n\r\nmore willing to adjust their expectations and to try  new\r\n\r\njobs  in  sectors  that  they  may  not  have  considered\r\n\r\nattractive  enough previously.  There are jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable, if all parties are willing to give it a try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides creating new jobs in new sectors, we have\r\n\r\nsome  900,000  non-Singaporeans  working  in  our  midst.\r\n\r\nWhile  we welcome them and know we will continue to  rely\r\n\r\non them far into the future, there are many sectors, like\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  for example, where employers would  welcome,\r\n\r\nwith open arms, willing locals to fill positions, so that\r\n\r\nwe   can   moderate  the  ratio  of  local  to  non-local\r\n\r\nemployees.   The  Government has  put  in  the  money  to\r\n\r\nsupport  reskilling workers. Workers are now more willing\r\n\r\nto   give  the  schemes  a  try  and  to  moderate  their\r\n\r\nexpectations.  Now, employers must also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  willing to overcome their prejudices and mindsets  to\r\n\r\nhire these mid-career recruits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share a success story, not only to\r\n\r\nencourage  workers currently looking for a break  in  the\r\n\r\ndark  clouds  that they can take heart, but  more  so  to\r\n\r\nencourage  employers to engage in some enlightened  self-interest.  It is about our experience in KK Hospital with\r\n\r\na  group  of new recruits who underwent three  months  of\r\n\r\ntraining  in the National Skills Standard for  healthcare\r\n\r\nattendants.  In fact, in the HMI training programme  that\r\n\r\nmy  NMP colleague, Dr Gan See Khem, had established, they\r\n\r\nare a small group and they have been with us for just two\r\n\r\nmonths.   But I have been tracking their progress  and  I\r\n\r\nam confident enough that they will be long-term employees\r\n\r\nwith us to share our story with the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started with 10 recruits, mostly in their 40s\r\n\r\nfrom   varied   backgrounds  -   clerical,   secretarial,\r\n\r\nproduction operations, storemen. They are now deployed in\r\n\r\nfrontline  positions in our wards, clinics and  operating\r\n\r\ntheatres.  Frontline jobs in healthcare institutions  are\r\n\r\nvery tough work.  You are on your feet most of the day in\r\n\r\nconstant patient contact and service, going on shifts.  I\r\n\r\ncan  tell  you  that this group has had some  tough  time\r\n\r\nadjusting,  but  they  are  very  determined   and   very\r\n\r\ncommitted to making this endeavour work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hospital's part, each of their supervisors\r\n\r\nhad  been  briefed as to making an extra effort  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  settle in, to be available to help, either to coach\r\n\r\nor  to assist, just to provide encouragement.  We started\r\n\r\nwith  10,  we  have lost three, who are  unable  to  make\r\n\r\nmainly  the  physical adjustments.  The remaining  seven,\r\n\r\nhowever,  their reports on them, both from  the  recruits\r\n\r\nthemselves,  as well as their supervisors, is  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  got  through  the adjustment  period  and  are  now\r\n\r\nfunctioning  very comfortably in their  assignments.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  have been given top marks by the supervisors\r\n\r\nfor attitude and performance.  I think 7 out of 10, a 70%\r\n\r\nretention rate, is pretty good, and I am very happy  with\r\n\r\nthe outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of 40-somethings is a shining example of\r\n\r\nwhat   is   possible  with  reskilling,  good   attitude,\r\n\r\ncommitment  and the willingness to stick it  out  through\r\n\r\nthe  initial  adjustment to a new work environment.   The\r\n\r\nmoral  of  the  story is that effort  is  most  certainly\r\n\r\nrequired  on  the  part  of  the  workers,  and  on   the\r\n\r\nemployers,   in  paying  attention  to  job   fit,   some\r\n\r\norientation  and  instructions on the job  and  attention\r\n\r\nfrom supervisors in helping the new mid-career recruit to\r\n\r\nsettle in and adjust.  This did not take a huge effort or\r\n\r\ncommitment  of any additional resources on the  company's\r\n\r\npart,   mainly   just  some  additional  attention   from\r\n\r\nsupervisors in the initial period.  For that the hospital\r\n\r\nhas  gained  a  bunch of enthused, committed  and  stable\r\n\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in these tough times an opportunity to\r\n\r\nredesign  jobs  and  to fill vacancies  with  mature  and\r\n\r\nstable workers.  Not all sectors are in the doldrums  and\r\n\r\nI  would like to take the occasion to encourage employers\r\n\r\nin those sectors that are in good shape to engage also in\r\n\r\nwhat  is  not at all altruistic, but distinctly in  their\r\n\r\nown  self-interest,  as I believe the  returns  are  well\r\n\r\nworth the efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shared one story of one group in one\r\n\r\norganisation.   We must share all other  success  stories\r\n\r\nthat  there  are, big and small, to talk  about  what  is\r\n\r\npossible  and workable and viable.  But beyond  spreading\r\n\r\nthe good word, we need to do more, to urgently accelerate\r\n\r\nthe process, getting companies over preconceived ideas of\r\n\r\nthe   capabilities  and  commitments  of  older  workers.\r\n\r\nExhortation and proselytising would only get us that far.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to therefore suggest that  it  may  be  a\r\n\r\nworthwhile  investment to incentivise employers  to  hire\r\n\r\nolder workers by offering tax offsets against the cost of\r\n\r\nemploying  these  re-skilled older recruits,  but  for  a\r\n\r\nlimited period only of, say, 3-5 years, as the intent  is\r\n\r\npurely to get them pass the existing immediate prejudices\r\n\r\nand mindsets.  Once employers have had the opportunity to\r\n\r\nget past the initial scepticism, I am sure that they will\r\n\r\nhave  enough positive experiences with older workers that\r\n\r\nsweeteners would no longer be necessary in the long  run.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, details of such a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  will have to be worked out to prevent gaming  and\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has already shown the importance it\r\n\r\nplaces   on   addressing   the  problem   of   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  enhancing the employability  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers  in the generous funding it continues  to  direct\r\n\r\ntowards skills upgrading and retraining programmes.  This\r\n\r\ninvestment  in reskilling would go to waste if  employers\r\n\r\ndo  not  respond  in  sufficient numbers.   I  believe  a\r\n\r\nconcerted  effort to incentivise companies for a  limited\r\n\r\nterm  to hire older reskilled workers would be well worth\r\n\r\nthe money spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other significant factors in the total\r\n\r\npicture  of enhancing the employability of older workers.\r\n\r\nThe  two  most  important that have been discussed  often\r\n\r\nbefore are moving away from a seniority-based wage system\r\n\r\nand  portable medical benefits.  We have been  discussing\r\n\r\nmoving away from a seniority-based wage system since  the\r\n\r\n1980s.  As recommended by the ERC, we really need to  act\r\n\r\nmuch more expeditiously on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to portable medical benefits, the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has offered both a bit of a carrot and  a\r\n\r\nstick  in  the  budget.  But the question  is:   is  this\r\n\r\nenough,  and  how  can we move this along  faster?   Both\r\n\r\nMembers,  Halimah  Yacob and Heng  Chee  How,  have  also\r\n\r\nspoken on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while the manufacturing sector continues to\r\n\r\nbe  very  important  to us, many of  the  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable,  and  will be available, are in  the  services\r\n\r\nsector.   Singaporeans need to change yet another mindset\r\n\r\n-  that  of the attitudes towards work in serving  others\r\n\r\nand  accord  such  honest  labour  the  respect  that  it\r\n\r\ndeserves.  This would facilitate the transition  we  need\r\n\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand\r\n\r\nin  support  of  the motion raised by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.    I  would  like  to  especially  welcome   his\r\n\r\nMinistry's acceptance of the recommendations by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review Committee on focusing to make  Singapore\r\n\r\nthe regional hub for new areas like healthcare, education\r\n\r\nand creative industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some time ago raised the notion in this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  Singapore becomes the regional medical  hub.\r\n\r\nThis  idea is not new; the implications are not  unknown.\r\n\r\nWe  have,  indeed, been there, but balked each  time.   I\r\n\r\nhope that this time this idea will not be thwarted again,\r\n\r\nlest we lose the chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia and Thailand have been making up\r\n\r\nground  in  healthcare services by leaps and bounds.   In\r\n\r\n2001,  the  Thai's Bumrungrad Hospital alone saw  225,000\r\n\r\nforeign  patients; much more than all  the  hospitals  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  put  together.   Treatment  like  open   heart\r\n\r\nsurgery,  once  considered beyond the abilities  of  many\r\n\r\nhospitals,  is something most hospitals in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nThailand offer today, at a fraction of the costs  charged\r\n\r\nhere.   Both  Malaysia and Thailand have  declared  their\r\n\r\nintention to go for a bigger slice of the healthcare  pie\r\n\r\nin  the  region.  Both these countries have the advantage\r\n\r\nof  lower  costs and the marked difference  in  costs  is\r\n\r\ndriving large numbers of cost-conscious patients from the\r\n\r\nregion away from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the serious questions encountered from this\r\n\r\nidea  of  making Singapore into the regional medical  hub\r\n\r\nthat  caused  key  players to abandon  it  in  the  past?\r\n\r\nFirst,   the  fear  of  spiralling  cost  of  healthcare.\r\n\r\nSecond,  \"the demonstration effect\", which is the  effect\r\n\r\nof  increasing  demand from the local populace  expecting\r\n\r\nthe  services being offered to foreign patients at  full-fee paying prices and perception of inequality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of spiralling costs, having more full-paying foreign patients, apart from giving a spin-off\r\n\r\neffect for our other services by having more visitors  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, may be a source of subsidy rather than a cause\r\n\r\nof  rising  healthcare  costs for local  patients.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is a need for a mindset change here.  Getting more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign  patients  paying full rates  help  hospitals  in\r\n\r\noperating  costs  and may moderate the  need  for  future\r\n\r\nhospital fees hikes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more cost effective and sensible to share\r\n\r\nexpertise   and   expensive   equipment   in   Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  very specialised fields  like  liver\r\n\r\ntransplants and gamma-knife facilities.  There is  not  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  pool of patients to support these areas  from\r\n\r\nour  population  of 3 million people.  Super  specialists\r\n\r\nwill  get more patients to keep their skills and  improve\r\n\r\non  them.   This will benefit both the local and  foreign\r\n\r\npatients in the end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present scheme of blurring the\r\n\r\nprivate   and   public   sectors  by   allowing   private\r\n\r\nspecialists to come back to public hospitals as  visiting\r\n\r\nconsultants  and allowing public hospital specialists  to\r\n\r\npractise  in  the private sector will minimise  the  ill-effects  of  doctors leaving the public sector  for  more\r\n\r\nlucrative  returns  in  the private  sector.   There  are\r\n\r\nenough specialists, especially in the private sector,  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  both  local  and foreign  patients.   Private\r\n\r\nhospitals today are running at less than half capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiralling healthcare costs are inevitable the world\r\n\r\nover.    Having  foreign  patients  here  will   have   a\r\n\r\ncushioning effect rather than a worse-off effect in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  Sir, the real reasons for our inevitable rising\r\n\r\nhealthcare  costs  are  the  increasing  expectations  of\r\n\r\npatients,  the  Government's assurance  that  our  public\r\n\r\nhealthcare system is the best, the demographic  variables\r\n\r\nof  population  growth  and age structure,  the  changing\r\n\r\nepidemiological patterns of diseases with a shift towards\r\n\r\nchronic  degenerative conditions requiring intensive  and\r\n\r\nlonger-term  care  and  the  rapid  advances  of  complex\r\n\r\ncapital-intensive technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of perception of inequality, consensus\r\n\r\nmust  be  reached  through more informed  discussion  and\r\n\r\npublic  education.   Assurance  must  be  given  on  good\r\n\r\naffordable  and  basic  healthcare to  all  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSir, the demand in medical care could be moderated by the\r\n\r\nsuppliers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthemselves.    Since  consumers  cannot  exercise   their\r\n\r\nsovereignty  in  purchasing the  appropriate  amount  and\r\n\r\nlevel  of medical care in most cases, they are invariably\r\n\r\ndependent  on  the  expert judgement  of  the  providers.\r\n\r\nHence, to address this issue, healthcare providers can be\r\n\r\nsubjected to the audit of an effective watchdog body with\r\n\r\na  system of checks and balances and healthcare providers\r\n\r\nshould  be  bound  by ethical codes of  conduct.   Public\r\n\r\nhospital A-class beds should be limited to not more  than\r\n\r\n13%.   A  further measure may be the requirement  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  hospital  providers  to  follow  prescribed  fair\r\n\r\nallocation of time for local populace as against  foreign\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the challenges facing this path of being\r\n\r\nthe medical hub of the region?  Sir, I feel the following\r\n\r\nareas are worth elaborating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's healthcare services are high in costs\r\n\r\nand  fees  in  comparison to about half in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nabout  one-third in Thailand.  In this respect, I applaud\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Review Committee's recommendation to ensure\r\n\r\nadequate  supply  of  land  at  institutional  rates  for\r\n\r\nmedical  hub developments.  Singapore may have  lost  the\r\n\r\nedge  to  Malaysia and Thailand for many low-end  medical\r\n\r\ntreatments and Singapore should aim for high-end  medical\r\n\r\ntreatments  such  as  transplant surgery,  complex  heart\r\n\r\nsurgery  and  other  complicated or  advanced  surgeries.\r\n\r\nThere  must be concerted efforts by service providers  to\r\n\r\ncontain  and  keep  healthcare prices  more  competitive.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  feel that integration of the private and  public\r\n\r\nsectors is the way forward to maximise our resource pool,\r\n\r\nto  have better economies of scale, to contain costs  and\r\n\r\nto avoid duplication of services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need for mindset change here by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to treat these two sectors as one  entity  to\r\n\r\nachieve  our  aim  of  being  competitive  globally.    I\r\n\r\ntherefore   welcome   the  Economic  Review   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  on the establishment  of  a  responsible\r\n\r\nhealthcare  consumer  forum for greater  transparency  on\r\n\r\npricing and clinical practice norms and the introduction,\r\n\r\nselectively, of subvented\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealthcare   at  private  facilities  to  help   generate\r\n\r\neconomies of scale in the private sector and enable  them\r\n\r\nto provide more cost-competitive services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a very good reputation as a\r\n\r\ncentre   of   medical  excellence  and   our   healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals are recognised for their high  quality  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.   We need to have more structured  aggressive\r\n\r\nmarketing  of  this  fact.  Both the private  and  public\r\n\r\nsectors  must  undertake this in  a  coordinated  manner.\r\n\r\nRemembering  that  there is increasing  protectionism  of\r\n\r\nlocal  healthcare  services in  other  countries,  joint-ventures  with reputable big names within the  region  to\r\n\r\nform  strategic alliances may be necessary.  Other  areas\r\n\r\nworth considering should include offering incentives  and\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  healthcare professionals,  strengthening\r\n\r\ninternational  professional  associations  and  enhancing\r\n\r\nnetworking with regional healthcare providers.  China  is\r\n\r\na  country  with  a huge potential demand for  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices  and  is a new market that needs  our  immediate\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have the upper edge, there is a\r\n\r\nneed  for  innovations and an ability to  predict  future\r\n\r\ntrends.   For example, with the trend towards  an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation, there will be an increase in the incidence of\r\n\r\nchronic diseases.  Thus, a greater focus on strategies in\r\n\r\neldercare and health promotion as well as development  of\r\n\r\ntreatments for chronic diseases should be encouraged.   A\r\n\r\ngood  example  would  be  the  recent  improved  surgical\r\n\r\nprocedure by our local doctors on reshaping the heart  to\r\n\r\ngive  patients with chronic heart failure a new lease  of\r\n\r\nlife.  For nearly two-thirds of patients who are waiting,\r\n\r\noften in vain, for a new heart, this new procedure  is  a\r\n\r\nsolution.  This procedure costs a third of the price of a\r\n\r\nheart  transplant and thus gives us the  extra  advantage\r\n\r\nwith regard to foreign patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our \"research culture\" had not been great and\r\n\r\n\"clinical  research\", especially, was never the emphasis.\r\n\r\nOur public hospitals' priorities are driven by maximising\r\n\r\nimmediate returns.  Clinicians, especially\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  specialists,  are  incentivised  to  treat  as  many\r\n\r\npatients  as  possible; they become too preoccupied  with\r\n\r\nthe  routines and are required to tend to maximal numbers\r\n\r\nof  patients.  That leaves them with little or no time to\r\n\r\nteach  the juniors, let alone spend time on research.   A\r\n\r\nlot  of  changes  at  our institutions  are  required  to\r\n\r\npromote,  identify and support the different  aspects  of\r\n\r\nclinical research.  Research activities on the world-wide\r\n\r\nprevalent diseases should be expanded expeditiously.  One\r\n\r\ngood   example  is  the  research  on  prevention,  early\r\n\r\ndiagnosis  and  drug therapies to combat  coronary  heart\r\n\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order for Singapore to remain competitive,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to pay attention to the training of the  future\r\n\r\ngeneration   of  our  healthcare  providers.    Only   by\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to  invest heavily on our  undergraduate  and\r\n\r\npostgraduate  medical education will we ensure  that  our\r\n\r\ndoctors  will  be competent and conversant with  the  new\r\n\r\ndevelopments in medical sciences.  Thus, our  investments\r\n\r\non  the Health Manpower Development Programme ought to be\r\n\r\nenhanced.  The learning of medicine is an apprenticeship;\r\n\r\none  cannot  be a good doctor just by reading  textbooks.\r\n\r\nWe  must  encourage those who are willing  to  teach  and\r\n\r\nthose who are willing to learn by providing them with the\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is worthwhile to include the extension of\r\n\r\nthe  service hub to become a training hub, as  this  will\r\n\r\nboost our aim of being a medical hub in the region.  This\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  effect of promoting  collaboration  with\r\n\r\ndoctors  in  the  neighbouring countries and  of  gaining\r\n\r\ntheir acceptance of us.  Training is a great professional\r\n\r\nrelationship  creator.  The goodwill and mentorship  will\r\n\r\ncontinue long after the training period is over.  Word of\r\n\r\nmouth is the most effective form of advertisement of  our\r\n\r\nmedical  capabilities.  It would be  far  more  effective\r\n\r\nthan  any  advertisement campaign, which might  earn  the\r\n\r\nwrath  of  the authorities in our neighbours.   There  is\r\n\r\nalso  a need for the public sector to involve the private\r\n\r\nsector as partners of the training and service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhub.  Only then could we have optimised our strengths  as\r\n\r\na medical hub in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovative packaging with other products such as\r\n\r\ninsurance, travel arrangements, hotel and shopping  needs\r\n\r\nshould  be  facilitated to make it  more  attractive  for\r\n\r\nconsumers to come here.  The various service sectors will\r\n\r\nno  doubt benefit when the consumers decide to  come.   A\r\n\r\ncoordinating   body  that  plans  and   complements   the\r\n\r\ndifferent  services to meet the needs of end-users  in  a\r\n\r\nmutually consistent way should be formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of most of the Economic\r\n\r\nReview Committee's recommendations on promoting Singapore\r\n\r\nas  the regional medical hub, I do have a differing  view\r\n\r\non  their recommendation on reviewing the regulations  in\r\n\r\nthe Public Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, with a view\r\n\r\nto  relax  restrictions on responsible  institution-based\r\n\r\nadvertising locally and abroad.  Sir, ethical issues have\r\n\r\nalways been of paramount importance in the conduct of our\r\n\r\nmedical profession, especially with regard to advertising\r\n\r\nor  medical  services.  There is  already  provision  for\r\n\r\nlimited   and   responsible  advertisement   locally   by\r\n\r\nindividuals  and  an  even  wider  provision  for  public\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising abroad is restricted by the enacted laws\r\n\r\nof  the  foreign  countries, thus  forbidding  others  to\r\n\r\nadvertise in their countries.  The gamma-knife incident a\r\n\r\nyear ago is a good case in point.   The Malaysian doctors\r\n\r\nviewed  the promotion of this new modality to a group  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  the public in Kuala Lumpur by a Singaporean\r\n\r\ndoctor  to be ethically unacceptable and indeed lodged  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to  the  Singapore Medical  Council.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthere  were  formal complaints lodged with the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical  Association in the past by neighbouring  medical\r\n\r\nassociations that Singapore doctors and private hospitals\r\n\r\nadvertised  their medical services in the newspapers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Yellow  Pages  of the neighbouring  countries.   The\r\n\r\ncomplainants felt this was distasteful and unethical.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concerns arising from relaxing\r\n\r\nadvertisement locally by individuals will be the creation\r\n\r\nof  unhealthy  demands  for certain  services  by  locals\r\n\r\nrather  than attracting foreign patients. The possibility\r\n\r\nof   boosting  unnecessary  local  consumption  and  over\r\n\r\nzealous  advertisements  may  also  mislead  the  public.\r\n\r\nLiberalising  advertisments locally may  degenerate  into\r\n\r\nenticement  or  persuasion of the public to  use  medical\r\n\r\nservices for maximising profits of the doctor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Finance Minister would\r\n\r\nconsider  my suggestions on making Singapore the regional\r\n\r\nhub for healthcare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  beyond  4.30  pm  and the  proceedings  thereon  be\r\n\r\nexempted  at  this day's sitting from the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1.  -  [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br>3.40 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank  you for allowing me to participate  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year seemed to be the \"R\" year for Singapore - Singaporeans were introduced to many \"R\" words that they\r\n\r\nare  not  usually  used  to  -  restructuring,  remaking,\r\n\r\nrefreshing, revitalising, renewal.    Those are  the  few\r\n\r\nthat  I can think of so far.  Actually, these words  have\r\n\r\none  thing in common.  They are the base words  with  the\r\n\r\nprefix   \"re\".   I  am  not a linguist  but  these  words\r\n\r\nsuggest  that what we have been doing previously  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger relevant.  Thus, the need for us to redo them, and\r\n\r\nwe  must before Singaporeans get fatigued with the letter\r\n\r\n\"R\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to focus on several aspects related\r\n\r\nto the issue of Enhancing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHuman  Capital presented by the Minister for Finance  and\r\n\r\nthe ERC Report.  Like many of my colleagues in the House,\r\n\r\nI welcome the Government's decision to set up a statutory\r\n\r\nboard to facilitate this process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I want to talk about is the issue of\r\n\r\ntraining and lifelong learning.  Sir, apart for the  \"re\"\r\n\r\nwords,  Singaporeans are also rather fatigued  with  this\r\n\r\nconstant  reminder to train and internalise the value  of\r\n\r\nlifelong    learning.   Yesterday,  Ms   Indranee   Rajah\r\n\r\neloquently  argued  that Singaporeans  should  just  pull\r\n\r\nthemselves  up together and do their part and not  expect\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to do everything for  them.   Certainly,\r\n\r\nthis is easier said than done.  How many Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nactually hearing the calls made in this House and outside\r\n\r\nthis  House by Ministers, MPs, union leaders, etc?   But,\r\n\r\nmore importantly, how many in this House are hearing  the\r\n\r\ncries  and  pleas of Singaporeans?  Are  we  speaking  in\r\n\r\ndifferent   languages?   Do  we  understand  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nenough?   Are  we  reaching out enough to  the  different\r\n\r\ntarget groups?  We need to understand the deeper and more\r\n\r\ncomplex issues that will motivate Singaporeans to  accept\r\n\r\nthe need for them to train and continue to train.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>3.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Ministry of Manpower conducted a study on\r\n\r\nadult  training in the year 2000.  Overall, it was  found\r\n\r\nthat only a third of the economically active Singaporeans\r\n\r\nengaged  in training.  The timeframe was 12 months  prior\r\n\r\nto  the study.  Also, it was found that participation  in\r\n\r\ntraining  is  inversely related to  age  and  educational\r\n\r\nqualification.   The higher educated  workers  were  more\r\n\r\nwilling  to  undertake training than the  lower  educated\r\n\r\nones,  and  so  are the younger workers compared  to  the\r\n\r\nolder workers.  Of significant importance I think is  the\r\n\r\nfinding  on  the motivations or lack thereof among  those\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds who did not actively participate in  training.\r\n\r\nOne quarter of them indicated no desire to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrain  at  all.   Amongst those who  indicated  interest,\r\n\r\nfactors  that will motivate them to train include whether\r\n\r\nthe  training can improve their career prospects,  having\r\n\r\nmore  time to go for training, the affordability  of  the\r\n\r\ncourse fees, and when their family commitments are  taken\r\n\r\ncare of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more recent study in 2002 amongst retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  also  showed  similar  trends,  especially   the\r\n\r\ninverse  relationship  between educational  qualification\r\n\r\nand  age  with willingness to undergo training.  In  this\r\n\r\nstudy,  it was found that the educated workers  were  two\r\n\r\ntimes more willing to train compared to the less educated\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst those who were re-employed, 30% indicated\r\n\r\ntheir  unwillingness  to  seek  training.   More  than  a\r\n\r\nquarter  of them gave the reason that it is not necessary\r\n\r\nor that they were not required to go for training  - this\r\n\r\ndespite having been retrenched previously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, obviously, there needs to be a targeted\r\n\r\napproach  at  different groups.   I  wonder  if  we  have\r\n\r\nstudied these trends sufficiently.  Are we being fair  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in asking them to buck up and do their part,\r\n\r\nwhen perhaps they have very little idea what is happening\r\n\r\nand  what  they  are expected to do?   I  wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has an indication how many Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nactually  picked  up  the  ERC  Report,  whether  in  the\r\n\r\nbookstores  or  downloaded them from the  Internet.   How\r\n\r\nmany   Singaporeans,  especially  the   lower   educated,\r\n\r\nunderstand  what is in the Report?  Do they  really  know\r\n\r\nwhere  we  want them to go and what they are supposed  to\r\n\r\ndo?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have argued before in this House the need for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  identify and own the  problem  that  we\r\n\r\nface.  We have to make them understand these problems and\r\n\r\nthen  own it together with the Government before  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect  them to come up and do their part.  I  think,  so\r\n\r\nfar,  all  they  have  heard in the last  two  years  is,\r\n\r\n\"economy is bad, so cut CPF; economy is still bad, cannot\r\n\r\nbe choosy;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy  may  still remain bad, must go for training  and\r\n\r\nupgrade  yourself;  must remain relevant,  otherwise  you\r\n\r\nwill be in trouble.\"  Basically, keep striving; do not be\r\n\r\ncomplacent, or else you will be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next point - implications of\r\n\r\nthis  requirement to upgrade on the family.  The  earlier\r\n\r\nlist  I  highlighted also noted that  training  was  more\r\n\r\nprevalent  amongst  workers who are  single  compared  to\r\n\r\nthose who are married.  Of course, if we factor the issue\r\n\r\nof  age  and  educational qualification, we will  realise\r\n\r\nthat  those  who need training most are not  getting  it.\r\n\r\nThis is not surprising as heavier family commitment could\r\n\r\nhave  hindered training participation amongst the married\r\n\r\npersons.   Madam, to many Singaporeans, this is the  real\r\n\r\nissue.  The average couple with two school-going children\r\n\r\nwork  during  the  day and spend the evening  supervising\r\n\r\ntheir children's education, if they are capable of.  Some\r\n\r\nhave  difficulties even doing so.  Some have to work  two\r\n\r\njobs  to survive.  Now, we want them to train and upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves, to develop our human capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this growing emphasis for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and upgrade to stay relevant and perhaps sharpen\r\n\r\ntheir  competitive edge, we must seriously  consider  the\r\n\r\nimpact on the family.  Unless training opportunities  are\r\n\r\navailable  during working hours, most training  is  often\r\n\r\ndone after working hours.  There needs to be a supportive\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to enable this to be part  of  the  living\r\n\r\npatterns  of Singaporeans.  Without such infrastructures,\r\n\r\nmany  will  find the pressures too harsh to  handle.   We\r\n\r\nalready  have  problems of latch-key  children  with  two\r\n\r\nparents who have to work during the day.  Can you imagine\r\n\r\nthe phenomenon that will develop when parents have to  go\r\n\r\nfor  their  classes in the evenings?  These are  systemic\r\n\r\neffects  that  will further challenge the institution  of\r\n\r\nthe  family.   Madam, with all these complex  demands  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and their families, do we wonder  why  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  choose  to  remain  single  or   not   have\r\n\r\nchildren?   I  would  like to support  the  call  by  Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah Yacob yesterday to set up the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNational  Council  on  the  Family  to  ensure   a   more\r\n\r\nsystematic  and  systemic approach at  addressing  issues\r\n\r\naffecting the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related aspect to the family is that of youths at\r\n\r\nrisk, as we enhance the human capital.  As we discuss the\r\n\r\nimpact  of this new development on the family, one  issue\r\n\r\nthat  arises  is  that of youths at risk.   Reports  have\r\n\r\nrecently  shown the sharp increase in juvenile crime  and\r\n\r\nmany  experts  attribute  it  to  the  lack  of  parental\r\n\r\nsupervision in the family.  Can you imagine what it would\r\n\r\nmean  when  parents are expected to spend  more  time  in\r\n\r\ntraining?  What will happen to the supervision  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those children and youths who are already\r\n\r\nvictims   of   circumstance  and   currently   undergoing\r\n\r\nrehabilitation, we must ensure that sufficient  resources\r\n\r\nare  allocated  to allow them to develop their  potential\r\n\r\ntoo.   Many do find it difficult to fit back into society\r\n\r\nand  may  then graduate to be adult offenders.   We  must\r\n\r\nprevent this from happening.  Madam, we must also do what\r\n\r\nwe  say.  When we say that every Singaporean matters,  we\r\n\r\nmust  recognise  their  potential  and  facilitate  their\r\n\r\nenhancement, including those who have failed before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on is that of\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of the private sector in facilitating\r\n\r\nthis  whole notion about lifelong learning and  continued\r\n\r\neducation.  We have been asking much of Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nI  think Singaporeans have been trying their best  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  part.   They swallowed painfully the reality  when\r\n\r\ntold that their employers' CPF will not be restored fully\r\n\r\nfor  another two years.  Last year, during the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe CPF issue, I highlighted the need for employers to do\r\n\r\ntheir  part.   This  is  even more crucial  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntraining.   The MOM study I cited earlier also  indicated\r\n\r\nthat workers in the public sector are twice as likely  to\r\n\r\nhave  gone for training compared to those in the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the public sector, as I was told, has a\r\n\r\npolicy  that  every civil servant has the  right  to  100\r\n\r\nhours  of  training per year.  This is very  encouraging.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think there is any such policy for workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  private  sector.  It is  up  to  the  respective\r\n\r\nemployers  to  facilitate the process for their  workers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  culture that has to be developed, but  if  the\r\n\r\nenvironment is not conducive, then the value will not  be\r\n\r\ninternalised  by  the  people.  I encourage  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  employers to also do their part  in  making  this\r\n\r\nrestructuring  work.  Much is provided for  them  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget to facilitate their business but they must also do\r\n\r\ntheir  part  in  making it easier for their  workers.   I\r\n\r\nencourage the Government to consider mechanisms that will\r\n\r\nrecognise employers who are pro-training, as we recognise\r\n\r\npro-family firms.  A code in relation to training  rights\r\n\r\nof workers akin to the one in the public sector should be\r\n\r\ndrawn up and implemented in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the education profiles of our workers are\r\n\r\ndiverse  and  I  have made the point about the  different\r\n\r\napproaches  needed to reach out to them.  The educational\r\n\r\nlevels  of our workers have also proportionally increased\r\n\r\nover  time.  As we encourage the internalisation  of  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  lifelong  learning, we  need  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  the means to upgrade  themselves  and\r\n\r\ncertainly take personal responsibility for their training\r\n\r\nand  upgrading  processes.  The Government has  allocated\r\n\r\nmuch  resources  in  this  regard,  through  the  various\r\n\r\nprogrammes as well as through the Lifelong Learning Fund.\r\n\r\nHowever,    in    line    with    encouraging    personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility, some of these workers may need to top  up\r\n\r\nthe course fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of workers who may need substantial\r\n\r\nresources   in   upgrading  are  the  professionals   and\r\n\r\ngraduates.   To  them, the only way up is  to  get  post-graduate  training.  Currently, however,  there  is  very\r\n\r\nlittle support in this area.  I would recommend that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider setting up a separate account in  the\r\n\r\nCPF  called  the Lifelong Learning Account which  can  be\r\n\r\nused  for  topping up of course fees as well as fees  for\r\n\r\npost-graduate  training.  This will certainly  facilitate\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  ability to upgrade themselves,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  higher educated ones who already have the  necessary\r\n\r\nmotivations.  I recognise that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has already raised the  tax  relief  for\r\n\r\ncourse  fees  to $3,500 as well as allow tax  relief  for\r\n\r\nfees  for  seminars  and  conferences.   This  is  indeed\r\n\r\nlaudable.   But the individual Lifelong Learning  Account\r\n\r\nwill  further  enhance  the ability  of  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ninternalise this value of lifelong learning.  The reality\r\n\r\nis  that  very few Singaporeans have cash savings  to  be\r\n\r\nused  for  upgrading and allowing them to use  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings will go a long way in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the \"re\" words that I started out with imply\r\n\r\na  constant  process of change.  Any change  will  create\r\n\r\nsystemic  efforts on the different actors in the equation\r\n\r\n-  from the workers to the families, to the employers and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  to the Government.  Each plays  a  critical\r\n\r\nrole.   The action of one will affect the others  and  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  speak  to  each other in a language  that  each\r\n\r\nunderstands.  We know that we need to enhance  our  human\r\n\r\ncapital - indeed, I grew up being indoctrinated with this\r\n\r\npoint  that  human resource is our best and  only  asset.\r\n\r\nFor the people to accept this, they need to be convinced,\r\n\r\nand  sold  too.   They need to own it.  I  encourage  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to tell them what to do, rather  to  share\r\n\r\nwith them what we can do to make this work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last recommendation is to produce a simplified\r\n\r\nversion of the ERC Report and let every Singaporean  have\r\n\r\nit.   Allow Singaporeans to own the Report, the  process,\r\n\r\nand the direction we are heading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Deputy Prime Minister, in summing up his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  said that, \"In a rapidly unfolding situation,\r\n\r\nall  work must be done onboard ship while we are  sailing\r\n\r\nand battling the elements. There is no safe harbour where\r\n\r\nour ship can shelter to rebuild and refit, before heading\r\n\r\nout  to  sea.\"  This statement has clearly spelt out  the\r\n\r\ncore  spirit of the Budget Statement this year, that  is,\r\n\r\nthe Government has the means to formulate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany strategies to deal with and resolve every crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the best medicine for us to ride the storm\r\n\r\nis  to  enable  our  people to emerge from  every  crisis\r\n\r\nstronger,  more  resourceful  and  resilient,   so   that\r\n\r\nSingapore could become an entrepreneurship and creativity\r\n\r\nhub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never doubt the Government's wisdom in facing\r\n\r\nwith  any economic predicament and the courage it has  to\r\n\r\nfight all the odds against us.  On this occasion, all the\r\n\r\nvarious   cost-cutting  measures  and  the   pro-business\r\n\r\nenvironment that is created are all very familiar to  us.\r\n\r\nMany  MPs have spoken about these and I would not  repeat\r\n\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to raise three points: firstly,\r\n\r\nto  intensify  the  concern  for  small  and  even  micro\r\n\r\nenterprises;   secondly,  educate  the  people   on   the\r\n\r\nimportance of promoting entrepreneurship; and thirdly, to\r\n\r\ntell  how  difficult  it is for the Government  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncaring parent to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government places much importance on the large\r\n\r\nenterprises.  There is nothing wrong about it.   In  each\r\n\r\nand  every Budget, special consideration is always  given\r\n\r\nto  them,  and quite rightly so.  But the small and  even\r\n\r\nmicro   enterprises  among  us  seem  to  have  attracted\r\n\r\nrelatively  less  attention from the Government.  In  the\r\n\r\ninitial  stages, many of these small or micro enterprises\r\n\r\ngave   full   play  to  the  fighting   spirit   of   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  become  the sources  of  future  large\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.   But  the road to success  is  inevitably\r\n\r\nfull  of hardships and difficulties. In the process, many\r\n\r\nof them lost steam and phased out.  If we want more large\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to be born, should we not show more concern\r\n\r\nfor  the sources from which these large enterprises  were\r\n\r\nevolved?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that some dialogue sessions be conducted\r\n\r\nfor  these small and even micro enterprises, to find  out\r\n\r\nthe needs and achievements of these enterprising fighters\r\n\r\nwho  had started off in a low profile, so that they could\r\n\r\nmake bigger contributions to society earlier.  At the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we  should  introduce their  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nspirit and success stories to our people, and inspire the\r\n\r\ngrowth of an entrepreneurial spirit among our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, we frequently read in the newspaper reports\r\n\r\nof  young  people  starting  off  new  ventures  and  the\r\n\r\nperspective  of  advocating entrepreneurship,  as  though\r\n\r\nstarting  new  business  ventures  is  the  best  way  to\r\n\r\novercome the economic predicament. In fact, what we  need\r\n\r\nmore  urgently is to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A professor of Business Administration from the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Melbourne   Institute  of  Technology,  Australia,\r\n\r\nspoke  at  a  youth  leadership forum  recently  that  to\r\n\r\nencourage the people to venture into business, we have to\r\n\r\nstart by reforming our educational system to inculcate in\r\n\r\nour young people the spirit of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the spirit of entrepreneurship? To possess\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  one must dare to take risk, be  responsible,\r\n\r\ncreative,    farsighted,   have   the   will-power    and\r\n\r\nperseverance.   Do  we provide the kind  of  training  to\r\n\r\nequip our young school children with such a spirit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest we compile the subject materials into a\r\n\r\ndrama  that can be performed in schools and case  studies\r\n\r\nto  be  debated  upon. All the events  happening  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  should  also  be compiled as  case  studies  for\r\n\r\nbrainstorming  by our students in the secondary  schools,\r\n\r\njunior colleges and universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we could invite entrepreneurs of\r\n\r\nvarious  age  groups to hold dialogue sessions  with  the\r\n\r\nyoung   people,  and  train  our  students  during  their\r\n\r\nschooling  days  to adapt to any kind  of  situation  and\r\n\r\nenvironment.  On the surface, these activities may appear\r\n\r\nto  have  nothing  to  do with the economy  but,  on  the\r\n\r\ncontrary, it is precisely the spirit that is most  needed\r\n\r\nin   times  of  economic  difficulties.   The  spirit  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship is the key spirit for Singapore to brave\r\n\r\nthe wind and the waves.  We should start cultivating this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsort  of entrepreneurial spirit among our people as early\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is difficult to be parents. Yesterday,\r\n\r\nMs  Indranee cited the  example of this collision between\r\n\r\na  motorcar  and  the MRT train.  She  felt  that  people\r\n\r\nshould  ask: what on earth was the Mercedes doing on  the\r\n\r\nMRT  track,  rather  than blame the  Government  for  not\r\n\r\ntaking  enough  preventive measures?  I  am  raising  all\r\n\r\nthese  examples to remind Singaporeans that  they  should\r\n\r\nnot be like the fourth  type of Singaporeans as described\r\n\r\nby  Mr Seng Han Thong, that is, those ignorant people who\r\n\r\nknow  only how to complain, to blame others but never  to\r\n\r\nblame themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote another example. Two days ago, I was\r\n\r\nvisiting  my  residents in Radin Mas.   The  owner  of  a\r\n\r\ngarment  shop  complained to me that the  Government  had\r\n\r\nallowed  some other people to sell dresses near his  shop\r\n\r\nand  stole away all his business.  He also commented that\r\n\r\nthe  HDB should have taken some measures to create a wave\r\n\r\nof people passing by the area where his shop was located.\r\n\r\nI  was  a bit curious.  So I went to take a look  at  the\r\n\r\ndresses that he was selling in his shop.  The answer  was\r\n\r\nobvious.   The  designs of his dresses were  so  outmoded\r\n\r\nthat  even  my  mother would think that  they  were  old-fashioned.   Who would buy his dresses?  So, rather  than\r\n\r\ncomplaining, why does he not think of ways to resolve his\r\n\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Singaporeans should learn to be more self-reliant. In his Budget Statement, DPM Lee pointed out\r\n\r\nthe  way for Singapore to go.  At the same time, whatever\r\n\r\ncan  be  done for our people has already been  done.   Dr\r\n\r\nWang Kai Yuen has rightly pointed out that Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  a magician.  I think it is time for Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nmake  contributions.  Ask not what the Government can  do\r\n\r\nfor you, but what you can do for yourself.  We have to be\r\n\r\nmore  realistic in our expectation in life.  Which  other\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  the world has this habit of  distributing\r\n\r\nang  pow  to  its  people?  Which other government  would\r\n\r\nsubsidise  its  people  to  attend  courses  and  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves?  I think ours is the first in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to be parents. I firmly\r\n\r\nbelieve  that,  as parents of our people, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  continue to take good care of our people,  to  help\r\n\r\nand  guide  them.  I also believe that, as children,  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  should also  appreciate  the  good\r\n\r\nintentions of our parents.  We should be responsible.  We\r\n\r\nshould  know  what  is right and what is  wrong,  and  be\r\n\r\nresponsible citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, since 1997, we have been living under the\r\n\r\nshadow   of  the  Asian  financial  crisis.   After   the\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 event and the Bali bombing in 2002,  we  are\r\n\r\nfurther  faced  with  the problem of  terrorism.   It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for us to predict how the future will be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extraordinary time, the Government of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  proposing a $1.2 billion  deficit  budget,\r\n\r\nwith  lots  of utilities and SC&CC rebates, plus  another\r\n\r\n$500  million  set aside for training programmes.   These\r\n\r\nare very good measures.  The Government has done all that\r\n\r\nit is expected to do. But the main concern now is to keep\r\n\r\nthe  jobs  for the employed, and train the unemployed  so\r\n\r\nthat they improve on their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak on the\r\n\r\nproblem  of unemployment and the entrepreneurship mindset\r\n\r\nof our young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unemployment rate has not come down. The\r\n\r\nforecast  is  that it would be between 4.5% and  5%  this\r\n\r\nyear.   It  is now difficult for those who are retrenched\r\n\r\nto  find  another job, especially those who are not  well\r\n\r\neducated and above the age of 45.  Having to compete with\r\n\r\nyounger  and better-educated workers is indeed an  uphill\r\n\r\ntask  for  them.  I  hope that the  Government  would  do\r\n\r\nsomething to encourage the employers to take on the older\r\n\r\nworkers,  apart  from providing training  and  retraining\r\n\r\nopportunities for these workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good times, of course, we think of automation,\r\n\r\ncomputerisation to improve productivity and reduce labour\r\n\r\ncost.  But in this difficult time, can we not change  the\r\n\r\nemployment attitude?  Under the premise of not increasing\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of labour, we can look into how we can  create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs for the people.  Let me give one example.   In\r\n\r\nthe  past, car washing at petrol stations was almost  all\r\n\r\ndone  by  automatic  car-washing  machines.  Nowadays,  I\r\n\r\nobserve that many petrol stations have switched to manual\r\n\r\nwashing.   Two  years ago, a certain  petrol  station  at\r\n\r\nJurong  West  Street 93 was planning to  install  a  car-washing  machine.  But,  because of  the  recession,  the\r\n\r\npetrol  station proprietor gave up the idea of  automated\r\n\r\ncar  washing, and decided to invite the residents  nearby\r\n\r\nto  provide manual car washing for his customers, working\r\n\r\non  a two-shift basis. They charge $5 for every wash, the\r\n\r\nsame as in the automatic car washing stations.  For every\r\n\r\ncar washed, $1 would be paid to the petrol station, while\r\n\r\nthe  remaining $4 will be shared by the workers. With  60\r\n\r\nto  80  cars washed daily, each car-washer will get  some\r\n\r\n$1,500  a  month.  The  petrol station  proprietor  earns\r\n\r\n$2,000 a month, without having to commit a capital outlay\r\n\r\nfor  the  automatic car-washing machine. If every  petrol\r\n\r\nstation  can  have about 10 people working as car-washers\r\n\r\nand  with  some  200 petrol stations in  Singapore,  some\r\n\r\n2,000  jobs are created.   I think this kind of idea  can\r\n\r\nonly be generated in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowing from this concept, I would like to make\r\n\r\nsome  suggestions for the public sector. For  convenience\r\n\r\nand easy administration, the canteens in most schools are\r\n\r\nlet out to contractors on a tender system. The successful\r\n\r\ntenderer  would  then sublet the various  stalls  to  the\r\n\r\nindividual  hawkers at a higher rate. Many stalls  remain\r\n\r\nvacant  as the hawkers could not afford the high  rental.\r\n\r\nIn  good  times,  this may be a good way  of  management.\r\n\r\nNow, with the high unemployment rate, can the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  consider changing the system  by  renting  the\r\n\r\nstalls  directly  to  the  individuals,  preferably   the\r\n\r\nresidents  nearby,  so that they will  not  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nhigher rents to the canteen operator.  In this way,  more\r\n\r\npeople will get\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  chance to earn a living at a lower cost.  Of course,\r\n\r\nadministratively, it will be a bit difficult but  it  can\r\n\r\ncreate more jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about building up team\r\n\r\nwork.   Globally,   the  global  political  and  economic\r\n\r\nscenes have changed. We can now sell our Singapore brands\r\n\r\nto  the world market, and this is one way for our SMEs to\r\n\r\nsurvive.   The  GLCs  and  some  of  the  larger  private\r\n\r\ncompanies have already gone into China, India and Vietnam\r\n\r\nfor  their  development.  But, in respect of  encouraging\r\n\r\nteam  work and entrepreneurship, we can do better.   SIA,\r\n\r\nPSA,  JTC, HDB etc, have already become well known brands\r\n\r\nin  Asia and all over the world.  These GLCs can take the\r\n\r\nlead  and leverage on their experience and reputation  to\r\n\r\ntake on the role of matchmaker to take our SMEs into  the\r\n\r\ninternational  markets,  such  as  China,   where   every\r\n\r\nbusinessman  would aspire to enter. It is a  big  market,\r\n\r\nfull of attractions for everybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to have a competitive edge in China, we\r\n\r\nmust  first of all satisfy three preconditions: financial\r\n\r\ncapital, energy and a team.  You must have large capital,\r\n\r\nyou  must have a team which you can depend upon  and  you\r\n\r\nneed to have the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we invest in China, we compete not only with\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese traders but we compete with the  world.   So\r\n\r\nChina  has  become a centre of contention for  the  whole\r\n\r\nworld.   One  example is the Taiwanese  investors.   They\r\n\r\nhave their people in Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu and the\r\n\r\nSuzhou Industrial Park.  They work as a team.   They have\r\n\r\na   good   financial  funding  system  for  international\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  development.  They have  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  spirit.   Their  projects  are   closely\r\n\r\nwatched  and esteemed by the Chinese Government. But  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  SMEs do not have this advantage when  they  go\r\n\r\nover to China.  Our investors tend to play solo when they\r\n\r\nventure  into China without the support of a  team.  They\r\n\r\nlack  capital,  and they cannot do much  to  develop  and\r\n\r\nestablish  themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has built the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP)\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now well known throughout China.  Recently,  I\r\n\r\nvisited  Qingdao in the Shangdong province.  An  official\r\n\r\nthere told me that he and many of his colleagues had gone\r\n\r\nto  the  Suzhou Industrial Park to learn.  I  asked  what\r\n\r\nthey  were  learning from the SIP.  He replied that  they\r\n\r\nwere  there to learn the Singapore management system  and\r\n\r\nthe Singapore experience.  Our endeavours at the SIP have\r\n\r\ncreated   a  good  impression  on  the  senior  officials\r\n\r\nthroughout China.  When asked further, he said  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese   entrepreneurs  learnt  from   Singapore   about\r\n\r\nplanning,  administration and management; from  Taiwanese\r\n\r\nthey  learnt  how to make money; and from the Hongkongers\r\n\r\nthey learnt about entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learnt from them, the Chinese now have all\r\n\r\nthese three pre-conditions to success.  They will be able\r\n\r\nto  break through their old framework and make a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney. Their economic growth was around 8% every year for\r\n\r\nthe  past  five  years.   So, we  must  seize  the  first\r\n\r\navailable  opportunity to go to China, preferably  within\r\n\r\nthe next five years, otherwise we will miss the boat.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have already good management, planning  and\r\n\r\nexperience.  We should next learn from the Taiwanese  how\r\n\r\nto  make  money  and  learn from  the  Hongkongers  about\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  After having acquired all these,  then\r\n\r\ncan we make a world for ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With very keen global competition, we want to be\r\n\r\nable to create products and services to compete with  the\r\n\r\nworld.    Then   we  must  be  able  to  strengthen   our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   To promote entrepreneurship,  overall\r\n\r\nefforts are required for a sustained period of time.   It\r\n\r\ndepends on not just the Government, but also on the  kind\r\n\r\nof  social  culture  to promote entrepreneurship  and  to\r\n\r\nchange the mindset of the individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government departments must also change their\r\n\r\nmindset, so as to create a good environment conducive  to\r\n\r\nthe  cultivation of entrepreneurship.  Senior\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister   Lee   spoke   at  the  Nanyang   Technological\r\n\r\nUniversity  that  Singaporeans must turn  away  from  the\r\n\r\nexisting mindset of over-dependence on the Government  if\r\n\r\nthey want to continue to enjoy prosperity.  I think it is\r\n\r\na very important message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs should not depend too much on the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   They must take the lead to help  our  local\r\n\r\nenterprises to go out of Singapore and into the world, to\r\n\r\nsell  our  brand  overseas and not just  to  stay  on  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and compete with our own SMEs, sharing the very\r\n\r\nsmall pie with them.  To become a globalised city and  to\r\n\r\npromote  entrepreneurship, we must be able to  step  into\r\n\r\nareas that others have not developed before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social problems. Young people in Singapore are very\r\n\r\nlucky.   They are born in a very comfortable and affluent\r\n\r\nsociety.   They  enjoy  a good living  environment,  good\r\n\r\neducation  and  are  able to learn from  the  information\r\n\r\ntechnology such as the Internet.  They thus get to  learn\r\n\r\nfrom information from all over the world.  It is apparent\r\n\r\nthat  the young people nowadays have better opportunities\r\n\r\nthan  we  did.   There  should be more  consciousness  of\r\n\r\nnational patriotism.  But they are apathetic to politics.\r\n\r\nThey  are not interested in national and current affairs.\r\n\r\nThey  are indifferent to the threat of terrorism  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  possible  effect of the war in  Iraq,  or  even  the\r\n\r\nsouring  of the Singapore-Malaysia relations.  Yet,  they\r\n\r\nchase  after their favourite pop stars, such as  the   F4\r\n\r\nand the 5566 . They are simply crazy over these idols.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, according to a survey, more\r\n\r\nthan  10%  of  our students in the institutes  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning  do not know who the Prime Minister of Singapore\r\n\r\nis.    I think this is some mindset that we cannot accept\r\n\r\n- young people who care only for themselves and the world\r\n\r\naround  them. They  think only about where to travel  to,\r\n\r\nbut  do  not care about major national events.  They  are\r\n\r\nsimply bo chap - they do not care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all very serious problems for the nation.\r\n\r\nThe young must take this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmatter   very  seriously.   We  cannot  allow   this   to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.18 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou,  Mdm Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to join in this\r\n\r\ndebate.   I  will  not  belabour on some  of  the  points\r\n\r\nalready  raised in this House over the Budget, except  to\r\n\r\nsay  that I fully support the calls made earlier to  make\r\n\r\nsites  more affordable for businesses to thrive, to  look\r\n\r\ndeep  into  what brands Singapore and makes us unique  in\r\n\r\nthis area in a globalised world, and to identify what are\r\n\r\nthe key performance indicators.  To follow up on what the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister of State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan's point  that\r\n\r\nwe  believe  truly that we do not confuse us  being  good\r\n\r\nwith what really makes us great, because that affects our\r\n\r\nperformance and how we aspire.  Having said that, I would\r\n\r\nlike to raise three main points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on training and retraining programmes. It\r\n\r\nis  commendable  that  the  Government  is  pumping  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  into  the Lifelong Learning Fund,  bringing  the\r\n\r\ntotal  to  $1.5 billion.  It is equally commendable  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Manpower has also pumped more money into\r\n\r\nthe Skills Redevelopment Programme.  These are pro-active\r\n\r\nmeasures.  However, sometimes one has to be a little  bit\r\n\r\ncautious  in  getting consoled over sheer  numbers.   The\r\n\r\nprogrammes we have are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Skills Redevelopment Programme;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) NTUC Education and Training Fund that provides\r\n\r\nunion members training;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) IT Literacy courses to equip workers with IT\r\n\r\nskills;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) BEST/WISE programmes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Critical Enabling Skills Programme;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Certification courses for those in technical\r\n\r\nfields; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Workskills Training Programme, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list is quite long, the website is quite\r\n\r\ninteresting.   However,  my  concern  here  is:  is  this\r\n\r\ninformation  going down to the retrenched worker  or  any\r\n\r\nworker,  so that he knows what is this buffet of  courses\r\n\r\nthat  is available, and what each of these courses  gives\r\n\r\nhim  in terms of a better job prospect or a better skill-based kind of training that will take him further?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therein lies my main concern. The changing dynamics\r\n\r\nfacing  a worker today puts more onus on the worker  than\r\n\r\nthe  employer to know what is out there, to pick  up  the\r\n\r\ncourses  that  are relevant to him to make him  a  better\r\n\r\nworker  and, more importantly, relevant, so that  he  can\r\n\r\nfeed himself and his family.  In this case, it is gender-neutral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking primarily about a change in mindset, in\r\n\r\nhow   we   administer  these  training  programmes.    If\r\n\r\nownership is in the hands of the employee, then he or she\r\n\r\ncan  attend  training courses with the blessings  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   For this to work, it is important  to  develop\r\n\r\nindependent  industry-focused career  development  units,\r\n\r\nrather  than  company-based  human  resource  development\r\n\r\nunits.   This  way, the worker can be counselled  on  his\r\n\r\nparticular  industry,  beyond the  company's  needs.   To\r\n\r\nexpect employers to work out good strategies for employee\r\n\r\ndevelopment can only go so far, as the employer will,  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the day, be more interested in his or her own\r\n\r\nprofits for the company.  Though the Ministry of Manpower\r\n\r\nand  the  unions have enforced a number of good practices\r\n\r\nwhere development/enhancement of workers is concerned, at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the day, the sourcing and development of  new\r\n\r\nprogrammes is not happening fast enough, as it  has  been\r\n\r\ndictated  by  the demands of the employer.  An  employee-demand  on programmes cuts through this problem  also  of\r\n\r\nencouraging workers to attend training courses  and  help\r\n\r\nthem to take total ownership over their whole career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also qualify that I make this suggestion in\r\n\r\nthe hope that it can be applied with a greater thrust  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyounger  workers right now who are more  nimble  and  can\r\n\r\nascertain for themselves what they want where their  work\r\n\r\nlife  processes  are concerned.  In this aspect,  I  also\r\n\r\nendorse  what  has  been raised  by  Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua,\r\n\r\nespecially when it concerns the younger workers, that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  about  it  anymore  as  an  end-point  of\r\n\r\nretirement  age  at 55 or 62.  The earlier  we  put  such\r\n\r\npractices  into reality for younger workers,  perhaps  it\r\n\r\nwill  not be so severe for them in a world that is making\r\n\r\nmore demands day by day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been said about Mr Sim Wong Hoo's\r\n\r\npiece  entitled \"NUTS\" and the need to nurture creativity\r\n\r\nand  entrepreneurship.  I would  just  like  to  add  one\r\n\r\nimportant point of view here.  I feel strongly that  more\r\n\r\nspace must be created by middle and top management levels\r\n\r\nto  allow workers to try out new initiatives.  What do  I\r\n\r\nmean  by  \"space\"?  It is important to allow for mistakes\r\n\r\nto  happen.   Hopefully, it will not be too  costly,  but\r\n\r\npart  of  that creative process is to make mistakes.   In\r\n\r\nfinding new solutions, when it comes to mistakes, that in\r\n\r\nitself   is   a  creative  process.   It  is   easy   for\r\n\r\ninstitutions and companies to be lulled into a  state  of\r\n\r\ncomplacency  when  many of their employees  are  in  WITS\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and other sub-committees.  That is  fine  and\r\n\r\nwell.    But   what  is  more  important  is  the   daily\r\n\r\ninteraction within the office space, eg, how  the  middle\r\n\r\nor  top  management  layer  or even  the  immediate  line\r\n\r\nsupervisor  reacts to the worker in the field,  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions  that are taken on board,  because  each\r\n\r\nsuggestion is a creative process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do tend to fall into this trap of a box.\r\n\r\nWhen it is time to think WITS, we wear our creative hats.\r\n\r\nOutside of WITS, we think of how can we follow the rules.\r\n\r\nRules are guidelines to direct an outcome in a consistent\r\n\r\nmanner.  Perhaps, sometimes it is good to follow  what  I\r\n\r\nheard from a certain CEO:  \"Just go ahead and do it.   If\r\n\r\nit  is wrong, then ask for forgiveness later.\"  So, being\r\n\r\nbound  by rules, the fear of making mistakes has crippled\r\n\r\nquite   a  lot  of  us  into  not  being  able  to  think\r\n\r\ncreatively.    I  think  the  Minister   of   State   for\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship will have to take this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non-board  in  how  to  make us  less  fearful  of  making\r\n\r\nmistakes.   In my view, this has become one big  dampener\r\n\r\nin  trying to create an environment that will help people\r\n\r\nto think differently and try out new areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is with regard to job losses and\r\n\r\nretrenchments.   Like  Mdm Halimah,  I  am  concerned  if\r\n\r\nenough  has  already  been  done  internally  within   an\r\n\r\ninstitution  first before the decision to shed  jobs  was\r\n\r\narrived  at.  One example I can think of here  is  Ikea's\r\n\r\nphilosophy.  For a long time, they have always looked  at\r\n\r\nwanting to make their furniture affordable to the  income\r\n\r\nbracket that they are targeting at, ie, the middle income\r\n\r\nearners.  One way that they have gone about doing  it  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  even  top management  staff  do  travel\r\n\r\neconomy  class.  Sometimes, in a far-reaching event  like\r\n\r\nthis  that  we are faced with today, when we have  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the process of retrenchment, it is also good  to\r\n\r\nrelook  at the processes within a company, to see whether\r\n\r\nthey  have been cost-effective enough from top-down.   If\r\n\r\nnot,  perhaps  it is time to have certain guidelines  for\r\n\r\npublic  and private institutions that will ensure  longer\r\n\r\r\nterm  employability for a good workforce that is keen  to\r\n\r\nkeep  up with skills training, rather than the bottom-end\r\n\r\npaying  the  price  for the top-end,  or  for  bad  cost-effective  structures that were put  into  place  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have about job shedding is: how\r\n\r\nmany  of  our employers have really explored job  sharing\r\n\r\nand flexi-time management schemes before the decision  to\r\n\r\nshed   workers   was  arrived  at?   Perhaps,   such   an\r\n\r\naccountability,  that this has not  really  worked,  will\r\n\r\nhelp  us to understand why quite a number of workers have\r\n\r\nhad  to lose their job.  This is also perhaps a good time\r\n\r\nfor  such  companies  to be persuaded  to  pick  up  such\r\n\r\nschemes  and to put them in place.  Many companies  have,\r\n\r\nfor  a long time, felt they do not want to get into these\r\n\r\nschemes   because   they  are  messy,   they   complicate\r\n\r\nadministrative  processes,  especially  job  sharing  and\r\n\r\nflexi-time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I applaud the initiatives of South West CDC\r\n\r\nand  North East CDC in their joint ventures with  various\r\n\r\nMinistries  to  retrain  retrenched  workers  into  child\r\n\r\nminders  and  into  caring for the elderly.   These  are,\r\n\r\nright  now,  gaps in our services.  To fill up  that  gap\r\n\r\nwith  people  who  do  need  jobs,  retrain  them  is  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  idea.   In my opinion, there  are  also  other\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  other services if we  can  get  enough\r\n\r\ntraining  funds and trainers, eg, assistant  teachers  in\r\n\r\nspecial  education  schools, more administrative  support\r\n\r\nfor  schools, more estate management staff in  hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe  older  and  more mature retrenched  workers  can  be\r\n\r\ntrained  as para-counsellors too, so that they  can  help\r\n\r\nfamilies in crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that we do not forget the number of\r\n\r\nworkers  with inactive CPF accounts.  I think Dr Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee  has  also  brought this up - the self-employed,  the\r\n\r\nhomemakers and some disabled members.  For the homemakers\r\n\r\nand  disabled, this will be an even harder time to return\r\n\r\nto  or enter into the workforce for the first time.  Some\r\n\r\nof them may have dependants with them.  I think we should\r\n\r\nnot  forget  that  they  would be finding  it  difficult.\r\n\r\nAlso, how do we keep them on the radar screen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also offered rebates to\r\n\r\nhelp  residents, based on house types.  That is well  and\r\n\r\ngood.   Perhaps, may I also suggest that we go  a  little\r\n\r\nbit  further  and take into account retrenched  residents\r\n\r\nwho may have a tough time finding a job, because they may\r\n\r\nbe  living  in 5-room flats, etc, so that they can  enjoy\r\n\r\nsuch rebates at least for a while longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, much has been said yesterday about a budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.   I  think we can live with one, as it  is  more\r\n\r\nhumane to help people get along with their lives, and  it\r\n\r\nis  also  the right thing to do.  The right thing  to  do\r\n\r\nhere  also  is to be mindful of the charities  scene,  as\r\n\r\nhard-hitting  times usually mean less  money  flowing  to\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  rise  in  support  of the Deputy  Prime  Minister  and\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance's Budget for FY 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we are realistic and bold enough to\r\n\r\nhave  a deficit budget.  Whatever the amount, it is still\r\n\r\nan effort to deal with the current economic situation.  I\r\n\r\nalso   strongly  support  the  idea  of  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Services headed by Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nLee,  and  having Minister of State, Mr Raymond  Lim,  to\r\n\r\ntake  charge  of  the  Government's effort  to  encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship   in  Singapore.   I  congratulate   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower for setting up a statutory board for\r\n\r\nContinuing Education and Training to coordinate  training\r\n\r\nand employment assistance efforts for workers.\r\n\r\nWe are indeed facing challenging and difficult times.  We\r\n\r\nsee    greater    global   competition,    retrenchments,\r\n\r\nunemployment and restructuring.  It must be  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  difficult  times for us since independence.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that we will pull through this period  just  as\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.  I say this because in the last  35  years,\r\n\r\nwe  have diligently built up our competencies.  Singapore\r\n\r\nitself is a reputable brand.  Our competencies reside  in\r\n\r\nour   GLCs,   our   advanced  technologies,   our   local\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  our  SMEs, our educated  workforce  and  our\r\n\r\nmanagement  expertise.  I think we should not feel  sorry\r\n\r\nfor  our  strong  GLCs  and also  our  strong  management\r\n\r\nexpertise.   This  is  our  comparative  advantage.   Our\r\n\r\ngrowth  has  been described as a miracle. 35  years  ago,\r\n\r\nwithout  any  resources, we succeeded.   Today,  we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  so much experience and expertise, we  have  no\r\n\r\nreason not to continue to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move forward, we must all consolidate our\r\n\r\ncompetencies.   ERC has not left any stone unturned,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has accepted the ERC's  recommendations.\r\n\r\nSo,  instead of pointing fingers at each other,  we  must\r\n\r\nnow  find  ways  to  work hard and fast  together.   Like\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister  of State, Mr Khaw  Boon  Wan  has  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,  we  need to work fast and  find  strength  in\r\n\r\nunity.   Both  the private and public sectors  must  find\r\n\r\nsynergy to deal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith the challenges.  We must identify our strengths  and\r\n\r\nweaknesses and move ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be afraid to ride on the economic growth\r\n\r\nof   other  countries,  such  as  China,  India,   Japan,\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia, Europe, USA and Australia.   We  already\r\n\r\nhave Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with a number of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed, we need special ingredients. I am\r\n\r\nreferring  to a fighting spirit to overcome the  economic\r\n\r\nchallenges.  Now, what we must have is the will to win.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, we should also strengthen our economy.\r\n\r\nAs  our  economy  matures, our spending  and  consumption\r\n\r\npatterns  become more diverse, corresponding to different\r\n\r\nlevels of disposable income.  I perceive these as falling\r\n\r\ninto   three  tiers.   At  the  top  tier  are   high-end\r\n\r\nenterprises selling high-end luxury goods.  In the middle\r\n\r\ntier are mid-priced brands with a mass-market appeal.  At\r\n\r\nthe  lowest tier are very basic consumption goods  served\r\n\r\nup  in modest surroundings, with minimum packaging and no\r\n\r\nfrills.   They  are  usually associated with  traditional\r\n\r\nsmall  local  services-based enterprises, like  old-style\r\n\r\nkopitiams,  market  stalls or small neighbourhood  shops.\r\n\r\nThey serve to build and strengthen the character of local\r\n\r\ncommunities,  and also help to preserve the arts,  crafts\r\n\r\nand  also  cuisine  that  form a  part  of  our  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.   More  importantly,  these  local  traditional\r\n\r\nenterprises  all  share  humble beginnings.   Their  very\r\n\r\nexistence  reminds  us  daily that  as  long  as  one  is\r\n\r\ndetermined  and  prepared to work hard, any  self-reliant\r\n\r\nSingaporean can make a decent, honest living.  Thus, more\r\n\r\nimportantly, the third tier enterprises also create jobs.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  entrepreneur, Ms Olivia Lum, is  one  good\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe there is much merit in\r\n\r\ntaking  a  closer  look  at  this  third  tier  of  small\r\n\r\ntraditional local enterprises, and ensuring that they too\r\n\r\nbenefit   from   the   Government's  measures   to   help\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  Without them, we would be left with  a  much\r\n\r\nduller  and  bleaker landscape that bores and disappoints\r\n\r\nresidents and visitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to preserve the existence of\r\n\r\nsuch  enterprises and trades in suburban areas,  such  as\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru  and Little India.  As far as  possible,  we\r\n\r\nshould  avoid  resettling or relocating such  businesses,\r\n\r\neven  if  it means the urban landscape becomes  a  little\r\n\r\nless  tidy and neatly demarcated.  I am heartened to note\r\n\r\nthat  discussions  on the importance of  retaining  \"old-world  charm\" has become more prominent in public forums,\r\n\r\nand that the Government has taken the views of the public\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not everything about the old world is\r\n\r\ncharming.  I support regular maintenance and upgrading of\r\n\r\nthe  operating premises of such businesses, and improving\r\n\r\npublic  safety and access.  In doing so, we  should  take\r\n\r\ncare  to retain the original character of the place,  and\r\n\r\nmake sure that operating costs for the enterprises do not\r\n\r\nrise  by too much. The refurbishment of the Maxwell  Road\r\n\r\nFood  Centre  is a successful example of upgrading.   The\r\n\r\nhygiene,  ventilation and lighting have  improved,  while\r\n\r\nthe  original open-air character and original layout have\r\n\r\nbeen preserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have discussed some ways of\r\n\r\nensuring  that this third tier of small local enterprises\r\n\r\ndoes  not erode away.  I believe it is also important  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  those Singaporeans who wish to  enter  this\r\n\r\ntier to start small businesses and micro enterprises  can\r\n\r\ndo  so  with  minimum  costs and minimum  red  tape.  The\r\n\r\nconcept of providing one-stop services to help businesses\r\n\r\nestablish  themselves in Singapore is not new.   EDB  has\r\n\r\nbeen  employing  this strategy to attract big  businesses\r\n\r\nand  MNCs  to locate in Singapore.  The Government's  on-going  efforts  to  reduce red tape have  also  benefited\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprises.  For instance, the one-stop  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainment   Licensing  Centre  helps   operators   of\r\n\r\nentertainment outlets obtain all the necessary  approvals\r\n\r\nfrom multiple licensing agencies at one go.  I think  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs has done  a  good  job  here.\r\n\r\nHowever,  more can be done.  I urge that this  regulatory\r\n\r\nmodel and supportive mindset be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextended to all forms of businesses and trades.  To  give\r\n\r\nan  example  of  red tape, the setting  up  of  the  NTUC\r\n\r\nFoodfare  kiosk of about 140 square feet at  Jurong  East\r\n\r\nMRT took more than one year, and involved working with as\r\n\r\nmany  as  seven  different  Government  agencies.   Large\r\n\r\norganisations may have the resources and the patience  to\r\n\r\nwait for administrative details to be sorted out with the\r\n\r\nrelevant   authorities.    But   small   businesses    or\r\n\r\nindividuals may feel frustrated and discouraged as  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and  survival is at stake.  Every  day  spent\r\n\r\nwaiting means another day of lost opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More generally, I also urge the Government to look\r\n\r\ninto  promoting  all  parts of the services  sector.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  already  announced  plans  to  introduce\r\n\r\nmeasures to promote the high value-added segments of  the\r\n\r\nservices   industry,  such  as  financial  services   and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications.  However, not everyone  who  wants  a\r\n\r\njob in these high-value added segments will be assured of\r\n\r\none.   I urge the Committee to consider targeted measures\r\n\r\nto help Singaporeans enter the more conventional segments\r\n\r\nof  the services industry, such as becoming nurses,  home\r\n\r\nhelpers,  hairdressers, retail sales personnel,  waiters,\r\n\r\nentertainers,  security  guards  or  hawkers.   This   is\r\n\r\nespecially  relevant  to  those  workers  who  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched from the manufacturing sector and are prepared\r\n\r\nto consider working in the services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to urge the Ministerial Committee to\r\n\r\nconsider  how best to attract young talent from all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world  to come to Singapore to provide  services  in\r\n\r\njoint ventures with our local youth.  For example, in the\r\n\r\nareas  of  accounting  and management,  water  treatment,\r\n\r\nenvironmental  management,  early  childhood   education,\r\n\r\npreparation  for examinations, food, property management,\r\n\r\nlogistics,   hotel   management,  entertainment,   music,\r\n\r\ndesign,  etc,  many may have good ideas but lack  funding\r\n\r\nand  resources.  How do we ensure that the same  kind  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  support that is available  to  manufacturing,\r\n\r\nthe  IT  industry and the biomedical cluster is available\r\n\r\nto start-ups in the services industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the economic outlook is uncertain, I\r\n\r\nfeel  confident that Singaporeans will be  able  to  find\r\n\r\nniche  markets in the services sector and  do  well.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  there  is  a  group of  Singaporean  musician-entrepreneurs who have been making waves in the  regional\r\n\r\nMandarin pop music industry.  I am not only referring  to\r\n\r\nfamous  pop  stars like Kit Chan or Stefanie Sun,  but  a\r\n\r\ngroup of producers and musicians like Li Si Song, Li  Wei\r\n\r\nSong  and Xu Huan Liang, who have produced numerous  hits\r\n\r\nand  impressed listeners and fans in Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  China.   I am told that  a  long  line  of\r\n\r\nregional  pop stars are queuing up for our local  singer-songwriter   Tanya  Chua  to  write   their   next   hit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  I  have  also been told by friends  returning\r\n\r\nfrom visits to major Chinese cities that every other shop\r\n\r\nseems  to be playing the latest hits of A-Do, our  latest\r\n\r\nmale  pop  export.   We also possess  some  of  the  best\r\n\r\nequipped  and professional music studios in  the  region,\r\n\r\nattracting scores of stars to record albums here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the secret of these musicians' success? It\r\n\r\nis not in copying or imitating pop music industry workers\r\n\r\nin  Taiwan  and  China.  In fact, it is  precisely  their\r\n\r\nunique  Singaporean characteristics that  create  demand.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  prized  in  the  industry  for   being\r\n\r\nthoroughly  familiar with Western as well as Eastern  pop\r\n\r\nmusic and being able to interpret the latest global music\r\n\r\ntrends  quickly  and creatively for a regional  audience.\r\n\r\nIn other words, they serve as an effective bridge between\r\n\r\ncultures and add value while translating trends.  This is\r\n\r\na direct result of our exposure to the West as well as to\r\n\r\nthe  East, in a multi-racial and multi-cultural  society.\r\n\r\nIf our musicians can play this role in the region, surely\r\n\r\nthis  inspires other professions in the services  sector.\r\n\r\nI urge the Ministerial Committee to highlight and promote\r\n\r\nother  such examples of new engines of growth within  our\r\n\r\nservices industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch on the area of use of\r\n\r\nscarce resources.  With the economic uncertainty ahead of\r\n\r\nus,  it is prudent for us to re-examine the uses to which\r\n\r\nwe put our scarce resources and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure that help goes to those who need it most.  In this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  support  the Government's  move  to  further\r\n\r\nexpand  the  use of means testing to allocate  healthcare\r\n\r\nsubsidies.    The  means  testing  framework   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has introduced for step-down care three  years\r\n\r\nago  has benefited patients and their families.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  congratulate the Ministry of  Health  for  this\r\n\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of Health is not the only\r\n\r\nGovernment  agency  that administers subsidies  to  needy\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Other agencies, such as MCDS,  MOE,  MinLaw\r\n\r\nand  CDCs,  also  administer subsidy  schemes,  all  with\r\n\r\ndifferent  criteria  and  requirements.   I  propose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider streamlining these  subsidy  schemes\r\n\r\nand  apply  a common means testing framework.  This  will\r\n\r\nreduce the need for those who need financial help to make\r\n\r\nfrequent  and multiple income declarations, and  also  to\r\n\r\nreduce  duplication of work between Government  officials\r\n\r\nin  processing  their  applications  and  auditing  their\r\n\r\ndeclarations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to applaud the Government for\r\n\r\nestablishing a portable medical benefits scheme  to  help\r\n\r\nworkers  pay for healthcare even when they are in between\r\n\r\njobs.   This is a welcome addition to our existing social\r\n\r\nsafety  nets.  I would like to ask for how  long  is  the\r\n\r\nmedical coverage planned to last for each insured  person\r\n\r\nwhile not employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the issue of scarce national resources, I\r\n\r\nhave   observed  constant  improvements   made   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  allocating resources amongst  Ministries.\r\n\r\nWe  have moved from Budgeting for Results to Managing for\r\n\r\nExcellence and now Resource Accounting.  However, I think\r\n\r\nit  would be beneficial for the House to learn more about\r\n\r\nthe  budgeting principles used by Ministries to  allocate\r\n\r\nresources to various projects and programmes.   How  does\r\n\r\neach  Ministry prioritise amongst different policy  areas\r\n\r\nof   concern  and  measure  the  effectiveness  of   each\r\n\r\nprogramme?    In  the  last  few  years,   large   inter-ministerial  committees involving  the  contributions  of\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers  of Singaporeans have been  set  up.   Are\r\n\r\nthere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany   plans  to  monitor  the  effectiveness   of   their\r\n\r\nrecommendations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude with\r\n\r\nsome   thoughts  on  the  next  step  for  Singapore   in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our  competitiveness in the global  economy.\r\n\r\nMuch   has   been   said  about  measures   on   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring  to  ensure  that our  fundamentals  remain\r\n\r\nsound.   However,  competition in the global  economy  is\r\n\r\nwaged on many fronts.  It is as much about being a choice\r\n\r\ndestination for people all over the world, as it is about\r\n\r\neffective  governance, having a flexible  labour  market,\r\n\r\ncompetitive  cost  structure  and  a  safe   and   secure\r\n\r\nenvironment.   What  is  it about  Singapore  that  makes\r\n\r\npeople want to visit us, to work and to play here, or  to\r\n\r\nsink  roots here?  What is it about Singapore that  makes\r\n\r\nour own citizens want to stay here and to contribute?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I urge the Government to consider more\r\n\r\ncreative  ways  to shape the vision for  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nchoice destination and the best home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise\r\n\r\nsome  of  the issues regarding Deputy Prime Minister  Lee\r\n\r\nHsien Loong's speech on the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many speakers ahead of me who have brought\r\n\r\nup  various  issues  regarding  the  Budget  on  manpower\r\n\r\ntraining and promoting private enterprise.  I come to you\r\n\r\nat  this  late  afternoon to put a little  more  personal\r\n\r\nperspective into the issue of private enterprises and its\r\n\r\ndevelopment in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent the business community and both the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business Federation and the Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce and Industry had made responses  to\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  Statement, and both these associations  have\r\n\r\nwelcomed the Deputy Prime Minister's pro-business budget.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a budget that has signified that the Government\r\n\r\nis responding to the appeal of the private sector for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlowering  cost of doing business and giving opportunities\r\n\r\nfor SMEs to develop in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Singapore SMEs have struggled since 1997\r\n\r\nwhen  the economic crisis hit Singapore and the  rest  of\r\n\r\nAsia.   Many of us in the private sector have  felt  that\r\n\r\nthe  support  from the Government is very much  welcomed,\r\n\r\nbut  for  many  of the business sectors in Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  gone from a stage of relative strength in  1996  to\r\n\r\ntoday where many in the private sector are in a very weak\r\n\r\nstage.   The effort to reduce the cost of doing  business\r\n\r\nis  welcomed, but we are also talking about Singapore now\r\n\r\nin  the  stage where there is reduced demand,  where  the\r\n\r\nmarket is not growing, demand is not increasing and where\r\n\r\nmany  people  are  much more cautious  about  consumption\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their  fear of employability  and  financial\r\n\r\nsecurity.   So, the private sector welcomes the  lowering\r\n\r\nof  cost,  keeping the CPF lower for the next two  years,\r\n\r\nbut we are now struggling with issues of how to transform\r\n\r\nour businesses and make it more viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We listen to the Government's earlier encouragement\r\n\r\nto go regional.  But we also realise that businesses have\r\n\r\nto  be strong in their home economy before they are  able\r\n\r\nto  have  the resources and the capacity to go  regional.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore,  many of the companies, the  ones  that  I\r\n\r\nrepresent, also do not find it easy to grow.  May  I  use\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  to  also illustrate  a  very  personal\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the recession hit Asia in 1997/98 we see, at\r\n\r\nHealth   Management  International  (HMI),   much   fewer\r\n\r\npatients from the region coming to Singapore.  We  are  a\r\n\r\nmedical group and we see fewer foreign patients.  We also\r\n\r\nsee  many  of the patients, who used to come to  use  our\r\n\r\nfacilities,  now  going to restructured hospitals.   They\r\n\r\nare  going to restructured hospitals because their income\r\n\r\nis  going  down or they fear for their own job  security.\r\n\r\nSo  they  are moving to restructured hospitals where  the\r\n\r\nservices  are  good and where they are  able  to  receive\r\n\r\nsubvention.  There is no way for a private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector  hospital  group to be able to  compete  with  the\r\n\r\nsubvention  of restructured hospitals.  For this  reason,\r\n\r\nour  performance,  as  a  commercial  enterprise,  dipped\r\n\r\nsignificantly,  especially last year, as we  got  weaker.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  we hit a very difficult patch and  HMI  lost\r\n\r\nmoney.   It  is  not news.  Many of the  members  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness sector were in the losing position the last  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do in helping local enterprises\r\n\r\nrestructure and respond, and how can we ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nlocal enterprises are able to build their strength in the\r\n\r\nlocal economy and move out to compete regionally?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we restructured, many of us in the private sector\r\n\r\nfelt  that  our  local banking system has not  been  most\r\n\r\nencouraging.  As SMEs restructured and struggled with the\r\n\r\nneed  to  transform and re-engineer,  we  find  that  the\r\n\r\nbanking  sector has not been supportive.  And  they  have\r\n\r\nnot been supportive also because there are fewer banks to\r\n\r\nwork with.  So, as local businesses restructured, we find\r\n\r\na  less  than supportive banking sector, where the  banks\r\n\r\nare  more  concerned with how they get their  money  back\r\n\r\nthan  how they are able to fund promising local SMEs  and\r\n\r\nhow  they are able to help these local SMEs transform and\r\n\r\ngrow again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, manpower issue. Private sector companies\r\n\r\nare  competing  with  GLCs, statutory boards,  Government\r\n\r\nsector  and  MNCs for the same small talent  pool.   But,\r\n\r\nprivate  sector enterprises are not able to  compete  and\r\n\r\noffer  such  high  salaries, good benefits,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nopportunities  for growth as the larger organisations  in\r\n\r\nthe  public sector, the MNCs and GLCs.  Hence we see that\r\n\r\nthe  main  problem of running local SMEs is that  we  are\r\n\r\nworking with very, very small manpower resources.  Is the\r\n\r\nGovernment  able  to help us?  Yes, I  think  the  recent\r\n\r\nbudget  allocation for manpower upgrading  and  all  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to help us recruit more talents  into  our\r\n\r\nworkforce.   But, for many of us in the local SMEs,  this\r\n\r\nhas been, and will continue to be, most challenging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, many of the SMEs are struggling to create new\r\n\r\nbusinesses out of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery  difficult local operating environment.  Many of  us\r\n\r\nin  the  private  sector have to contend with  regulatory\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  Government agencies to seek  the  required\r\n\r\nsupport, permits, licensing, to get our businesses  done.\r\n\r\nMany  of  the speakers before me have mentioned that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  have  been  very  bound  by  rules.\r\n\r\nWhilst  I  applaud  many in the civil service  have  been\r\n\r\ntrying  very hard not to bend the rules but to help  SMEs\r\n\r\nget along with the approval processes, this has been time-consuming.  If we are running a big enterprise, if we are\r\n\r\nrunning  a  big  organisation, with  lots  of  resources,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is manpower or financial, I think the process\r\n\r\nof  waiting for approval to happen would be okay.  But if\r\n\r\nyou  are  running a SME with very little human  resource,\r\n\r\nvery  small human resource capability, and with very thin\r\n\r\nfinancial  capability,  you  find  that  the  process  of\r\n\r\napproval  takes  so  long  and it  is  a  very  expensive\r\n\r\nprocess, and SMEs would find it most difficult to be able\r\n\r\nto  finance  the waiting process of all these  regulatory\r\n\r\napprovals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite some recent experiences. When the hard\r\n\r\ntimes  hit HMI, we decided to transform our business from\r\n\r\na  health  services provider to a trainer  of  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers.   The logic is very simple.  When you cannot  do\r\n\r\nthe  business in one sector you quickly transform into  a\r\n\r\nsector  where there is more demand.  We have  transformed\r\n\r\nout  of  the  services sector because of the  competition\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  from the restructured hospitals  and  the\r\n\r\nshrinking  foreign  and  local patients  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  I think that is fine.  In businesses we have  to\r\n\r\nswitch our course fast.  But when we hit on the idea  for\r\n\r\ntraining, and we still believe that it is a good  concept\r\n\r\nbecause  the  healthcare sector has  a  huge  demand  for\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers, so we thought that would be something\r\n\r\nthat  is worthwhile doing.  And because of the recession,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  people who would normally  not  enter  the\r\n\r\nhealth service workforce have come forward and apply  for\r\n\r\nopportunities to be trained as healthcare workers.  So we\r\n\r\nhave  a situation facing an SME where you have identified\r\n\r\na new business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector where the demand is clear, meaning people who  are\r\n\r\ntrained  for  the  healthcare  sector  actually  do   get\r\n\r\nemployed.  The employability rate is very high.   We  are\r\n\r\ntalking about 75-95% employability after training  for  a\r\n\r\nhealthcare  career.  So what problems did we  face  as  a\r\n\r\nprivate sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we face was that though the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been  very  encouraging in its  efforts  to  provide\r\n\r\ntraining  and upgrading opportunities for the  unemployed\r\n\r\nand  retrenched into service areas where  they  can  find\r\n\r\njobs  - I think the general support has always been there\r\n\r\nfrom  day  one  -  what was difficult was  the  different\r\n\r\nagencies  that were involved with this approval  process,\r\n\r\nfor  example, my experience with the approval process for\r\n\r\none course, the \"Enrolled Nurse Training\".  Singapore has\r\n\r\nused  a  lot of foreign workers to staff the lower levels\r\n\r\nof  the  workforce in terms of patient care.  So many  of\r\n\r\nus,  when  we go into restructured hospitals  or  private\r\n\r\nhospitals,  feel  that  we  could  be  anywhere,  in  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  or China, due to the sheer number  of  these\r\n\r\nforeign workers in our hospitals in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we were to train our locals, what do we do?\r\n\r\nWe  went  to  the  Ministry of Health.  We  went  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Nursing Board and said that we have this  idea\r\n\r\nand  this  is the curriculum.  We want to train  enrolled\r\n\r\nnurses  because there is a huge demand for  them  amongst\r\n\r\nour  local hospitals and, as we see it, many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are retrenched and unemployed would like to come and\r\n\r\ntrain  for  a  career  that  has  potential  for  further\r\n\r\ndevelopment as well as stability and fairly good  income.\r\n\r\nThe  approval  process from the Singapore  Nursing  Board\r\n\r\ntook more than six months.  And, as we waited, there were\r\n\r\nmany  changes  to  the structure.  We  need  the  Nursing\r\n\r\nBoard's  approval  before we can get  the  NTUC  and  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development  Fund  to  approve  the  courses  for\r\n\r\ntraining  and  subsidy.  So all these approval  processes\r\n\r\ntook six months, nine months, and we are still working on\r\n\r\nit today - many, many months after we had started.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to our colleague, Dr Ng Eng Hen, earlier and\r\n\r\nhe said to bring it up in the House.  I said yes, I will.\r\n\r\nI  threw away my prepared script and speak from my  heart\r\n\r\nand  from my experience because I am not the only example\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   I  speak  from  my  experience  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in the Chinese Chamber and the other  business\r\n\r\nsectors.   Whilst we want to encourage local  enterprise,\r\n\r\nwe   want   to  encourage  creation  of  new  jobs,   new\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  new  opportunities, I think  the  Government\r\n\r\nneeds to look not only at reducing business cost.  I hate\r\n\r\nto  be  ungrateful when I said that, because the business\r\n\r\ncommunity  has  been  urging  the  Government  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost, and now that they have done  it,  we  say\r\n\r\nthat  is  not enough.  It is a very important gesture  to\r\n\r\nreduce business cost but also to look into all the  other\r\n\r\ncircumstances  that  create a  very  difficult  operating\r\n\r\nenvironment  for our SMEs and for the SMEs to  transform,\r\n\r\nto  grow  into  strong enterprises so that  we  can  move\r\n\r\nregionally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, using my own examples, I take the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   directions  with  very   serious   belief,\r\n\r\nconviction  and consideration.  The Government  said  the\r\n\r\nmarket  here is small, go regional.  So as an  enterprise\r\n\r\nwe  went regional, not very far, just 300-400 km north of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  went into another country  to  operate  a\r\n\r\nhospital.   All is well, except that local SMEs  find  it\r\n\r\nimmensely difficult to raise funds in Singapore to invest\r\n\r\noutside of Singapore.  And this is why earlier I said  we\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  groom  our local SMEs  to  be  financially\r\n\r\nstrong,  to  have a significant market share, to  develop\r\n\r\nhuman  resource  and  accumulate financial  resources  in\r\n\r\norder for them to compete well in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my experience has indicated that there are\r\n\r\nterrific market opportunities for healthcare service  out\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  but as a local SME how  do  I  go  there?\r\n\r\nLocal  banks  do not lend to SMEs who go regional.   They\r\n\r\nlend  to  SMEs not on your projects outside of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  on  your  capability to borrow in  Singapore,  which\r\n\r\nagain  boils  down  to  your financial  resources  within\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What is there that you can collaterise?  What\r\n\r\nis there that the banks will find it worthwhile to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlend   you  in  your  Singapore  operations?   Not   what\r\n\r\nopportunities  you have and the future stream  of  income\r\n\r\nyou  can  bring  back to your headquarters  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause   of   your   wise  and  good  investments   into\r\n\r\nopportunities out of Singapore.  Therein lie the problems\r\n\r\nthat  SMEs face and SMEs are still confronted with.  Many\r\n\r\nSMEs,  whilst waiting for pro-business measures  to  come\r\n\r\nfrom the Government, have been weakened and will continue\r\n\r\nto  weaken  if  some of these measures do not  come  fast\r\n\r\nenough.   When these measures and policies come,  if  the\r\n\r\ncivil service, the administration arm, does not implement\r\n\r\nthese  measures fast enough, we will see many, many  more\r\n\r\nSMEs  failing, falling on the wayside, before things  get\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> We will stop here today.
