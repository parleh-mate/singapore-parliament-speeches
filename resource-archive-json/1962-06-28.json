It is therefore refreshing to note that  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party is taking up the cudgels for the capitalists. The Commissioner of\r\n\r\nInland  Revenue  has discretion to remit penalty or extend the date  of  payment\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are good reasons to do so. Normally a seven days' grace  is  given\r\n\r\nbefore  the  fine is sent and penalty imposed. Where a taxpayer is  able  to  de\r\n\r\nmonstrate  that  he cannot meet payment by the due date because of  his  absence\r\n\r\nFrom  Malaya or sickness or other reasonable cause, remission of penalty may  be\r\n\r\ngranted  on the individual :merits of the case. Deferred payment is also allowed\r\n\r\nin  the case of a company which has commenced trading and instalments of payment\r\n\r\nare allowed on the second year of tax as a matter of practice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount received by way of penalty in 1961 was $285,000 in Singapore. the\r\n\r\namount in the Federation was about $259,000.

Sir, we know that as an educational medium,  television  is  far\r\n\r\nsuperior to radio broadcasting or the cinema. In fact, television will  reach  a\r\n\r\nlarger  number of young people in their homes,, whereas in the case of a  cinema\r\n\r\ntheatre, they must go to the theatre and buy tickets. In the case of television,\r\n\r\nchildren can just press certain buttons or turn certain knobs and there the film\r\n\r\nwill be brought to their own homes. If, therefore, in a television programme the\r\n\r\nfilms  shown are not suitable for our young people, then I am afraid the  object\r\n\r\nof  the Government in helping the young people will be defeated. In view of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that more than half of the people of Singapore are young people, I  should\r\n\r\nthink  that posts similar to those provided for the Broadcasting Division should\r\n\r\nalso  be provided here. Very likely it may be due to an oversight because  there\r\n\r\nare  three  phases, and this being only the first phase, maybe the  thought  was\r\n\r\nthat  it  was not necessary to include it since there will be just a  three-hour\r\n\r\nprogramme and only one hour will be for the news and the rest will be for films.\r\n\r\nBut  the  selection of the films then becomes a very important thing unless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to invite the Programme Assistants in charge of Schools from\r\n\r\nthe  Broadcasting Division to assist also in the Television Section  until  such\r\n\r\ntime as they are able to provide for separate posts for Programme Assistants  in\r\n\r\ncharge of Schools. Sir, I draw attention to this omission so that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  remedy  it  so as to prevent the wrong type of films from being  televised\r\n\r\nwith harmful effects to the young.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know whether the Government would advertise all\r\n\r\nthese posts in Schedule A, or whether in fact they are at present working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\ninquire  whether Government would consider allocating one channel of  television\r\n\r\nfor use by an independent nonprofit authority to be appointed in accordance with\r\n\r\nstatutory provisions so that the people of Singapore can have the opportunity of\r\n\r\nat least one channel where they can get honest news and views.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are conscious that the philosophy of the Government with reference to Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  that  they  are  perfectly entitled  to  utilise  it  for  biased\r\n\r\npropaganda  purposes  and,  in fact, for party purposes.

In fact, two months ago some lost have been advertised  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission have made selections for some of those and are making\r\n\r\nselections for others.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Arson now wants an independent television service. How nice,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, if we can afford this sort of thing. He says  the  authority\r\n\r\nshould  be  independent, non-profit making. But the trouble with  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nventure is that when you have a fairly small number of receiving audience, there\r\n\r\nmay  well  be  a  loss.  It is not a question of making a profit, but  avoiding\r\n\r\nlosses.  Our  calculation is that the television service  will  make  losses  of\r\n\r\nseveral  million  dollars a year for quite some time before  it  recoups  losses\r\n\r\nthrough  advertising revenue licensing fees. So if the Member for Anson can  let\r\n\r\nme  know,  in my capacity as Minister for Finance, not in my capacity as  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture,  any philanthropic organisation  which  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  part  of  the  losses that we are going to  incur,  then  I  shall  be\r\n\r\ndelighted to receive his suggestion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe\r\n\r\nthat the Four-Year Plan of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nGovernment  can only have this part concerning T.V. materialised. We  also  know\r\n\r\nthat  in carrying out the T.V. services, the Government is trying to help itself\r\n\r\nwith political propaganda and therefore, at the present juncture, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  stepped  up its speed in setting up a temporary station in Bukit  Batok  in\r\n\r\norder to facilitate the propaganda work of the P.A.P. Therefore, I hope that the\r\n\r\nActing  Minister for Culture will assure this House that the T.V. service  will\r\n\r\nnot be taken advantage of for the purpose of political propaganda of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to find out from the Acting Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nconcerns  this. As far as I know, there are two surveying teams,  one  from  New\r\n\r\nZealand  and  the other from Japan. Can the Minister concerned  tell  the  House\r\n\r\nwhether  in, the future T.V. service which country will be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nassistance given to the T.V. service in Singapore?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Minister not aware that, in fact, on television it is\r\n\r\npossible to have several channels, and an additional channel to the one proposed\r\n\r\nwould  not  entail proportionately equal expense, and would he  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  question of renting a channel to an independent television  body?\r\n\r\nWould  Government  consider  bringing in a Bill to create  such  an  independent\r\n\r\ntelevision body?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the only so-called independent television\r\n\r\nbodies  who  may  be  interested in running either the  whole  or  part  of  the\r\n\r\ntelevision  service would be commercial companies who will want to make  use  of\r\n\r\nthe facilities purely to make profits, if there is any question of renting out a\r\n\r\nstudio  room  or  television  time  to  them,  it  is  obvious  that  the   only\r\n\r\nconsideration between them and the Government would be just how much money  they\r\n\r\nwould make.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that is the sort of independent television authority that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  is  thinking of. On the other hand, if  he  is  thinking  of\r\n\r\nsomething independent, like the British\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Corporation, then the question is: who is going  to  put  out\r\n\r\nthe  money  to pay for what can be fairly substantial losses in  the  first\r\n\r\nfew  years  of operations? So until we get clear answers to these problems, I do not think it is worthwhile to pursue the subject here.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang expresses fears that this would be used as\r\n\r\nunfair  propaganda.

As for assistance from\r\n\r\nabroad,  it is true that we have two missions; one is from Japan  and  that\r\n\r\nis  concerned mainly with the technical aspects of setting up a  television\r\n\r\nservice - where should the site of the transmitting station be; how fast  can\r\n\r\nit  expand; and whether the cost could be covered up in the long  run,  and\r\n\r\nso  on  and so forth. The Australian experts came here to advise us on  the\r\n\r\ndetails of setting up the service.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> New Zealand.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe  details  of setting up the service were, e.g., what staff to  recruit,\r\n\r\nwhat  equipment to buy, how to tender for them, and so on and so forth.

But we are at the same time training our  own  local\r\n\r\npersonnel in these new techniques, and every year anything between  half  a\r\n\r\ndozen  and  a  dozen  technicians  are being  sent  abroad  for  study  and\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry to pursue this, Mr Speaker, but it seems only\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nbe  partly understood and I do ask the indulgence of this House since it is\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\nmatter  of  some  importance. The Minister did refer to the British Broadcasting\r\n\r\nCorporation.  But,  of  course, he is aware, as we all  are,  that  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom the potent influence of the radio and television is not  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of Government or of any political Party. It is, in fact, in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  a  non-profit public body created by statute.

But could we not  create  an\r\n\r\nindependent  radio and television body by statute empowering it  to  rent  at  a\r\n\r\nrental  paying  the  Government for a wavelength on the air  and  a  channel  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  television? And they could recoup themselves by power  to  take  in\r\n\r\nadvertisements.  These  have been tried out and have been  found  successful  in\r\n\r\nother  countries. As I have pointed out, the additional cost  of  a  channel  in\r\n\r\ntelevision  is not proportionate to the original cost of establishment,  and  it\r\n\r\ncould  easily  be borne by the advertisements which would be attracted  to  this\r\n\r\nindependent  television channel.

I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to ensure that such waste should not be allowed in future.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I intend to give no such assurance, Mr Speaker, Sir,I do\r\n\r\nnot  know what are his objections. First, it could be an objection to' Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThat is fair enough. He objects to Malaysia, we like Malaysia; and if we want to\r\n\r\npropagate  the  idea  of Malaysia, we do it. That may be one  objection,  and  I\r\n\r\nconsider that as an invalid objection.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he may say that if the Government puts up posters, then other people\r\n\r\ncan  put  up  posters.  Well, other people can put up posters.  There  are  laws\r\n\r\nregulating  the  putting up of posters, and if they make their application  and\r\n\r\nconform  to  the  laws,  then posters are put up. On the  other  hand,  if  they\r\n\r\ninstigate school kids to put up posters at 3 o'clock in the morning, then  they\r\n\r\nare merely looking for trouble. So that may be the second\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nobjection - that if we put up posters, and they should be putting up anti-posters,\r\n\r\nthen I say that there is provision for that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the third objection could be that he does not want posters to be put up\r\n\r\nat  all.  There is great merit in that proposal. I mean, in a well  ordered  and\r\n\r\nrational society, appeals through propaganda such as posters, advertisements and\r\n\r\nso  on  will  be  completely unnecessary. In fact, no country in the  world  has\r\n\r\nreached  the  stage  of  being completely well ordered and  perfectly  rational.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  these  appeals  to human reason, to human emotion  perhaps,  through\r\n\r\nvarious media of publicity are necessary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the money\r\n\r\nspent  by  the  Government on Malaysia Week was merely wasted.

You will know  that\r\n\r\nat  present the Singapore Infantry Regiment's work is only to suppress and curb\r\n\r\nriots  and  violence, and perhaps to protect the P.A.P. Headquarters. This  year\r\n\r\nthere' was an occasion for this Infantry Regiment, combined with the Police,  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  P.A.P. Headquarters. Mr Speaker, Sir, as representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  we  have the duty to supervise over the Government's use of  the  money\r\n\r\nderived from the people in a proper way. We should not spend this $1,040,725  on\r\n\r\nsomething  that  is not necessary. I am of the opinion that the Government  from\r\n\r\nnow  on should, spend public money on services for the benefit of the people and\r\n\r\nnot on military Services.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  can  understand well the Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang's\r\n\r\napprehension regarding this Second Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\nWe  can understand his feelings. Mr Speaker, Sir, if in Singapore there are  no\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements who Want to sabotage Singapore, then there is no  necessity\r\n\r\nto  have  such a military establishment, and everybody would agree that the  sum\r\n\r\ncould  then  be  used to build, say, hospitals, schools and do other  things  to\r\n\r\nbenefit the people. But under the present practical circumstances we have such a\r\n\r\nnecessity.  Especially judging from the present and future political situations,\r\n\r\nit  is very necessary for Singapore to have this Second Battalion. We know  that\r\n\r\nif  the  security situation in Singapore deteriorates and there  is  turmoil  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, all  construction  work  such  as  hospitals  and  schools  will  be\r\n\r\nfrustrated.  Of  course,  if  we want to accept the  proposition  by  the  Vice-President  of  the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Woodhull, to preserve British  military\r\n\r\nbases  in  Singapore, then it is not necessary to have a Second  Battalion.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  purpose of having the' Second Battalion is  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill,  by  1963  or before, merge with the Federation of Malaya  and  become  in\r\n\r\ndependent. Therefore, it is necessary for us to have our own military forces  to\r\n\r\ntake  over  the  responsibilities  at present  borne  by  the  British  Military\r\n\r\nServices.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nyou  see how the P.A.P. always contradict themselves.

Even the  Civil  Defence  Corps,  you\r\n\r\nremember,  was' dissolved. It was not necessary according to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  also to the Minister for Home Affairs, and you see what he has said  today.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have troops. For what?

If they talk of defending Singapore,  a\r\n\r\nfew hundred troops will not make any difference, Sir. The Prime Minister went to\r\n\r\ngreat  lengths  to  convince us in days of old that even a few  thousand  troops\r\n\r\ncould  not  look after Singapore. He said anybody who controlled the  Federation\r\n\r\ncould just walk into Singapore, like the Japanese troops in 1942. So what is the\r\n\r\npoint  of having those few hundred troops? Those troops are meant not to protect\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore but to protect the Headquarters of the P.A.P.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is actually happening, and the training which our local troops are  having\r\n\r\nat  the  present  moment  is not the training to meet  the  enemy  from  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore, but to see how they can surround blocks and buildings and  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat nobody escapes the cordon.

We  had already explained that it was not necessary to use  troops  on\r\n\r\nthose  occasions. Money that can be saved on such troops can be  put  to  better\r\n\r\npurpose.

First,  he has an unholy fear of cordons of disciplined  troops  which,\r\n\r\nperhaps in his wilder moments in bed, he dreams will he enclosing upon those who\r\n\r\nare  wicked:  and,  second, in the last resort, he has, in  violent  threatening\r\n\r\nlanguage, warned the Government that a second battalion is not enough. I concede\r\n\r\nthat  point when I first speak on this. It has been estimated that for  security\r\n\r\npurposes,  maintenance of law and order, in times of insurrection, there  should\r\n\r\nat least be five battalions deployed in Singapore and several more battalions in\r\n\r\nSouth  Malaya and several other battalions in Malaysia. We have been  threatened\r\n\r\nfrom time to time by the Member for Queenstown about the use of force: force  if\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  say  \"yes\" or \"no\"; force if Malaysia is brought into  being.  Not\r\n\r\nunnaturally, it is the duty of the Government to ensure that, if, I hope, in the\r\n\r\nunlikely event of those behind the Member for Queenstown who not only talk force\r\n\r\nbut  actually  use force and had occasions in the past to have  met  force  with\r\n\r\nforce, we should not fail in our duty to protect the lives and limbs of our popu\r\n\r\nlation.  That is the duty of the Government. That is the duty of any government.\r\n\r\nI  need  hardly  remind  the  Member for Queenstown that  the  Chinese  People's\r\n\r\nRepublic  has  a standing army of 5 million out of a population of 650  million,\r\n\r\nabout one per cent of the population. It has a total militia of 50 million  men.\r\n\r\nThe  Indian  Army  is somewhere in the region of 600,000. The  Indonesian  Army,\r\n\r\nwhich  has had to appeal for volunteers, was no less than 370,000 men. This  was\r\n\r\nat  a time when on one occasion the Minister for Home Affairs and I had a casual\r\n\r\nconversation with an officer of the Indonesian Army who happened to pass through\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I  gathered the impression that it was a token amendment  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of raising the inappropriateness of the utilisation of our troops in the\r\n\r\npast. With that I would have been in full agreement in so far as the evidence in\r\n\r\nmy  possession goes. But when the issue is directed, as it seems to be directed,\r\n\r\nas to the necessity for a second battalion, frankly, Sir, I must join issue with\r\n\r\nthose  who deny that necessity. We are a people of one and a half million,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  a  large  city. It cannot be doubted that though a vast  majority  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  peace-loving  and  decent, there have  in  the  past  been  unhappy\r\n\r\nincidents  where important numbers have been misled. There have been unfortunate\r\n\r\nacts  which have caused damage and personal injury, and in one or two  instances\r\n\r\ndeath.  In  the  context of our experience, Sir, within  the  lifetime  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  in  the last seven years, we cannot deny the validity for the  request\r\n\r\nfor  a  further battalion. It is true that troops can be misused and that  power\r\n\r\ncan  be  abused.  But that is another question. The real issue  that  should  be\r\n\r\nbefore  this Assembly is, are there adequate powers for an honest Government  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with possible situations where crises of violence are threatened? I am  in\r\n\r\nan  acutely embarrassing position of finding myself in agreement with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\non any aspect. But, Sir, I must be quite frank in this instance. I do agree with\r\n\r\nthem that one battalion is inadequate and that a second battalion is necessary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I deplore the implication in the speech of the Member for Queenstown that\r\n\r\nour people could, in their despair\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  frustration,  which is perfectly legitimate, consider  the  utilisation  of\r\n\r\nunconstitutional methods for the expression of that frustration. I do  not  seek\r\n\r\nto  wear a halo in this instance. I am not speaking of what is constitutional be\r\n\r\ncause professionally I am trained to respect the law. I say, Sir, as a practical\r\n\r\nhuman  being, I face the basic fact that experience has repeatedly  proved  that\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  violence, only the people suffer, not those in authority.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  suffer and the poor suffer, and any violence would react a hundred-fold\r\n\r\nto  the detriment of our people. There is no way out for the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the  frustration  they  suffer from P.A.P. rule  except  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nprocess.  In  the  name  of the Workers' Party, Sir, and  as  a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition who feels very deeply the dishonesty of the proposed conduct of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment, I say that we do not agree that there should ever be any question of\r\n\r\nunconstitutional  conduct and violence. The thought of  such  action  could  but\r\n\r\nbring  our  people into grave danger and would be a retrograde step which  would\r\n\r\ntake us way back into the tragedies we suffered under imperial rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in the heat of anger, in the agonising position where, by virtue\r\n\r\nof  the  constitutional position, we are fighting a losing fight for decency,  a\r\n\r\nrearguard  action that we know will mean in the end defeat by  virtue  of  their\r\n\r\nmajority,  but in action we must see through. I know that in that  position  one\r\n\r\ntends  in one's frustration sometimes to indulge in sentiments which are  wholly\r\n\r\ninappropriate. I would suggest that the Member for Queenstown may  well  utilise\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to speak again in Committee to deface the unhappy implication of\r\n\r\nthe possibility of unconstitutional violence as a reply to P.A.P. dishonesty.  I\r\n\r\ndo  support  the provision, Sir, for a second battalion, because I think  it  is\r\n\r\nlegitimate for an honest Government, and this is a provision not merely for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

I think the Member for Queenstown,  in  the  last\r\n\r\nattempt to score off the rugged edges of his first performance, was hard put  to\r\n\r\nsound  like a cat when actually he was roaring like a tiger. You cannot  make  a\r\n\r\ntiger  mew.  That is not one of the things which the Member for  Queenstown,  in\r\n\r\nspite of his many versatile and variegated skills, can do. As I have said, those\r\n\r\nwho have no evil intentions can sleep well and nice. As the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  have a duty to ensure that those with evil intentions do not  imperil\r\n\r\nthe  lives,  the  limbs and the safety of the people. The Second Battalion  will\r\n\r\nonly be a start. Eventually the trouble which those manipulating the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  face is this. Troops cannot defend a colonialist administration,  be\r\n\r\ncause more than force is required to sustain the government. But when the attack\r\n\r\nis  against  a  popularly-elected administration representing the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  an  effort  by  an  armed  organised militant  minority  can  often  be\r\n\r\nfrustrated  quickly,  effectively and easily  by  the  immediate  and  effective\r\n\r\ndeployment of armed force.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of the Work Brigade last year. It was round three in\r\n\r\nthe  battle between the Communists manipulating the Barisan Sosialis versus  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. There were bicycle chains, tyres and open acts of indiscipline.  Had\r\n\r\nthere  been  hesitation; had there been fumbling, a few people would  have  been\r\n\r\nhurt,  injured  and maimed. But because of the First Battalion, because  it  was\r\n\r\ndemonstrably clear to anybody who wanted to use bicycle chains, the axe  or  the\r\n\r\niron rod that it would be unprofitable to do so, it turned out in the event that\r\n\r\nnobody used these weapons at all. And so we not only did good to society, but we\r\n\r\nalso did good to the wrongdoer by protecting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim  by  his  own logic and commonsense from putting himself into  an  untenably\r\n\r\nvulnerable position.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has been known for his qualities to charge, often\r\n\r\nblindly, and as the Member for Anson has said, it is a losing battle.

It set off a chain of events that brought\r\n\r\nabout  the  White Paper, merger, Malaysia, Malaysia Week and a  whole  chain  of\r\n\r\ninevitable consequences that will culminate in the final expurgation of all  the\r\n\r\nevil  forces  in  our  society. The Member for Queenstown  can  only  read  this\r\n\r\nmorning's  paper. The gentleman who wrote Mr Lim Ching Siong a  letter  through\r\n\r\nhim  as  the postbox. Mr Wen Lin Chen, from Sarawak. \"Leading officials,\"  said\r\n\r\nhe,  \"of  the S.U.P.P. constitutional organisation.\" He was on his way  back  on\r\n\r\nvoluntary repatriation to China and he was arrested as a member of the vanishing\r\n\r\nCommunist  organisation. And so the process will go on. But behind  the  process\r\n\r\nthere  must  always be the ultimate deterrent. Nobody wants to use  any  troops.\r\n\r\nEverybody wants the law to be observed. But everybody knows that if you are  not\r\n\r\nin  a  position  to  enforce  the  law, nobody will  enforce  it.  If  everybody\r\n\r\nunderstands  that  not only will the law be enforced, but it  will  be  enforced\r\n\r\nswiftly and effectively, then it may well be that everybody will conform to  and\r\n\r\nobey the rules of the game.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Chairman.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  words of the Prime Minister have revealed the intention,  as  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid, of his political Party.

The  more  they\r\n\r\ncarry on this political warfare, the more confused will the electorate be. I  do\r\n\r\nnet  know what is the object of this deliberate intention to confuse the  public\r\n\r\nby  distortions,  counter-distortions, smears and counter-smears.  Merger  is  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue. In the words of some Members of this House, it means  life  and\r\n\r\ndeath  to  the people of Singapore. Yet the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P. choose  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  this national issue as a plaything for them to indulge  in  their\r\n\r\npolitical warfare, calling it round 1, round 2, round\r\n\r\n3.    I  do  not know how many rounds they want to have.

But\r\n\r\nat  that time, there was great interest over this question of merger - or  closer\r\n\r\nassociation  as I choose to call it - So much so that there was a forum  at  which\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the P.A.P., the S.P.A., the U.P.P. and the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwere  present. The question was posed as to what was a more desirable method  of\r\n\r\nascertaining the wishes of the people in regard to closer association  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. Was it to be by means of a referendum or by  means  of  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election?  The  Barisan demanded general  elections.  The  others,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the S.P.A. and the U.P.P., quite rightly stated that the proper  way  to\r\n\r\nascertain the views of the electorate was through a referendum. So at that time,\r\n\r\neven  before agreement was reached between the Government of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya, the P.A.P. Government was committed to a\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill. So they went ahead with the preparation of a Referendum  Bill,\r\n\r\nand in that preparation, of course, their intention was that the Bill should  be\r\n\r\na  Referendum Bill on merger. That is how it came to be that the P.A.P. is  now\r\n\r\nsaying that the Referendum Bill is\r\n\r\ngeneral Bill. They thought at that time they were honest. They thought that  it\r\n\r\nwould be right and proper that the agreement which they hoped to reach with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Federation of Malaya would be put to the people  fairly  and\r\n\r\nsquarely. They thought that in that way they would get the electorate to say yes\r\n\r\nto  the  agreement  which they had reached. That was months ago.  In  their  own\r\n\r\nwords,  that could be round 1 of the fight between the P.A.P. and the  Communist\r\n\r\ngroup in the P.A.P. But when they came to round 3, when they found that if  they\r\n\r\nwere  to pose only one question, a straightforward question, to the people in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, it would\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nturn  out to be a majority vote against the White Paper, not because the  people\r\n\r\ndo  not  want closer association with the Federation of Malaya, but because  the\r\n\r\nCommunist group in the P.A.P. went out telling the people that the quickest  way\r\n\r\nto  get  rid  of this rotten Government was to say \"No\" in a referendum  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion to be posed by the Government. So they thought that it would be  danger\r\n\r\nOUS  to pose one question, because they knew that the Barisan Sosialis had  gone\r\n\r\nout  preaching hatred against the P.A.P., preaching that the only way to get the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. out  of  office was to vote \"No\" to the White Paper.  The  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then had to stand up on the Second Reading of the National  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  and  say - and very few people caught the meaning of the words he  said - \"The\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  referendum need not mean the resignation of the  Government.  A\r\n\r\nreferendum  is a referendum; it is not a vote of confidence in the  Government.\"\r\n\r\nHe  had to say that in order to read just the minds of the people that had  been\r\n\r\ncontaminated  by  the  smears and distortions that  had  been  pervaded  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisani  Sosialis.  So  they thought that one question  would  be  a  dangerous\r\n\r\nquestion,  because  it  would not get a fair answer. It  would  also  result  in\r\n\r\ngetting the electorate to cast a vote of their loss of confidence in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. Therefore, the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Bill was delayed. It was delayed for that reason. And  sud\r\n\r\ndenly,  Sir, the bright boys of the P.A.P. thought, \"Aha, now that  we  are  committed to a referendum, how are we going to wriggle out of it? We must at  least\r\n\r\nput up some semblance of honesty and decency.\" They hit upon the idea of saying,\r\n\r\n\"Ah, let us put two questions:\r\n\r\none question to the White Paper, and another question to be worse than the White\r\n\r\nPaper.\" Therefore, the answer can only be the White Paper, and nothing else.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What is the other one?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That was in their minds. If the Deputy Prime Minister wants\r\n\r\nto know it, it is this. He said, \"There are two types of closer association with\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst type is the White Paper where [as the P.A.P. is very fond of saying] there\r\n\r\nwill be autonomy in education and labour demanded by the P.A.P. Government.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  is  merger  of the Penang and Malacca type where 340,000  non-local-born\r\n\r\ncitizens would lose their citizenship rights.\" Sir, if those two questions  were\r\n\r\nposed,  surely  the 340,000 non-local-born citizens, who are  in  the  majority,\r\n\r\nwould  not  vote for the second type. They would say. \"This is the P.A.P.  White\r\n\r\nPaper, and therefore they want to win.\" So the P.A.P. knew that in this game  of\r\n\r\n\"Heads, I win, Tails, you lose\", it is easy; we go ahead.\" Now they had the idea\r\n\r\nof  putting  two questions. This may be their Round 6 against the Ban-san.  Then\r\n\r\nthe Barisan came out with their upper-cut or below-the-belt blow. I do not know.\r\n\r\nThey said, \"In that case, blank votes, blank votes, blank votes.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, in fact, does not bring credit to the political Parties in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is not even bringing credit to the Parties that are indulging  in\r\n\r\ndistortions and counter-distortions. And now all this trouble - they are going  to\r\n\r\nask more than one question. And obviously the Barisan Sosialis, very ably led by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson, came out very strongly for \"one question one issue.\" I can\r\n\r\nunderstand  what  is  in the minds of the Barisan Sosialis - they  want  to  wreck\r\n\r\nmerger; they want to wreck every opportunity that is offered to us for closer as\r\n\r\nsociation,  because it is inimical to the Communist group in  Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\ntheir death blow. But what I find it difficult to understand is: why should  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson feel it is a grand thing to lead the Barisan Sosialis  on  the\r\n\r\nwar-path and cause more confusion in the minds of the people?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson was a very good colleague of mine in the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment. From my experience working under him and with him, I can  say  this:\r\n\r\nhe  means well. He means to serve the best interests of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  he  believes that, in moving this amendment, he is doing it  for  the  best\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore. But, unfortunately, he has\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noverlooked  the  danger of the Communist game in this fight for  existence.  He\r\n\r\nhas  in  a way been misled into providing the lead to the group that is  losing\r\n\r\nthe battle for merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are against the amendment. This is in answer to the question of the Mem\r\n\r\nber  for  Anson as to why there has been no explanation given to our view  that\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  is not acceptable. It is not acceptable in this  respect - and  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  stand here explaining and be misunderstood as wanting to  defend  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.;  to  which I say that the sooner the P.A.P. get out of the  Government.\r\n\r\nthe better it will be for Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

In fact, it was because of\r\n\r\nthe  intrigues of the P.A.P. who slept with the Communists since they first came\r\n\r\ninto  existence  and  who, when they sat on this side of the  House,  loved  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, welcomed and praised them as their comrades and won their  way  into\r\n\r\npower,  that they are now in this mess today. If they had played clean politics,\r\n\r\nand they should if they were a good, honest government, they would not have been\r\n\r\nin  this  mess and have to fight their ex-comrades whom they describe as  heroes\r\n\r\none day and denounce as Communists another day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow a one-question referendum, because if that one question were\r\n\r\nto  be  posed: \"Do you accept Command Paper No. 33?\" - \"Yes/No\", I can say this  :\r\n\r\nthere may be 90 per cent of the people saying \"No\", not because they do not want\r\n\r\ncloser association, but because they want to show their contempt, their disgust,\r\n\r\nand  their loss of confidence in the P.A.P. Government. It would not give us the\r\n\r\nright  answer  and  it  would create a bad impression in  the  minds  of  people\r\n\r\noutside.

What would be the  consequences?  I  dare  not\r\n\r\nimagine.  Once  the hand of friendship is extended to us but cast  aside  by  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  that does not give a real verdict, it will be almost impossible  to\r\n\r\nresume negotiations for better terms perhaps, or for closer association.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what is very important to us, the S.P.A., a responsible Opposition\r\n\r\nin  this  Chamber, is to ensure that the questions to be posed by the Government\r\n\r\nin  a  referendum are questions that can allow the electorate to pass a verdict.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Finance, speaking on behalf of the Government, has  given  an\r\n\r\nassurance  to  this House that such questions shall be debated in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nbefore  they are posed in a referendum. I accept the assurance, but  I  do  urge\r\n\r\nupon  the  Government to carry out that assurance by suitably amending thc  Bill\r\n\r\nto'  ensure  that  such an assurance will be carried out. I gave  an  indication\r\n\r\nyesterday,  Sir,  that when the amendment to clause 13 is  under  discussion,  I\r\n\r\nhoped  to' achieve that amendment by proposing an amendment to the amendment.  I\r\n\r\nwill touch on that when the time comes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today is just the second day of the debate, and I do not know what round\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. would like to call it - the 8th or 9th round. But let us make  it  the\r\n\r\nlast  round for the good of the people of Singapore. Make it the last round.  Do\r\n\r\nnot  have  any more rounds; the people are getting more and more confused.  Even\r\n\r\nthe  Leader  of the Barisan Sosialis was getting confused, so much so  that  his\r\n\r\nconfusion was so badly apparent in the discussion in Select Committee.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance kept arguing with him on certain amendments proposed in\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee.  The confusion was so apparent  that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance had to say that his skull was thick or something like that. I am  trying\r\n\r\nto  quote  from  the Official Report. Yes, here it is, Sir, column  474  of  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Report of the Select Committee No. 7, of 17th May:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, the Minister for Health and Law has said that some people's skulls are\r\n\r\nso thick that no light can penetrate and no amount of clarification can convince\r\n\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And what did the Leader of the Barisan Sosialis say?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us assume that I have a skull that\r\n\r\nthick.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And I will therefore assume that he has a skull that thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us put an end to all this political warfare that is going on which is\r\n\r\ndamaging the interests of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us debate this very important piece of legislation with a calm, cool head\r\n\r\nand with only one guiding factor - and let us be guided by this one factor - the  interests  of the people of Singapore should come first, and  not  the  in\r\n\r\nterests of any political Party, and in that the S.P.A. is prepared to serve  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the country first. We do not mind what happens to the  S.P.A.  So\r\n\r\nlong as we have served the country, we shall die satisfied.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed very confusing to see the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  once again expressing support for the Government's arguments  against\r\n\r\nthis  clause.  I thought, before the Assembly sitting, on reading  the  sort  of\r\n\r\nstatements  that the S.P.A. issue or listening to none other than the Secretary-General of the S.P.A. at a forum at the University of Singapore, that the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nshould come into this Chamber and say, \"Down with the Referendum Bill because it\r\n\r\nis undemocratic, because it is not possible to determine the views of the people\r\n\r\nwith  a  Bill  of this nature.\" Even as late as, I believe, last week  when  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. representative at a mass rally at Anson denounced the Bill, he gave  the\r\n\r\nimpression   that  his  representatives  here,  namely  the  S.P.A.  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssemblymen,  would  be  opposing the Bill and  expressing  support  to  certain\r\n\r\namendments  that the Opposition had filed. However, Sir, today it is clear  that\r\n\r\nno  matter  what  they say outside the Assembly, inside the Assembly  it  is  ex\r\n\r\ntremely necessary for them to support the Government because this is part of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe deal. And if the S.P.A. does not support the P.A.P., then the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nnot  have a majority at the moment. I believe, and as is believed by many people\r\n\r\noutside  this  Chamber, that part of the deal is to make sure  that  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nmakes  all  the  noise that it wants to make outside in order to make  political\r\n\r\ncapital for itself, at the same time to ensure that the Government keeps ticking\r\n\r\nand that their scheme of things is put through quite neatly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said yesterday, I do not want to spend time replying to speeches\r\n\r\nmade  by  S.P.A. Members. I will now come to the amendments before the Committee\r\n\r\ntoday. I wish to start off by saying this:\r\n\r\nthat  if the Government tells the world that the Barisan Sosialis is up  to  mischief, that we are undesirable social plagues, that our business is to go  about\r\n\r\nwrecking  peace  and  tranquility, and that our functions  are  to  confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople,  I  assure  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that we  are  not  what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndesperadoes  make  us out to be. But just for the Purposes of  argument,  if  we\r\n\r\naccept  the  Government statements on their face value, then we in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  bad  chaps; we go about confusing the people; and  those  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are good chaps and they go about helping people not to get confused.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of our amendment to clause 18 of the Bill is to help the\r\n\r\nvoters get used to the form of the ballot paper before they actually go to vote.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also suggested in this ballot paper that the question to be posed should\r\n\r\nbe a simple and straightforward question which will require only a \"yes\" or \"no\"\r\n\r\nanswer. Sir, this is the first time that a referendum will be held in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand our literacy rate compared with, for example. New Zealand, is extremely low.\r\n\r\nAnd to add to this we have a multi-racial society where even the literate popula\r\n\r\ntion  is  not necessarily literate in English. In this context it is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary,  if  we want to honestly ascertain the views of the people,  to  make\r\n\r\nmatters as simple as possible so that the people are not confused or misled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a referendum is to ascertain the views of the people. This we are all\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nagreed.  The Government ostensibly agrees that the sole purpose of a  referendum\r\n\r\nis  to  ascertain the views of the people, if the Government means what it says,\r\n\r\nnamely, that it wants to determine the views of the people, it cannot but  agree\r\n\r\nthat  its responsibilities and obligations are as much the Opposition's, if  not\r\n\r\nmore, to help the people give their views in the simplest possible manner and to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  verdict of the people is unequivocal and  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nambiguity about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Ministers have time and again suggested that it is the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis that seeks to confuse the people. This is nonsense. We are  not\r\n\r\nseeking  to  confuse the people or mislead the people. We want to do  everything\r\n\r\npossible to hold a referendum in which the issues are put clearly to the  people\r\n\r\nand in which the people will be given every opportunity to vote unequivocally so\r\n\r\nthat  there can be no ambiguity about the verdict of the people, no matter which\r\n\r\nway  the  verdict goes. And these amendments before the Committee that  we  have\r\n\r\nmoved  are  to  minimise confusion. I think any man should be in a  position  to\r\n\r\nrealise  this.  There  is  no  hide  and  seek  in  this.  The  amendments   are\r\n\r\nstraightforward.  If the Government are honest in wanting the people  to  decide\r\n\r\nclearly,  in  wanting  the  people  to indicate  their  wishes  clearly  and  in\r\n\r\nunambiguous form, then they must accept this amendment. They do not have  to  be\r\n\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Assembly at the time when the White Paper was de\r\n\r\nbated, the Government Members repeatedly said that they were confident that  the\r\n\r\npeople  would  support  their proposals when, in fact, Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  said  that  in  their  view the people  would  reject  it.  They  were\r\n\r\nconfident. They said, \"When you say 'the people', you mean the Communists.\" They\r\n\r\nwere  confident. If they were confident, and if they are confident now, why  are\r\n\r\nthey afraid to put the question to the people in the simplest and clearest form,\r\n\r\nso  that the people can give their verdict? I say that we are not interested  in\r\n\r\ngetting  the  people to vote against merger in principle. We  have  opposed  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nIf  the  White Paper is put to the people, and if the people oppose  it,  it  is\r\n\r\nopposition  to  merger  on  terms contained in the  White  Paper.  Sir,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  serious  in  saying that they do not  want  the  people  to  be\r\n\r\nconfused,  then  I do not see, as I say, any reason why they should  not  accept\r\n\r\nthese amendments which make things simpler and clearer for the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this new clause that the Opposition is proposing to clause 5 of the Bill\r\n\r\nis important. It is, in fact, very important. Yet the Government reject it. They\r\n\r\nreject  the amendment moved for clarity and simplicity. Yet they have the  cheek\r\n\r\nto  come  and  say that we are the people who go round wanting  to  confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole Referendum Bill will not serve its purpose if the Government\r\n\r\nreject this and the other amendments, this amendment, in particular, which  will\r\n\r\nallow  for the submission of only one question to the electorate in a referendum\r\n\r\nand  which will make it possible for the people to vote \"yes\" or \"no\". Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in rejecting this amendment in Select Committee revolved its argument\r\n\r\naround  two  central  points,  viz, (1) that it may  be  necessary  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nelectorate more than one question, and (2), that it is not unusual to have  more\r\n\r\nthan  one  question  posed  in  one referendum, in  that  there  are  precedents\r\n\r\nelsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take these two points one by one. The Government's\r\n\r\narguments are naive and hypocritical. Their arguments must be exposed  for  what\r\n\r\nthey  are worth. But before I do that, Sir, it is necessary for me to state that\r\n\r\nin  the  debate on this amendment we must bear in mind clauses 21 and 29 of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Clause  21 enforces compulsory voting. Clause 29 makes all  unmarked  and\r\n\r\nuncertain  votes as votes for the Government proposition. These  three  clauses,\r\n\r\nSir,  viz, clauses 5, 21 and 29, put together, in fact, mean the denial of  free\r\n\r\nchoice  to  the people. It is against this background that we must consider  the\r\n\r\nvalidity of the amendments before the House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental proposition that the Barisan Sosialis makes is that the\r\n\r\nbasic  human  right  of free choice must be guaranteed to  the  people,  notwith\r\n\r\nstanding the number of questions, the right to accept, reject or abstain must be\r\n\r\nuninterfered with. Irrespective of whatever alternatives are put to the  people,\r\n\r\nthe  basic  right of the people to accept, reject, or abstain must be guaranteed\r\n\r\nand  not deprived by legislation, which is brought in by a Government which  has\r\n\r\nlost  the confidence of the people and which survives with one vote on  its  own\r\n\r\nside and with the support of a discredited political force like the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. This then, Sir, is our basic proposition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point that the Government has used for its argument, I have this\r\n\r\nto  say.  I do not think it is that the Government by necessity has to  ask  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  more than one question at a given referendum. Whether to  have  one,\r\n\r\ntwo or more questions will entirely depend on the Government if the amendment is\r\n\r\nrejected.  The  framing of the question, the number of questions  to  be  posed,\r\n\r\netc.,  will  all  be  left  completely in the hands  of  the  Government, lithe\r\n\r\nGovernment  are thoughtful and really care for the views of the people,  if  not\r\n\r\nfor  anything  else at least for the sake of clarity, they can easily  pose  one\r\n\r\nquestion in one referendum.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand,  if this amendment is rejected, it  will  also  allow  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if they so desire, to pose more than one question. Again,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe   Government  so  desire,  they  can  also  pose  two  totally  unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives and use an unfair law to force the people to vote for  one  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  unacceptable alternatives and deny the people the right to  abstain.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government have already  indicated  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  exactly what they seek to do, and it is our responsibility - it  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of all of us in this House - to  ensure that there is no room in this Bill for such a dishonest referendum.\r\n\r\nIf  we  allowed  room  for this, then we would, in effect,  be  encouraging  and\r\n\r\ncondoning the rigging of the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because it is obvious that whether there should be one or more questions\r\n\r\nwill depend entirely on the Government, we have moved these amendments. By these\r\n\r\namendments  we  seek  to  prevent foul play.

Even if this\r\n\r\nwas so, the Opposition cannot accept the argument that because this is the cost,\r\n\r\nit is necessary to have in the Bill a provision to ask more than one question at\r\n\r\nany  referendum,  it  may be that on issues of minor importance,  two  or  three\r\n\r\nquestions could be asked, provided, of course, the basic right of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  people  to free choice is not restricted, provided the people are  not  compelled  by  law  to  choose  one of two totally unacceptable  alternatives,  and\r\n\r\nprovided the people are not denied the fundamental human right to freely accept,\r\n\r\nreject  or abstain. But, Sir, the Opposition, particularly the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\ncannot  and will not accept a position where it will give the P.A.P. Government,\r\n\r\nwhich has already indicated its dishonest intentions, a blank provision in  this\r\n\r\nBill - a  Bill  which,  in fact, will deny the people a very  desirable  right - the\r\n\r\ndemocratic right to free choice. It is not the intention of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nto  waste public money by asking that a few referenda held at $400,000 each.  It\r\n\r\nhas  been  suggested, Sir, in the Select Committee that there may  be  referenda\r\n\r\nheld  to  determine  questions like whether toddy shops  should  close,  whether\r\n\r\nsmoking should be prohibited, or whether pipe-smoking should be prohibited.  I\r\n\r\ncan  only  say, Sir, that to hold a referendum at $400,000 to determine  whether\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore should smoke a pipe, a cigarette or a cigar is  absurd,\r\n\r\nand  any argument on these lines is only frivolous in my view. We do not  for  a\r\n\r\nmoment  believe  that  this National Referendum Bill is  going  to  be  used  to\r\n\r\ndetermine frivolous issues lie that. We say quite categorically that we  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  three or four referenda held at public expense to determine such  matters.\r\n\r\nBut,  sir, on matters of national importance, on matters which affect the  lives\r\n\r\nof  all  our  people and the lives of all our children and that  of  our  future\r\n\r\ngenerations, on matters like constitutional changes, on matters like  merger.  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  if  it  is  necessary to hold more than one referendum  in  order  to\r\n\r\ndetermine with clarity the issues, in order to determine with clarity the wishes\r\n\r\nof our people, it is desirable to do so even if it will cost $400000 to hold  a\r\n\r\nreferendum. Therefore, Sir, in thinking of the cost of a referendum, let us  not\r\n\r\ndisregard  the  importance  of the issue that may be  referred  to  the  people.\r\n\r\n$400,000 or a\r\n\r\nfew million dollars of public money spent in order to determine the people's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown  future  is money worth spending. In any case, Sir, it is definitely  better\r\n\r\nthan going round the world and flying over the North Pole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the second point used in the Government's arguments,\r\n\r\nnamely  that there are precedents for asking more than one question, I  must  at\r\n\r\nthe  outset  say  that there is a fundamental difference between the  referendum\r\n\r\nexamples  quoted and the P.A.P. National Referendum Bill, and that is  while  in\r\n\r\nevery  referendum held elsewhere in the world, the people were given their basic\r\n\r\nright to freely accept, reject or abstain on any question, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     National  Referendum Bill will deny the people  this  right  to  free\r\n\r\nchoice. Clause 29 of this Bill absolutely interferes with the people's right  to\r\n\r\nfree  choice. Sir, in an endeavour to substantiate the arguments, the Government\r\n\r\nMembers  have  tried  to quote certain examples of the sort  of  referenda  held\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in  the world where more than one question have been put.  They  have\r\n\r\nquoted,  for  example, New Zealand. I must point out, Sir, that  the  precedents\r\n\r\nquoted  by the Ministers in Select committee are completely irrelevant. This  is\r\n\r\nso  because  in  the examples quoted, there has always been the  right  for  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  to reject or abstain in a referendum irrespective of the  number  of\r\n\r\nquestions posed. And this is fundamental. The Singapore National Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nis  unique  in  that it seeks to deny the people the right to  vote  against  or\r\n\r\nabstain from voting ii a referendum. This is completely untenable. It is no  use\r\n\r\nquoting  examples  if  we  forget the fundamental position  that  basically  the\r\n\r\nreferendum that the P.A.P. Government is proposing is different from that of New\r\n\r\nZealand, or Australia, or other referenda held in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish, Sir, to debate the merits or otherwise of clause 29 of this\r\n\r\nBill  at this moment. Nevertheless, I think to discuss the amendment before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  in  isolation,  in  complete disregard of  other  clauses  of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nparticularly  clauses  21 and 29, is not proper. In any case,  it  is  certainly\r\n\r\nmisleading\r\n\r\nif we accept the precedents the Government\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers have quoted without consideration of these clauses, namely clauses 21\r\n\r\nand 29.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because the Government has quoted the examples of referenda held in New\r\n\r\nZealand,  to  argue against the amendment before the House, it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  fundamentals involved. The Minister  for  Law,  in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, quoted three New Zealand examples. The first one was on the time that\r\n\r\nhotels should close. The second one was the question on the sale of liquor,  and\r\n\r\nthe  third  one  was  the question on compulsory military training.  These  were\r\n\r\nquoted,  Sir,  as I have said, to substantiate the arguments that there  can  be\r\n\r\nmore  than one question. I would like to go over the examples that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law  gave. The first one, Sir, is on the 8th of May in column  116  of  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Report No. 3. The first example, according to the Minister for Law, the\r\n\r\nballot  paper  was in the following form: \"I vote for closing  at  6  p.m.\"  and\r\n\r\nanother line - \"I vote for closing at 10 p.m.\" Then, Sir, the Minister gave  the\r\n\r\ninstructions which have been given to the voter. They are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The voter must strike out one line, leaving untouched the line which shows\r\n\r\nthe way he wishes to vote.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the voter strikes out both lines or fails to strike Out one of the lines,\r\n\r\nthe voting paper will be void and his vote will not be recorded.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voting paper so marked is to be placed by the voter in the ballot box.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voter is not allowed to take his voting paper out of the polling booth.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it will be noted that in this referendum, the voter's free choice\r\n\r\nwas  in  no  way  interfered  with.  If the  voter  did  not  support  both  the\r\n\r\npropositions put to him, the voter was completely at liberty to strike out  both\r\n\r\nlines. Such a ballot paper would be rejected. It would be declared void and  the\r\n\r\nvote  will  not  be recorded, unlike the P.A.P. referendum where unmarked  votes\r\n\r\nwould  be  recorded  as votes for the Government. In other words,  Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum quoted by the Minister which was held in New Zealand, the fundamental\r\n\r\nright  to  either reject or abstain was given to the voter. This very  right  is\r\n\r\nbeing denied\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto the people of Singapore, and therefore, this example is completely irrelevant\r\n\r\nin  the  context  of  the Referendum Bill that we are discussing.  It  does  not\r\n\r\nsupport the Government's case.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the second example which the Minister quoted, there were three pro\r\n\r\nposals put to the electorate. This is also in column 116. The three propositions\r\n\r\nput  to  the  electorate were: (1) \"I vote for national continuance\",  i.e. for\r\n\r\nallowing the sale of alcoholic drinks:\r\n\r\n(2)   \"I  vote for State purchase and control\", i.e. for all alcoholic  liquors,\r\n\r\nand  (3)  \"I  vote  for national prohibition.' In this example,  Sir,  the  same\r\n\r\nprocedure  was followed. The same instructions were given to the voter,  whereby\r\n\r\nif  THC  voter  struck  out  all  the three propositions  or  only  one  of  the\r\n\r\npropositions or none at all, the voting paper would have been void and his  vote\r\n\r\nwould not be recorded. Here again, Sir, the fundamental right of the voter to  a\r\n\r\nfree  choice  with  no  limitation and with no  imposition  was  given  to  him.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, this example again is one that is irrelevant in the context  of\r\n\r\nthis  Referendum  Bill  before the Committee. It  does  not  again  support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's case.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the third example given by the Minister for Health and Law, i.e. the\r\n\r\none on compulsory military training, the ballot paper, as quoted by the Minister\r\n\r\nin  column 232 [Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May, 1962], says as follows: \"I\r\n\r\nvote  for compulsory military training\" and on the second line, \"I vote  against\r\n\r\ncompulsory  military  training\". In this example, Sir, the  voter  was  given  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  right to reject compulsory military training or to accept  it.  The\r\n\r\nvoter  had his fundamental right to either vote for or against or, ii necessary,\r\n\r\nto  abstain. If the voter put in an unmarked vote, his vote would not be counted\r\n\r\nas  a  vote for compulsory military training. This is not what the P.A.P. intend\r\n\r\nto  do in Singapore. I repeat, Sir, this example again is irrelevant because  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  support the Government's case and it is irrelevant to the context  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore National Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Mr Chairman, we cannot accept this precedent which is\r\n\r\nquoted  blindly  to  substantiate a case for more  than  one  question  without\r\n\r\nregard to the type of referendum that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     Government is proposing. It is one thing for the Government  to  say\r\n\r\nthat they do not want to accept our proposal for a simple question requiring  a\r\n\r\n'yes' or 'no' answer on the grounds that it may be necessary to pose more  than\r\n\r\none  question.  But  it is entirely another matter for the Government  to  substantiate  this  argument  by  quoting precedents which  are  fundamentally  in\r\n\r\nconflict with the Referendum Bill that is being proposed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government is confident that the people are in favour of the\r\n\r\nmerger  arrangements  that they have made, then the  Ministers  need  not  fear\r\n\r\ngiving  our  people their basic right to choose freely. Put  to  the  people  a\r\n\r\nsimple  question  requiring a 'yes' or 'no' answer. They  do  not  have  to  be\r\n\r\nafraid.  They  keep  telling  the world that the  Barisan  Sosialis  is  up  to\r\n\r\nmischief. They keep telling the world that we are out to confuse the people.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether the Government would agree to sit down with us  and\r\n\r\nwork out the\r\n\r\nsimplest  possible procedure whereby confusion would be minimised,  and  whereby\r\n\r\nthe   people   would  be  given  every  opportunity  to  give   their   verdict\r\n\r\nunequivocably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Liberal Socialist representatives were being examined in the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nat one stage said that the voter can stay\r\n\r\naway if he did not want to accept either\r\n\r\nof  the  two  propositions. This is on Page C.28, column 55, Sir. I  will  just\r\n\r\nread  the  last sentence of Mrs Leon-Soh's answer and then what  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law had to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'[Mrs Leon-Soh] But, on the other hand, the question is not clearly\r\n\r\nframed; it is a question of wanting either (A) or (B), and the voter says,  \"I\r\n\r\ndo not want (A) and I do not want (B).\" We are taking it on that level, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mr Byrne] He can stay away.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister is supposed to be the Minister for Law for the State.

He had the courage and the guts to say, 'This is\r\n\r\nwhat  I  believe in - no democracy, nothing'. But the Government today  have  very\r\n\r\nstrong  Fascist  tendencies  and  they want to camouflage  them  by  talking  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and individual freedom, 'We are pillars of parliamentary democracy  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world.' It has already been pointed out very many times in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the so-called democrats like them - like  all  the\r\n\r\nChiang Kai-sheks and Syngman Rhees that we have - who spelt doom for democracy  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world. It is not the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are accused as Communists; it is not the people in the Barisan Sosialis who\r\n\r\nwill  destroy democracy. It is the men who are drunk with power and want to keep\r\n\r\npower at the expense of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Bill stands now, the Government can pose a question in any form.\r\n\r\nIt  can pose a number of questions. It can also ask the people to choose between\r\n\r\ntwo  unacceptable alternatives and deny them the right to abstain.  If  a  voter\r\n\r\ndoes not wish either of the alternatives, he cannot say 'no', because he is  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  say  'no'. He is legally expected to say 'yes' to one  of  them  at\r\n\r\nleast.  So, Sir, a voter who does not desire both will be helpless. This  voter,\r\n\r\nas  many, many others like him, will not be uncertain as to choose which of  the\r\n\r\ntwo alternatives.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

He cannot put in an unmarked vote, for that will,\r\n\r\naccording to the law, be a vote for the Government proposition. Sir, this is the\r\n\r\ntrick  formula worked out with clause 5 of the Bill as a basis, which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  has  invented  to get the 'support' of the  people  for  its  merger\r\n\r\nproposals, and it is with this trick formula that they feel confident.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say the Barisan Sosialis have been cornered. They say the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are desperate now; the Communists are desperate - they do not know  what\r\n\r\nto  do.  I  tell  them,  Sir, we are not desperate.  We  are  not  cornered  and\r\n\r\ndesperate,  because we have great respect for the intelligence  of  the  people,\r\n\r\nunlike the P.A.P. leadership. We do not have to go and tell the people what to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndo.  We believe the people know themselves what they should do. So all this talk\r\n\r\nof referendum on smoking, toddy shop is just humbug. This Bill has been drawn up\r\n\r\nby  the  Government with the sole intention of pushing through the P.A.P  merger\r\n\r\nproposals, no matter what bluff they make in this Assembly or outside it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will see why the Opposition lay so much importance in this\r\n\r\namendment to include a new clause which will mean only one question to which the\r\n\r\nelectorate can say without ambiguity, unequivocally yes or no. Who is trying  to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the people? The Barisan Sosialis or the P.A.P. We are fighting  to  get\r\n\r\nthe Government to put a simple yes or no question so that the people will not be\r\n\r\nconfused and helpless. So that the verdict of the people whichever way  it  goes\r\n\r\nwill  be  clear-cut  and the irony of it is that we are  accused  of  trying  to\r\n\r\nconfuse the people This is the conduct pf an absolutely dishonest Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every single amendment that has been moved by the Opposition to this Hill\r\n\r\nis to minimise confusion, is to help the people to indicate their wishes clearly\r\n\r\nand yet the P.A.P. is opposing\r\n\r\nit.   The S.P.A. talk a lot outside, but inside here they make certain that  the\r\n\r\nBill  goes  through. The P.A.P. to-day has no other way of surviving  except  by\r\n\r\ncheating  the  people,  and  that is exactly what  it  is  seeking  to  do.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is seeking to rig the referendum. This in simple straight\r\n\r\nforward  language  is rigging, and I would say it is not only  rigging,  it  is\r\n\r\nshameful rigging. To those Members of this House who sit as Back benchers of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  who are fully aware of the pressure of the people and who  wish  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that all this dirty work is being done by the Prime Minister  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility is his alone, I say, \"You are also responsible.\" Sir,  every\r\n\r\ndishonest  act  of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet is also the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  Back  benchers,  because without their support, the  Government  cannot\r\n\r\nimplement its crooked\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndecisions.  As  I say, it is the responsibility of every one in  this  House  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  in this Bill there is no provision for rigging the referendum  one\r\n\r\nway or the other.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause proposed to clause S of the Bill is one of the most important\r\n\r\namendments  to  the whole Bill. Without this clause and with  the  inclusion  of\r\n\r\nclauses  21  and 29, the Referendum Bill would seek to deprive the  exercise  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights by our people. The Government on the one  hand  says  that  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  is to consult the people, to ascertain the views of the  people.  It\r\n\r\nsays  that  a referendum will be held in order to determine whether  the  people\r\n\r\nsupport  the  White Paper merger or not. On the other hand,  Sir,  it  seeks  to\r\n\r\ninterfere with the people's right to free choice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referendum that the Government has in mind would, in fact, compel the\r\n\r\npeople  to vote only yes. The right to say no and the right to abstain  will  be\r\n\r\ndeprived by legislation. We in the Barisan Sosialis have been accused as  people\r\n\r\nwho work to wreck democracy. We are not hypocrites, Sir, like those who claim to\r\n\r\nbe  democrats.  We  are not hypocrites like those who claim  to  be  pillars  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy but who are in fact destroying the very foundations of a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society.  The argument the Government has put  forward  against  the\r\n\r\namendment is untenable. We are told that if a simple question requiring a yes or\r\n\r\nno answer is put, the people will be confused. The stupidity of this argument is\r\n\r\nclear.  It is absolutely ridiculous for the Government to say that our amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  will seek a yes or no answer unequivocally would confuse the people.  Any\r\n\r\nman  who makes a suggestion of this sort, Sir, must be insane. And whatever form\r\n\r\nthe  question  takes in the referendum, the right to reject or abstain  must  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the people. This is denied by the Referendum Bill and any proposition\r\n\r\nwhich denies the people the right of free choice, the right to say freely yes or\r\n\r\nno or abstain would be in conflict with the principles of democracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  debate  on  the Referendum Bill threatens to be  the  most  dreary\r\n\r\nperformance ever in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Oh, you are not\r\n\r\nafraid, are you?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> All the points\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  made and all the arguments that have been put forward  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and  the  Workers' Party had all been  set  out  on  previous\r\n\r\noccasions.  You,  Mr  Speaker,  as Chairman of  the  Select  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill, would have recognized them immediately. If you had listened  to\r\n\r\nthe  radio  forums conducted by the University of Singapore and Radio Singapore,\r\n\r\nyou  would  have come across the very same old dreary arguments  used  by  these\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition on these occasions. For practical purposes,  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and the Workers' Party had been provided with  cuttings  from\r\n\r\ntape-recordings of those occasions, they could have played back  their  previous\r\n\r\nperformances, thereby saving their throats unnecessary effort and our  ear-drums\r\n\r\nunnecessary tedium. It is true, Mr Speaker, Sir, that on this occasion we  have\r\n\r\nso  far been spared the more lurid perorations of the Member for Anson. You will\r\n\r\nrecollect  that  on  previous occasions he likened our  proposed  referendum  to\r\n\r\nbeating  of  wives,  beating  of daughters, drinking of  arsenic,  prostitution,\r\n\r\nconcubine,  etc. Perhaps sombre reflection, which I concede even the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  on  occasions is capable of, has convinced him of the absurdity of  these\r\n\r\nanalogies. So, now, we have to put up with the gramophone record performances of\r\n\r\nsome  hon.  Members opposite. In all these weeks and months of  cogitation  they\r\n\r\nhave  not been able to think of a single new idea. Their brains appear  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  completely dried up. One would have thought that decency requires them  to\r\n\r\nspare us the dreary repetitions of half-truths and untruths, but this is not the\r\n\r\ncase.  These hon. Members set about their business as if they are informing  the\r\n\r\nHouse of startling new discoveries in human affairs. So there is nothing for  us\r\n\r\nto do but to meet each and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  one  of these arguments again. We shall try on our part to introduce,  if\r\n\r\nnot a completely new set of arguments, at least a more refreshing approach to  a\r\n\r\nvery stale subject.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, every time the Member for Anson speaks on how questions in a\r\n\r\nreferendum should be framed, he lists out referenda in other countries where one\r\n\r\nquestion  is asked with a yes or no answer. No one denies that this is  the  way\r\n\r\ncertain countries carry out certain types of referenda, but the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  conveniently forgotten the two referenda most closely akin to the one  that\r\n\r\nwill be carried out in Singapore soon. I refer, of course, to the referendum  in\r\n\r\nNewfoundland  in 1948 and the referendum, carried out last year  by  the  United\r\n\r\nNations in the Cameroons. Both these referenda were to decide the constitutional\r\n\r\nfuture  of  the  territory concerned. The analogy with  Singapore  is  therefore\r\n\r\nclose,  but  the  matter  goes  even further than  that.  The  future  of  these\r\n\r\nterritories is to be decided along certain alternatives, one of which is  merger\r\n\r\nwith  a  larger  territory. The parallel with Singapore is therefore  exact.  In\r\n\r\nNewfoundland,  the choice was whether the country should merge  with  Canada  or\r\n\r\nachieve independence by itself. In the Cameroons, the choice was between  merger\r\n\r\nwith  Nigeria  and  merger with the French Cameroons.  Here  are  the  most  apt\r\n\r\nprecedents  that we have, and our framing of the question follows exactly  these\r\n\r\nprecedents, that is to say, the choice of alternatives and not one question with\r\n\r\na 'yes' or 'no' answer.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis and the Member for Anson say that the right to say\r\n\r\n\"no\"  is  a basic, fundamental, inalienable human right. I find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand this, urge of theirs to say 'no' - an urge which may be appropriate  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of a virtuous damsel being assailed with an improper suggestion.  But\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party are neither virtuous nor damsels. In\r\n\r\nconstitutional  affairs, I do not see where the right to say  \"no\"  is  a  basic\r\n\r\nhuman  right.  In the Cameroons, for instance, voters were asked to  drop  their\r\n\r\nballot papers in one\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  two boxes; one box for Nigeria and another for Cameroons. There was no third\r\n\r\nbox for voters, who did not want either of these a1ternatives. So let us not  be\r\n\r\nmisled  by  precedents selected and slanted by the Member for Anson of referenda\r\n\r\ncarried out in other countries. Some referenda support his case, others do  not;\r\n\r\nand  I  hope he will admit that too. Those which do not support his case have  a\r\n\r\nmore  immediate similarity with our own situation in Singapore than those  which\r\n\r\ndo. So this disposes of international precedents.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown have made quite a\r\n\r\nfuss  about  the  fact  that this is a general Referendum  Bill  under  wnich  a\r\n\r\nspecific referendum, that is, on merger, will be held. One accepts this,  and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see  why  this  should call for much excitement among  these  two  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers.   Some   proposed  amendments  are  unacceptable   because   they   are\r\n\r\ninappropriate to a general Referendum Bill, and others are because the Bill will\r\n\r\nbe  used to carry out a referendum on merger. So what is so extraordinary  about\r\n\r\nit? [Interruption]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, am I to understand from the Member for Anson that this\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill is to remain a general Referendum Bill, but not used for\r\n\r\nany specific referendum? Is that what he wants us to understand? The hon. Member\r\n\r\neven  offered  the  utterly preposterous suggestion that  in  addition  to  this\r\n\r\ngeneral  Referendum Bill, we should have a specific Referendum Bill  on  merger.\r\n\r\nSir,  I can see some point, in logic, if he maintains, that we should scrap this\r\n\r\ngeneral  Referendum  Bill  and  in  its place  have  one  specifically  for  the\r\n\r\nreferendum on merger. I can see some point in this. But I am unable to  see  how\r\n\r\nand why we should have two Bills on referendum passed at the same time, both  of\r\n\r\nwhich would be used to regulate one referendum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me get down to the gist of the matter. These people want the referendum to\r\n\r\ncontain only one question, which will admit only a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have  stated  quite  correctly  that in a general  Referendum  Bill  such  a\r\n\r\nlimitation  is  unnecessarily restrictive. The arguments have been  set  out  in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  Reports, and I do not wish to weary this House  by  repeating\r\n\r\nthem.  But I only want to draw attention to two points. First, I want to discuss\r\n\r\nwhat they hope to achieve by this amendment. Second, I want to show that even if\r\n\r\nthis  amendment is accepted by the Government, it is defective from their  point\r\n\r\nof  view and that the objectives which they had in mind can be frustrated  quite\r\n\r\neasily by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the point as to why they want one question with a 'yes'\r\n\r\nor 'no' answer. The Member for Queens-town said that the original intention was\r\n\r\nto  put  up the White Paper proposals for acceptance or rejection. He  is  quite\r\n\r\nright.  That  was  our  original  intention and it  still  remains  our  present\r\n\r\nintention.  But where we disagreed with the Member for Queenstown  is  this:  he\r\n\r\nwants  a  rejection of the White Paper proposals to mean that there will  be  no\r\n\r\nmerger  whatsoever.  We say that the rejection of the White Paper  merger  would\r\n\r\nmean  complete  merger on terms of absolute equality with any of  the  other  11\r\n\r\nStates  of the Federation of Malaya. In other words, if the electorate does  not\r\n\r\nlike  the  White  Paper proposals, then they get the type of  merger  which  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party had been advocating all the time in this\r\n\r\nHouse.  What  is  so  wrong about this? They want complete merger  on  terms  of\r\n\r\nabsolute  equality  with  the  other States.  Why  do  they  fear  to  put  this\r\n\r\nproposition to the electorate? If they are absolutely honest in wanting complete\r\n\r\nmerger,  then  they should insist that complete merger should be offered  as  an\r\n\r\nalternative to the White Paper merger in the Referendum. In fact, if  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger  were  the  only  proposition that  the  Government  puts  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate, then he should rise in anger and demand that complete merger  should\r\n\r\nbe  put  as  an  alternative. Why have they not done so, if they  really  wanted\r\n\r\ncomplete merger?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday four of us, the Members for Queenstown, Anson, the Prime\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMinister and myself went to Radio Singapore to record the third forum on  merger\r\n\r\nand  the  Referendum  Bill.  Some time was spent on which  questions  should  we\r\n\r\ndiscuss. Eventually we agreed to discuss three questions, and they were:  first,\r\n\r\nwhether the electorate should be able to say 'no' at the referendum:\r\n\r\nthe second was the question of blank votes, and the third question asked was why\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis and the Workers' Party objected, to  complete  merger,  a\r\n\r\nproposal  which  they  have  advocated all the  time,  to  be  included  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Sir, more time was then spent on deciding how much time  should  be\r\n\r\nallotted to each of these questions. The two hon. Members in the Opposition said\r\n\r\nthat the basic issue was the right to say 'no', and that the other two were not\r\n\r\nreally  very  important so that half the time should be spent on discussing  the\r\n\r\nbasic  right  to say 'no', and a quarter of the time to each of  the  other  two\r\n\r\nquestions, including the question why they object to complete merger  being  put\r\n\r\nto the electorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our side we maintained that they had to explain to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwhy  they had always, objected to complete merger being put in a referendum, and\r\n\r\nwe  considered this to be a central issue. We, therefore, proposed that half the\r\n\r\ntime -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

There is no mention of complete\r\n\r\nmerger. What is he talking about?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue the narrative, Mr Speaker, Sir, we said, \"Give them half the time\r\n\r\nto  explain why they did not want to put complete merger to the electorate.\" But\r\n\r\nthey  displayed a marked shyness in accepting this opportunity to put their case\r\n\r\nstraight  before  the public. Eventually, Sir, we compromised and  decided  that\r\n\r\neach of the three questions should be given equal time. Now, their reluctance to\r\n\r\ndeal with this very basic question, \"Why do they not want their own proposals to\r\n\r\nbe  put to the electorate?\" does not surprise us, for we know that whatever they\r\n\r\npretend  to  say they have never wanted complete merger or any form  of  merger.\r\n\r\nEven  now they are saying that they never really asked for complete merger  like\r\n\r\nany of the 11 States.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone knows that at the first Radio Forum, the Members for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nand  Anson in public rebuked the Member for Queenstown for letting the side down\r\n\r\nin  making  a  grave mistake when the Barisan asked for merger like  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca.

In the  first  instance,\r\n\r\nthey  asked  for  complete merger like Penang or Malacca. Then, realising  their\r\n\r\nerror,  they added a new condition which demands that the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nshould  treat  Singapore on better terms than any of the  11  States.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  what the Barisan Sosialis want is not complete merger for Singapore  but\r\n\r\nsuper-merger.  This  is  not  a proposition that can be  seriously  entertained,\r\n\r\nexcept by those whose real intention is to frustrate merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b>\r\n\r\nWhat about Brunei?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Nee Soon says, 'What about Brunei?' If they\r\n\r\nwant  merger on equal terms with Brunei, we will put it to the public. There  is\r\n\r\nno  trouble  about that. But do not ask for super-merger. That does  not  happen\r\n\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both they and the Workers' Party are committed to a policy of complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  In  any reasonable man's understanding of the words 'complete  merger',\r\n\r\nthe  terms  must  be  like  those enjoyed by anyone of  the  11  States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation - no better than these and no worse than these. In fact, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson has laid down his policy in no uncertain terms. I quote from Hansard  Vol. 15 No. 7, dated 23rd November, 1961, column 557. He was referring to -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'a dog-eared copy of the very first and the only party platform of the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  on its formation in December of 1957. In the very first paragraph and  in\r\n\r\nthe very first sentence, it says,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The basis and framework of all policy must be recognition of the fact that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is geographically, ethnically, and economically part of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthe  only healthy ultimate solution is integration with Malaya on an equal basis\r\n\r\nwith other states...\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on to say in column 562:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I believe that if the issue were put to the people of Singapore, \"Do you want\r\n\r\nunconditional merger complete, or do you want the P.A.P.

But what strikes me as beyond comprehension is his anger\r\n\r\nthat  the Government should carry out the referendum in exactly the manner which\r\n\r\nhe  thought so natural several months ago. Why is it blatant dishonesty in  June\r\n\r\n1962  to  do what was so obviously right in November 1961? That .is to  put  two\r\n\r\nalternatives  for  the  people's choice - White Paper merger  and  complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger. Sir, if he wants complete and unconditional merger, to use\r\n\r\nhis  own  words, \"on an equal basis with any of the, other States\", why does  he\r\n\r\nobject to this choice being offered to the electorate as an alternative to White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger?  More especially so as he is convinced that 90 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate will choose complete and unconditional merger. Why does he  say  that\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger is like drinking arsenic, beating one's  wife,\r\n\r\ngoing  into  prostitution and other perverted forms of human conduct  which  his\r\n\r\nmorbid imagination conjures up every now and then?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this brings me to the point raised by the Member for Queenstown. He said\r\n\r\nthat  we had originally intended to pose the White Paper proposal for acceptance\r\n\r\nor  rejection. He meant by this we wanted to put the White Paper proposal  in  a\r\n\r\nform  of  a question which only admits of a \"Yes\" or \"No.\" answer. Sir,  how  he\r\n\r\ngets  this  curious notion I do not know. But he now admits that if  the  choice\r\n\r\nwere  given  to the people between White Paper merger and complete merger,  this\r\n\r\nwould put Barisan Sosialis in a \"zugzwang\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At long last the awful truth has dawned upon him, and I must congratulate him\r\n\r\non his realisation of the dire straits in which he finds himself, belated though\r\n\r\nhis  perception comes. But he will recollect that when I first told him that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis was in a \"zugzwang\", it was not this year, but well into  last\r\n\r\nyear that it happened. Sir, time does not permit me to check through Hansard  to\r\n\r\nidentify the date but this may be a useful piece of research for the hon.

Right from the beginning we were fairly certain of the outcome  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  we propose to carry out. There was no hasty change of  intention  or\r\n\r\ndesign, as a result of a reappraisal of political trends. The P.A.P., Sir, makes\r\n\r\nlong-term  forecasts fairly accurately and, in addition, allows for  the  inevit\r\n\r\nable  margin  of error and inaccuracy for which special precautions  are  always\r\n\r\navailable. This is the way to handle a troublesome situation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Queenstown is still not convinced of what I say, may I\r\n\r\nrefer  him  to the parable of the inquisitive camel, which I brought up  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee? This stupid and inquisitive camel - I am referring, of  course,\r\n\r\nto  the  Barisan Sosialis - is led to the belief that there is a fish in the  mud-hole.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Are you referring to merger?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, I am not referring to merger.

They think that they can  get\r\n\r\naway  with this dishonest pretence. Sir, the time for reckoning is not far  off.\r\n\r\nThe day of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretribution  is at hand. Once they said that they wanted complete  and  absolute\r\n\r\nmerger, then there was no escape for them. Sir, how different the position would\r\n\r\nbe  if they had, right from the beginning, said that they did not want merger on\r\n\r\nany  terms whatsoever. They were instructed by the Communist underground to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  next stage of the constitutional development of Singapore  should  be\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government with internal security in the hands of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  so  that they can save their own skins. If they had  stuck  to  this\r\n\r\nM.C.P. underground official line steadfastly and without deviation, they  would\r\n\r\nnot have been in their present predicament of having their bluff called.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you ask for complete merger, you ask for complete merger, not for super-merger. This attempt to wriggle out from complete merger by saying that you\r\n\r\nreally  wanted super-merger is too obvious and dishonest a maneuver  to  deceive\r\n\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, now, Sir, the camel is in the mud-hole and there he remains until he is\r\n\r\ncarried out by persons who want to take charge of naughty and inquisitive camels\r\n\r\narid to put them in their proper places.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are the camel, then.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Some people are trying to make a pretence of being quite\r\n\r\njolly about the situation.

I said, before that even if the Government accepted this  amendment,\r\n\r\nit could still frustrate the objective which the amenders have in mind, namely,\r\n\r\nto  block merger. Now. Sir, let me transfix the point that we can easily  devise\r\n\r\nthe  question  in accordance with the requirements of this amendment  and  still\r\n\r\nhave  merger, whatever the answer is. We can frame the question like this.:  \"Do\r\n\r\nyou prefer\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncomplete merger to the White Paper merger? Answer 'yes' or 'no'.\" If the  answer\r\n\r\nis  'yes',  you  get complete merger. If the answer is 'no', you get  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger.  All the conditions of the clauses are followed,  but  the  camel\r\n\r\nstill  remains in its mud-hole. So this amendment really is an example of  inept\r\n\r\ndraftsmanship,  just  as  the amendment we discussed yesterday  was  clumsy  and\r\n\r\ninept.  They wanted to have the questions put to the referendum to be  discussed\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly. They dealt with the wrong clause of the Bill, amending it  in\r\n\r\nsuch a way that it became constitutionally ridiculous. May I, therefore, suggest\r\n\r\nto  them, the Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party, that they should pay more\r\n\r\nattention to the finer points of legal draftsmanship?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have been so obsessed with having questions\r\n\r\nwith an answer of 'yes' or 'no' that they said through their representative, Dr\r\n\r\nLim  Hock Siew, at the forum of the University of Singapore, that they  did  not\r\n\r\nmind whether there is one question, two' questions, or five questions put to the\r\n\r\nreferendum, provided the answer is 'yes' or 'no' to each one of them. And if the\r\n\r\nelectorate were given the choice to say 'no', they would, not mind whether blank\r\n\r\nvotes  counted  one  way  or  the other. Sir, these  are  very  rash,  bold  and\r\n\r\ninadequately considered views. If we were to take Dr Lim at his own  words,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  require much ingenuity to frame the questions in such  a  way  as  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate the Barisan Sosialis' attempt to wreck the merger referendum. Sir, the\r\n\r\npoint  is not whether there should be one question to which the answer is to  be\r\n\r\n'yes'  or  'no'. This is merely a matter of legal draftsmanship  on  which  they\r\n\r\nslipped  up  so badly. The real issue is this: should the Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nstooges  be given a chance to wriggle out of their open commitment for  complete\r\n\r\nmerger and so wreck the referendum by dishonest and fraudulent misrepresentation\r\n\r\nof  the issue? They claim that in a democratic state they have the right to  use\r\n\r\ndemocratic  privileges to jam up the democratic processes. Sir,  only  the  most\r\n\r\ninnocent of people believe that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocratic  state is so feeble, so flabby, and so powerless as  to  provide  its\r\n\r\nenemies, who wish to destroy democracy, all the facilities and encouragement  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  They  may  feel that the democratic system should allow  itself  to  be\r\n\r\ncorroded and destroyed in this manner. We of the P.A.P. say that it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof  the  democratic state to set up defences in sufficient strength to deny  the\r\n\r\nenemy any opportunity to do this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand the Minister preparing and\r\n\r\nreading a written speech for that tour de force of abuse and falsehoods.

Mr Speaker, every human being is expected to have  a  memory  that\r\n\r\nlasts  at  least 24 hours. Not 24 hours ago, Mr Speaker, I had  to  meet  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen  across  the  Floor in Radio P.A.P. There was a loaded  question  from\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu.  Let me read it, Sir, so that you can have it accurately,  from\r\n\r\nthe official transcript; it is not mine:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party have in the earlier stages asked\r\n\r\nfor  complete merger.

As to the second  question,  it\r\n\r\nwas  completely  inaccurate to suggest that we were reluctant that  that  matter\r\n\r\nshould  be  put.

We sought to introduce the words:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore\r\n\r\nentering  the  Federation  as  the  twelfth state  and  with  all  its  Citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  that deals with the first falsehood that we do not want our stand  put  to\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I almost feel apologetic with the respect that I normally have for the traditional august nature of this Assembly, which one is apt to forget\r\n\r\nsometimes in the light of the unprecedented conduct of the Government to use the\r\n\r\nword  \"falsehood\".  But  there is no other word, Sir,  which  could  fairly  and\r\n\r\nsquarely  pin  it down in the light of the fact that it was but 30  hours  ago - yesterday, between 12.30 and 2.00 p.m., this was stated in his presence, and his\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nanswer  was, \"This is a bribe.\" I said. \"It is not the P.A.P. that I am offering\r\n\r\nthe  bribe  to.\" The National Union of Journalists can hardly assist me  in  it,\r\n\r\nSir.  That is the first falsehood. They said, \"Ah, yes.\" Now, Sir, we went right\r\n\r\noff.  They  did  not accept the challenge. Would they put the  position  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  as enunciated by them after consultation and fully supported,  which\r\n\r\nthey defeated' with the Front Bench of the Opposition by I think it was 32 votes\r\n\r\nto 17 with two absent on 6th December.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us pin this falsehood once and forever, and I am prepared to sit\r\n\r\ndown  to  receive'  the  answer. Would the Government be  prepared  to  put  the\r\n\r\nalternative  in the form that the Opposition want? And, Sir, I added  this.  You\r\n\r\nknow,  Mr Speaker, never I think - and you have known me for a long time - have  I\r\n\r\never  alleged that I could at most but guess at the wishes of the people. Nobody\r\n\r\nknows it. And when I expressed my own views as to the possible result, those are\r\n\r\nmy  own  views, but I would say this that even if our proposals were put to  the\r\n\r\npeople, I say that they are entitled to say yes or no to each, that there should\r\n\r\nnever be any question because the Opposition Parties say they believe the people\r\n\r\nwant  one  thing  and  the Government say they believe the people  want  another\r\n\r\nthing,  that  the people should have no right to reject both the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition proposals. We are no gods. We are human beings. Some of us  seek\r\n\r\nin  sincerity to assess what is wanted, to assess how good it is, to assess  how\r\n\r\nfar  it  should  be taken, and I, in so far as the Workers' Party is  concerned,\r\n\r\neven if that were put, I would insist that the people, should have the right  to\r\n\r\nreject and categorically and clearly to reject my proposals if they deem fit  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  They should have the unequivocal right to say yes or no to  either  the\r\n\r\nGovernment proposition and/or the Opposition proposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the second falsehood - that we asked for super merger. I do not have\r\n\r\nto  prepare  or  get prepared by one of many paid stooges any speech  to  answer\r\n\r\nthis. The second falsehood that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas  perpetrated in that tour de force of abuse and falsehood is that we seek  a\r\n\r\nsuper merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, first let us look at the terms again: \"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as\r\n\r\nthe  twelfth  state  and  with all its Citizens automatically  becoming  Federal\r\n\r\nCitizens.\"  That  was our amendment which was defeated by the  P.A.P. with  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and U.M.N.O. in support. Where is its super position?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask for integration. Do you think that when Newfoundland entered Canada the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Newfoundland did not become Canadian citizens? You know that  since\r\n\r\n1948  the  Federation has had provisions whereby persons living  in  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca could have Federal citizenship. Do you think that when the eleven States\r\n\r\njoined  together,  the  Federal citizens of Penang or  Malacca  did  not  become\r\n\r\nFederation  citizens?  Now, Sir, Penang did not have any Singapore  citizens  or\r\n\r\nPenang citizens. Malacca did not have any Singapore citizens or Malacca citizens\r\n\r\nand  the issue as regards our citizens should be dealt with in the same  way  as\r\n\r\nthe  citizens  who were Federal citizens and that this can be  done  is  clearly\r\n\r\nshown:\r\n\r\nit  was  in the mind of the Federation parties and the Alliance which helped  to\r\n\r\nformulate  the  Constitution whereby under Article  22  the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is given the power to grant citizenship to those in new  territories\r\n\r\nwho are citizens of the new territories which join it. So, Mr Speaker, that  is\r\n\r\nthe second falsehood, that we asked for a super, super merger -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order.

Mr Speaker, you have been\r\n\r\nreferred during a bag and unhappy sitting in November and December of last  year\r\n\r\nto  the widespread publicity given to polIcy statements of the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya wherein he indicated in the clearest  possible  terms\r\n\r\nthat he was prepared to take in Brunei, Borneo aid Sarawak with full Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship for the Brunei citizens and the British subjects in the  other  two\r\n\r\nterritories.  So where are we asking for this super merger? That is  the  secoid\r\n\r\nfalsehood, Sir. Then he said - and this, Sir, but for the fact that it  is  tragic\r\n\r\nwould  make one laugh; prepared for him no doubt by somebody and I wonder if  he\r\n\r\nunderstands the words he uses - \"What would the reasonable man's understanding  be\r\n\r\nof  complete merger?\" Yes, do they know what a reasonable man is? Can  they  put\r\n\r\nthemselves in the position of a reasonable man? Do they really think  they  can?\r\n\r\nHave  they  made  any  effort  to  talk on an honest  man-to-man  basis  with  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  man and ask of him, \"What do you understand by the phrase  'complete\r\n\r\nand  unconditional merger'?\" Do you understand that there are going to  be  half\r\n\r\nour  citizens who would be deprived of citizenship? Sir, to put the question  is\r\n\r\nto answer it, except for those who are deaf to all logic, to all\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nreason,  to all good sense. For the P.A.P. Front Bench to talk of the reasonable\r\n\r\nman  is  almost blasphemy. He said, Sir. \"What is wrong, that in  June  1962  we\r\n\r\nshould  not do what the Member for Anson said we could do in November of  1961?\"\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Anson has at no time. Mr Speaker, ever considered it proper  or\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  was  proper that the people should have questions  put  to  them\r\n\r\nwithout  being  given  the  right to say yes or no to  each  question  as  every\r\n\r\ncivilised  country  has  offered.  The  Minister  for  Finance  has  offered  us\r\n\r\nNewfoundland - I hope it was not done cleverly. I should like to think that he  is\r\n\r\nnot just that dishonest but shall we say he has glossed over the manner in which\r\n\r\nthe  voting took place, whether in respect of the three alternatives, they  were\r\n\r\ngiven  the  chance to say yes or no in respect of each of them. But he  has  put\r\n\r\nforward the issue of the Cameroons.\r\n\r\nThe Cameroons, and I may be wrong here in my history, Mr Chairman, were a trust\r\n\r\nterritory  under  the  United  Nations and  it  could  be,  after  thorough  and\r\n\r\nexhaustive examination and various commissions going to the Cameroons, that they\r\n\r\ndecided  that  there  was no other alternative, because nobody  wanted  anything\r\n\r\nelse:  either the question of going into Nigeria or the question of  going  into\r\n\r\nthe Cameroons. There was never any demand for the right to say yes or no, it was\r\n\r\nnever  queried by anybody within the Cameroons if you would care to look at  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations report in that respect. It was put very frankly, Sir. But  here,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  being threatened is not that we are going to put the only two possible\r\n\r\nissues because they admit themselves through the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- they have said ad nauseam; to talk about radio or gramophone records, Sir,\r\n\r\nnowadays  is  really  to  bring people's minds to the  Prime  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nperformances on Radio Singapore - but he has said that if you ask 624,000 citizens\r\n\r\nwhat  type  of  merger  you  want,  according  to  him,  you  will  get  624,000\r\n\r\nalternatives. So, Sir, it is not a question - unless they are going to somersault again and I must confess, Sir, that I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  reached the stage where I do not believe that anything we say on this side\r\n\r\nof  the  House can convince them except perhaps the power to out-vote  them;  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  look  possible,  in view of the statement  made  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill - but  for  the  record  let us pin down  these  falsehoods.  There  are\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  P.A.P. 624,000 possible variations of  merger - one  for  each\r\n\r\ncitizen. So it is not that they are exhausted. Now, why do they refuse the right\r\n\r\nto say no? Why?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Finance said that he missed my lurid analogies of mistress and prostitute, of beating his mother, his wife or his daughter and\r\n\r\nhe  asked,  in sneering terms, whether calmer judgment has made me  realise  the\r\n\r\ninappropriateness - or  perhaps he used an abusive word, I  cannot  remember  them\r\n\r\nall - that  this was not appropriate. Mr Chairman, not at all, not at all.  These\r\n\r\nanalogies  likening  the  alternatives to the alternative  offered  of  being  a\r\n\r\nmistress or being a prostitute - the essential quality between all these analogies\r\n\r\nis  the  quality  of -  how shall I say it - unacceptability to the  normal,  decent\r\n\r\nperson; giving the alternative of one unacceptable alternative and another  that\r\n\r\nis  even  more  unacceptable. And it is far from inappropriate to say  that  the\r\n\r\npresent merger proposals are somewhat equivalent to offering us the position  of\r\n\r\na  mistress coming to my home, joining my board but she cannot have the  dignity\r\n\r\nand status of my bride. Nor is there so grave a discrepancy and so inappropriate\r\n\r\nthat  one  can complain about the interpretation that they put about  joining  a\r\n\r\nState  with the deprivation of our citizens of their citizenship being different\r\n\r\nfrom that of inviting us to be a prostitute. Mr Speaker, if they prefer, and it\r\n\r\nis  the  same to me, I have earlier said it is not fair to say to your daughter,\r\n\r\n\"You must marry A or B.\" She should have the chance to say yes or no to either.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we had the extraordinary performance - not extraordinary, one should become accustomed to this by now - of the Minister standing up and saying,\r\n\r\n\"This is a specific Bill,\" and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthree  sentences later saying, \"This is a general Bill for a specific  purpose,\"\r\n\r\nand  then  going on to say, \"It is a general Bill and why should not we  have  a\r\n\r\nspecific  referendum  thereunder?\" Mr Speaker, we all  know  that  general  pro\r\n\r\nvisions  apply in individual cases but they are general provisions because  they\r\n\r\nare intended for all cases that may be applicable thereafter. But he stated that\r\n\r\nthis  was a specific Bill and that is why it was inappropriate that there should\r\n\r\nbe only one question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to this Minister's statement on the 15th of May, 1962, to be found in column 309 of our Official Report from\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, and that is to show you that though this is supposed to  be  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  referendum Bill he admitted that the present clause 29 was in fact  for\r\n\r\nthe  specific purposes of dealing with the Communist threat on merger.  We  will\r\n\r\ncome to the Communist threat. But I want to use the exact words so that I should\r\n\r\nnot misquote him. Now, Mr Speaker, your question after he had quoted himself - he\r\n\r\nhas  a delightful habit of respecting himself and admiring himself so much  that\r\n\r\nhe  is always quoting himself. Now, Sir, he quoted himself over the whole column\r\n\r\nand then you asked him when he drew breath:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Chairman: May I now ask the Minister whether he has indicated, by his\r\n\r\nreading  of the extracts, that the New Clause (A) [that is, our clause 29]  has,\r\n\r\nin fact, been introduced to meet a situation of that nature in regard\r\n\r\nto a referendum on merger?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr  Goh Keng Swee: I would say, Mr Chairman, not generally, but in particular\r\n\r\nreference to the present situation,...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir,  what  does the Minister for Labour and Law say in  respect  of  that\r\n\r\nclause?  I  know  he  says all over the place - it is peppered with  his  protestations - that this is a general Bill.

After all, here are specific provisions in a general Bill,\r\n\r\ncall  it a hybrid Bill, not to use an offensive term, although a hybrid Bill  is\r\n\r\nknown  technically as meaning something else. Let us use that term here to  mean\r\n\r\none  that is a cross between a general and a specific. They have here clause  29\r\n\r\nwhich  is  specifically for merger. Could we not have also some provisions  with\r\n\r\nreference to saying 'yes' or 'no' and to the merger proposal question?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to the Member for Cairnhill. I must confess that I am so\r\n\r\nunaccustomed in this Chamber to hearing a Member of the Assembly referring  with\r\n\r\ncourtesy to a political opponent with whom he is in strong disagreement  that  I\r\n\r\ntrust that you will\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngrant  me the indulgence of expressing my surprise and my appreciation  for  the\r\n\r\ncourteous  manner  in  which he referred to me and his  acceptance  of  my  good\r\n\r\nintentions. Sir, he asked, why do I lead the Barisan Sosialis? Heaven forbid!  I\r\n\r\nthink  both the Member for Queenstown and I would deny that strenuously, Sir,  1\r\n\r\nam  sure they do not like to follow that. He has suggested it, and shall we say,\r\n\r\nif  I  might  change a little without changing the meaning. Why am  I  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  on this matter of having one question one issue?  I  must  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied that that would lead to the Communists rigging the merger proposals. 1\r\n\r\nthink that is what he said, Sir. Now, the question there is a fair one and it is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that  he did not elaborate on why and how the  rigging  would  take\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately we are in Committee, and it would be helpful - very helpful, Sir - if we could know. But I would like to ask this. I told him frankly that I am\r\n\r\nassociated with this amendment and with this attack on the Referendum Bill,  and\r\n\r\nwith  his  strenuous,  and  I  do  assure  him,  his  sincere  efforts  for  its\r\n\r\namelioration,  because we believe that it is essential for our welfare  and  the\r\n\r\nhealthy development of democracy that the people should be honestly dealt  with.\r\n\r\nIt is as simple as that. And if we deal dishonestly with them - those whom we seek\r\n\r\nto  attract  to the democratic way -  it would be a retrograde step and  it  would\r\n\r\ntake us a long time to recover from it. I would ask him, Sir, does he think that\r\n\r\nif  one  Question was put to the people, the question that was accepted by  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  it  being  that the merger proposals are the  first  step  which  are\r\n\r\nacceptable to the welfare of the people, is he then saying that he thinks they\r\n\r\nwould  reject  it? Because he says they would wreck it. If he does  think  that,\r\n\r\ndoes  he  think  that  the  majority  or our  624,000  people  would  be  acting\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  or  under compulsion? If voluntarily, Sir, surely it  is  the  very\r\n\r\nessence  of the democratic process that a man, no matter how humble,  no  matter\r\n\r\nhow ignorant, if he is a citizen\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof age and sane, should have the right to express his views. That is part of the\r\n\r\nstrength and the defects that we reach a healthy balance. Does he now deny  the\r\n\r\nright  of  the majority who do not believe in merger, according to him,  to  say\r\n\r\n\"no\"? If so, why, Sir? Because they are confused? Would the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nnot  admit that the only confusion of which we have any evidence so far  is  the\r\n\r\ncalculated  confusion created, perpetrated and maintained  by  the  P.A.P. with\r\n\r\nreference  to'  this  Penang  and Malacca bogey?  Does  he  know  of  any  other\r\n\r\nconfusion?  Yes,  Sir,  let me be fair. There is the confusion  of  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship. True. There is that and I know the Barisan did not like me  when  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  \"second-class  citizen\" was an inappropriate  phrase,  that  it  was\r\n\r\ndistinct  citizenship. But assuming, and I accept that is a  totally  inaccurate\r\n\r\nway  of describing it - distinct citizenship; let us say that there are people who\r\n\r\nbelieved  that, Sir, and who are merely confused, although, in so far as  I  can\r\n\r\nsee,  the major campaign is this humbug and hypocrisy that is being manufactured\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. in respect of Penang and Malacca. But let us say that it is  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  who talk of second-class citizenship. I will ask you this, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nRight, I am confused. I have swallowed hook, line and sinker this talk of second-class  citizenship. Am I therefore not entitled to vote, because I am  confused?\r\n\r\nHas  a man who is confused no right to vote? Since when has democracy sought  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  the  confused  and the not confused? How  many  of  those  opposite\r\n\r\nBenches  are  not confused? Or on the Back Benches? The Front Benches  know  not\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are  doing.  Oh! yes, the Back Benches will begin  to  wriggle  with\r\n\r\nembarrassment,  I  hope. So, Sir, I would ask the Member for Cairnhill.  He  has\r\n\r\nposed  a  fair  question, and he has the chance, and I would ask him, in  these\r\n\r\ncases  if  the  people would freely vote against the White Paper, are  they  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  do  so?  Surely he is not suggesting any  matter  of  coercion  or\r\n\r\ncompulsion?  It  is  the essence of democracy that no matter  how  confused,  or\r\n\r\nhumble or stupid a man may be, he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nis  entitled to say \"yes\" or \"no\" , and to make his choice. He says, and I think\r\n\r\nhe implies it, to have one question, one issue, would wreck the referendum - the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals. He did not indicate either what other question he had in mind.\r\n\r\nI  want  to say this to you, Mr Chairman. I  recognize that there can be  other\r\n\r\nquestions  -  legitimate  questions - and I want to say  to  myself,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nintransigent as regards one question, so long as the people have a right to  say\r\n\r\n\"yes\"  or  to say \"no\" to each. In the context of the merger proposals, we frame\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  because  it  seems to us that there  was  but  one  appropriate\r\n\r\nquestion, and that was the question posed by the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, you are not unaware of the accepted constitutional understanding of a referendum that it puts to the people something approved of by the\r\n\r\nLegislature  for  their confirmation and what has been approved  are  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals. The Opposition stand has been rejected and frankly,  from  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  standpoint, it does not seem appropriate . I  do  not,  for  one\r\n\r\nmoment,  believe   that  there is any milk of human  kindness,  or  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsportsmanship, or a sense of democracy or even a sense of decency on  the  Front\r\n\r\nBench  that would put the Opposition point of view to the people. You have heard\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance last night say proudly, \"What do you think the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis? A philanthropic organization that is going to help the Barisan Sosialis with\r\n\r\nits  point  of  view? Of course it is not.\" There is no understanding  of  these\r\n\r\nthings  on  the part of the Front Bench. This era of the P.A.P. is  an  era  of\r\n\r\ntragedy  which the people of Singapore will  remember for a  long time.  And  we\r\n\r\nare all praying that it will end, and that it will end quietly, and without much\r\n\r\nmore  damage to us. The sooner we bury them, Sir, the cleaner the air  will  be,\r\n\r\nand  the more scope there will be for democracy. So it is not the question  that\r\n\r\nthey are seeking to pose our question. I am\r\n\r\nAsking the Member for Cairnhill - since he posed a fair question - what question\r\n\r\nhas  he  in  mind  that  could  probably be  posed  which  would  frustrate  the\r\n\r\nmachinations of the Communists? Mr Chairman I want to ask you, Sir, it is not  a\r\n\r\nlittle\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfantastic to suggest that the Communists in Singapore could intrude and in fact,\r\n\r\ninfluence the voluntary act of voting of the majority of our 624,000 citizens? I\r\n\r\nwould say that is an absurdity. [Interruption] Oh, let us have an end to all\r\n\r\nthese falsehoods. He has been replied to. This is another Dr Goebbels - repeat\r\n\r\nand repeat like a foolish, worn-out gramophone record that is dusty, dirty,\r\n\r\nbankrupt and broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me return to the Member for Cairnhill, who has\r\n\r\nurged me to an effort at understanding and who has put a fair question which I\r\n\r\nam trying to deal with. I do ask what further question would he like'? Would he\r\n\r\nlike to indicate them? I would go so far as to say, Mr Chairman, that he has\r\n\r\nnot, in fact, dealt with the last limb of our amendment. The first one was that\r\n\r\nthere should be one question, the second is that there should be one issue, the\r\n\r\nlast part is that every elector shall be required to answer such question. He\r\n\r\ncan put each question. He can put each question with a 'yes' or 'no'. Would he\r\n\r\nlike to move that amendment or would he like to deal with the question as a\r\n\r\nwhole? I have not given up hope, as the Barisan seems to have given up hope,\r\n\r\nthat the S.P.A. would in fact dissociate themselves from a dishonest referendum.\r\n\r\nI have heard the Member for Cairnhill in Select Committee. You will remember,\r\n\r\nSir, that we were indebted to him for a conciliatory and constructive effort and\r\n\r\nI do hope that we will see no change of that stand in this Assembly now. I would\r\n\r\ninquire whether the Member for Cairnhill is, in fact, interested in supporting\r\n\r\nthat part of the amendment which requests that there should be an answer of\r\n\r\n\"yes\" or \"no\" to the question, although he objects to the single question and\r\n\r\nthe single issue aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much\r\n\r\nalready has been debated, discussed, argued from all parties in Singapore on\r\n\r\nwhether there should be one simple straightforward question in the coming\r\n\r\nreferendum. We have listened to all the twists and turns and arguments put\r\n\r\nforward by the Government and I do not wish to repeat here the same old\r\n\r\narguments. But what I must do now is to explode one of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npoints raised by the Minister for Finance, which, on the face of it, looks very\r\n\r\nconvincing. In  his  speech the Minister for Finance has said  that  under  the\r\n\r\nOpposition's  united  amendment, the Government can still ask:  \"Do  you  prefer\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  to White Paper merger?\" I think, Sir, if  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared to be dishonest and to go to any lengths, however much we tie  them  up\r\n\r\nin  Bills, Ordinances and by-laws, they still can wriggle out to suit their  own\r\n\r\nconvenience. However, I wish today to quote from a book written by J. F. S. Ross\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Assembly  Library called \"Elections and Electors\".  Commenting  on  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, at page 23 of his book, Mr Ross said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The essence of the referendum, of course, is that it puts a question to the\r\n\r\ngeneral body of citizens. Now, any fool can ask a question, but to ask the right\r\n\r\nquestion,  and  to ask it in the right way, is quite another matter.  Experience\r\n\r\nshows  that large numbers of people will misunderstand even simple questions  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  the  least chance. It needs great skill and care  to  make  questions\r\n\r\nfoolproof.  Moreover  to  ask  questions on controversial  issues  requires,  in\r\n\r\naddition, a high standard of integrity; for if the questioner is unscrupulous he\r\n\r\nmay so word the question as either deliberately to mislead the answerer, or else\r\n\r\nto  suggest to him a particular response that the questioner desires to receive.\r\n\r\nIn  short,  the referendum offers too many opportunities of misunderstanding  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, and of manipulation on the other, to permit of its acceptance  as\r\n\r\ngenerally suitable for purposes of government. Further, even if we could be sure\r\n\r\nof putting impeccable questions and receiving faultless answers, we should still\r\n\r\nhave  to  confine  the  use of the referendum to comparatively  few  and  simple\r\n\r\nissues.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing to prevent the Government, if it so\r\n\r\ndesires,  from  asking any question. They can have a referendum to  ask  such  a\r\n\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\"Do you prefer an S.P.A. Government to a P.A.P. Government?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in another book by C. S. Emden, \"The People and the Constitution\", that\r\n\r\nhe  mentions  that  in  1945,  Churchill, at the  conclusion  of  his  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment, suggested a referendum to authorise the maintenance of the  existing\r\n\r\nParliament until the end of the war against Japan. This referendum was not  held\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  opposition  of the Labour and  Liberal  Parties.  Now  if  Mr\r\n\r\nChurchill in those days had insisted\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat the referendum should be held, he had two ways out. If he wanted to hold an\r\n\r\nhonest referendum he would put the question simply by asking for a simple  'yes'\r\n\r\nor  'no'. He would frame the question: \"Do you agree that the present Parliament\r\n\r\nshould  continue  until the end of the war with Japan?\" What  he  wanted  was  a\r\n\r\nsimple 'yes' or 'no'. But if Mr Churchill were politically bankrupt, but  still\r\n\r\nwanted  to  cling to power and hold a dishonest referendum, he  could  pose  two\r\n\r\nalternatives: \"Do you want Churchill to govern the country?\" and  \"Do  you  want\r\n\r\nChamberlain  to come back to power?\", or as the Minister for Finance  said  just\r\n\r\nnow: \"Do you prefer a Hitler or a Mussolini to Mr Churchill?\" Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  shows  that a referendum can always be manipulated. That is  why  we  have\r\n\r\nsupported the amendment to clause 5 so as to minimise the risk of the referendum\r\n\r\nbeing manipulated. That is why we have thought that the question to be asked  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  referendum should be a simple straightforward question requiring  a\r\n\r\nsimple answer - 'yes' or 'no'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the amendment put forward by the three Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nis  accepted  by Government, we believe there will be less room for unscrupulous\r\n\r\ngovernments,  not  only  now, but also in the future, to  manipulate  referenda.\r\n\r\nHowever, on this occasion, I doubt whether we can make this Government see  some\r\n\r\nsense. It is prepared to go against the people and to dishonour its pledges. You\r\n\r\nremember, I mentioned once in this Assembly that the Deputy Prime Minister wrote\r\n\r\nto the Opposition Parties on 6th September, 1961, the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There has not been and there will not be any secret deal between the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government and the Singapore Government. The agreement in  principle\r\n\r\non  the  two points I have enunciated has been published. When the deliberations\r\n\r\nof  the Working Party are completed and agreement is reached, they will also  be\r\n\r\npublished. The people can then either accept or reject them.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the words are very clear, unequivocal and unambiguous.  \"The\r\n\r\npeople can either accept or reject them\", which means the White Paper proposals.\r\n\r\nTo accept means to say yes and to reject is to say no. The Deputy Prime\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMinister  has given a pledge to all Opposition Parties and the contents  of\r\n\r\nhis letter could be translated as this: Do you want the White Paper - yes  or\r\n\r\nno?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech yesterday and today has\r\n\r\nconfirmed  the  pledge and he has given reasons why his  Government  is  dis\r\n\r\nhonouring  the  pledge.  Sir, our analysis, in  this  instance,  happens  to\r\n\r\ncoincide incidentally  with the Member for Cairnhill's analysis just now.  Why  does  Government  want  to dishonour its pledge? At yesterday's debate, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance remarked that it was because the Barisan Sosialis  had  put  up\r\n\r\nproposals  for  a  different type of merger. Now, Sir,  this  is  merely  an\r\n\r\nexcuse.  This  type of argument does not hold ground, firstly,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is not the only Opposition to the White Paper proposals. Secondly,\r\n\r\nit  has claimed that the P.A.P. had distorted its intentions. Thirdly,  when\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper was put up for debate, the Barisan Sosialis' stand in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly was clearly one of automatic conversion of Singapore citizens  into\r\n\r\nFederal citizens.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has been agreed between the Singapore and the Federa\r\n\r\ntion  Governments as a form of constitutional proposals. As far as we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  informed,  there save been no other types of merger  proposals  other\r\n\r\nthan the White Paper merger proposals. As far as we know, no other types of\r\n\r\nmerger proposals have been discussed between the two Governments.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ask the Government, \"Has the Federation Government said that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  choose any type of merger it wants?\" We hope the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  give  an  answer. Sir, why does the Government want to  dishonour  its\r\n\r\npledge  which  it has given in speeches by the Prime Minister  in  July  and August 1961, and in a letter sent to Opposition Parties by the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister? We feel that the Government has changed its mind, because  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  stages  of the talks with the Federation, the P.A.P.  Government  was\r\n\r\nconfident  that  its proposals could be acceptable to the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This  confidence  was based on the premise  that  the  people  will\r\n\r\nswallow the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbait  of  the so-called autonomy in education and labour. Therefore, the  Government  committed  itself not only to a referendum but also to  a  straightforward\r\n\r\nquestion  with  a 'yes' or 'no' answer. However, later, the situation  developed\r\n\r\nrapidly.  The  people did not swallow the bait but instead asked  for  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion.  Therefore,  the  Government was having  second  thoughts  when  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  came  up for Second Reading. The people  had  known,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had known itself that it will lose in a straightforward  and  honest\r\n\r\nreferendum.  However,  the  Government after having committed  itself  to  a  referendum  must  find a way out. This was found by the skilful and artful  manipulation  of  putting a second alternative which will be worse than  the  original\r\n\r\nproposal. Faced with two bad alternatives the voters will have to abstain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing now which this Government is not prepared to do, lt is\r\n\r\nalready politically bankrupt, and it makes no difference whether one is bankrupt\r\n\r\nonce  or  bankrupt  ten times. The Government can argue that  it  has  not  gone\r\n\r\nagainst  its pledge. It can say, as it had said in the Radio forum,  \"You  still\r\n\r\ncan  reject  the White Paper by voting for the second alternative,  and  if  you\r\n\r\ncannot make up your mind, don't worry, the Government will do it for you.\" As  I\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now, it Churchill wants to be politically dishonest, he  can  always\r\n\r\nsay,  \"If you don't want me to be the Prime Minister for another few years, then\r\n\r\nyou  can  vote Chamberlain in.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, this is all twisted logic  and\r\n\r\ndialectics.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not feel that we should waste the time any more of this House. We\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through and made countless arguments in debates and forums  on  this\r\n\r\nextremely important issue. Both the Government and Opposition Parties have  more\r\n\r\nor  less exhausted all the arguments and I am convinced that nothing will change\r\n\r\nthe  Government stand. However, it is important for us to know which side of the\r\n\r\narguments  has been more convincing and acceptable to the people. The best  way,\r\n\r\nSit, -is to decide in a by-election. I will resign from the seat of Hong Lim  if\r\n\r\nGovernment  gives us two undertakings; one, not to force through the  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill in its present form\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuntil  the  verdict of the people is obtained: two, not to delay or to  postpone\r\n\r\nthe  by-election  sine die but to have polling day on or before  31st  of  July,\r\n\r\n1962. Mr, speaker, Sir, I will not try to embarrass the Front Benches of the Government by challenging them to resign one seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will fight on two simple issues - clause 5 and clause 29; that is the question to be put and the blank votes.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government  wins,  I say that the people agree  with  the  Government's\r\n\r\narguments  but  if the Government loses, then the Government should  accept  the\r\n\r\nOpposition stand. Sir, there are no personal feelings or rancour in this  offer.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  acting without due consideration and without realising  my  responsi\r\n\r\nbilities  as an Assemblyman of this House. However, on clause 5 hinges the  fate\r\n\r\nand the destiny of our political and constitutional future and, therefore, it is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the  people must give their verdict before  we  press  on.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the destiny of the country is at stake and it all hinges on clause\r\n\r\n5 and clause 29. I ask the Government, why not let the free and true will of the\r\n\r\npeople he the judge of the undemocratic clauses in the Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, one outstanding feature of today's debate is that after the Opposition  has\r\n\r\nput  up  so many meritorious arguments to back up their stand on this amendment,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has said nothing and made no reply whatsoever to  these  various\r\n\r\narguments.

The first is that the Opposition hopes that by this amendment\r\n\r\nto  limit  or  restrict the Government on its questions in the  referendum,  and\r\n\r\nthereby  to frustrate the P.A.P. Command Paper No. 33 type of merger.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nhe says that even if this amendment was accepted and approved by this House, the\r\n\r\nGovernment would still be able to rig a referendum because he quoted that  under\r\n\r\nthe  new circumstances - the circumstances in which the amendment applies - it would\r\n\r\nbe  possible for the Government to pose a question thus: \"Do you prefer complete\r\n\r\nmerger or Command Paper No. 33 P.A.P. type of merger?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, this kind of attitude reflects only the machiavellian machina\r\n\r\ntions behind the brain of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we all understand that a referendum is a procedure\r\n\r\nfor  the  ascertainment of the views of the people - the electorate - on matters  of\r\n\r\nnational  importance. Now, we see very clearly that, insofar as  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nconcerned, a referendum is not for the purpose of ascertaining the views of  the\r\n\r\npeople but to sustain them in office and for that they are even prepared  to  go\r\n\r\nto  the  extent  of spending $400,000 on a referendum just for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nhaving one over the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nelectorate  by  posing a question in which the electorate has  Hobson's  choice.\r\n\r\nThat was the Minister for Finance. He thought he was clever, but I think that is\r\n\r\nmore machiavellian machination than cleverness, that to have one over the people\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of sustaining one's own political longevity is  certainly  not\r\n\r\nclever. It is either abusing or cheating. He then went on to quote at length the\r\n\r\nwords  of  the Member for Anson. He said that the Opposition stand was  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  prepared  to  accept  complete merger and in his usual  machiavellian  and\r\n\r\ncunning  way  he  distorts complete merger as something akin to the  Malacca  or\r\n\r\nPenang type of merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think our stand on the matter has been very clearly\r\n\r\nput  up by the Member for Anson who has gone to great lengths to quote the  full\r\n\r\npart  of  our stand, that is, insofar as we are concerned, complete  merger  can\r\n\r\nmean  only one thing - the genuine reunification of the territories and the people\r\n\r\nresulting  in  automatic  conversion in citizenship  and  in  Singapore  getting\r\n\r\nproportional representation in the Federal Parliament. The Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nkeeps  on harping on his theme that we can get only what the other eleven States\r\n\r\ngot.  But  the  Prime Minister himself at the Radio Forum,  during  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmoments  when  he thought he was clever, stated that the various States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya got into the Federation at different levels. For  instance,\r\n\r\nhe  said  that Pahang got in on better terms than Johore and Johore  got  in  on\r\n\r\nbetter  terms  than Penang or Malacca. And all this business of  getting  in  on\r\n\r\ndifferent  terms  or  better terms took place before  Merdeka  Day.  The  proper\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the  Federation  Constitution that  should  apply  would  be  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for these various States to get in before Merdeka. But, Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  now  near  Merdeka  Day. We are, in fact, more than five  years  away  from\r\n\r\nMerdeka Day, and therefore any new State that should get into the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  must get in under the provisions of the section of the Constitution  which  provides for the admission of new States, that particular section  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal Constitution that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npermits  negotiations to be made between the various parties  on  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  We  are  not asking very much, Sir. We are asking  only  for  the  safe\r\n\r\nguarding  of the democratic and political rights of the people of Singapore  who\r\n\r\nhave  already acquired them. There is no reason why they should be lost or given\r\n\r\nup; not even for saving the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really no merit in the arguments put up by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nIf  the Minister for Finance is sincere, let him put up the stand of the Barisan\r\n\r\nin  the  referendum. Let him not just put up something which  he  has  not  even\r\n\r\ndiscussed,  nor a White Paper produced, nor a full debate taken  place  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, if he is really going to be sincere about giving the people a choice, and\r\n\r\nnot  Hobson's choice, it is for him to debate the Barisan stand and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nmerger in this House fully, so that in the process of that debate the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  understand  the implications of  the  Barisan  stand,  and  subsequently  will  be persuaded by the Barisan Sosialis that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nstand is the correct stand and then they will vote for it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister in his speech yesterday also did not touch upon the various arguments put forward by the Opposition. He only harped on one\r\n\r\npoint - that the Referendum Bill is a general Referendum Bill and therefore it  is\r\n\r\nridiculous  to restrict the Government to one question. First I will  deal  with\r\n\r\nthis aspect of his argument. It is my contention, Sir, that a referendum is only\r\n\r\nheld  when there is a matter of national importance. Only a feebleminded Cabinet\r\n\r\nwould  actually hold a referendum at the cost of $400,000 of public money simply\r\n\r\nfor  the ascertainment of whether one should smoke a cigarette or a pipe. If the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government did that, it would be an indication, not only of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership's  political  bankruptcy,  but  also  of  its  feeble-mindedness  and\r\n\r\nsenility, a sure indication that it is better off in the grave.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the Deputy Prime Minister, in trying to justify himself that the Assembly should not limit or\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nrestrict  the  Government in the posing of questions in the  referendum,  spoke\r\n\r\nlightly  and  in  a light vein, and quoted, for example, that  if  we  were  all\r\n\r\nthirsty -   and  he suddenly became kindhearted and offered us a drink - what  drink\r\n\r\nwould we have? Granted if the bona fides of the Deputy Prime Minister were good,\r\n\r\nif  he  had offered me that drink in his private and personal capacity, I  would\r\n\r\ncertainly accept it from him. But, Sir, that premise cannot hold for the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  bona  fides of the P.A.P. are no good. The intention of the  P.A.P. is  no\r\n\r\ngood.  How  can the people accept a drink from a Government whom they know  will\r\n\r\nmost certainly serve them poison? Even if they are thirsty, it is better to  die\r\n\r\nof thirst, because it takes longer to die of thirst, and in the period of dying,\r\n\r\nrain  might always come, than to die by poison, when one goes off like a  light.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what the P.A.P. leadership has in mind for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Sir, even if the P.A.P. insists upon calling this Bill, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Referendum Bill, a general Bill, and to make  provisions  so\r\n\r\nthat  the Bill becomes not unnecessarily restrictive, it should still allow  the\r\n\r\nvoters  a choice. Even if the Deputy Prime Minister was good and honest  in  his\r\n\r\nintentions, when he offered Coca Cola, or Pepsi Cola or Green Spot - Mr Mammen, I\r\n\r\nam  just  quoting these various trade names out of convenience. I  by  no  means\r\n\r\nindicate  that I own any shares in them. Even if the Deputy Prime  Minister  had\r\n\r\ngood  intentions to offer thirsty people drinks like that, surely he should have\r\n\r\nthe same good intentions to allow people to say \"no\". People may be allergic  to\r\n\r\nCoca cola, people may be allergic to Pepsi Cola, and if the range of drinks that\r\n\r\nis  offered is unlimited, then, perhaps, one can insist on a definite \"yes\". But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s offer is limited. It is limited down to two choices - the devil  and\r\n\r\nthe deep sea. Under those circumstances clause 29, which permits blank votes and\r\n\r\nuncertain votes to be in favour of the Government, will surely bring in  a  neat\r\n\r\nprofit for the Government - a big crop of abstaining votes, because no man would\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nchoose the devil or the deep sea, when the alternative to live in prosperity and\r\n\r\nhappiness is there.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since none of the other Ministers have spoken yet, it is not possible for me\r\n\r\nto  remark on their exceptional performances in this House. But I notice,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson was speaking earlier, the Minister for Health  and  Law\r\n\r\ninterrupted to say that when he advised the people of Singapore not  to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  poll  in  order  to show disgust for the P.A.P., it was  something  legal. Perhaps  it may be considered legal in so far as income tax avoidance is  legal\r\n\r\nand  income tax evasion is illegal. But then the Minister for Heath and Law had\r\n\r\nmuch  deeper implications when he gave that advice. I will only refer  to  this\r\n\r\nin  passing, Sir. Clause 21 subclause (8) provides that anybody who has  failed\r\n\r\nto  vote  and  who, under subclause (7) is unable to give satisfactory  reason\r\n\r\nfor  his  failure to go to the poll will have his name struck off the list  and\r\n\r\nhis  name  will only reappear in the revised version of the electoral  roll.  I\r\n\r\nknow  what  the Minister for Health and Law is thinking about. He  is  thinking\r\n\r\nthat  should the Barisan Sosialis advise the people to do such a thing, in  one\r\n\r\nfell  stroke  he  would be able to get the Barisan supporters and  perhaps  the Barisan  candidates off the electoral roll and refuse to revise  the  electoral\r\n\r\nroll,  as  we  have seen in Hong Lim and then subsequently having  an  election\r\n\r\nwith  the  Barisan Sosialis members and supporters on the electoral  roil.  The Minister for Health and Law sometimes exhibits shrewdness. Perhaps it  may  not\r\n\r\nbe  shrewdness really on his part. Perhaps he was sincere when he  cracked  the\r\n\r\njoke.  Perhaps  he has not thought about this matter that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncan  be  fixed legally in a way like this. Now I think he understands. And  now\r\n\r\nhe knows - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What a clever man!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - that these\r\n\r\nthings can be done.

The essence of our stand is  that  all\r\n\r\nour  citizens must have their citizenship automatically converted and that there\r\n\r\nmust be proportional representation in Parliament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is prepared to accept that, we are prepared to go to the\r\n\r\nmasses and to persuade them that our stand is the correct stand and that, having\r\n\r\naccepted  that, we would want to have a general election so that the people  can\r\n\r\nchoose afresh a new Party to represent them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill before the House is the\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum Bill which has been presented to the House for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof a referendum on merger. Naturally, if it is a Bill for a number of referenda,\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  should, as far as possible, be for general application,  and  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  rise  to  oppose the amendment proposed by  the  Members  for  Anson,\r\n\r\nQueenstown and Hong Lim whereby they propose the insertion of a new paragraph to\r\n\r\nclause 5 of the Bill to limit the question that is to be put to electors in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum to just one single question so that the answers may be just a yes  or\r\n\r\na no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we concede that the Opposition Members as represented by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  the  Workers'  Party  and  the United  People's  Party,  have  quoted\r\n\r\nprecedents  of  referenda held in various countries where  there  was  just  one\r\n\r\nquestion  that was put to the people. But that does not necessarily  imply  that\r\n\r\nevery  referendum should be with one single question. We have, in fact,  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side quoted good precedents of countries where referenda  have  been\r\n\r\nheld  in  which more than one question was put to the electorate in the case  of\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand and more especially in the case of Newfoundland and the  Cameroons,\r\n\r\nthe last of which was, in fact, conducted by an impartial\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nworld  organisation - the United Nations. My colleague, the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nhas  very  ably drawn the attention of this House to the fact that in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  proposed referendum which we shall taco in Singapore  there  are  two\r\n\r\ncases:\r\n\r\nthat  is, the referenda held in Newfoundland and in the Cameroons, in these  two\r\n\r\neases, the issues were similar to the issue which we face - that of merger of one\r\n\r\ncountry  with  another.  Therefore, Sir, it  is  possible  to  pose  alternative\r\n\r\nquestions for: the people to decide which they would prefer - A or B, or even C\r\n\r\nor  D.  There is no necessity for the Government to tie its hands. In  case  the\r\n\r\nissue that is to be decided at the referendum requires one question, so shall it\r\n\r\nbe  posed. But where it may be necessary to put more than one question, then  it\r\n\r\nis up to the Government to put two or more questions to the electorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the last Member who spoke in this House, the Member for Nee Soon,\r\n\r\nargued against himself. The amendment wants to limit the referendum to just  one\r\n\r\nquestion. What the Barisan Sosialis, the Workers' Party and the United  People's\r\n\r\nParty  object  to  is  the possibility of the Government posing  more  than  one\r\n\r\nquestion and the second question would put them in a spot. Before the Member for\r\n\r\nNee  Soon  sat down, he said the Barisan Sosialis would be quite happy  to  have\r\n\r\nmore  than one question, provided the second question would be framed in  accord\r\n\r\nance  with  their  wishes. So the amendment before this House  was  put  forward\r\n\r\nbecause they were afraid that the Government would put the second alternative to\r\n\r\nthe  people  where  merger is concerned. Their case for one  question  therefore\r\n\r\nfalls  flat.  They will be quite happy to have the second question  put  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  but it should be framed in accordance with their wishes.  Now  that\r\n\r\nthe Government will not do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>8.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the statements made by the Workers' Party as represented by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  the  statements made by the Member for  Queenstown  as  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Barisan Sosialis and again by the Member for Thomson -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwhen  they mentioned the two unacceptable alternatives that would be put to  the\r\n\r\npeople - revealed the true character of this amendment. All this while,  Sir, the\r\n\r\ndiscussion has centred on the fact that when this Referendum Bill is passed, the\r\n\r\nfirst  referendum to be held in Singapore would be on merger. The first question\r\n\r\nwould  be  in  respect of the motion on the White Paper passed by this  Assembly\r\n\r\nnem. con.  with  Members of the Workers' Party, the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  People's Party not having the courage to vote against the motion and  to\r\n\r\nvote  against merger, but by taking the coward's way out, by walking out of  the\r\n\r\nChamber.  The White Paper on merger, Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961, will  be  placed\r\n\r\nbefore  the  electorate. Assuming that these proposals are unacceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, the Workers' Party and the United People's  Party,  the  next\r\n\r\nquestion  which  we want to put would be that of complete merger,  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger,  merger  where Singapore would be a member of the  Federation  on  equal\r\n\r\nterms,  like any one of the other 11 States - no more and no less - with no autonomy\r\n\r\nfor  education  and  labour, and where one half of Singapore citizens  would  be\r\n\r\ndisfranchised  because they were not born in Singapore and they would  therefore\r\n\r\nhave  to  reapply  before they can hope to be registered as  citizens,  if  they\r\n\r\nqualify.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, however much the Barisan Sosialis may say till they are blue in the face,\r\n\r\nthat  was what they wanted and although for this amendment, the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  the Workers' Party on the left and the United People's Party on the right,\r\n\r\nboth  their  representatives at the radio forum told the Barisan Sosialis  where\r\n\r\nthe fatal mistake was and that it should have been withdrawn. But no, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill  put  that to the people, and that is what the Barisan Sosialis stood  for,\r\n\r\ntill they realised the catastrophic mistake made. That is why they fear question\r\n\r\nNo.  2.  We  shall not change question No. 2 to be of the type that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis would like to have worded in the referendum paper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon):</b> You want to twist.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We do not twist, but we put you on the spot because we want\r\n\r\nyou  to  stand by what you have said. And this is where it is most revealing - the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown, before he sat down yesterday, said, \"the two  questions\r\n\r\nthat would be posed to the people\" (mind you, the people) should really read  as\r\n\r\n\"the two questions that would be posed would amount to death and hanging not  to\r\n\r\nthe  people or to anyone but to the Barisan Sosialis.\" The Member for  Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nused  another terminology \"to choose between the devil and the deep  sea\".  Yes,\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper on merger would be the \"death and the devil\" for  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. The question on complete merger would be hanging and the deep sea  for\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis and not for the people and the citizens of Singapore.  So\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis have revealed their true nature - how the  White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nmerger  would  mean  death and the devil to the Barisan Sosialis,  and  how  the\r\n\r\nquestion for a complete merger, when put in the referendum paper, would  be  the\r\n\r\nhanging of the Barisan Sosialis and the deep blue sea for them to drown in.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I say that the amendment proposed holds no water; that, in\r\n\r\nfact, they have argued against themselves, and that the purpose of the amendment\r\n\r\nis  a  mischievous one in order that the merger issue will be confused. We  only\r\n\r\nsay  that  the true stand of the Barisan Sosialis has always been \"not  merger\".\r\n\r\nAll they want is a continuation of colonial rule under the British with internal\r\n\r\nself-government.  And if the Member for Choa Chu Kang does not  know  what  that\r\n\r\nmeans,  it  means  being colonial subjects, proud to be under  the  British  but\r\n\r\nashamed  to  be independent and free Malayans. But they loudly claim  toat  they\r\n\r\naccept merger in principle, Malaysia in principle, everything in principle.  But\r\n\r\nbehind the facade, all that they are interested in is to destroy the people  and\r\n\r\nthe  country. It is useless for the Barisan Sosialis to pretend that they  stand\r\n\r\nfor  merger and reunification, when their heartland is in Indonesia. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  opened his big wide mouth and has been rapped.

They  quoted\r\n\r\nexamples from the Jamaican referendum, the Australian referendum and the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nreferenda held in Switzerland, France and so on.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was what the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson said on the 8th May in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, [Official Report No. 3, col. 113]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, in so far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no country that I\r\n\r\nknow  of which does not, in fact, require that the issues in a referendum should\r\n\r\nbe  formed  in  a  single  question  containing  a  single  issue  requiring  an\r\n\r\naffirmative yes or no.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee, the Minister for Health and Law quoted instances\r\n\r\nwhere  more  than one question had been asked. For the record, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nquote  the  Licensing (Amendment) Act of 1948 of New Zealand,  under  which  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  was held on the question of the hours for the sale of  liquor.  That\r\n\r\nwas  sometime  in  1949. In that referendum, about four or five  questions  were\r\n\r\nasked.  There  are  a  few more instances, but to the knowledge  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  these  instances may be and actually had been considered  to  be  on\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  lesser importance. But let us take the case of Newfoundland  where\r\n\r\nthey had a similar problem such as ours, that is, a constitutional problem. This\r\n\r\nprecedent is more appropriate for our purpose. There were three questions  which\r\n\r\nwere posed for that\r\n\r\nReferendum:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do we wish to continue as we were in a Colony?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Do we wish the Colonial Government to be restored?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Do you wish to join the Canadian Confederation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one more instance of a referendum held in the French Cameroons.\r\n\r\nThere  were two ballot boxes - one box for those who wish to join Algiers and  the\r\n\r\nother  box  for  those  who  wish to join the French  Cameroons.  There  was  no\r\n\r\nprovision  for  saying  \"No\"  to  any of these proposals.  The  only  thing  the\r\n\r\nelectorate could have done was not to have gone to the polls.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we had discussed in the Select Committee a possible question\r\n\r\nin  a  referendum  about the Malay language becoming the official  language.  In\r\n\r\nfact, there will be no one who will oppose the national language becoming\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe official language. But there may be different views as to when to make Malay\r\n\r\nthe  official language. There may be some people who will hold the view that  we\r\n\r\nshould make Malay the official language within five years. Some other people may\r\n\r\nsay  within  7  years,  yet some others may say within  10  years.

You will see the point that if there is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be only one question, there must be art affirmative yes or no to  that\r\n\r\nquestion. There are precedents which have been quoted by the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nbut  where  there are two or more questions posed to the electorate, as  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Newfoundland and the Cameroons, it is essential that there  should  be\r\n\r\nonly  one  affirmative  reply. We have to get the  electors  to  indicate  their\r\n\r\nchoice. If there are three questions, they can strike out two and there is  only\r\n\r\none  answer.  If  there are five or more questions, or six questions,  they  can\r\n\r\nleave  one  question  and  strike out all the others. All  the  precedents  also\r\n\r\nestablish this point. Then how can the Opposition, that is the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand the Member for Anson, accuse us that we are undemocratic?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And the U.P.P.

If two or more\r\n\r\nquestions  are posed, you are given a choice to say no to any question.  As  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson has asked me to refer to the merger problem, we will take  the\r\n\r\nmerger referendum. We pose both the proposals - the White Paper proposals and  the\r\n\r\nproposal  of complete merger. If you do not like the White Paper proposals,  you\r\n\r\ncan  say  no and strike it out and vote for the complete merger. If you  do  not\r\n\r\nlike  complete merger, say no to the complete merger and accept the White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals. I would say in the current merger referendum what is going to be done\r\n\r\nis  not the ascertainment of principle on merger because nobody has said he does\r\n\r\nnot  want merger. Nobody has opposed merger. Everybody has said that he  accepts\r\n\r\nthe principle of merger. Then the referendum is going to be on the ascertainment\r\n\r\nof  the mode and manner or, in other words, the details of merger. Therefore, as\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  ascertain the views of the people on the mode and manner  of, the\r\n\r\nreunification  of both territories, we have no other alternative  than  to  pose\r\n\r\nmore  than one question to the electorate and it is for the electorate to choose\r\n\r\nbetween  the  alternatives put before them. If they  do  not  like  one  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals, as I have said, they can strike it out and vote for the other one.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, a few moments ago two Ministers from the Government side rose to  speak against the amendment moved by this side of the House. After listening\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Education. I have the feeling that whatever he has said does\r\n\r\nnot  merit any reply because what he has said can be described by one proverb - he\r\n\r\nwas just picking up what was said by others.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance seems to represent the Government when he made an important speech on the amendment we moved. However, his arguments are very\r\n\r\nstrange, and I cannot in any way agree with any one of them. Now, I want\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto lock from several angles at the inaccurate and wrong arguments put forward by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance in relation to the amendment that has been  moved.  In\r\n\r\nthe  first place, our contention to have only one question during the referendum\r\n\r\nhad been very clearly explained by the Member for Anson with regard to its legal\r\n\r\naspect.  He  quoted examples of referenda held in various Countries.  Our  Party\r\n\r\nChairman  has  also pointed out many points and given several examples  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  the  National  Referendum Bill put forward by the Government  is  actually\r\n\r\nintended for the matter relating to merger between Singapore and Malaya.  A  few\r\n\r\nmoments  ago  the  Member for Hong Lim pointed out very  clearly  and  correctly\r\n\r\ncertain  examples and legal points and arguments to show that  if  the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum does not pose one question only, but instead poses several questions,\r\n\r\nthen  there  will be the possibility that the Government will take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe multiple questions to manipulate the referendum, so that it will not achieve\r\n\r\nthe  objectives of finding out the actual views of the electorate as to  whether\r\n\r\nor not they agree with the policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point that I wish to stress, and that is our contention that we\r\n\r\nshould  have  only one question. This contention is being made now  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has all along been trying to distort the stand of the Opposition  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter of merger. From the speech of the Minister for Finance, we  come  to\r\n\r\nknow  that the Government has not much confidence in its own White Paper merger.\r\n\r\nNo  matter how much publicity the Government gives and how much propaganda  work\r\n\r\nit  carries out regarding its form of merger, or however much it says about  the\r\n\r\nmerger, or however well it speaks of its merger proposals as being able to bring\r\n\r\nan  independent status, the status of Federal national, Malaysian passports, and\r\n\r\nautonomy  in Education and Labour for the people of Singapore, I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that, if there are actually so many good points about its proposals,\r\n\r\nhow  is it that it does not have the guts and courage to frame a simple question\r\n\r\non this matter and put\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nit to the people for their decision? The Minister for Finance talks about posing\r\n\r\nthe  question of complete merger as another alternative for the decision of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This  goes  to  show that the P.A.P. know  full  well  that  their  own\r\n\r\nconstitutional  arrangements are unacceptable to anybody  and,  therefore,  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  find  a way out from their present predicament, and that  is  why  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance has brought up the matter regarding the posing of complete\r\n\r\nmerger  as a question for the decision of the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, on  this\r\n\r\npoint,  I  must  reiterate and stress again and again that we  are  against  the\r\n\r\nsecond alternative to be put to the people for a decision, because in the  first\r\n\r\nplace, the posing of the so-called second alternative is not in keeping with the\r\n\r\nprinciple. All along we have been pointing out that the matter of merger is  not\r\n\r\na  question  of  party struggle. It is not a matter of controversy  between  two\r\n\r\nParties or any number of Parties. We have also pointed out that this question of\r\n\r\nmerger  should  not  be one which should be fought between the  P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  or any other Party. The main point is: are the constitutional proposals\r\n\r\nin  keeping with the interests of all the people of Singapore? That is the  crux\r\n\r\nof the whole matter.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wish to pose to the people the stand and contention of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  then the P.A.P. are treating the merger  issue  as  a  party\r\n\r\nissue.  It is wrong in principle. If we were in the Government dealing with  the\r\n\r\nmerger  matter,  we would not be afraid to put our stand and contention  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  for  their endorsement or rejection. That is a very important principle.\r\n\r\nThe  Government does not have the courage to put to the people its own  proposal\r\n\r\nand  find out from them whether they want it or not. It would be wrong  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  put several questions to confuse the people. We  are  very  much\r\n\r\nagainst this behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said that since the Barisan Sosialis want complete merger the question of complete merger could be posed to the people for\r\n\r\ntheir decision. There is nothing wrong about it, he says. What I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like to emphasise here regarding this point is that the matter  regarding\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger,  as  put  forward by the Minister  for  Finance,  is  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent from the complete merger we have in our own minds. He tries to explain\r\n\r\nthat the complete merger we have in mind will mean that some 324,000 citizens in\r\n\r\nSingapore will lose their citizenship rights after complete merger. He  explains\r\n\r\nthat  our contention for compete merger will mean that we are prepared to accept\r\n\r\nthe  education  and  labour  policies  of  the  Federation  Government.  Such  a\r\n\r\ndistortion  of the stand of the Barisan Sosialis is an example of the  behaviour\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. which is well-known to everybody. According to our definition,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  read  a  few passages from an article of the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nregarding the meaning of complete merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Therefore, I have  allowed\r\n\r\npassing reference to these matters, but not a detailed debate on them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the quotation I am going to make here is taken from a  speech\r\n\r\nwhich  has not been made use of by the Chairman of our Party.

This is not a new line. This article was published on the  28th  of\r\n\r\nAugust,  1961, in a booklet containing a statement on merger. Apart from dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the question of citizenship and proportionate representation we point  out\r\n\r\nin  this article, as a matter of fact, that the present Right-wing Government in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation has many policies which are unacceptable to us. This  Government\r\n\r\nhas  very close relationship and association with foreign capitalists and it has\r\n\r\nsigned an agreement with the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBritish  Government  whereby  our countries will  have  bases  for  the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary forces.

Sir, if the Minister for Finance has not brought out his arguments\r\n\r\nregarding the stand of the Barisan Sosialis and suggest that our stand  will  be\r\n\r\nput as an alternative, then I will agree that the quotation I am making will  be\r\n\r\nunnecessary, but since the Minister for Finance himself has said that  he  would\r\n\r\nput  to the people our complete merger stand which he has tried to distort, then\r\n\r\nI  would like to have your permission to take about two minutes to clear up this\r\n\r\npoint regarding the definition of our complete merger concept. I would like  you\r\n\r\nto  give  me some time to read another two sentences and then you will know  the\r\n\r\nwhole position and realise how the P.A.P. has distorted our stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our statement points out:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the meantime, the Federation Government is carrying out a wrong education\r\n\r\npolicy.  In  spite of this, because of our stand on merger, we are  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  and  face  difficulties. We will join hands with the Socialists  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation to establish a strong alliance of workers, intellectuals and  farmers\r\n\r\nand defeat all reactionary forces in the general election.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, from this quotation we can see that when we advocate complete merger it does not mean that we will accept every policy of the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, it does riot mean that we will give up the struggle against  the  un\r\n\r\nreasonable policies of the Federation Government. But what is the stand  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out specially that the Government has not only tried to\r\n\r\ndistort our views on this point in various ways but it has also tried to whip up\r\n\r\ncommunal feelings to bring fear into the people so that they would not think  of\r\n\r\nhaving a genuine merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to allow the Government to bring their own merger proposals\r\n\r\nbefore  the  people for a decision. The P.A.P. are against their own words  when\r\n\r\nthey say they wish to have a reunification of Singapore and Malaya and to have a\r\n\r\nsocialist  nation. The P.A.P. have gone against their words and  the  principles\r\n\r\nfor which they stand for. They have even tried to stress the communal and racial\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you do not read the Chinese newspapers, I would like to make a quotation\r\n\r\nfrom a certain Chinese newspaper to acquaint you of a certain fact. This fact is\r\n\r\nin  regard to merger. The P.A.P. are trying to frighten the people in such a way\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  be  afraid to have complete merger in  the  true  sense.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment Press releases are usually published in the Malay Press, the  Chinese\r\n\r\nPress  and  the  English  Press. But we have discovered  that  recently  certain\r\n\r\nstatements  on  merger issued by the Political Bureau of  the  P.A.P. are  only\r\n\r\npublished  in  the Chinese newspapers. They are not published in the  papers  of\r\n\r\nother languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote a passage which is not very long. It is taken from a statement\r\n\r\npublished  in the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 24th  June,\r\n\r\n1962. The statement says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to ask the Barisan Sosialis to answer openly and publicly as to\r\n\r\nwhether  they  accept the policies regarding giving special  privileges  to  the\r\n\r\nMalays in Singapore as what the Federation of Malaya is doing.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>They  also  asked  us in this statement whether we are prepared  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nposition where Chinese students should answer in public examinations in  English\r\n\r\nor Malay. They also asked us whether we are prepared to accept the ratio of 4 to\r\n\r\n1 in the recruitment to the Civil Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Government has all along tried to distort our stand on merger. At the same time it has also\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntried to whip up communal feelings. So we say that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  allowed  to pose the complete merger question  in  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum, it will be a very unfair way of doing things.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the distortion and threat of the Government, we in the Opposition\r\n\r\nhave also been subjected to certain restrictions in our propaganda work.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, let me tell you that whenever the Barisan Sosialis apply for permission to hold a mass rally we are always confronted with many unreasonable\r\n\r\nprovisions and regulations.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Where the Opposition\r\n\r\nare asking for the insertion of a clause saying there should be one question and\r\n\r\nreply in the affirmative or the negative\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- all these details are completely irrelevant.

I have pulled the Member  up\r\n\r\nfor that. He is now going on a different tack which, to me, again appears to  be\r\n\r\nirrelevant to the issue.

I am now going to talk on another aspect. The second  part\r\n\r\nof our amendment says that the people when faced with the choice should have the\r\n\r\nright to say 'yes' or 'no'. We know that if the National Referendum Bill is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  condemned  by  the entire people of Singapore, it is  because  there  are\r\n\r\nprovisions relating to the blank and uncertain votes. I would like to point  out\r\n\r\nto you. Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the Government allows the people to have their\r\n\r\nbasic  right to negate a certain issue, in other words, if the Government allows\r\n\r\nthe  people to say 'no', then there should not have been so many blank votes  in\r\n\r\nany national referendum, and so this question of taking blank votes as votes  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Government will not be embodied in the provisions contained  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. Then it will also be unnecessary for the Government to have a clause\r\n\r\nregarding the penalty to be imposed on those who deface ballot papers.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to point out that it is in this particular clause that the Government does\r\n\r\nnot  allow the people to say 'no'. That is why the Government finds it necessary\r\n\r\nto  make  certain provisions such as clause 29 regarding blank  papers  and  the\r\n\r\nsevere  penalties  to be imposed on people who happen to deface  ballot  papers.\r\n\r\nSuch  provisions have made this Bill a laughing stock of the whole world because\r\n\r\nit does not allow the people so say 'no'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government says that to pose two questions to the people\r\n\r\nwill  enable the people to make a choice, but this is not actually a choice.  If\r\n\r\nyou  want to buy a thing and if you are faced with two things which you  do  not\r\n\r\nwish to buy, then you go to another shop and find something which will suit you.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  when you have this right that you can say you have  a  freedom  of\r\n\r\nchoice - [Interruption in Mandarin]\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The unfortunate part of it is that I cannot understand the\r\n\r\ninterruption.

This example is not  appropriate\r\n\r\nat  all. For example, we have the Housing and Development Board which has  built\r\n\r\nmany flats for selection by applicants. Now, the applicants can refuse the offer\r\n\r\nof  flats and the right to refuse to make a choice is actually the right to have\r\n\r\na  choice. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government wants to deprive the basic  right\r\n\r\nof  the  people  to say \"no\", then to say that such behaviour is  democratic  is\r\n\r\nactually  improper. I would like to quote the speech made by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin  1955  in  the Kreta Ayer Constituency. He said that this type  of  democracy\r\n\r\nshould be given to the dog for consumption.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Member  for Anson in his speech before the dinner break  paid  me  an\r\n\r\nexchange of compliments and posed to me certain questions, because he felt  that\r\n\r\nthere  was justification in my criticism of the one-question amendment  proposed\r\n\r\nby  him  and  that  he would be interested to know whether we have  changed  our\r\n\r\nstand.  We,  Sir, in this Party do not change stands now and then. We  have  one\r\n\r\nstand and that stand is always firm. It is firm to this extent and we would  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Parties  represented in this Assembly to always bear  in  mind  that  in  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue of this great importance, they should sink political differences\r\n\r\nand try to find out a solution for the best interest of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Upper Serangoon quite rightly said that this merger  referendum\r\n\r\nshould  not be a question for party struggle between the P.A.P. and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nand the ex-P.A.P., and it should not be right and proper that the question to be\r\n\r\nposed  should  only  be  the P.A.P. White Paper and the Barisan's  proposal  for\r\n\r\nmerger. I would not like to say what it was, but they have denounced and  denied\r\n\r\nthat they have ever made such a proposition, although we, as an independent  and\r\n\r\nresponsible Opposition, must say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have read in the Press, a statement issued by the Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis on what their stand was at the time when this merger issue  was\r\n\r\nvery,  very hot. The Member for Anson asked whether I do not consider  it  right\r\n\r\nthat  the people should have the right to reject any proposition put forward  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the right to reject Command Paper 33. I say there should be  an\r\n\r\ninherent  right. There should be the right to say, \"I do not like Paper  Command 33.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then let us treat this merger referendum that is tabled today calmly and\r\n\r\nsoberly  and  not  allow  our minds to be poisoned  by  all  the  intrigues  and\r\n\r\ndistortions  that  have been indulged in by the P.A.P. and  the  ex-P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, both of whom have graduated from the same school of the art of\r\n\r\ndistortion. Let us treat this merger referendum in a manner that is befitting of\r\n\r\nmen elected by the people of Singapore to represent the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you ask me this one question. If this one question of the White Paper is\r\n\r\nposed to the people, and if they reject it, would it be voluntary or compulsory?\r\n\r\nI  have this to say. I said in my speech earlier this afternoon that it would be\r\n\r\nvoluntary. He knows, we know and everybody on this side knows and the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  know, except the P.A.P. who refuse to admit that such is  the  state,\r\n\r\nanything  that the P.A.P. Government does will not be accepted by the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. If you pose that question as one question to the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthey  will  cast a \"no\" - an emphatic \"no\" - not because they do not  want  closer\r\n\r\nassociation with the Federation of Malaya but because they want to see  the  end\r\n\r\nof P.A.P. misrule.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the merger referendum would be defeated to the extent that the\r\n\r\nanswer given by the electorate given on that one question, one issue, referendum\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould  not disclose whether or not the people of Singapore want merger. We  know\r\n\r\nthat  they  want merger. In fact, every Party represented in this  Assembly  and\r\n\r\nparties outside which hope to be represented in this Assembly have all clamoured\r\n\r\nfor merger. This merger issue is not a new one. It is as old as the existence of\r\n\r\nall  political Parties in Singapore - old political Parties, new political Parties\r\n\r\nand  budding parties. But it has never been spelled out in all the platforms and\r\n\r\nconstitutions and the objects of all the political Parties. All they say is  \"We\r\n\r\nwant  merger.\" Right, we want merger. Everybody wants merger. But what  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger?  in  fact, what is meant by merger at that time was complete  merger,  a\r\n\r\nmerger which will make Singapore a constituent State of the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\non  the  basis  of  any one of the other constituent States at  present  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. That was all in our minds. It was all that we prayed for, hoped for,\r\n\r\nworked  for, struggled for, and fought for. Now suddenly the prospects of closer\r\n\r\nrelationship  have come upon us. The P.A.P. know it. The P.A.P. was responsible,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  for the cold shoulder of the Federation; government for the past  two\r\n\r\nand  a  half years towards P.A.P. pleadings of merger. At that time, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis was sitting on that side too.\r\n\r\nThey  were  there. They did plead and kept on pleading, \"We want merger.\"  Every\r\n\r\ntime  they said, \"We want merger,\" the Tunku gave a tight slap, \"Shut up. I will\r\n\r\nnot have mercer.\" Now, the Tunku suddenly thought in his wisdom that perhaps  he\r\n\r\nhad  been  too harsh on Singapore; that perhaps it might be in the best interest\r\n\r\nof  both  territories  that  closer association  should  be  achieved.  Then  he\r\n\r\nsuggested that he could have Singapore in a closer association so long as he had\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs, defence and security. That was what he said. He was prepared.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, he extended the hand of friendship to the people and the Government of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Unfortunately, the P.A.P. thought that it was a good thing  to  play\r\n\r\nparty politics. And it came out with. \"We want autonomy in education and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlabour,\"  and  never mind about other things. The Tunku had never said  that  he\r\n\r\nwanted education and labour. Why should the P.A.P. -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I will cut it short. I will not touch on that  any\r\n\r\nmore.  But  because  the debate took place, the P.A.P. had to  come  with  half-merger.  And  they  thought  half-merger, and we  also  thought - we  agreed  with\r\n\r\nthem - that  half-merger was better than no merger. That what has been offered  to\r\n\r\nus - the hand of friendship - should be welcomed and that the White Paper Command 33\r\n\r\nembodies the agreement reached. No doubt that does not give as much as we  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  have  or to see. But we must be realistic. That is the best  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  can  achieve  at  the  present  time  under   the   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this question of merger is in the forefront. Those who are against the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  are  for complete merger. They say that the  P.A.P. has  not  got\r\n\r\nenough.  \"Therefore, we want more.\" They say they want merger in  the  way  they\r\n\r\nmeant merger when the Parties had that written into their objectives and written\r\n\r\ninto  their  platforms. They want complete merger as a constituent part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, on the same basis as any one State at present constituted\r\n\r\nin the Federation of Malaya. That is all they want.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of citizenship and automatic citizenship right need not have\r\n\r\narisen and would not have arisen if there had been no -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> P.A.P.!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - no P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstyle of distortion and the Barisan style of distortion, so much so that citizenship, citizenship and citizenship happens to be the order of the day.

In fact, they let the cat out of the\r\n\r\nbag.  They wanted to pose the questions in such a way that that there  could  be\r\n\r\nonly  one possible answer. Quite rightly, Members of the Opposition, and I  too,\r\n\r\nwere disgusted. We said that that was not an honest way and we would resist  any\r\n\r\nattempt  by  the  P.A.P. to  conduct  a  dishonest  referendum  with  dishonest\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Anson, says, I have explained why one question is not a\r\n\r\nwise  thing, and we are going to oppose that one question. The Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nasked  me  what  alternative I had. You will remember, Sir, that in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  when I sat down and listened to the ding-dong battle that  had  been\r\n\r\ngoing on between the Barisan Sosialis and the P.A.P., knowing that we could  get\r\n\r\nnowhere,  I  thought I had found a compromise that might put  an  end  to  this\r\n\r\nbitter struggle on this one question one issue referendum. So I did suggest that\r\n\r\nif I got their permission I would like to move an amendment to ensure that there\r\n\r\nshould  only be one issue posed in a referendum and that there might be as  many\r\n\r\nquestions as the Government liked to pose under that one issue, so long as  such\r\n\r\nquestions required a reply in the affirmative or in the negative \"yes\" or \"no\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that when I put forward that suggestion to the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, there was a lot of discussion on that, and it was proved  to  me  not\r\n\r\nonly  by  the  Government  but also by Members in the  Opposition  too  that  my\r\n\r\nsuggestion  could  not  hold water, because it you'd make  the  referendum  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated  and it would just get us nowhere. In spite of that,  I  begged  for\r\n\r\nleave to move the amendment.

The Member for Nee Soon has said clearly  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government Wants two questions, he has no objection to it, so long  as  the\r\n\r\nsecond  question  posed  can be the Barisan question. And  yet  another  Barisan\r\n\r\nMember,  the  Member for Upper Serangoon, says that it should not he  a  Barisan\r\n\r\nquestion  or  a P.A.P. question. We are getting more and more confused.  Even  I\r\n\r\nbecome more confused! What is it that the Barisan wants? The Barisan question or\r\n\r\nno  Barisan question? Or that it should be questions based in the best interests\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore as stated by the Member for Upper Serangoon? I think\r\n\r\nso  long  as we can ensure that the questions to be posed in a merger referendum\r\n\r\nare  clean,  honest  questions, I see no objection why more  than  one  question\r\n\r\ncannot  be  posed. In fact, talking about merger, as I have said  earlier,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  all  Parties said, \"Merger, merger, we want merger,\" what they  meant  was\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger as a constituent State in the Federation of Malaya.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhy are we opposing that? To my mind, I think these questions can be said to  be\r\n\r\nhonest, clean, straightforward questions: \"Do you want White Paper 33? That is a\r\n\r\nstraightforward question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Do you want Cmd.

Or, with  the  Cobbold\r\n\r\nReport now out, but still not yet made public, all right, another question could\r\n\r\nbe posed. \"Do you want Singapore to enter the Federation of Malaysia on the same\r\n\r\nterms,   on  terms  not  less  favourable  than  those  of  any  of  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories?\"  There  could even be three questions and these  could  be  honest\r\n\r\nquestions that want an answer from the electorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to a yes or no. If you were to pose two questions or three\r\n\r\nquestions  like that (the three questions that I have thought out), they  would.\r\n\r\nin  our view, be fair and to the point. If you were to ask yes or no, yes or no,\r\n\r\nyes  or  no, it can be three yeses and three noes and then we will get  nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe  choice  is there. The political Parties that are for complete  merger  will\r\n\r\nspeak  at referendum meetings telling the people that they should vote  for  com\r\n\r\nplete  merger. Those of us who axe committed to the White Paper (the  33  of  us\r\n\r\nhere) will have to come out and try to sell the idea to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere may be some, and I am afraid there have been some, who may ask: why is  it\r\n\r\nwe  are not entering on the same terms as North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei? They\r\n\r\ncould  speak strongly at referendum meetings on why Singapore should  enter  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaysia on terms no less favourable than those of Borneo, Sarawak\r\n\r\nor  Brunei. All political Parties having different ideas of merger can speak and\r\n\r\npreach  to the people to their hearts' content and win the minds of the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the choice is there for the people of Singapore. Do  you  want  half\r\n\r\nmerger?  Do  you want full merger? Do you want merger like Borneo,  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nBrunei? What they will be asked then is to give their choice. What do they want?\r\n\r\nIn  that  way  the  referendum will be able to elicit  from  the  electorate  of\r\n\r\nSingapore the wishes of the majority of the electorate of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the assurance given by the Minister that the questions will be\r\n\r\ndebated in this Assembly before posing them in a merger referendum, I have said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat the proper place to write that into the law is in clause 13. The Government\r\n\r\nsays  that  this is a general referendum Bill, which is for general  application\r\n\r\nand  not for merger. If it is a general Bill, I am of the view that in a general\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill, of course, the Government should have the right  to  pose  the\r\n\r\nquestions. But on a merger referendum, a matter that means life and death to the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, a matter on which all political Parties have  taken  firm\r\n\r\nstands  one way or the other, it is quite right that the questions to  be  posed\r\n\r\nshould  be debated in this Assembly. For all we know it might take three  months\r\n\r\nbefore  a  decision could be taken. But it is worth it. It should be debated  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly before it is presented to the electorate for their verdict. There\r\n\r\nhave  been  criticisms too by other Members of the Opposition  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  Referendum Bill to be passed. But as we all know and if we  are  honest\r\n\r\nwith  ourselves,  this  Bill is introduced just to meet the  merger  referendum.\r\n\r\nTherefore. I would suggest to the Government that they should give an  assurance\r\n\r\nhere to this House - and if that assurance is given, it might take the heat off  a\r\n\r\nnumber of other proposed amendments here - \r\n\r\nthat  as  soon  as the merger referendum has been completed, this general  Referendum Bill shall be repealed. That will take the heat off, otherwise there will\r\n\r\nbe  so many amendments put in just to safeguard the position that a general Bill\r\n\r\non  referendum  should  be  of  a character that should  be  acceptable  to  all\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that if the Government thinks of posing more than one\r\n\r\nquestion,  perhaps, in our view, the three honest questions could  be:  \"Do  you\r\n\r\nwant  White Paper 33?\" \"Complete merger on the same basis as that of  the  other\r\n\r\nStates that have joined the Federation?\" \"Or entering the Federation of Malaysia\r\n\r\non terms no less favourable than those of any one of the Borneo territories?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, before the Member sits down, may I rise on a point\r\n\r\nof elucidation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I do not know if he meant that the sitting will be  up  to\r\n\r\nmidnight,  so  that everybody will not sleep well when he  goes  home.  But\r\n\r\nhere  I  would  like to tell him that the blame should  be  placed  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders of the Minister for Finance and on the P.A.P. Government  because\r\n\r\nthey  utilise  this Assembly to play about with their phoney  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  We,  in the Opposition, who are faced with such  .a  situation,\r\n\r\nhave  no  alternative but to clear up the issues which remain to be settled\r\n\r\nbecause we, as representatives of the people, have to do so.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has said just now that this Bill is a\r\n\r\ngeneral  referendum Bill. Judging from the wording of the  Bill,  it  is  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  general Bill applicable to all referenda. But we feel  that  this National  Referendum Bill is specifically meant for merger.  We  have  lost\r\n\r\nour faith and confidence in the P.A.P., and so have the people. Therefore,  we  have to explain to the people the consequences  of  passing\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  The  P.A.P. are now making use of parliamentary  democracy  to\r\n\r\ncarry out their dictatorial rule.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we fully understand - and the people also understand well - that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  exhausted  all  the facilities  of  attack.  Radio  Singapore,\r\n\r\nRediffusion,  the  Press, the Ministry of Culture,  the  Treasury,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home Affairs have all been the means for them  to  sell  their\r\n\r\nphoney  merger.  They have carried out this trickery for a  long  time  but\r\n\r\nthey  have  now come to realise that their type of merger is not  acceptable\r\n\r\nto  the people. That is why they have to resort to threats and trickery  to\r\n\r\ncheat the people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  distorting the stand of the Barisan Sosialis which is genuine  merger.  They\r\n\r\ndistort  our stand in order to further cheat the people. That is why  they  have\r\n\r\nalleged  that  we  want the Penang type of merger, and so  hope  that  when  the\r\n\r\nreferendum is held they can fish in troubled waters.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of our amendment to this clause is to pinpoint this fact - that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. wants to make much use of this\r\n\r\nclause  as  it  is  the most important clause in the Bill. The meaning  of  this\r\n\r\nclause  is rather equivocal, and they want to use this clause to enable them  to\r\n\r\nplay  their tricks. We can see that after the publication of this Bill  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation  of  the  people, all Opposition Parties  here  in  this  House  and\r\n\r\noutside,  as well as organisations, have felt strongly against this clause.  But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are still bent on their arbitrary way and they do not heed the views\r\n\r\nand  opinions of the people and other political Parties. Yet they  try  to  show\r\n\r\nthat they are democratic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the debate since yesterday, you can see our reasons for wanting to amend\r\n\r\nthis clause. We feel that they want to make use of this clause to enable them to\r\n\r\npropose  two  questions  at the coming referendum. I will  therefore  give  some\r\n\r\nassumptions because the Minister for Finance also gave some assumptions - I should\r\n\r\nsay  \"parables\".  He  said that the people would be asked  the  question  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  they accept Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 which embodies the merger  proposals,\r\n\r\nand that to attract the people this question would be framed in such a way as to\r\n\r\nmean that Singapore would, by this merger, be able to retain autonomy in labour,\r\n\r\nand  education. He also said that the other question would very likely be framed\r\n\r\nin  such  a  way as to ask the people this, \"Do you want the Penang and  Malacca\r\n\r\ntype  of  merger,  which means that about 300,000 Singapore citizens  will  lose\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship rights?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise on a point as to whether the\r\n\r\nHouse has a quorum.

Some of the Members opposite who have spoken\r\n\r\nappeared  to contradict their previous statements. I remember the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ntelling  the people a few days ago that the White Paper merger would finally  he\r\n\r\nput to the people for a decision. But we know what is meant by \"a final decision\r\n\r\nof  the  people.\"  It  means that the people have a right to  accept  or  reject\r\n\r\nanything.  But when two undesirable alternatives are put to them, how  can  they\r\n\r\nmake  their choice? From this we can see what they mean when they say  \"let  the\r\n\r\npeople  choose.\" This is their way of cheating because the people cannot  choose\r\n\r\none  or  the other, and it therefore means that the people cannot make  a  final\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, my colleague, the Member for Upper Serangoon, said that in\r\n\r\nspite  of the publicity given by the Government on how good merger is the people\r\n\r\ndo  not support the White Paper merger. We know that the Government have no guts\r\n\r\nto  present  this question to the people because the nature of the  question  is\r\n\r\nsuch that they dare not do so. There is a saying - \"genuine gold dreads no lire.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  true in this case. They dare not pose only this White Paper merger  in\r\n\r\nthe referendum because it is had in itself.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have also been distorting the stand of the Barisan Sosialis.

The stand\r\n\r\nof  Members on this amendment will expose their true nature. It will  also  show\r\n\r\nwhether  a Member wants to see our democracy becoming a laughing stock.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  said that the main part of this Bill revolves around this  clause.  All\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties,  inside  as  well  as  outside  this  Assembly,   and   many\r\n\r\norganisations  and  individuals, have paid much attention to the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause 5.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have published their views and opinions on this clause. Various views on\r\n\r\nthese provisions have been aired at radio forums and discussions. The object  is\r\n\r\nto enable the Government to frame the provisions in such a way so that they will\r\n\r\nhe  acceptable to the people. But certainly there is some confusion  prevailing.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  the  Party in power do not want to rule  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\ndemocratic principles.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote certain views aired by some eminent lawyers at certain forums.\r\n\r\nI  hope the Government will pay attention to this for their benefit. I hope they\r\n\r\nwill  not  feel that today's sitting is wearisome or irksome. Not  only  are  we\r\n\r\ngiving our views on the provisions of this Bill, but there are also other people\r\n\r\nand  organisations  outside  this House who have  given  their  views  on  these\r\n\r\nprovisions.  The intention is to prevent the Government from making  a  laughing\r\n\r\nstock of our democracy here. Let me quote the views on this Bill of the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Graduates Guild. I think it is necessary that the  Ministers'  attention  should  be drawn to this because there are certain Ministers  who  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  Chinese, and they do not like to see the views given by the  people.\r\n\r\nThe Nantah Graduates Guild have given their views thus:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are faced with the Government's White Paper on merger.

That appears now to be an argument against the White\r\n\r\nPaper.  We are not worried about that now. What we are worried about is  whether\r\n\r\nor  not there should be one question or two questions. I do not want to hear any\r\n\r\narguments against or for the White Paper. It has been suggested that a  question\r\n\r\ncould  be asked on the White Paper. Somebody else said a question could be asked\r\n\r\nan  complete merger. I do not want to hear any argument as to whether the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  is  good or bad. We are on a specific issue as to whether  or  not  there\r\n\r\nshould be one or two questions or more.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Chairman,  even in the passage I have quoted, the last  point  therein  continues to say that the national referendum must be held in a democratic manner.\r\n\r\nThis  view is also our view. It is because we feel that this opinion is the same\r\n\r\nas  the  one  we had that we are bringing it up for the reference of Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House for their convenience.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which the statement deals with is that we must put the White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger as a question for the decision of the people. By making  reference\r\n\r\nto  this statement, I mean to say that the National Referendum Bill is a  centre\r\n\r\nof  interest to the various classes of people in Singapore. Here again, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  make  a quotation of a speech of a Member in the Opposition.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is a Malay and a Malay brother of ours. He is also a representative\r\n\r\nof  a  political  Party. This Malay brother of ours is a representative  of  the\r\n\r\nParty  Rakyat. He says that the National Referendum Bill as brought  forward  by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is an unprecedented one. In other words, you can never find such a Bill\r\n\r\nin the world.

But now he seems to have forgotten about democracy. Instead  he\r\n\r\ngoes over the radio and makes distortions of the stand of other people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has this to say concerning the question to be introduced in the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. wants us to make a choice, say, for example, between this: Do you\r\n\r\nwant  the  P.A.P. type of merger or the Penang type of merger?

I would like to remind the Members of the Government that as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  controversy over the National Referendum Bill, the Government is now placed\r\n\r\nin a very embarrassing position. Because it is now faced with the attack coining\r\n\r\nfrom  the Opposition and from other angles and quarters. Even their friends  in\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance are unhappy about some clauses in this Bill. That will  mean  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is actually undemocratic. Even their friends are against them in some\r\n\r\nplaces.  Let me now deal with the speech made by the Minister for Education.  In\r\n\r\nhis speech, the Minister concerned tried to explain why we want to bring up this\r\n\r\namendment.

This particular clause is now being incorporated  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of merger. The Government is going all out in its publicity over  the\r\n\r\nmerger matter and tries to bluff the people by saying that those who are against\r\n\r\nmerger  are  being fooled by the Communists. This is a step to bluff  them.  The\r\n\r\nnext  step  will be to suppress the people. We have many trade unions and  other\r\n\r\ncultural organisations which want to hold meetings over the merger issue and the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill, but they have not been given permission. So from this  we  can\r\n\r\nsee -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon.

I have been lenient, but  at  this\r\n\r\ntime  of  the  night  perhaps leniency is out of place. The  Standing  Order  is\r\n\r\nStanding Order 50 (2) :\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When notice of a motion has been given, it shall be out of order to raise the\r\n\r\nsubject  matter of that motion in the form of an amendment to another motion  or\r\n\r\nto  discuss the subject matter to which the motion relates on a motion  for  the\r\n\r\nadjournment of the Assembly.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask the Member to try not to anticipate, for he probably would like to\r\n\r\nsay something on this other motion and I will permit him just to touch on it  in\r\n\r\npassing, but not to go into details.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nThe amendment we are bringing up to this particular clause has been brought\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nup  because  of  their behaviour, because we have completely lost confidence  in\r\n\r\nthem.  I  was  just  trying  to show you why we are actually  bringing  up  this\r\n\r\namendment  to this particular clause. In short, they are very reactionary.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  have no alternative but to bring in an amendment to this particular\r\n\r\nclause  which says that there should be only one question in a referendum.  That\r\n\r\nis why the people will be able to say yes or no to any particular matter. Clause\r\n\r\n29  deals  with  blank  votes which will be taken as votes  in  support  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  So  if the Government should pose two questions which  are  equally\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to the people, then it is very unfair to the people, because  they\r\n\r\ncannot make a choice. Mr Speaker, Sir, because of this, we are bringing up this\r\n\r\namendment so that only one question will be asked at the referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the speech made\r\n\r\nby the Deputy Prime Minister. He says when a person is thirsty, he would like to\r\n\r\ndrink  water. That is common knowledge. When a person is thirsty, he must  drink\r\n\r\nwater.  There  is  no  point for him to tell us this. He  makes  the  comparison\r\n\r\nbetween  tea  and drain water. Well, it does not matter what type of  drink  you\r\n\r\nhave  as long as you have a drink to quench your thirst. But this is a different\r\n\r\nmatter. Merger is very important as far as the people are concerned. You  cannot\r\n\r\ncompare  merger to the drinking of clean water or dirty water, because  the  two\r\n\r\nare different. What I will say is that the White Paper merger is as bad as dirty\r\n\r\nwater.  So  to  draw  a proper analogy, I would ask our Government  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is trying to force the people to drink ditty water. I think this is a\r\n\r\nmore appropriate analog.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Dirty water from Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I am going to give other examples which, I think,  are  necessary  because they have not been published in newspapers and many people do  not\r\n\r\nknow  about them.

So, by\r\n\r\nbringing  this up, more people will know about it. In this memorandum,  it  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  people's views on Command Paper 33 are to refuse or accept the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  There should be only one question in order that the correct attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  may be ascertained. If there should be two questions on  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger,  then it will be undemocratic because if you ask  the  people  to\r\n\r\nchoose  between  the Penang type of merger and the White Paper type  of  merger,\r\n\r\nthen  the people have no actual choice and this is not in keeping with the  true\r\n\r\nmeaning of a national referendum -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That argument has been advanced in this House from the\r\n\r\nOpposition side several times. I also asked the Member to spare this  House  the\r\n\r\nsame  argument by somebody who is not in this House. We have had enough of  that\r\n\r\nsame  argument,  and I think possibly I must be a little bit more  strict  about\r\n\r\nthis  because  all arguments have been exhausted, and we are  going  round  and\r\n\r\nround  in  circles.  If the Member can bring his speech to a  conclusw4l, then\r\n\r\nperhaps we can get on faster than we have gone on.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker. Sir, this argument has only been advanced by the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nand that is why I am trying to advance the same argument again in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have already made a quotation; that ends my speech. But before I sit\r\n\r\ndown, I hope the Government will not say that, as the Minister for Finance says.\r\n\r\nbecause  of the trouble created by the Barisan Sosialis, the people are  against\r\n\r\nthe  national referendum. As a matter of fact, the National Referendum Bill  has\r\n\r\ncaught  the attention and interest of people of various classes. Their attention\r\n\r\nhas  been  drawn  to it because they want to be sure that in a democratic  State\r\n\r\nthis Bill is not implemented in an undemocratic manner.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we are almost reaching midnight and\r\n\r\nall  this  time  we have been led far away by some Members of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nwith  the  same  old  tune, a tune which sometimes gives  a  kind  of  entertainment to those who wish to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the amendment moved by the Opposition, we have heard\r\n\r\nmany  speakers  touching  on  the  subject  of  democracy,  democracy,  and\r\n\r\ndemocracy. But if we go deeply into the matter of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, which has been expounded by them as genuine democracy,  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  democracy  is practised by them merely for the purpose  of  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections, that is to say, \"We want the seats.\" That is  democracy\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In opposing the clause before us, they pretend to be true patriots. But\r\n\r\ntheir  words  expose  their true character. We have  been  led  far  field,\r\n\r\nparticularly by an eminent lawyer in this Assembly, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson, on the subject of the referendum in other countries such  as\r\n\r\nAustralia - from  north to south, and from east to west. But  they  have  conveniently  forgotten that in those countries there is only one nationality. Here  in  Singapore  we are living in a country comprising  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety  with  different religions. We must stand on solid ground  and,  as\r\n\r\nfighters  of  democracy, we must respect the views of all sections  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  who live in this country and who owe undivided allegiance  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  This  is  the responsibility of fighters of democracy - to  respect\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  all  sections of the community and whose  loyalty  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry is undivided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Mr Speaker, in honouring the respect of these loyal\r\n\r\npeople,  we must be cool, calm, and perservering, and must look on a  wider\r\n\r\nplane.  Mr Speaker, in discussing this question, which is to be  posed  in\r\n\r\nthe  forthcoming referendum as to how many questions are to  be  posed  and\r\n\r\nwhether  it  will be answered by a \"yes\" or \"no\", we must  be  cautious  so\r\n\r\nthat  we will not put something that is not acceptable to our community  as\r\n\r\na  whole.  We  know  that  the principle of merger  has  been  agreed  upon\r\n\r\nunanimously, i.e. Singapore must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerge  with  the Federation of Malaya. But the type of merger has  been  debated\r\n\r\nupon months ago, and we have also debated the White Paper Cmd. 33 which has been\r\n\r\nadopted  by  this Assembly. In my opinion, the basis of merger has been  debated\r\n\r\nand  accepted  by  a great majority of the population comprising  a  multiracial\r\n\r\nsociety  in  Singapore.  But  these views and opinions  have  been  misled  and\r\n\r\nconfused  by opportunistic leaders who play on chauvinistic feelings  so  as  to\r\n\r\nachieve their own political ends. Nobody can deny this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard it said in this Assembly by Members opposite, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  which  is led by their  great  leader,  the  Member  for Queenstown, that we have deceived the people and so on and so forth. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  the  Chinese  language and therefore cannot read Chinese  newspapers, but\r\n\r\nuntil  today I have not come across nor have I heard what is the type of  merger\r\n\r\nthat the Barisan Sosialis want. The Member who spoke just now about the attitude\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis, unfortunately spoke in Chinese. But whatever he  said\r\n\r\nmust  be  read,  digested and understood by those who do not understand  Chinese\r\n\r\ntoo.  From  this  we  can see that their opinion is limited and  confined  to  a\r\n\r\nparticular section of the community. In this way, they are playing on chauvinism\r\n\r\nfor  their  own  political  future. They only pose to  be  genuine  fighters  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. We Assemblymen here, on this side at least, come from all sections of\r\n\r\nthe community, and we disseminate our views to the people in open confrontation,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  people  themselves may decide. So when this  problem  is  clearly\r\n\r\nunderstood by all sections of the people. Mr Speaker, it means that we are figh\r\n\r\nting for the rights of democracy, and that the people themselves can realise and\r\n\r\nassess the value of democracy according to their views and their wishes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to reiterate. It is highly dangerous and highly inflam mable and will bring calamity to the country if leaders, especially those\r\n\r\nsitting  in  this  Assembly,  stir up communal passion  to  light  the  fire  of\r\n\r\ncommunalism  f  or  a particular section or part of the community,  or  for  any\r\n\r\nparticular Party.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary is straying away when he went\r\n\r\non that tack. That is, in my opinion, completely irrelevant to the amendment.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Parliamentary Secretary is guilty of the same fault - being completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant when he talks about feelings in this particular context when  we  are\r\n\r\ndealing with the amendment before the House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not wish to argue with you. But I\r\n\r\nhave  said  it because that charge has been made several times when Mr  Speaker\r\n\r\nretired from the Chamber for a while. So I think it is imperative that I  should\r\n\r\nexplain that in implementing this referendum, we must pose questions which  will\r\n\r\nbe  acceptable  by the people comprising the various races. This is  my  object.\r\n\r\nThere is a danger if only one question were put and accepted by one section  and\r\n\r\nrejected by another. So in order to safeguard democracy and thereby respect  the\r\n\r\nviews of all the communities, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestions  to be posed should be acceptable by all sections of the people  here.\r\n\r\nBy  this  there  is  the hope that the basis of national unity  which  has  been\r\n\r\nimplanted  in the people of Singapore who owe undivided loyalty to this  country\r\n\r\nwill not be disrupted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
