For  the budget sets out in  detail  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  proposals for  the  coming  financial\r\n\r\nyear. It describes the ways in which the Government\r\n\r\nintends to raise its revenue. It gives a blue print\r\n\r\nof expenditure by each department of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This occasion, however, holds even greater\r\n\r\nhistorical importance than one normally attaches to\r\n\r\nGovernment budgets. This is the first budget of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party Government elected under  the\r\n\r\nnew  self-governing constitution of  Singapore.  On\r\n\r\nthis  occasion, therefore, it would be  appropriate\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  do  a wider survey of  events  and  to\r\n\r\nventure  further afield than is the normal practice\r\n\r\nof  Finance Ministers when presenting their  annual\r\n\r\nbudgets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a democratic socialist Government and our\r\n\r\npurpose,  within  the five years  of  our  stay  in\r\n\r\noffice, is to produce at the end of it a more  just\r\n\r\nsociety  in  which the democratic institutions  and\r\n\r\npractices  would be more firmly rooted. An  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment which enjoys the support of the mass  of\r\n\r\nthe people must have objectives basically different\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government  that it  replaced.  It  will\r\n\r\nstrive  to  remove  those glaring injustices  which\r\n\r\nstill  remain  in  our society.  It  will  seek  to\r\n\r\neliminate the forms of exploitation of men  by  men\r\n\r\nwhich the exploiters, through being tolerated  over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  have come to regard as customary  and,\r\n\r\nindeed,  normal. It will strive to  bring  for  the\r\n\r\nordinary man the full fruits of his labour. And  in\r\n\r\nso  doing  it must resolve also those conflicts  of\r\n\r\ninterest  which  inevitably will arise  within  our\r\n\r\nsociety  and  which  may threaten  to  disrupt  the\r\n\r\norderly progress of social adjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of things, these objectives take\r\n\r\ntime  to  attain.  For  we  are  committed  to  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process  by  which  changes  are   made\r\n\r\nthrough the processes of law and carried out by the\r\n\r\nadministrative machine which we inherit. There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the need, whilst making these  changes,\r\n\r\nto  retain some continuity with the past.  And  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  national budgetting  illustrates  this\r\n\r\nvery clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of a Government budget is a\r\n\r\nlengthy   and   involved  process.   The   original\r\n\r\nproposals  on  which  this  budget  is  based  were\r\n\r\ninitiated early this year, months before the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  assumed office. It is not  possible  to\r\n\r\nscrap  all these proposals nor, within the time  at\r\n\r\nour disposal, to introduce new procedures and start\r\n\r\ncompletely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafresh.  The  establishment  scales  of  Government\r\n\r\nDepartments  have  to be carried forward  and  such\r\n\r\nadjustments  to it as are being made  are  marginal\r\n\r\nones.  To  do otherwise at this stage would  be  to\r\n\r\ninvite a breakdown of the machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this extent, therefore, the budget which I\r\n\r\nhave the honour to present to the Assembly is based\r\n\r\nto  a  considerable  extent on  the  administrative\r\n\r\npractices  and  policies which have been  built  up\r\n\r\nover the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary in presenting the budget for the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  to make a brief  review  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and  to assess prospects for the  year  to\r\n\r\ncome. In Singapore, we have an open economy and the\r\n\r\nlevel  of business activity is conditioned  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  by  what  we  ourselves  do  as  by  economic\r\n\r\nconditions in neighbouring territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Federation of Malaya</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the general position outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  begin with our closest  neighbour,\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya.  1958  has   been   a\r\n\r\nremarkable year for the Federation. The decline  in\r\n\r\nthe  price  of  rubber  which  began  in  1957  and\r\n\r\ncontinued steadily ever since was arrested in  this\r\n\r\nyear.  Before  this,  the  Federation  had  several\r\n\r\nanxious  moments  when an enormous  budget  deficit\r\n\r\nloomed  over the horizon because of the decline  in\r\n\r\nthe revenue on the export duty on rubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily the world economic expansion caught up\r\n\r\nwith  the  total available supply of  rubber,  both\r\n\r\nnatural  and synthetic, and as inevitably  happens,\r\n\r\nthe  price of rubber increases. At first, there was\r\n\r\nhesitation owing to the uncertainties of the rubber\r\n\r\nstockpiling  policy of the U.S.  Government.  When,\r\n\r\nhowever, it appeared that stock releases,  both  in\r\n\r\nAmerica  and  the United Kingdom, were insufficient\r\n\r\nto  fulfil the needs for rubber, especially of  the\r\n\r\nhigher  grades,  the  spectacular  rise  in  rubber\r\n\r\nprices  followed. Thus the Federation's  threatened\r\n\r\ndifficulties disappeared almost overnight. The  way\r\n\r\nwas open to them to prepare a prosperity budget for\r\n\r\n1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosperity in the Federation inevitably brings\r\n\r\nwith  it  an  increase in business in Singapore  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  the two territories are agreed that  they\r\n\r\nshould  work  as one economic unit, whatever  their\r\n\r\npolitical divisions may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government, through its prudent\r\n\r\naction  in laying aside substantial sums  of  money\r\n\r\nfor  replanting  of rubber, has  assured  that  its\r\n\r\neconomic   strength,  which   today   still   rests\r\n\r\nprincipally on rubber, will continue in  the  years\r\n\r\nto   come.  It  has  also  set  in  motion  a  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful programme of industrial growth. There is\r\n\r\na major building boom in Kuala Lumpur today and all\r\n\r\nthese,  together  with  the high  targets  set  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure in  1960,  will  ensure  a\r\n\r\nsteady expansion of the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two developments in the Federation give\r\n\r\ncause  for  concern  in Singapore.  There  is,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the valuation on a new basis  of  branch\r\n\r\ntransfers  between  Singapore  concerns  and  their\r\n\r\nbranches in the Federation. This recent move by the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is being studied by Singapore\r\n\r\nand  it is hoped that, whatever the merits of  this\r\n\r\nparticular  action, the Federation will not  pursue\r\n\r\nany policy designed to isolate Singapore whose port\r\n\r\nand  commercial facilities have served her so  well\r\n\r\nover  the  past years, to the mutual  advantage  of\r\n\r\nboth territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Indonesia</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to our second great neighbour,\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Our  trade with her is  of  importance.\r\n\r\nThrough  numerous  little  ships,  we  supply   the\r\n\r\nscattered  islands  of  the Indonesian  Archipelago\r\n\r\nwith  much  of  their basic needs. In  return,  our\r\n\r\ntraders bring back the many varied tropical produce\r\n\r\nof these islands and, after processing them, export\r\n\r\nthem  to  the great markets of the world.  On  this\r\n\r\ntrade   and   its   allied   services,   such    as\r\n\r\ntransportation,  handling of  cargoes,  processing,\r\n\r\nfinance  and  insurance, depends the livelihood  of\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of our population. What  happens  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia   has  therefore  immediate  and   direct\r\n\r\neconomic consequences to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this trade is of benefit to both parties.

I shall later give  figures  to\r\n\r\nshow    that   the   Indonesian   economy   derives\r\n\r\nsubstantial  benefits from our  trade.  We  are  an\r\n\r\nentrepot  and we survive because we offer the  best\r\n\r\nprices which the primary producers around us,  both\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia  and the Federation  of  Malaya,  can\r\n\r\nobtain.  Through our efficient shipping and banking\r\n\r\nfacilities,  we make it easier for these  producers\r\n\r\nto dispose of their products in the great commodity\r\n\r\nmarkets  of  the world at the best prices  possible\r\n\r\nand  we of Singapore wish for nothing more than  to\r\n\r\nsee  Indonesia  overcome her economic  difficulties\r\n\r\nand bring about those conditions under which honest\r\n\r\ntraders can conduct their business on a stable  and\r\n\r\npermanent basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would not attempt to Whitewash Singapore\r\n\r\ncompletely. Unfortunately, in the past this country\r\n\r\nhas given refuge to elements hostile to the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Indonesia. We have thereby  incurred\r\n\r\ntheir displeasure and quite naturally so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government cannot be held responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the acts of its predecessors. We have made  it\r\n\r\nabundantly clear to the Indonesian authorities that\r\n\r\nwe  wish for a new basis and a new approach to  our\r\n\r\nmutual problems. Our relations with Indonesia  have\r\n\r\nimmensely   improved  since  the  advent   of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  shall  continue  our  efforts   to\r\n\r\nimprove upon them. We have undertaken not to  allow\r\n\r\nany  action  to  proceed  in  Singapore  which   is\r\n\r\ndirected  against  the security of  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nState. This assurance we shall fulfil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the improved relationships with\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  there  is the trade agreement  recently\r\n\r\nconcluded between the Governments of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  on  the  supply of  raw  cotton  to  our\r\n\r\nspinning  mills for processing and  return  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of yarn to Indonesia. This is a small  symbol\r\n\r\nof  the  new spirit of mutual respect which we  all\r\n\r\nhope will grow in the years to come. I am sure that\r\n\r\nmembers of the Assembly will join me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  congratulating our Deputy Prime Minister on the\r\n\r\nsuccess   of   his   efforts  to   promote   better\r\n\r\nrelationships between the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Singapore in 1959</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, the year 1959 had been a period of\r\n\r\nsome  uncertainty. The first half of the  year  was\r\n\r\nnotable  for  a  general attitude  of  wait-and-see\r\n\r\nadopted by business enterprises. It was a period of\r\n\r\ncomparative  stagnation. The reason was  of  course\r\n\r\nthe  impending general elections, scheduled to take\r\n\r\nplace in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, possible to exaggerate the extent\r\n\r\nof  the  trade recession. The total trade  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half of the year stood at $2,787 million  as\r\n\r\nagainst $2,960 million for the first half of  1958.\r\n\r\nThe decline was less than 6 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Government assumed office, trade has\r\n\r\npicked  up somewhat. The value of imports  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  July  to October this year averaged  $261.5\r\n\r\nmillion  per month as against $255 million for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of  the  year. The  value  of  exports\r\n\r\nincreased to a more marked extent. Exports  in  the\r\n\r\nlast four months ran at $236.3 million per month as\r\n\r\nagainst  $211 million per month for the first  half\r\n\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can therefore see that the scare about the\r\n\r\ndecline  in  business  generated  by  the  cuts  in\r\n\r\nvariable allowance was largely unfounded. Even  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean's capacity to enjoy himself  showed  no\r\n\r\ndecline  in the last few months as the receipts  on\r\n\r\nentertainment duty and liquor revenue plainly show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As compared with the similar period last year,\r\n\r\nrecent trading conditions showed an improvement  of\r\n\r\nabout  10 per cent in respect of imports and nearly\r\n\r\n30  per  cent  in  respect of exports.  These  more\r\n\r\nfavourable  trade  figures result principally  from\r\n\r\nthe  higher  prices of rubber and so  long  as  the\r\n\r\npresent  state  of the market can be sustained,  we\r\n\r\ncan  look forward to an increase in incomes in  the\r\n\r\nmonths to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian trade, however, witnessed a grievous\r\n\r\ndecline  in  exports from Singapore. In  the  first\r\n\r\nnine  months of 1958 exports to Indonesia  totalled\r\n\r\n$276.2 million. For the corresponding period this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear,  the total dropped to just over one-third  of\r\n\r\nthis figure, $107.5 million. This decline was  due\r\n\r\nto  the  severe restrictions on imports  introduced\r\n\r\nthis year by the Indonesian Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against the decline in exports, imports from\r\n\r\nIndonesia  showed  a  substantial  increase,   from\r\n\r\n$662.7  million for the period January to September\r\n\r\n1958  to  $837.6 million for the same  period  this\r\n\r\nyear.  These  figures show that  Indonesia  derives\r\n\r\nconsiderable  benefit by way  of  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nearnings in their trade with Singapore and  it  was\r\n\r\nSingapore's  trade lines that made it possible  for\r\n\r\nher  to  have  disposed of so  much  quantities  of\r\n\r\nproduce through the ready made market of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere   is   therefore  every   justification   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to ask for a relaxation on the  controls\r\n\r\non   Singapore   exports  of  consumer   goods   to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building trade in Singapore, however, went\r\n\r\nthrough a difficult period. The statistics  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  buildings completed this year  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod January to August are misleading. They  seem\r\n\r\nto  indicate  that  the level of  activity  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  and construction trade was  at  least  as\r\n\r\nmuch as that for the same period last year. Figures\r\n\r\non  the  production of local building material  are\r\n\r\nprobably   better  indicators  as   they   show   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable decline in 1959 as compared with 1958.\r\n\r\nThe production of bricks for the first eight months\r\n\r\nfell  from  51  million in 1958 to 38 million  this\r\n\r\nyear. The production of broken granite dropped from\r\n\r\n391,000 cu. yds, to 243,000 cu. yds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local industries were adversely affected for a\r\n\r\nvariety of reasons. The local soap industries, sago\r\n\r\nflour  production, coconut oil and rubber  footwear\r\n\r\nregistered  declines. The reasons were varied.  The\r\n\r\nlocal  rubber  footwear  industries  suffered  from\r\n\r\noverseas   competition,  primarily  from   Japanese\r\n\r\nsources. The coconut oil industry is plagued  by  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  copra imports. The rubber  re-milling\r\n\r\nindustry, however, saw more activity this  year  as\r\n\r\nimports  of rubber increased consequent  on  higher\r\n\r\nprices.  The biscuit industry maintained an  active\r\n\r\ntempo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption of electricity and gas both for\r\n\r\ndomestic and industrial purposes continues the rate\r\n\r\nof  increase  shown  in the  last  few  years.  The\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  petrol and liquor  maintained  the\r\n\r\nnormal  expected rate of increase. In the  case  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes,  the  revenue declined,  but  this  was\r\n\r\nprincipally  due  to  a  switchover  from  imported\r\n\r\ncigarettes to local brands. This developed  such  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the  revenue that it was  necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  last  September changes  in  the  import\r\n\r\nduties  on  cut tobacco and the cheaper  brands  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  in  order  to  arrest  the  decline  in\r\n\r\ntobacco revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Common Market</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the foregoing review of trade and production\r\n\r\nfigures, it is clear that a special effort must  be\r\n\r\nmade to stimulate business activities in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn   the  case  of  trade,  much  depends  on   the\r\n\r\nprosperity of our neighbours. I have already  dwelt\r\n\r\non   this  in  my  remarks  on  conditions  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of promoting the growth of industry\r\n\r\nis  one  to which the Government is paying constant\r\n\r\nattention.  This has both its long term  and  short\r\n\r\nterm aspects. In the long term, whether or not  the\r\n\r\ncountry will survive as a going concern depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  extent  to  which our attempt to industrialise\r\n\r\nthe  economy  succeeds.  In  the  short  term,  the\r\n\r\nimmediate problem is to stimulate the basic demands\r\n\r\nfor  products already being produced.  As  I  shall\r\n\r\ndescribe  later, the prospects for  so  doing  next\r\n\r\nyear are excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term policy of creating new industries,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is a more complex one. It is  clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  domestic market limited by a population of our\r\n\r\nsize will attract only a small range of industries.\r\n\r\nIf  industries  established in Singapore  could  be\r\n\r\nassured  of a more extensive market, e.g. that  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation and Singapore combined, we can look\r\n\r\nforward   with  greater  confidence  to  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me immediately to the question of a\r\n\r\ncommon market with the Federation. It has been  one\r\n\r\nof  the  major points in our election programme  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this.  And  this may  be  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nmoment  in  which to give a broad  outline  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals  which  we have made  to  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the  establishment  of  a   common\r\n\r\nmarket. It is not possible to go into great  detail\r\n\r\nas   the  matter  is  under  consideration  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one talks of a common market, one usually\r\n\r\nhas in mind two varieties following the practice in\r\n\r\nWestern  European countries. The first is a customs\r\n\r\nunion in which the territories proposing to form  a\r\n\r\ncommon  market attempt, within a given  period,  to\r\n\r\nset  up similar customs duties against imports from\r\n\r\noutside  the area. In other words, if  we  were  to\r\n\r\nhave  a customs union with the Federation, we shall\r\n\r\nimpose  on  our  imports the  same  duties  as  the\r\n\r\nFederation does, while permitting the free movement\r\n\r\nof goods between the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other form of a common market is the free\r\n\r\ntrade  area.  Under this arrangement, each  partner\r\n\r\nretains  independence of action as regards  customs\r\n\r\nduties  on  goods coming in. There is a same  duty-free movement of goods between partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that neither of these systems would\r\n\r\nbe  acceptable both to the Federation of Malaya and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  A  Custom's Union may ruin  Singapore's\r\n\r\nentrepot trade which is based on duty-free  imports\r\n\r\nof such goods as enter the entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a free trade area may give a\r\n\r\npreponderant advantage to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore thought out a third hybrid\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  good  conscience,  we  believe  to   be\r\n\r\nattractive  enough  to  the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwithout  at  the same time incurring  the  risk  of\r\n\r\ndestroying our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a modified form of a Customs Union. It is\r\n\r\nproposed  that the list of goods be agreed  between\r\n\r\nthe two Governments on which similar duties would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  levied in both territories against imports from\r\n\r\noverseas.  These  goods will not  be  charged  with\r\n\r\ncustoms  duties  if  they are  produced  in  either\r\n\r\nterritory on entering the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of common market may be called a\r\n\r\ncommodity  common  market. The  commodities  to  be\r\n\r\nincluded would naturally be those which offer  good\r\n\r\nprospects  of local production either in  Singapore\r\n\r\nor  the  Federation. They would not  include  goods\r\n\r\nwhich enter extensively into our entrepot trade. As\r\n\r\na  corollary  to  the commodity common  market,  it\r\n\r\nwould    be    necessary    to    integrate     the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme of the two  territories\r\n\r\nso   that,   in  lines  of  production  where   one\r\n\r\nproduction   unit  is  sufficient  to  cover   both\r\n\r\nmarkets, there would be arrangements for the zoning\r\n\r\nof such units. This would enable more efficient and\r\n\r\nmore  competitive industries to be established  and\r\n\r\nfurther  would  avoid the danger of  having  excess\r\n\r\ncapacity installed in relation to consumer demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made our proposals to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and these are being examined.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso  requested  that  the proposals  submitted  be\r\n\r\nexamined  by  a Joint Committee of Officials.  This\r\n\r\nCommittee  could  go  into  great  detail  on   the\r\n\r\nimplications of the system proposed and report back\r\n\r\nto   the   respective  Governments  what  are   the\r\n\r\ndifferences that still remain to be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from the foregoing account that an\r\n\r\narrangement  of this kind accepts the fact  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic unity of the two territories. Whatever the\r\n\r\npolitical  divisions, it is obvious that they  must\r\n\r\nco-operate  in  economic fields  and  it  would  be\r\n\r\ninjurious  to both countries to take an independent\r\n\r\nand   competitive  line  of  action  in   promoting\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth. From the point of view  of  the\r\n\r\nprospective   manufacturer,   the   attraction   of\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  Malaya would immensely  increase.  A\r\n\r\nFederation investor, for instance, would be assured\r\n\r\nof  a protected market not only in his own country,\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  Singapore.  Similarly,  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nmanufacturer would not have to surmount  the  tariff\r\n\r\nwall   which  the  Federation  now  places  against\r\n\r\nSingapore products. It is therefore hoped that an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearly  decision  would  be reached.  Any  delay  in\r\n\r\nreaching   a  decision  would  merely   mean   that\r\n\r\nprospective  investors may be induced  to  adopt  a\r\n\r\nwaiting policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's attraction as a partner to the common\r\n\r\nmarket  is much greater than the comparison of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  figures  of the two  territories  would\r\n\r\nsuggest.  While the Federation has more  than  four\r\n\r\npersons to one Singaporean, the purchasing power of\r\n\r\nthe two territories by no means follows this ratio.\r\n\r\nThis is because a concentrated urban population has\r\n\r\na  higher  purchasing power than a dispersed  rural\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958 separate figures of foreign trade were\r\n\r\npublished  for the first time which would  give  an\r\n\r\nindication  of the potential market in manufactures\r\n\r\nin the two territories. In Singapore the imports of\r\n\r\nmanufactured  goods  for domestic  consumption  for\r\n\r\n1958 was $489 million. The corresponding figure for\r\n\r\nthe  Federation was $630 million. The disparity  in\r\n\r\npurchasing  power  is therefore  considerably  less\r\n\r\nthan the ratio of population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this gives the overall totals and\r\n\r\nthere would be considerable variation in respect of\r\n\r\nindividual  commodities. At the same  time,  it  is\r\n\r\nwell to remember that Singapore has an enormous re-export  market in manufactures which  an  efficient\r\n\r\nindustrial concern can penetrate. The re-export  of\r\n\r\nmanufactured goods from Singapore in 1958 was  $293\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give these figures to show that the integration\r\n\r\nof  the two economies would produce benefits  which\r\n\r\nare  not as one-sided as some people may think.  On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, the access to a protected market  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for Federation manufactures  must  be  a\r\n\r\nfactor   which  would  increase  considerably   the\r\n\r\nattractiveness and profitability of enterprises  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Financial Review of 1959</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget for 1959 which this Government\r\n\r\ninherited  was framed on a standstill  basis.

The  last  Government\r\n\r\nbudgetted for a deficit of $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Budget was planned at $42\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  was to be financed by  $20  million\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ordinary Estimates, $18 million from  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Revenue Reserve and $4 million from  other\r\n\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total deficit in the Ordinary and Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  combined was therefore of the  order  of\r\n\r\n$22  million. However, before the general elections\r\n\r\nin  May,  supplementary provisions were voted  for,\r\n\r\ntotalling  $10 million. This further increased  the\r\n\r\nexpected deficit to $32 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the revenue from tobacco began\r\n\r\nto  fall in an alarming way due to the transfer  of\r\n\r\nconsumer choice from imported cigarettes, on  which\r\n\r\nthe   duty   was   high,  to  locally  manufactured\r\n\r\ncigarettes made from cut tobacco, on which the duty\r\n\r\nwas  kept  low. A shortfall of $10 million  on  the\r\n\r\ntobacco revenue was expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If events were allowed to take their course, we\r\n\r\nwill  find  that our deficit, taking both  ordinary\r\n\r\nexpenditure and the development estimates together,\r\n\r\nwould eventually amount to $42 million. That is  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  this would be the total decline  in  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Revenue Balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position would be unacceptable to any prudent\r\n\r\nGovernment  and consequently economy measures  were\r\n\r\nintroduced.  This was especially necessary  as  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  surpluses accruing in the  boom  years\r\n\r\nand amounting to $325 million had very largely been\r\n\r\nspent. While it is true that some of these had been\r\n\r\nconverted  into concrete forms, such as new  school\r\n\r\nbuildings, new S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses,  improved roads and so forth, this  however\r\n\r\nprovides  a  very  scant  consolation  to  the  new\r\n\r\nGovernment which had its own ambitions in  the  way\r\n\r\nof  a  development programme.

There was  the\r\n\r\ncut in variable allowances; there was the cessation\r\n\r\nof   development  projects  which  had   not   been\r\n\r\ncommenced  and, finally, there was the freezing  of\r\n\r\nvacant posts and uncommitted special expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action had also been taken to bolster up the\r\n\r\ndeclining  revenue from tobacco.  While  increasing\r\n\r\nthe  tobacco  duty  to  check the  severe  decline,\r\n\r\nopportunity to the same level as that obtaining  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  At the same time  a  tax  on  the\r\n\r\nhiring  of films was introduced, was also taken  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  petrol duty. All these measures,  though\r\n\r\nthey failed to bring revenue to the estimated total\r\n\r\nof  $265  million, nevertheless, had the effect  of\r\n\r\nbridging what, at one time, threatened to be a most\r\n\r\nserious gap between revenue and expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two months ago, I reported to the Assembly\r\n\r\nthat  the  effect of these measures, together  with\r\n\r\nprospective increases in taxation, would mean  that\r\n\r\nwe  should just about balance our budget at the end\r\n\r\nof the year. The latest revised Estimates show that\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure will amount to $257 million  and\r\n\r\nrevenue to about $258 million, leaving a surplus of\r\n\r\nabout $1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government had not acted as promptly and\r\n\r\nas  decisively as it did, we would have  ended  the\r\n\r\nyear  in  the  red.  The deficit  on  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates  would  have been at least  $20  million,\r\n\r\nconsisting  of $12 million by way of reductions  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  that would not have  taken  place,  $4\r\n\r\nmillion in revenue shortfalls plus the original  $4\r\n\r\nmillion deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exertions of the Government, unpleasant\r\n\r\nthough  some of the consequences were, had achieved\r\n\r\nthe  objective of placing the finances of the State\r\n\r\non   a   sound  footing.  Nothing  could  be   more\r\n\r\ndisastrous for this Government than to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind  in the first six months of its term of office\r\n\r\nthat serious inroads had been made on the financial\r\n\r\nreserves as a result of a very large deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Ordinary Budget</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the 1960 Ordinary Estimates. As I\r\n\r\nmentioned  before, the process of budgetting  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous one. Hardly had the budget for one  year\r\n\r\nbeen  approved by the Assembly then all departments\r\n\r\nand  Ministries begin to think and plan  ahead  for\r\n\r\nthe Estimate proposals for the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Ordinary Estimates for 1960,\r\n\r\nthe  present Government was confronted by what  was\r\n\r\nreally  a  fait  accompli. The first  cast  of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  which was presented to me was so  dismal\r\n\r\nin   outlook   that  I  asked  for   an   immediate\r\n\r\nreconsideration  of expenditure items.  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  have  been constantly assailed  by  the\r\n\r\nspectre of budget deficits and may by now have been\r\n\r\npersuaded that the whole thing is a bogey  conjured\r\n\r\nup  by the Finance Minister with some ill intent in\r\n\r\nmind. I assure Members that this is not so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a few words on the trends of revenue\r\n\r\nand  expenditure in the last few years.  Ten  years\r\n\r\nago  revenue  collection totalled  $180.8  million.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  was  then $94.3 million.  In  1953  we\r\n\r\nreaped the full harvest of the post-Korean War boom\r\n\r\nand revenue collected totalled $238.5 million. From\r\n\r\n1954  to 1957 revenue varied between $207.3 million\r\n\r\nand  $241.5  million. The high figure for  1958  of\r\n\r\n$271.4  million included a windfall of $20  million\r\n\r\nfrom  the  sale of Christmas Island.  Increases  in\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  rates introduced for  1959  brought  a\r\n\r\nslight  revenue  increase but it  is  now  becoming\r\n\r\nclear that the revenue had lost the buoyancy of the\r\n\r\nimmediate post-Korean War years. We had reached the\r\n\r\nplateau in revenue yields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, expenditure went up\r\n\r\nrelentlessly.  In  particular  the  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nsocial  services  seemed  to  have  an  independent\r\n\r\nmomentum  of  its  own. By 1958 it became  apparent\r\n\r\nthat  the natural growth of expenditure had reached\r\n\r\nthe tax plateau and was continuing to forge ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so much that the Civil Service had been\r\n\r\naccustomed  to lavish and extravagant standards  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure but that we are now paying very  dearly\r\n\r\nfor  the  enormous birth rates that  had  been  the\r\n\r\nfeature of post-war Singapore. The large number  of\r\n\r\nbabies  born every year may be a welcome  testimony\r\n\r\nto  the virility of the population. But it sets  in\r\n\r\nstore  problems of nightmarish proportions for  the\r\n\r\nFinance   Minister  of  Singapore.  For  with   the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  population in Singapore,  there  must\r\n\r\nfollow  inevitably  increases  in  expenditure   on\r\n\r\neducation, health and the social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may, as we are now doing, take severe measures\r\n\r\nto keep expenditure within available resources, but\r\n\r\nhowever ingenious we can be, the growing population\r\n\r\nexerts  its  inexorable pressure. Where  population\r\n\r\nincreases  are  not  matched by  increases  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  income, the country will inevitably  head\r\n\r\nfor  a breaking point. For there is a limit to  the\r\n\r\ntax  capacity  of  any economic system.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying   that  we  have  reached  this   limit   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  it  is  obvious  that  unless  the\r\n\r\nnational  income can be increased as  fast  as  the\r\n\r\ngrowth in population, we shall be faced either with\r\n\r\nthe  scaling down of the volume of public  services\r\n\r\nor we must undertake further reductions in the cost\r\n\r\nof these services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore of paramount importance for the\r\n\r\nfuture  well-being of Singapore to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nnational income grows as fast as the population and\r\n\r\nwhere   this  growth  is  not  possible,   due   to\r\n\r\ncircumstances  beyond  our control,  we  must  make\r\n\r\nevery  effort  to slow down the rate of  population\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a simple but graphic illustration of\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of the population growth on Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  I  shall  take  the  expenditure   on\r\n\r\neducation   not  merely  because   this   is   most\r\n\r\nimmediately  affected by the growth  of  population\r\n\r\nbut  also because the increases in expenditure  can\r\n\r\nbe foreseen and calculated with accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school children now attending the primary\r\n\r\nschools consist of those children born between  the\r\n\r\nyears 1946 and 1952.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these seven years, 318,000 babies were born.\r\n\r\nSeven  years  from now the children  attending  our\r\n\r\nprimary  schools would be those born  between  1953\r\n\r\nand  1959. The number of births in this period  was\r\n\r\n423,000, an increase of exactly one-third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, we shall be spending a total of $87.2\r\n\r\nmillion  on  education,  $65.3  million  being  the\r\n\r\nrunning  cost and $21.9 million being  the  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure on new schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can assume that the increase in the number of\r\n\r\nchildren  in  primary schools in 1967  will  be  at\r\n\r\nleast one-third greater than the number now. If - and\r\n\r\nI  stress  this - we  were  merely  to  maintain  the\r\n\r\npresent  ratio of children of school going  age  to\r\n\r\nchildren attending school and not increase on it we\r\n\r\nshall  have  to spend one-third more  on  education\r\n\r\nthan  we  now  do.  Allowing  for  the  decline  in\r\n\r\ninfantile mortality rates, we can expect at least a\r\n\r\n40  per cent increase in children of primary school\r\n\r\nage in seven years' time as compared with now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1967, therefore, we shall have to spend not\r\n\r\nless than $122 million a year on education, that is\r\n\r\nif  we  are  satisfied  only  to  maintain  present\r\n\r\nstandards. If we want to give every child  a  place\r\n\r\nin  school and if we want to increase the number of\r\n\r\nchildren  receiving secondary and higher education,\r\n\r\nthe  figure  may  well be 50 per cent  greater.  In\r\n\r\nother words, by 1967, if we want to make strides in\r\n\r\nour education programme, we shall have to spend  in\r\n\r\none year, some $180 million on education alone. And\r\n\r\nthis  sum  is  nearly 70% of the  total  Government\r\n\r\nrevenue as it now stands. It covers the whole yield\r\n\r\nof  Income Tax and Customs duties on liquor, petrol\r\n\r\nand  tobacco.  If  anybody were  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nincreases  envisaged here are improbable,  I  would\r\n\r\nrefer  them  to  the  increases in  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nEducation  between 1953 and 1960.  These  increases\r\n\r\nwere much greater proportionately than what is  set\r\n\r\nout above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the first cast of the Estimates;\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  other way but to call  for  further\r\n\r\nreductions   in   expenditure  and  accordingly   a\r\n\r\ncircular  was  issued  informing  departments  that\r\n\r\nunless they could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffer offset savings, no new items or increases  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure will be entered in the 1960  Estimates,\r\n\r\nother   than   those  resulting  from   commitments\r\n\r\napproved  by  this Government. It was  possible  to\r\n\r\nreduce the expenditure by $10 million in this  way,\r\n\r\nbut  at  the last moment, however, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  submitted late proposals for  a  further\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $4  million.  There  was  no  way  of\r\n\r\navoiding this expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to new appointments these have been\r\n\r\nkept to the barest minimum. 1,109 new posts will be\r\n\r\ncreated in 1960 as against 885 in 1959 and 1,622 in\r\n\r\n1958. Of the 1,109 new posts all except 80 are  for\r\n\r\nthe   Ministries  of  Education  and  Health.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  these 80 new posts have been  created\r\n\r\nagainst deletions of existing posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure, including revotes, now\r\n\r\nstands  at  $275.3 million as against  an  expected\r\n\r\nrevenue  of  $269.2 million, leaving a  deficit  of\r\n\r\n$6.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Ordinary Expenditure</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described some of the steps taken to keep\r\n\r\nexpenditure within distance of estimated revenue. I\r\n\r\nshall  now  describe some of the  more  significant\r\n\r\nitems of expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the re-grouping of\r\n\r\ndepartments into Ministries and the creation of two\r\n\r\nnew Ministries, and the abolition of one. There  is\r\n\r\nfurther  the  measures initiated to integrate  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  departments  into the  Central  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries. I shall refer to this at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-grouping of departments and Ministries is\r\n\r\nnow  familiar history and I need not expand on  it.\r\n\r\nThe   estimates  themselves  show  in  detail   how\r\n\r\ndepartments have been re-allocated to Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most departments show less expenditure in 1960 as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the previous year. Special  mention\r\n\r\nmay  be made of the Police who in 1960 are expected\r\n\r\nto  spend $1\u00bd million less than in 1959,  a  most\r\n\r\nwelcome  reversal of past trend of mounting  Police\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  The Police expenditure had  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $8.2  million in 1950 to $24.4  million  nine\r\n\r\nyears  later. No one would deny the need for having\r\n\r\na strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narm   of   the   law.  Nevertheless   the   reduced\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the Police should not  bring  about\r\n\r\nany  deterioration  in  efficiency,  for  with  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  public which a popularly  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  rally round the Police,  there  is\r\n\r\nevery indication that the efficiency of their  work\r\n\r\nwould  be enhanced. The efficiency of their  recent\r\n\r\naction against gangsters proves this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the economy measures undertaken,\r\n\r\nmost  Heads of Expenditure show reductions for 1960\r\n\r\nas  compared with 1959. Of 47 Heads of expenditure,\r\n\r\n25   show  reductions,  one  head  of  expenditure,\r\n\r\nnamely, Head 43 - Film Censorship, shows an identical\r\n\r\namount  as  between 1960 and the revised  estimates\r\n\r\nfor 1959. 24 heads of expenditure show increases of\r\n\r\nvarying degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance shows a saving of $2.3\r\n\r\nmillion in 1960 as compared with the revised figure\r\n\r\nfor 1959. I would like to believe that this results\r\n\r\nfrom  a  more Spartan degree of self-denial on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the Minister. This however would  not  be\r\n\r\nwholly  true.  The  reasons are more  mundane.  The\r\n\r\nsavings   are   principally   due   to   accounting\r\n\r\ntransfers.  Repayment of War Damage  Interest  Free\r\n\r\nLoan  of  $1.5  million has been  removed  to  Head\r\n\r\n23 - Charge on Account of the Public Debt.  The  task\r\n\r\nof   luring  tourists  to  our  shores - formerly  my\r\n\r\nresponsibility - now falls on the broad shoulders  of\r\n\r\nmy colleague the Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reductions of expenditure under other heads\r\n\r\nare  principally the effect of the cuts in variable\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Heads of expenditure which show\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increases, those heads of  expenditure\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  the  social  services  continue  to\r\n\r\nincrease.  Head 21 - Health shows an  increase  from\r\n\r\n$33.3 million to $35.2 million, an increase of $1.9\r\n\r\nmillion.  Head 37 - Social Welfare shows an  increase\r\n\r\nfrom $11.3 million to $13.6 million, an increase of\r\n\r\n$2.3  million. There is also the perennial increase\r\n\r\nin  expenditure on Public Assistance which in  1960\r\n\r\nis  estimated  at  $7.5  million  as  against  $6.7\r\n\r\nmillion this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred to the increase in the\r\n\r\nrunning cost of Education which in 1960 will  reach\r\n\r\n$65.3  million,  an increase of $3.8  million  over\r\n\r\n1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above represents the increases in expenditure\r\n\r\non  the  social services which must be regarded  as\r\n\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next group of heads of expenditure which\r\n\r\nshow increases, the reason is that these relate  to\r\n\r\ndepartments  which provide commercial  services  of\r\n\r\none  kind  or  the  other  to  the  public  and  to\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The  Marine Department  and  the  Marine\r\n\r\nSurveys   Department  show  slight   increases   in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  No one would grudge the  increase  in\r\n\r\nthe    expenditure   on   Postal    Services    and\r\n\r\nTelecommunications which are necessary to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith increased demand for these services. These, by\r\n\r\nand large, pay for themselves. Similarly the Survey\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  the Trade Marks  Registry  provide\r\n\r\nservices to the public and to the trading community\r\n\r\nand the cost for these must be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8 - Civil Aviation, however, is a different\r\n\r\nproposition. There is an increase of half a million\r\n\r\ndollars  in  the estimated expenditure in  1960  as\r\n\r\ncompared with 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as we prize our Airport, the time has come\r\n\r\nto  consider  whether it is justified to  subsidise\r\n\r\nthe   operations  of  the  Airport  by  an   amount\r\n\r\nexceeding $2 million a year. It is hoped that  ways\r\n\r\nand means will be found to increase the earnings of\r\n\r\nthe  Airport, improve its efficiency and reduce the\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining items of major importance which\r\n\r\nshow   sizable   increases  are  either   statutory\r\n\r\npayments such as Head 23 - Charge on Account  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic   Debt   and   Head  24 - Pensions,   Retiring\r\n\r\nAllowances  and Gratuities. The latter  expenditure\r\n\r\ngoes  up  from  $16.8 million to $18.6  million  in\r\n\r\n1960,  an  increase  of  $1.4  million.  These  are\r\n\r\nstatutory  payments and nothing more need  be  said\r\n\r\nabout  it.  The  Charge on Public Debt  is  also  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  payment and shows an  increase  of  $6.6\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1960,  the  expenditure  being   $13.3\r\n\r\nmillion  as  against $5.7 million  this  year.

There is a\r\n\r\ndemand  for  Treasury  Bills  by  banks  and  other\r\n\r\ninstitutions  which have surpluses  of  cash  which\r\n\r\nthey  want  to keep in interest-bearing short  term\r\n\r\nliquid assets. It is also intended that an approach\r\n\r\nbe  made  to the small savers who may want  to  set\r\n\r\naside  their  savings  in the  form  of  bonds  and\r\n\r\nsavings certificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are measures which the Government\r\n\r\nproposes  to  take  in  1960  with  the  object  of\r\n\r\nmobilising  domestic savings and  putting  them  to\r\n\r\nproductive  uses.

These estimates  are\r\n\r\nbased on the same rates of taxation in all fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, considerable variations in a\r\n\r\nfew  individual  items, though for  the  most  part\r\n\r\nitems  of  revenue have been taken at substantially\r\n\r\nthe same level as 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these changes are principally due to\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the accounting system consequent  upon\r\n\r\nthe  integration of the District Councils into  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government. For instance, the Rural  Board\r\n\r\nRevenues  which were formerly shown as an  appendix\r\n\r\nin  the  Estimates are now in the Estimates itself.\r\n\r\nThis  accounts for a total of $6.5 million  of  the\r\n\r\nextra  yield of $10 million. The net real  increase\r\n\r\nin revenue is therefore $3.5 million only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the principal items of revenue, income tax is\r\n\r\nestimated to yield $65 million for 1960 as  against\r\n\r\n$76 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1959.  The decline is due partly  to  the  less\r\n\r\nfavourable  trading conditions in 1959 as  compared\r\n\r\nwith  1958. It is expected that incomes and, hence,\r\n\r\nthe  tax  on incomes, would be lower this  year  as\r\n\r\ncompared with last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the fact that in the course of the\r\n\r\nyear    several    companies   transferred    their\r\n\r\nheadquarters   from  Singapore  to  other   places,\r\n\r\nprincipally   the  Federation  of   Malaya.   Their\r\n\r\noperations  in  Singapore,  however,  continue   as\r\n\r\nbefore,  but  the  transfer of Head  Offices  would\r\n\r\nmean,  under  the  provisions  of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance, a deferment of tax payment which  would,\r\n\r\naccordingly, reduce the amount payable in 1960. The\r\n\r\nrecent  increases  in the rates  of  petroleum  and\r\n\r\ntobacco duty are expected to have an effect on  the\r\n\r\nyield  of  these  duties next  year.  Petroleum  is\r\n\r\nexpected to yield $40.4 million in 1960 as  against\r\n\r\n$35 million this year. The duty on tobacco goes  up\r\n\r\nfrom  $34.2 million to $43.1 million. But this item\r\n\r\nneeds   close  watching.  It  is  based  on  certain\r\n\r\nassumptions  about  consumer  preferences   between\r\n\r\nlocally    produced   cigarettes    and    imported\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  It  remains to be seen  whether  these\r\n\r\nassumptions will, in fact, be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected yield of revenue from all sources\r\n\r\nclearly demonstrates the point I made earlier  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  reached the tax plateau given the present\r\n\r\nbasis of personal incomes, consumer expenditure and\r\n\r\ntax  structure. Such marginal adjustments  as  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made in the past year or two as well as those\r\n\r\nthat  are contemplated for next year will  not  produce  the spectacular revenue increases which  were\r\n\r\nwitnessed during the period 1950 to 1953  when  the\r\n\r\ntotal revenue more than doubled in four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the period during which the post Korean\r\n\r\nwar  boom tools place and brought about both  rapid\r\n\r\nincreases  in  incomes as well  as  a  considerable\r\n\r\namount of capital accumulation. The initial impulse\r\n\r\nwas,  of  course, external and we benefited largely\r\n\r\nin a fortuitous manner. If we want to bring about a\r\n\r\nsimilar expansion in the economy, it would  be  too\r\n\r\nrisky  a policy to wait for a repetition of such  a\r\n\r\nstroke of good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfortune.  This may well come about, but  we  cannot\r\n\r\nstake   the   future  of  the  country  on   chance\r\n\r\noccurrences, such as international conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>City Council</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment ago I referred to the City Council. The\r\n\r\nintegration of the City Council into the Government\r\n\r\nhas  already commenced under the direction  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. Initially, City Council Departments\r\n\r\nhave   been  allocated  to  appropriate  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries  for  guidance and decisions  on  policy\r\n\r\nmatters.   The   Departments  still  retain   their\r\n\r\nseparate  identities, hierarchy and  organisational\r\n\r\nprocedures. In particular, the financial accounting\r\n\r\nof  City  Council Departments will remain  separate\r\n\r\nfrom the Government. Establishments and staff have,\r\n\r\nin  general, not been merged into a single  uniform\r\n\r\norganisation with Government Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of integration must be carried out in\r\n\r\nstages.  The  first  stage, in  which  only  policy\r\n\r\ndirectives are issued from Government Ministries to\r\n\r\nCity   Council   Departments,  has   already   been\r\n\r\nundertaken.  The other stages which  remain  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried   out  must  be  completed  in  an  orderly\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous matters of great complexity\r\n\r\nstanding   in  the  way  of  complete   and   final\r\n\r\nintegration.  It would be quite possible  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  the  complete  integration  scheme  ourselves,\r\n\r\nusing the personnel available in the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council. This would, however, mean  that\r\n\r\nthe best administrative, legal and financial brains\r\n\r\nwill  have to be set aside for a fairly long period\r\n\r\nto handle these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided that, in view of the\r\n\r\nheavy  pressure of work found at the upper echelons\r\n\r\nof  the  administration, it is desirable to  invite\r\n\r\noverseas  experts to advise the Government  on  the\r\n\r\nmany  problems of integration. Accordingly, we have\r\n\r\napproached, under the Colombo Plan, the  Government\r\n\r\nof  Canada  for a team of experts in the fields  of\r\n\r\nfinance  and  budgetting, establishment  and  staff\r\n\r\nmatters,  and local government legislation.  It  is\r\n\r\nexpected that the team of experts will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrive early next year to assist the Government  in\r\n\r\nthis  heavy and complicated undertaking. Until  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been received and  considered,\r\n\r\nthe budgets of the City Council Departments and the\r\n\r\nCentral   Government  will  continue  to  be   made\r\n\r\nseparately.  A consolidated budget is not  possible\r\n\r\nuntil  all issues have been finally resolved, staff\r\n\r\nand   departments  fully  integrated,  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities   Board   set  up,   loans   and   assets\r\n\r\ndistributed  as  between  the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board, and many other complicated\r\n\r\nproblems  solved. It can well be  imagined  that  a\r\n\r\ntask of this magnitude will take several months  to\r\n\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Development Estimates</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development projects entered in the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates fall into two groups. In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  group is included those projects which  were\r\n\r\nin  the  process of construction in  1959  and  had\r\n\r\ntherefore  to  be  carried out to completion.  They\r\n\r\nwere  all  projects which formed part of  expansion\r\n\r\nprogrammes  worked  out in the  past  and  awaiting\r\n\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of continuing projects carried forward\r\n\r\nfrom  1959 amounts to $28.0 million. Education  and\r\n\r\nHealth  lead the field with $7.7 million  and  $5.8\r\n\r\nmillion  respectively.  These  are  items  in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  extension of schools,  hospitals\r\n\r\nand  hospital  services. Continuing  projects  have\r\n\r\ntherefore been entered and assessed in detail. They\r\n\r\nwill be carried out to completion next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, and by far the larger part of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates, consists of  new  proposals\r\n\r\ninitiated   by  this  Government.  In  this   sense\r\n\r\ntherefore the Development Estimates have much  more\r\n\r\nof  the  imprint of the policies of this Government\r\n\r\nas  compared  with  the  Ordinary  Estimates  where\r\n\r\ncontinuity with the past had to be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the nature of things, with the short\r\n\r\ntime  available and the pre-occupation of immediate\r\n\r\ntasks, that the new development proposals are  more\r\n\r\ndefinitions of targets and objectives than projects  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  had  been  processed  by  architects,\r\n\r\nengineers  and  other technicians to  the  required\r\n\r\ndegree of finality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, two consequences follow. The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  that  the  amounts are  entered  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates in round numbers. The second is that they\r\n\r\nare  all  subject to Treasury control. This  latter\r\n\r\nstep is necessary to ensure that no expenditure  is\r\n\r\nmade  before  the  project  has  gone  through  the\r\n\r\ndetailed  screening by the technicians. It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat,  taking  into  account  the  vast  amount  of\r\n\r\nplanning  and preparation that will be required  in\r\n\r\nrelation   to   the  availability   of   engineers,\r\n\r\narchitects   and  others,  there   will   be   some\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in completing all the works  envisaged.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  every effort will be made  to  bring\r\n\r\ninto  fruition the intentions of the Government  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  these capital development  projects.  A\r\n\r\ndetailed  study will be made by the  Commission  of\r\n\r\nEnquiry recently appointed on the capacity  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry. This will enable the Government\r\n\r\nto put the development funds to the optimum use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, the value of the development proposals\r\n\r\nadd  up to $105.8 million. The expenditure of money\r\n\r\nof  this  order  of magnitude will  give  a  strong\r\n\r\nstimulus  to the economy. As will be apparent  from\r\n\r\nthe  details, it will have more than just  a  pump-priming function, necessary though this may  be  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage. The development projects will  add  to\r\n\r\nthe   permanent  accumulation  of  wealth  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry and strengthen the sinews of the economy. I\r\n\r\nwill  now  give a brief account of what  these  new\r\n\r\nprojects are and what they hope to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest single item in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates   goes  to  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  A  sum  of  $27.4  million  has  been\r\n\r\nallotted  to that Ministry. The details  appear  on\r\n\r\npage  477.  There is a loan of $25 million  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority which will be  established  next\r\n\r\nyear. There is also a sum of $800,000 allotted  for\r\n\r\nrural  development projects. This will  consist  of\r\n\r\nvarious   schemes   designed   to   increase    the\r\n\r\nproductivity of farmers and fishermen, as  well  as\r\n\r\nto extend the areas under cultivation. The Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstands  second in the demands on finances  provided\r\n\r\nby  the  Development Fund. A total of $21.9 million\r\n\r\nhas been allotted to them of which $7.7 million  is\r\n\r\nfor  continuing projects and $14.2 million for  new\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I have already referred  to  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  money  to  be  spent  on  education,  both  on\r\n\r\nteachers  and on building new schools. The  sum  of\r\n\r\n$21.9  million is not as much as the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation would like to have, but this is all  that\r\n\r\nwe can spare in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that the present Minister, with his\r\n\r\nlong  business experience, will be able to put this\r\n\r\nmoney   to   far  more  effective  uses  than   his\r\n\r\npredecessor who had to make an untimely  exit  from\r\n\r\nthe  political scene. Some of the schools sited  by\r\n\r\nthe  previous  administration show  an  astonishing\r\n\r\ndegree  of  incompetence  and  lack  of  foresight.\r\n\r\nAnyone  who  passes  through Jurong  Road  will  be\r\n\r\nastonished  to  see two large and modern  buildings\r\n\r\nsited in the middle of nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has made a claim for\r\n\r\n$20.5  million.  $500,000  consist  of  the  second\r\n\r\ninstalment of a $2 million loan to be made  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government Officers Co-operative  Housing\r\n\r\nSociety.  $20  million  has been  allotted  to  the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development   Board,   which   will   be\r\n\r\nestablished next year. This is a long awaited event\r\n\r\nand   I  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Economic Development Board</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  is  related  to  the  Government's  plan  of\r\n\r\naccelerated  industrial growth  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nintention  to establish such a Board was  announced\r\n\r\nduring  the election campaign and accordingly  this\r\n\r\nproposal  in  the  Development  Estimates  has  the\r\n\r\nmandate of the electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that the total resources of the\r\n\r\nBoard  will reach a figure of $100 million  if  the\r\n\r\nBoard were to make any significant contribution  to\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth. In 1960 the  first  draft  from\r\n\r\npublic  funds would be made and an initial  sum  of\r\n\r\n$20 million has been set by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first draft of the Bill to establish the\r\n\r\nBoard  has  been  completed and it is  under  close\r\n\r\nstudy  by  the  Government. A number  of  important\r\n\r\nissues still remain to be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without attempting any precision in definition, I\r\n\r\nmay be permitted to discuss the principal functions\r\n\r\nand objectives of the Board. The Board will act, in\r\n\r\nthe  first instance, as an industrial bank and will\r\n\r\nmake available to industrial concerns loans on both\r\n\r\nshort  and  long  terms. The  Board  will  also  be\r\n\r\ncharged  with certain executive powers in  carrying\r\n\r\nout      the     Government's     programme      of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, particularly in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nplanning  and preparation of industrial sites.  The\r\n\r\nBoard  will  have a staff of economic planners  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  technicians  with  which  it  will   be\r\n\r\nequipped  to  discharge its  functions  within  the\r\n\r\nframework  of  general Government policy.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso  be able to offer both industry and Government\r\n\r\ntechnical and expert advice and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An undertaking of this nature is one not lightly\r\n\r\nto  be embarked upon. Its necessity is apparent  to\r\n\r\nall.  But great care has to be taken to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  large  sums  of money placed at  its  disposal\r\n\r\nwould  be  spent to the maximum advantage  and  not\r\n\r\nfrittered away in unprofitable ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has approached the International\r\n\r\nBank   for   Reconstruction  and  Development   for\r\n\r\nassistance in recruiting the top executives of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board. In so doing, we are not\r\n\r\ndeparting   from  our  previous  pledges   to   the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  I  say  this  because  there  may   be\r\n\r\ncriticism from certain quarters that the policy  of\r\n\r\noverseas recruitment may run counter to the general\r\n\r\nprinciple  of Malayanisation which this  Government\r\n\r\nsupports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stated in our election manifestos and\r\n\r\nother pre-election documents that there is not  the\r\n\r\nskill and experience in this country which can cope\r\n\r\nwith  the immensely responsible and complex  duties\r\n\r\nwhich  the Economic Development Board will have  to\r\n\r\ndischarge.  It was stated then quite  clearly  that\r\n\r\nlocal talent and experience not being available, we\r\n\r\nshall have to recruit from overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of Asian revolution, this step which\r\n\r\nwe  adopt may appear to be distasteful to some  and\r\n\r\nretrograde to others. To these people, we  can  say\r\n\r\nwith  perfect  candour that members of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership are not  lacking  in  talent,\r\n\r\nvigour  or self-confidence. A combination of  these\r\n\r\nqualities,  however, may well lead to  recklessness\r\n\r\nbred  out of arrogance and ignorance if it  is  not\r\n\r\ntempered with a sense of realism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an open city exposed to the business\r\n\r\nand political currents coming from all parts of the\r\n\r\nworld. As such, we are more cosmopolitan in outlook\r\n\r\nthan  perhaps any other country in Asia.  While  we\r\n\r\npassionately believe in nationalism in its fine and\r\n\r\ncreative sense, we must desist from those forms  of\r\n\r\neconomic  nationalism where these militate  against\r\n\r\nour interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to recruit the top executives of the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development  Board  from   overseas   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a  measure  which  should  find  general\r\n\r\nsupport  in  this  country. It is fitting  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  approach  an agency of the United  Nations,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  World  Bank, for assistance  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter  and  if we succeed in attracting  the  best\r\n\r\ntalent  available, this will be all to the good  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also made applications to the United\r\n\r\nNations  through the U.K. Government for assistance\r\n\r\nin a technical study of investment possibilities in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In 1960, with the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board and the full use of  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  and advisory services available  through\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations agencies,  we  shall  see  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of an energetic plan to promote  a  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth of industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I wish to reiterate the broad\r\n\r\noutlines  of our industrial policy. We have  stated\r\n\r\nin  our  election manifestos that in the  stage  in\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore  finds itself today,  the  primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility of industrialisation  must  rest  on\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise. This being the case, we  should\r\n\r\ndo   everything  possible,  consistent   with   the\r\n\r\nwellbeing of our population,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  attract  to  Singapore  the  maximum\r\n\r\namount  of  overseas capital and overseas technical\r\n\r\nand  managerial skills and do all that  we  can  to\r\n\r\ninduce  local  enterprise  and  capital  into   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of new industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of this policy must be\r\n\r\nunderstood by all. Business people do not embark on\r\n\r\nnew  ventures for political objectives, such as the\r\n\r\ndefence of the democratic system. They do so  on  a\r\n\r\ncalculation  of  profits and if we want  to  induce\r\n\r\nthem to develop new industrial enterprises, we must\r\n\r\nmake   the  economic  setting  suitable   for   the\r\n\r\npromotion of these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Development Estimates, the\r\n\r\nnext  substantial item is an amount of  $7  million\r\n\r\nallotted  to the Ministry of Labour and  Law,  Head\r\n\r\nD.34, at page 484. This sum of money is intended to\r\n\r\nbe  used  on capital development so as to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  grave problem of unemployment now facing  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic solution of course is not to be found\r\n\r\nin  relief  projects but in the  expansion  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  particularly in the way  of  establishing\r\n\r\nnew industries to provide for greater employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the new development expenditure\r\n\r\nwould  be to inject a sufficient stimulant  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy  to  raise  it from its  present  state  of\r\n\r\nstagnation.  Greater prosperity engendered  in  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  rubber  would  also  contribute  towards\r\n\r\neconomic recovery in this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely, however, that there will still\r\n\r\nremain    a   residual   of   unemployed   persons,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the young looking for  work  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time.  It is to provide useful activity  for\r\n\r\nthese  persons that the Government has  allotted  a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $7  million  to be spent  on  unemployment\r\n\r\nrelief  works  under the direction of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government to organise\r\n\r\nunemployed youths into work brigades. They will  be\r\n\r\ngrouped  in  residential units to be  stationed  in\r\n\r\nvarious   parts   of   the  island   where   useful\r\n\r\nconstruction activity can be carried out by way  of\r\n\r\nland  reclamation, road building, irrigation works,\r\n\r\nreclamation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  swamps and so forth. Special attention will  be\r\n\r\npaid  to the spiritual and moral wellbeing of these\r\n\r\nyouths organised in these work brigades. They  will\r\n\r\nbe  taught the value of social discipline  and  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of social responsibility Their needs in the\r\n\r\nway   of   cultural  enlightenment  will   not   be\r\n\r\nneglected. These are important matters for we  must\r\n\r\navoid  the  atmosphere of spiritual  demoralisation\r\n\r\nwhich  could  creep into poorly managed  and  badly\r\n\r\nconceived relief works projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that this sum would be sufficient\r\n\r\nto  provide  for the employment of at  least  5,000\r\n\r\npersons.  Rates  of pay would below,  considerably\r\n\r\nless than those paid to the present detachments  of\r\n\r\nunemployed persons now engaged in construction work\r\n\r\nof one kind or another At present these persons are\r\n\r\npaid  $3  a  day, with provision in some cases  for\r\n\r\novertime.  Such rates of pay are higher  than  what\r\n\r\npeople  in  fulltime occupation in some trades  are\r\n\r\nearning,  and it would therefore be a  misnomer  to\r\n\r\nconsider  such  projects as properly falling  under\r\n\r\nthe relief of unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable amount of detailed planning\r\n\r\nremains  to  be  done as regards the organisational\r\n\r\nstructure of the work brigades, and the engineering\r\n\r\nand   construction  details  on   selected   sites.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  this  whole item of  expenditure  has\r\n\r\nbeen made subject to Treasury sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5 million under Head D.\r\n\r\n9 - Marine - represents  really a token  provision  for\r\n\r\nport improvement. For some years now the Government\r\n\r\nhas   been   considering  plans  to   improve   the\r\n\r\ndeplorable  condition of the Singapore River  which\r\n\r\nis a vital artery of our entrepot trade. This river\r\n\r\nis  very  congested; river traffic  is  subject  to\r\n\r\nstoppages at low and high tides, and parts  of  the\r\n\r\nquays  on  private  land are  in  a  state  of  sad\r\n\r\ndisrepair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Department has made a proposal for the\r\n\r\ndeepening of the inner harbour opposite Beach  Road\r\n\r\nand  the construction of a new breakwater. Detailed\r\n\r\nplanning and expert evaluation of this project have\r\n\r\nstill to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, these projects have been entered in\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Estimates even though  the  final\r\n\r\ndecision to embark upon them will have to be  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Port Authority as was recommended  by  the\r\n\r\nMilbourne  Commission. The inclusion of this  item,\r\n\r\nif  it  does nothing else, serves to underline  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  keen  interest  in  maintaining   and\r\n\r\npromoting  the efficiency of our port services.  It\r\n\r\nalso  indicates  the  Government's  willingness  to\r\n\r\napproach  overseas  governments or  United  Nations\r\n\r\nagencies for loans to finance these projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last item of the Development Estimates on\r\n\r\nwhich  I  wish to comment is the sum of $2  million\r\n\r\nallotted  under  Head  D. 40  to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture for the extension and development of radio,\r\n\r\ninformation and publicity services. It is  intended\r\n\r\nto introduce next year commercial broadcasting in a\r\n\r\nsomewhat  diluted form. For all these, a  provision\r\n\r\nof  $2  million  has been made, the expenditure  of\r\n\r\nwhich is again subject to Treasury sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>The Civil Service</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinary Estimates show a deficit of $6\r\n\r\nmillion - and  this after the most strenuous  efforts\r\n\r\nhad been made to reduce expenditure.

Some  have  been\r\n\r\nresentful over the pay cuts. Others have been taken\r\n\r\naback by the exacting standards which the Ministers\r\n\r\nexpect of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Civil Service is going\r\n\r\nthrough a difficult period. The acceleration in the\r\n\r\nspeed of Malayanisation has imposed a severe burden\r\n\r\non  the local officer. While a few have been  found\r\n\r\nto  be  wanting, the great majority  of  them  have\r\n\r\nrisen to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation provides for serving officers the\r\n\r\nopportunity for accelerated promotion,  which  will\r\n\r\nnever  occur again. This has both its strength  and\r\n\r\nweaknesses. On the one hand, some Departments  have\r\n\r\nbeen  placed in a difficult position, but,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, it provides an opportunity for serving\r\n\r\nofficers  who  are prepared to work hard  to  prove\r\n\r\ntheir worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended next year to make a review of the\r\n\r\nstaffing  position to ensure that there is  a  hard\r\n\r\ncore  of  experienced officers in all  Departments,\r\n\r\nand   that  opportunities  will  be  provided   for\r\n\r\naccelerated  promotion to those local  officers  of\r\n\r\nmerit and ability who are prepared to give of their\r\n\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be regretted that a number of officers\r\n\r\nin   administrative   and  technical   posts   have\r\n\r\nresigned.  Some of these have chosen to  leave  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  for a more  lucrative  private\r\n\r\npractice.  It must not be forgotten, however,  that\r\n\r\nservice   in  Government  provides  officers   with\r\n\r\nspecial opportunities for advanced training,  which\r\n\r\nare   not   available   elsewhere.   This   applies\r\n\r\nespecially to doctors, whose programme of  advanced\r\n\r\ntraining  overseas has been maintained despite  the\r\n\r\nneed for economies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>The Deficit</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now return to the deficit and the means of\r\n\r\nmeeting it. There are normally two methods open  to\r\n\r\nus: the first is to reduce expenditure; the second,\r\n\r\nto increase revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards economy, the recent steps taken by\r\n\r\nthis Government leave no room for doubt that we are\r\n\r\nprepared to do the utmost. But the methods  so  far\r\n\r\nused,   though  they  have  been  considered   very\r\n\r\ndrastic,  have  been  simple  ones.  They  are  the\r\n\r\nmethods  which the Chinese call Ta tau k'uo  fu  or\r\n\r\n\"the big knife and the broad axe\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been simple ones in that they do not\r\n\r\nrequire detailed examination of each and every item\r\n\r\nof  expenditure. They could be justified only on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  basis  and, for long-term  economies,  a\r\n\r\nmore delicate instrument than the big knife or  the\r\n\r\nbroad  axe  has  to be used, if we  want  to  avoid\r\n\r\nimpairing  the  efficiency of  the  administration.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  needed  is  an  instrument  such  as  the\r\n\r\nsurgeon's  knife to cut out waste and  extravagance\r\n\r\nthat  may  be  occurring in  regard  to  individual\r\n\r\nitems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of services has been so rapid in\r\n\r\nthe  last  ten  years  that  it  is  unlikely  that\r\n\r\nunnecessary  expenditure had not been incurred  and\r\n\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every fresh item, when introduced in the\r\n\r\nEstimates  proposals for any year,  is  subject  to\r\n\r\nclose scrutiny, once it has passed the vigilant eye\r\n\r\nof  the Treasury, it tends to remain thereafter  in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates  practically as a matter  of  right.\r\n\r\nThis particularly applies to O.C.A.R. items. These,\r\n\r\ndespite  every  effort to keep them within  bounds,\r\n\r\ncontinue to expand inexorably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year the Government proposes to establish a\r\n\r\nCommission  to  examine Department  by  Department,\r\n\r\nevery   item   of  P.E. and  O.C.A.R.   Heads   of\r\n\r\nDepartments  will  have to justify  that  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  item included is necessary for the efficient\r\n\r\nrunning of the administration. The Commission  will\r\n\r\nalso  inquire  into procedures and organisation  in\r\n\r\norder to see whether or not any simplification of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  could  not  bring  about  both  economy   and\r\n\r\nincreased efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would hasten to assure the civil\r\n\r\nservice  that  this would not lead to an  extensive\r\n\r\nretrenchment of personnel. Such posts as are  found\r\n\r\nredundant  will  be abolished, but the  holders  of\r\n\r\nthese  posts  will be given every  opportunity  for\r\n\r\ntransfer  without  loss  of  emoluments  to   other\r\n\r\ndepartments  of Government or to other agencies  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   where  they  can  be  more  profitably\r\n\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not set its face against\r\n\r\nincreasing the volume and the value of services  it\r\n\r\npresents  to  the  public. On the contrary,  it  is\r\n\r\nintended to give the public an increasing scope  of\r\n\r\nservices which would promote the wellbeing  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  and  sustain an increased  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people may therefore rest assured that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will strain every effort to  see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat   public   money  is  spent  to  the   maximum\r\n\r\nadvantage. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that in the\r\n\r\nreorganisation envisaged whether substantial enough\r\n\r\neconomies would be produced to balance the  Budget,\r\n\r\ntaking into account the fact that in the course  of\r\n\r\nthe year Ministries and Departments will inevitably\r\n\r\nsubmit applications for supplementary votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxpayer must therefore be called upon to\r\n\r\nbear  his  burden  of  responsibility.  However,  I\r\n\r\nhasten to assure the taxpayer that there will be no\r\n\r\nunduly  heavy  claims  on  his  purse.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nproposed to make any changes to the rates of income\r\n\r\ntax  next  year,  or  to  the  scales  of  personal\r\n\r\nreliefs. It is, however, intended to tighten up the\r\n\r\nprovisions against the evasion of income tax and to\r\n\r\nprovide the Comptroller with more extensive  powers\r\n\r\nthan  he now has to combat tax evasion. I have been\r\n\r\nin consultation with the Minister of Finance of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  and  we  are  in   complete\r\n\r\nagreement  that the war on evasion must be  stepped\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has one major tax proposal to\r\n\r\nannounce. This is the imposition of port  dues.  At\r\n\r\nthe present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoment,  other  than  the  wharves  and  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Singapore Harbour Board,  services\r\n\r\nto   shipping   by  way  of  harbour  control   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and other services have been  provided\r\n\r\nlargely by the Singapore taxpayer. Such charges  as\r\n\r\nare  levied  for  specific services,  such  as  the\r\n\r\ninspection  of  ships  by the  Surveyor-General  of\r\n\r\nShips  or  the Master Attendant, do not even  cover\r\n\r\nthe   cost  of  the  administration  of  these  two\r\n\r\nDepartments. Port conservancy has cost  $2  million\r\n\r\nper  annum  and the Government has willingly  borne\r\n\r\nthis.  The  port dues envisaged, however,  will  be\r\n\r\nmodest  ones and shipping interests will  be  fully\r\n\r\nconsulted  before they are implemented. It  is  not\r\n\r\nexpected  that  the  port dues under  consideration\r\n\r\nwill yield more than $2.5 million a year, and this,\r\n\r\ntaking   into  account  the  enormous  tonnage   of\r\n\r\nshipping  that  passes through the harbour,  is  an\r\n\r\nextremely light charge for the use of our port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from Port Dues will not be sufficient\r\n\r\nto  cover  the  estimated deficit. Other  means  of\r\n\r\nraising  revenue  may have to be considered.  There\r\n\r\nis,  however, one element in the financial position\r\n\r\nof   the   Singapore  Government  today  which   is\r\n\r\nunique - and,   before  this  source  of   additional\r\n\r\nfinance  has  been fully uncovered, the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes not intend to make any further incursions into\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers'  pocket. Should this,  however,  be\r\n\r\nnecessary, it is the intention of the Government to\r\n\r\nmake  marginal adjustments over a broad field.  The\r\n\r\nprincipal  sources  of  Government  revenue,   i.e.\r\n\r\nincome  tax,  customs duties on petrol and  liquor,\r\n\r\nwill  remain  as  they now are  in  any  review  of\r\n\r\ntaxation in 1960. There may be adjustments  to  the\r\n\r\ntax  on tobacco, depending on factors which I  have\r\n\r\npreviously discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new element in the situation to which I\r\n\r\nreferred above is the request made by the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to the U.K. Government that the cost  of\r\n\r\ndefence,  being a constitutional responsibility  of\r\n\r\nHer  Majesty's Government, should be borne by them.\r\n\r\nThe U.K. Government has agreed to study this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposal  in detail, but until now we have  had  no\r\n\r\nindication  what progress has been made  with  this\r\n\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of maintaining our Defence Forces is\r\n\r\nexpected  to amount to $9.3 million in the Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates,   and   $180,000  in   the   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.

The  budget\r\n\r\nis  designed to expand the economy. This budget has\r\n\r\nclaims to be called an \"expansion budget\". It  will\r\n\r\nstimulate  activity  in two  ways.  First  are  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial   outlays  on  development  expenditure\r\n\r\nwhich   will  lead  to  a  high  rate  of   capital\r\n\r\nformation. Second, by keeping domestic taxation  to\r\n\r\nits  present level, the consuming public will  reap\r\n\r\nthe full benefit of the expansion of the economy. I\r\n\r\nhope that this would not encourage the public to go\r\n\r\non  a  spending spree but rather to induce them  to\r\n\r\nput  aside,  as much as possible, their incomes  in\r\n\r\nthe form of investment for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, the Government can fairly\r\n\r\nclaim as a remarkable achievement the avoidance  of\r\n\r\nincreases on domestic taxation in the budget.  This\r\n\r\nshould provide some of the psychological impetus to\r\n\r\neconomic  expansion.  Nor  have  we  neglected  the\r\n\r\nclaims of the masses for better social services and\r\n\r\nfor  the  amelioration  of  the  condition  of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed. The country should now take  heart  and\r\n\r\nget down to the tasks that lie ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to pay a tribute to the Treasury\r\n\r\nofficials  upon whom the combined tasks of  pruning\r\n\r\nthis  year's  expenditure and drastically  amending\r\n\r\nthe  first  draft  estimates for  next  year,  have\r\n\r\nimposed  an  unprecedented burden. They have  borne\r\n\r\nthis  cheerfully  and  have applied  themselves  to\r\n\r\ntheir   work   with  dedication  and   skill.
