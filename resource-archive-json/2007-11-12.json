<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, inflation in Singapore is on a slightly rising trend.&nbsp; In the third quarter of 2007, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.7% year-on-year, compared to 1.0% in the second quarter and 0.5% in the first quarter. This reflects mainly higher food prices and the one-off effect of the increase in GST in July this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price of food, which is the largest component in the CPI basket, rose by 3.3% year-on-year in the third quarter.&nbsp; However, this third quarter figure does not yet include the most recent increases in the prices of flour and chicken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food prices have risen mainly due to dearer imports, arising from disruptions in supply in some of our major food import sources.&nbsp; Adverse weather conditions in Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia have reduced crop yield and supply, raising prices of rice and cereals, vegetables and dairy products.&nbsp; These supply disruptions have occurred against a backdrop of increased global demand for agricultural products, fuelled by rising living standards in emerging economies and higher bio-fuel production.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diversifying our food supply sources is one way we can reduce our vulnerability to such supply disruptions and maintain more stable food prices.&nbsp; However, diversification cannot protect us against a worldwide increase in food prices, such as is happening now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current uptick in inflation is a global phenomenon.&nbsp; In recent months, rapidly growing economies such as China and India as well as the developed economies, such as those in Europe, have experienced higher inflation. This is mostly due to higher food prices and <p align=left>Column: 2482<p>energy costs.&nbsp; Oil prices have reached historical highs in recent months, reflecting strong global demand, a relatively tight supply and low global inventories of oil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise in CPI inflation in Singapore has also reflected the impact of the GST increase.&nbsp; This was a one-off event that occurred when the GST was raised on 1st July 2007.&nbsp; On a month-on-month basis, overall CPI has reverted back within the range recorded in months before the GST increase.&nbsp; It increased by 0.3% in August 2007 and fell 0.3% in September 2007.&nbsp; But because of the way the CPI is calculated, the GST increase will continue to show up in higher CPI inflation figures for 12 months until June 2008, though to diminishing extents.&nbsp; More importantly, unlike food import prices, the GST increase has had only a limited impact on basic food prices as the major supermarket chains have been absorbing the GST increase for basic food items.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To mitigate the impact of the GST increase on the cost of living, the Government introduced the GST Offset Package earlier this year. The GST Offset Package will more than offset the impact of the higher GST on lower-income families.&nbsp; Middle-income Singaporeans have also enjoyed substantial benefits such as GST credits, utilities and rental rebates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pick-up in inflation in Singapore should also be viewed from the perspective of our rapid economic growth over the last three years.&nbsp; GDP has grown by more than 6.0% on average since 2003.&nbsp; Growth has also been broad-based, across all sectors of the economy.&nbsp; Wages have also been growing, especially last year and this year.&nbsp; Against this backdrop, we should not be surprised to see inflation rise above the unusually low levels seen in recent years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also be wary of interpreting a rise in the headline CPI as necessarily<p align=left>Column: 2483<p> reflecting an increase in the cost of living.&nbsp; First, the CPI measures average changes in prices across all households.&nbsp; Whether there is an increase in the cost of living for a particular household depends on that household's spending patterns.&nbsp; Switching to cheaper products can reduce the cost of living despite&nbsp; a rise in the CPI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, an increase in the CPI can sometimes reflect technical factors rather than an actual increase in prices faced by consumers.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the revision in annual value of HDB flats announced by IRAS this morning. The adjustment in annual values will translate into a notional increase in imputed rentals of owner-occupied HDB flats, and hence raise the CPI in the coming months. But as HDB flat owners do not pay rentals on the flats they own, they will not experience higher inflation as a result of this revision in annual values.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One important way the Government helps to keep inflation low in Singapore is through our monetary policy, ie, the policy on the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar.&nbsp; In recent years, MAS has been maintaining the exchange rate on a modest and gradually appreciating path.&nbsp; This strengthening Singapore dollar has helped to reduce imported inflation.&nbsp; If we had pursued a different exchange rate policy, such as one pegging our Singapore dollar to the US dollar, Singaporeans would have experienced higher inflation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's overall inflation is rising but is still low by international standards and in the context of the healthy growth in incomes that we have seen in recent years. The Government will continue to keep a tight watch to ensure that inflation remains low.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Another economist has also projected that inflation will hit 4% in the first half of next year.&nbsp; Can I have the Minister's comments on this, please?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, if inflation continues to rise, will there be other measures that the Government will put in place to help the vulnerable people such as the low-income and the elderly to cope with the cost of living?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained in my answer earlier, our CPI has been low for the first quarter and second quarter this year.&nbsp; The first quarter was 0.5% and the second quarter was 1%.&nbsp; It rose to 2.7% in the third quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be around 2.7% or even slightly higher.&nbsp; We expect the first quarter of next year to reach the peak of between 4% and maybe even 5%.&nbsp; This is because of the base effects of the first quarter of 2007 where we had very low transport CPI because of the changes that we made in our transport policies.&nbsp; We had low oil prices because in January/February 2007, oil prices were around US$50.&nbsp; By the end of this year and next year, we expect oil prices to be within US$90 or so and also because the effect of the GST increase continues on, as I mentioned, up to June 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that the headline CPI numbers will show an upward trend for the fourth quarter and also for the first half of next year.&nbsp; But we expect the trends to revert back to more normal conditions in the second half of next year.&nbsp; But even so, we expect the 2008 CPI numbers to be averaging around 3%.&nbsp; It will be higher than what we have been experiencing in the last few years.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I wonder if he could elaborate on whether the Government is looking at other sources of supply that we have not hitherto tapped on and what are these sources, and whether there is a chance that this will help us to stabilise food prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, have we fully exhausted our potential for local production of food?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Diversification of our supply sources is a general strategy, especially for food.&nbsp; Take, for example, the most recent increases in the third quarter where we saw a big increase in vegetable prices.&nbsp; This is largely because of the supply conditions in Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp; Obviously, if we can widen our sources of vegetable supplies to Thailand and China, this of course would mitigate the local supply disruptions that we face from Malaysia and Indonesia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if there is a worldwide increase in prices, for example, in corn feed, you will expect chicken prices to go up.&nbsp; Even though we are diversifying our sources of frozen chicken, not just from Australia and the US but also from Brazil - it is a very competitive source for chickens - but because of the worldwide increase in corn feed, we will expect even frozen&nbsp;chicken prices to go up.&nbsp; There is a certain extent that we can go in diversifying when it helps to mitigate local disruptions but, if it is a worldwide increase, I am afraid that we do not have that cushion.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I have two questions for the Minister.&nbsp; First of all, does the Minister see any impact on our competitiveness as far as businesses are concerned?&nbsp; Is inflation on the general cost increases affecting our ability to attract investors in the long run?&nbsp; Second, what is it that is going to happen that is going to make the second half inflation <p align=left>Column: 2486<p>come down, according to the Minister's forecast?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;We are tracking our competitiveness position very closely and, so far, we are in quite&nbsp;a good position for several reasons.&nbsp; First, as I explained earlier, our inflation rate, even though it is higher than what we have been experiencing, is still lower than in other countries.&nbsp; In that sense, comparatively, we are still better off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, even though wages had gone up last year, particularly the first three quarters of this year, we must see wages in the context of the last five to seven years where wages had not gone up so rapidly.&nbsp; So I do not think we should begrudge our workers for having their fair share of a wage increase in the last two years if we look at the broader 5-7 years' timeframe.&nbsp; But, more importantly, it is the productivity that we have been able to achieve.&nbsp; In the end, we have to look at the unit labour cost and not just wage increase.&nbsp; If we track the unit labour cost, we are still&nbsp;relatively well-off.&nbsp; We are watching these numbers closely but, right now, it has not affected our competitive position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why we estimate that&nbsp;inflation will tail down in the second half of next year is because of the base effects that I explained earlier.&nbsp; First, we had the GST increase which will continue, in technical terms, to be reflected in the CPI up to June 2008.&nbsp; So in the second half of next year, the&nbsp;effect of the&nbsp;GST increase&nbsp;will be worn off.&nbsp; Second, we had the transport effect.&nbsp; Some of the adjustments to our road tax and the various&nbsp;costs of owning cars resulted in low inflation in 2007 and, in 2008, because of the base effects, we will see a blip in the number.&nbsp; Third, of course, is the oil prices.&nbsp; If we look at the oil prices this year, there was a sharp downturn where oil prices dropped to between US$50 and US$60 in the first part of this year but, in the <p align=left>Column: 2487<p>second half, it has picked up.&nbsp; So, next year, again based on base effects, we&nbsp;expect to see the CPI being higher.&nbsp; But we expect the base effects to be washed out by the second half of next year.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Sir, as I explained&nbsp;in my answer, the MAS has been adopting an exchange rate policy that allows the Singapore dollar to appreciate gradually and modestly&nbsp;since&nbsp;April last year, and therefore it has helped us, because of the strengthening of the Singapore dollar, to reduce imported inflation.&nbsp; Again, in October this year, the MAS, in looking at the exchange rate policy,&nbsp;decided to allow the gradual and modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar&nbsp;at a slightly faster rate.&nbsp; So we are allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate a bit more and this, of course, means that we&nbsp;have a better buffer against imported inflation.&nbsp; But as Dr Lily Neo has mentioned, the trade-off is, of course, we have to watch our export competitiveness, not just in terms of the tourism industry but, overall, in our exports.&nbsp; So this is the trade-off and the balance that we have to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;composition of the CPI is reflected in fairly great detail.&nbsp; In fact, in the basket that we use to compute the CPI, food constitutes 23%, and there is a very detailed breakdown of uncooked food, cooked food, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very detailed<p align=left>Column: 2488<p> breakdown of what constitutes that 23% of food within the CPI basket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, transport is the second biggest item - around 21%-22%.&nbsp; And in that transport component, we break it down further into public transport, private transport and the different impact of the different components.&nbsp; So it is very detailed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, I am sure Members will remember that we also&nbsp;measure the CPI affecting different income levels - the bottom 20%, the top 20% and the middle 60%.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deferred Payment Scheme (DPS) was introduced in 1997.&nbsp; If Members will recall, that was at a time when the economy was in recession and the property market was in&nbsp;the doldrums.&nbsp; It is no longer relevant given the strong property market conditions today.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the DPS was withdrawn only on 26th October 2007 - slightly over two weeks ago - it is too early to ascertain the overall impact of the withdrawal.&nbsp; However, I believe that, over time, the withdrawal of the DPS will encourage home-buyers to be more financially prudent, and dampen some of the speculative <p align=left>Column: 2489<p>activities in the market.&nbsp; The withdrawal of the DPS should not unduly affect genuine home-buyers as they&nbsp;should be able to obtain home loans from banks.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Government will continue to closely monitor the property market to ensure that our prices are supported by economic fundamentals.&nbsp; In addition, the Government will ensure that there is sufficient supply to meet the demand for private housing. &nbsp;There is no need and we are not considering any new measure for the property market at the moment.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Second, whether MND would influence other agencies through fiscal policies, such as perhaps raising the reserve ratio or interest rates in response to managing the rising property prices in Singapore?&nbsp; Third, what specific plans does the Ministry have in the next three years to ease the rising property prices in Singapore?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp;Sir, first of all, on the supply, there are two ways that supply comes into the market.&nbsp; One, of course, is from the private developers and, two, through Government land sales.&nbsp; Private developers would have to decide based on the land banking that they have undertaken, how much land to release and when.&nbsp; The Government land sales (GLS) programme is conducted twice a year.&nbsp; Every six months, we review the demand/supply situation and we put out a slate of lands for sale under the GLS, on the reserve list as well as on the confirmed list.&nbsp; For example, in the second half 2007 GLS programme that was announced not too long ago, we put up<p align=left>Column: 2490<p> 20 new sites just for private residential development alone, and these 20 new sites would yield something like 8,000 units, including EC sites.&nbsp; So, if there is a necessity and if demand continues to be strong, we will be prepared to release even more sites in the first half 2008 GLS programme.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we have to be mindful that we take not just a short term but also a medium and a longer term view of the market. We must therefore be mindful that we do not also create an over supply situation in the longer term.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also remind Singaporeans that the stock of private residential units in the pipeline is not insignificant.&nbsp; As at the end of the third quarter 2007, there was a supply in the pipeline of about 65,000 units and this, in fact, was higher than the supply in the pipeline as at the end of the second quarter of about 56,000 units.&nbsp; Of the 65,000 units that are in the pipeline, either being built or with planning permission to build&nbsp; -&nbsp; in other words, the developers have already applied to build these units - approximately two-thirds of the 65,000 units, or around 40,000 units, are likely to be built and made available over the next three years.&nbsp; If Singaporeans are aware of these figures - and these are the numbers that we put out regularly and constantly - there is really no reason for Singaporeans to panic and to feel that there is a real shortage in the medium term.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked what is going to happen in the next three years, whether we are going to ease property prices.&nbsp; First of all, we make known what is the supply situation as far as we can see - what has been committed for building, what is likely to be built.&nbsp; We also put out information like how much land is going to be made available for the private sector to bid for.&nbsp; And, cumulatively, we hope to build up a store of information, of knowledge among the community, so that<p align=left>Column: 2491<p> people will make informed decisions about purchases of property, rather than to be swayed by newspaper headlines or by property agents or by friends who are talking around the coffee table.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the position that the Government takes.&nbsp; We will provide information on the supply and demand situation.&nbsp; We will put out supply as much as we can, taking into account the medium and long term positions.&nbsp; Our bias is really not to over regulate or to interfere in the market if we have to.&nbsp; We want to make sure that the market grows in a healthy and sustained manner.&nbsp; We monitor the growth rate of the market in relation to the growth of the economy, and we make sure that growth is supported by economic fundamentals.&nbsp; I think that is the right way to go about it, and that is what we intend to do.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in so far as demand is concerned, if there is excessive speculative demand, then there is really no need for us to encourage it.&nbsp; We may look at ways in which to diminish it, and this is the context in which the decision to withdraw the DPS was taken.&nbsp; The DPS, while necessary 10 years ago in order to encourage people to come into the market, is no longer relevant today.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho also asked whether we will talk to the other agencies, like the MAS, to see how we can influence property prices.&nbsp; The various Government agencies do get together and we monitor the market very closely.&nbsp; And if there is a need for us to act, obviously, we would take the necessary measures.&nbsp; But, as I said in my reply, at this point in time, there is no need and there is no intention for us to take any further action.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Because a lot of newly-wed couples are coming to see us and saying that they find difficulty in getting new flats.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; Sir, in the same way that we are monitoring the private housing market, we are also monitoring the public housing market.&nbsp; And we will similarly make sure that there is sufficient supply coming on stream in terms of public housing.&nbsp; But having said that, I must also caution that it is not a good idea for us to be building new HDB flats in order to cater for all the demand that is coming on stream.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; Part of the demand that is coming on stream from newly-wed couples, for example, should rightly be met not only by new flats but also by going into the resale market.&nbsp; If we were to build only new flats in order to cater to this demand, then we are building up an over supply situation in the long term.&nbsp; Because, one day, there will be a need for these couples to sell off for whatever reason.&nbsp; Then there would be an over supply situation if we are not careful.&nbsp; So there is a need for us to balance - whether it is private housing or public housing - the supply/demand situation, not just in the immediate term but also in the longer term.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Member will recall, when we were building new flats to cater for demand, there was a lot of pressure for us to build new flats as there was a long queue by first-timers as well as second-timers. When we did so, eventually, when the market turned, what happened?&nbsp; The queue disappeared and we ended up with a stock of unsold flats, which took HDB many years to clear.&nbsp; So we have to learn a lesson from this.&nbsp; We have to make sure that when we build new flats, we take into account the longer term demand<p align=left>Column: 2493<p> situation, and we also take into account the fact that one day, there will be a turnover of flats.&nbsp; But, just to assure the Member, yes, we are ramping up the new flat building programme.&nbsp; In fact, we have already announced that we are going to ramp up the programme very sharply this year and next year.&nbsp; But, at the same time, we have also made it very clear that this is not going to meet the demand from every single newly-wed couple wanting to own a flat, particularly when they want to own a flat in a desirable location.&nbsp; This is where we have to continue to educate our flat buyers.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> What is the number that will be built?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp;For this year, under the BTO programme, we have announced that we are going to add another 4,000 units from now onwards to the middle of next year, which is much higher than the building programme that we have been undertaking up to now.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> &nbsp; Sir, I would like to clarify with the Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the HDB will definitely have the number of newly-weds who are actually waiting for their flats.&nbsp; By meeting their demand, I do not see how the HDB will over build and end up with a demand/supply problem.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:&nbsp;</B> &nbsp;Mr Speaker, if every newly-wed couple bought a flat and stay there for the rest of their life, I do not think that would be an issue.

And also from our perspective&nbsp;and&nbsp;understanding, right now, many of the wakes are actually conducted, as the Member said, at the void decks,&nbsp;on the streets as well as public roads.&nbsp; In view of a potential increase in such wakes in our country,&nbsp;we are basically taking a view about what we need to do for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, we have a model that we think is probably a better alternative - a model that basically puts a purpose-built funeral parlour where all the services are put together, it is air-conditioned, it is held indoor.&nbsp; We have all the conditions that we have thought through, including not allowing procession to be carried on the street, allowing incense only to be burnt indoor and with air pollution control measures.&nbsp; So, we believe that the traditional rite and ritual funeral wakes can actually be carried out in an environment that is more controlled and&nbsp;cleaner, and it is probably quieter for everybody in that environment.&nbsp; This is something that we are planning for the future.&nbsp; We have seen better alternatives of&nbsp;funeral parlours in other countries.&nbsp; I think it is only right for us to consider these models for a very small country like Singapore where we are living close by to one another.&nbsp; It may not be an immediate issue as we do not receive many complaints.&nbsp; But, I think, it is an issue that we need to deal with&nbsp;in the longer term.&nbsp; As I said, we have already decided to delay the funeral parlour construction until a time when the industrial site is developed, and we will take into consideration issues that have been raised by residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just like to say that although the issue about complaints may not be a <p align=left>Column: 2499<p>very critical one at the moment, but we do receive&nbsp;complaints from residents.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MEDISHIELD--><p align=left>Column: 2499<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:MEDISHIELD:::2500--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But I have some views on the deductible for the enhanced MediShield, which&nbsp;I purposely set it a bit high at $3,000 because I was not sure then.&nbsp; But&nbsp;looking at the data the last few months, it suggests that maybe there is some scope to reduce that deductible perhaps by about $500.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir<B>,</B> Basic MediShield and the enhanced rider plans offered by private insurers are all self-funded.&nbsp; In other words, the premiums collected from policyholders must more than cover the anticipated payouts claimed by patients.&nbsp; For the plans to be sustainable, premiums are determined on an actuarially-sound basis.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons with congenital illnesses can join MediShield to obtain coverage for <p align=left>Column: 2501<p>medical treatment that is not related to their congenital condition.&nbsp; However, it will be unusual for insurers to cover pre-existing illnesses or to cover treatment related to known congenital conditions.&nbsp; To do so will be to load the burden on the rest of the policyholders who may not support a manifold increase in premiums to take on this additional liability.&nbsp; More importantly, if MediShield were to cover pre-existing illnesses, it will encourage potential policyholders to delay subscription until they are sick.&nbsp; This will defeat the whole principle of insurance which is based on the sharing of burden among policyholders with similar risk profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, some private insurers do offer cash benefit products which pay lump sum amounts if a baby is diagnosed with specific congenital anomalies.&nbsp; They include the Prudential PruSmart Lady's Maternity Rider, HSBC Lady FirstCare, and NTUC i-Maternity.&nbsp; Subscription to these products must of course be made prior to the discovery of any known congenital anomaly.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for children attending special schools or with special needs, the basis of coverage is the same as the basis for other children, that is, they should be healthy at the point of entry and have no pre-existing illnesses.&nbsp; We therefore encourage all parents, including those who have children with special needs, to cover them under MediShield as soon as possible, before they develop any other illnesses that could disqualify them in future.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So when congenital or pre-existing medical conditions are excluded, families have to pay lump sum expenses themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially hardship for the low-income<p align=left>Column: 2502<p> and even average-income families.&nbsp; I would like to ask if, since MediShield itself is administered by CPF, the Minister would consider&nbsp;studying having MediShield include pre-existing or congenital conditions for these children up to, say, a maximum claim limit of $200,000, which is the current MediShield limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if there is a need&nbsp;for extra loading, then perhaps those who can afford can pay themselves.&nbsp; But the Government can do&nbsp;something for those who cannot afford.&nbsp; So I would like to ask the Minister to consider this.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> &nbsp; Sir, I am sympathetic to those parents&nbsp;- a small minority of parents - with children born with such congenital difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;About three years ago, I had in fact asked our actuaries and&nbsp;consultants to take a look at how much would this additional burden be because if it is quite inexpensive to load onto the rest of the population,&nbsp;I could try to make a case to let us share this burden.&nbsp; I was hoping that the increase in the premiums on Basic MediShield, if we take on this additional liability, was not too much.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MediShield premium&nbsp;for&nbsp;a young Singaporean&nbsp;below 30 years of age today, I think,&nbsp;is only $30 a year which is very inexpensive.&nbsp; But if we were to load this liability on - I rely on my memory now - the consultants' recommendation would be something like a seven-fold increase,&nbsp;so from $30&nbsp;per year to something like more than $200 per year, and even then, it is to&nbsp;limit the payout to just the first year of birth, in other words,&nbsp;before the child hits one year old.&nbsp; That is the difficulty we are faced with.&nbsp; And to load such&nbsp;hefty increase of premiums&nbsp;onto the rest of the population I think it is hard to justify.&nbsp; So we have to look for other means, which is the families themselves, and of course the society.&nbsp; Where they require additional medical treatment, then Medifund can come in, and we can be more helpful by making use of Medifund as a tool.&nbsp; Of course, NGOs, VWOs on <p align=left>Column: 2503<p>specific causes, if they want to chip in, I think that is certainly welcomed.&nbsp; So I am afraid to load it onto the rest of the population with such hefty increase of premiums, I would find it very difficult to explain and&nbsp;justify.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But I&nbsp;also asked them to study how to load it onto all pregnancies so that as&nbsp;soon as you discover you are pregnant, buy an insurance policy which&nbsp;would then cover all these eventualities.&nbsp; It is the same old thing.&nbsp; The premium is hefty, and to make it compulsory, it becomes very difficult for us to justify.&nbsp; It was because of those series of enquiries and discussions I had with the private insurers,&nbsp;which led&nbsp;to products which I have just named a while ago, which are offered by NTUC i-Maternity, and so on.&nbsp; Even then, the insurers were careful in not saying that the insurance would then cover all medical treatments.&nbsp; It just says that if the baby is unfortunately born with certain conditions,&nbsp;here is the cash amount which you can claim, and&nbsp;how you spend the money is left to the parents.&nbsp; I will continue to look at the other countries on how they take care of problems like this through the insurance route, but because of our very small market, unfortunately, the situation is what I have just described.</p></div></span>\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2504<p>\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I asked CPF yesterday and they confirmed the policy.&nbsp; They will not cover conditions related to a congenital condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance will not cover treatment related to a congenital condition.&nbsp; But if you pay the insurance, you can cover for treatments for all the other conditions that may crop up - cough and cold, whatever that may crop up -&nbsp;like any other normal child.&nbsp; So&nbsp;my advice remains: please immediately go&nbsp;and insure your child now and do not wait when he actually falls sick, then you may find&nbsp;the insurance company is not willing to take your case.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CYBER/GAMING CAFES--><p align=left>Column: 2504<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CYBER/GAMING CAFES:::2512--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We have adopted a proactive approach to educate our students on the risks of cyber addictions and on responsible use of the Internet.&nbsp; Schools also actively advise students against frequenting computer games centres or cyber cafes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, MOE provides a Cyber-wellness Framework to support and guide schools in planning their cyber-wellness programmes.&nbsp; Using this framework, schools plan and implement school-based programmes and instructional materials to suit the needs of their students.&nbsp; These programmes could take the form of assembly talks, workshops or they could<p align=left>Column: 2508<p> be infused into the curriculum.&nbsp; For example, issues of cyber-wellness and Internet safety are used as contexts in the Civics and Moral Education (CME) lessons where appropriate.&nbsp; In these lessons, teachers are encouraged to use current and real life examples as context for discussion of issues of cyber-wellness and Internet.&nbsp; For example, at Ang Mo Kio Secondary School, topics, such as blogging, Internet gaming and cyber bullying, have been included during the CME lessons.&nbsp; Teachers in the school share strategies and approaches among themselves in dealing with these topics in their classrooms.&nbsp; Their focus is on promoting cyber-wellness and guiding their students in applying good values when using the Internet.&nbsp; MOE is in the process of preparing a cyber-wellness resource kit to complement the schools' efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than the Cyber-wellness Framework, schools also use the Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) Framework to develop the social and emotional competencies of students.&nbsp; This includes educating students against cyber addictions through exercising self-control over their own behaviour and actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools' Full-Time School Counsellors have undergone training on managing addictive behaviour, including cyber addiction.&nbsp; Schools also draw on the support from external agencies and organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Touch Community Services, supported by partners such as National Youth Council (NYC) and National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation (NYGR), has been conducting cyber-wellness programmes for our schools, as well as for&nbsp;parents.&nbsp; Schools welcome and value the involvement and support of parents to play their part in the prevention of cyber addictions and delinquent behaviours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will continue to monitor and review the situation and see how we can better support our schools in their efforts<p align=left>Column: 2509<p> to educate their students on cyber-wellness.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Because of that, he has also incurred a lot of debts, so to speak.&nbsp; That is why I am asking the question of the three Ministries.&nbsp; And I want to know&nbsp;from the MOE's point of view whether, despite having set up all the wellness programmes, the discipline masters in the schools are empowered to deal with any of the students who are caught in all these LAN centres gaming away during school hours and sometimes within the proximity of the schools as well.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, our schools adopt a variety of approaches.&nbsp; Some schools would use their discipline masters, teachers or even&nbsp;parent volunteers sometimes to visit some of the shopping centres and shopping malls around the school to ensure that their students&nbsp;do not misbehave.&nbsp; Sometimes, they received information and went to check on these cyber centres.&nbsp; Once the students are discovered to have cyber addiction, the schools will usually counsel them and try to understand better the problems that these students face.&nbsp; Sometimes, the issues are not just because of<p align=left>Column: 2510<p> cyber addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&nbsp;could be&nbsp;many related issues, such as family background, influence by peers as well as other issues like stress, and so on.&nbsp; These are all related issues.&nbsp; So the schools have to take a holistic approach.&nbsp; Through our Full-Time School Counsellors, we take a pro-active approach to counsel these students and find ways to help them.&nbsp; So I would like to encourage Ms Lee to ask&nbsp;her nephew to approach the school.&nbsp; We will work with the school, his parents and&nbsp;families to find different ways to help him.&nbsp; As the circumstances are quite unique in each case, it would be difficult to generalise exactly how we approach the issue.&nbsp; But, in general, we can say that the schools do take a very serious view and, whenever we come across such problems, we will try to take a pro-active approach through our counselling framework, our schools and teachers as well as other partners in this area to extend a helping hand to the family as well as the student involved.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CYBER/GAMING CAFES--><p align=left>Column: 2510<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CYBER/GAMING CAFES:::2512--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

To address this issue, my Ministry supports various Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) in their initiatives to help youths, and their parents, take a healthier approach to cyber gaming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;the Minister of State Mr Gan Kim Yong has mentioned, TOUCH Community Services&nbsp;started Project CRUSH (Cyberspace Risks and where U Seek Help) in 2001 to educate students on cyber-risks and equip them to better manage their time and handle any negative effects of their online experience. Casework and counselling services are also provided for youths who face specific addiction problems, such as addiction to cyber gaming.&nbsp; Since its inception, Project CRUSH has reached out to more than 130,000 secondary school students.&nbsp; Other&nbsp;VWOs, such as Fei Yue Community Services, also provide cyber-wellness and counselling services to youths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, TOUCH Youth was commissioned by the NYGR and NYC to conduct a series of cyber-wellness workshops in conjunction with the World Cyber Games 2007 to encourage youths to adopt a balanced lifestyle. &nbsp;The workshops, which also targeted parents, provided information on the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between the real and virtual worlds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also helping parents and educators. &nbsp;In 2005, under an initiative by the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation (NYGR), the National Youth Council helped to develop a guidebook for parents, youth developers and educators on the potential online risks faced by young people.&nbsp; The book carries practical tips on how to help young people manage these risks. &nbsp;Copies of the guidebook have also been sent to all primary and secondary schools, tertiary institutions and voluntary welfare organisations.&nbsp; They are also given out to parents during cyber-wellness talks organ-<p align=left>Column: 2512<p>ised by schools and youth organisations.&nbsp; NYGR has also established a fund to encourage VWOs and Youth Organisations to run cyber-wellness programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst NYGR works with various VWOs and community partners to help our youths strike a healthy balance between cyber gaming and their studies and other pursuits, the role of the family, especially the parents, cannot be over-emphasised.&nbsp; I understand that it is not easy for&nbsp;parents, but they&nbsp;must make the effort to spend time with their children to help them develop good judgement and the right values so that they do not spend excessive time on cyber gaming to their detriment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The industry is also doing its part to tackle this issue.&nbsp; The Singapore LAN gaming centre association - the Private Network Alliance (PNA) - has made it their responsibility to set up a monitoring system to track the usage of individual customers, and to train staff to identify and counsel customers who seem to spend too much time on gaming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global trends indicate that cyber gaming is here to stay.&nbsp; Cyber gaming is, however, not a bad activity in itself.&nbsp; It can help keep youths engaged, encourage creativity, and develop quick thinking skills.&nbsp; But the issue is one of balance and education, so that youths maximise the benefits and manage the risks properly.&nbsp; The solution lies in inculcating in people the right values so that they can exercise discretion and good judgement while enjoying these games and reap the benefits. &nbsp;In this respect, industry players, schools, parents, VWOs and the Government all have their roles to play so that young people can enjoy cyber gaming in a healthy manner.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:FIRE INSURANCE FOR STALLHOLDERS--><p align=left>Column: 2512<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:FIRE INSURANCE FOR STALLHOLDERS:::2515--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>FIRE INSURANCE FOR STALLHOLDERS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp; <B>Mr Inderjit Singh</B> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources<p align=left>Column: 2513<p> in light of the recent market fire at Ang Mo Kio Street 61 whether the Ministry will consider (i) making fire insurance compulsory for all stallholders who rent stalls from the National Environment Agency; and (ii) building the insurance premium into the rental which stallholders pay for renting their stalls.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc.

These are jobs which are of higher skill.&nbsp; But, over the years, we have been helping PMETs who have lost their jobs to get jobs which are suitable to their needs. And this assistance has been given by the DCNs, including Community Development Councils, self-help groups, SNEF and other agencies.&nbsp; But, overall, in general, I would say that the unemployment rate amongst PMETs has declined and re-employment rate has improved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you some figures on the re-employment rate of PMETs who have lost their jobs.&nbsp; In June 2004, 58.5% were re-employed within a period of six months after losing their jobs; in June 2005, 64.5%; and in June 2006, 72.6%.&nbsp; Unemployment rate amongst PMETs has also declined over the years and lower compared to the overall resident unemployment rate.&nbsp; In 2003, for example, 4.1% resident PMETs lost their jobs or unemployed, compared to 5.9% of overall resident unemployment.&nbsp; In 2004, 3.8% for PMETs and 5.8% amongst resident workforce.&nbsp; In 2006, 2.9% amongst PMETs and 4.5% amongst resident unemployed, overall.&nbsp; So, overall, unemployment<p align=left>Column: 2518<p> rate has declined and re-employment has improved. Yes, we may still have people who have difficulties in getting the jobs that they want, but the jobs that people take up may depend on their own ability and their interest.

This will become part of the business strategy of companies that have embraced this service excellence strategy.&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked whether we recognise champions.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, we do. We have service excellence awards which were launched in 2006. These give accolades to organisations for service excellence. We also have excellence service awards which are given to individuals who have delivered outstanding service in the<p align=left>Column: 2521<p> course of their work. So we do give recognition to leaders in the service excellence movement.&nbsp; Mdm Ho also asked about introducing some kind of indicator.&nbsp; I am pleased to let Mdm Ho know that we will indeed be looking at customer satisfaction index for Singapore and this will be released sometime early 2008. This will help us track the service satisfaction level from our customers. This survey will be conducted and&nbsp;released in the early part of 2008.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SOLAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGY--><p align=left>Column: 2521<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SOLAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGY:::2522--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SOLAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGY</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min</B> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the current extent of energy supply from solar energy technology; and (b) whether there are long-term plans to tap on this alternative source of energy, in view of the high oil prices and finite supply of oil and natural gases.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the use of solar energy in Singapore is still very limited. Our total installed capacity for generating solar energy is currently only 0.15 megawatts, compared with our peak electricity demand of more than 5,000 megawatts.&nbsp; Even buildings with installations for tapping solar energy cannot meet their own needs from solar energy generated, and they have to tap electricity from the grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This situation is not unique to Singapore. The use of solar energy is still in its infancy in most parts of the world.&nbsp; According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewables such as geothermal, wind, solar and other combustible waste accounted for only 2% of global electricity generated in 2004. Solar photovoltaics (PV) alone accounted for just 0.005%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason is cost.&nbsp; Current technologies for tapping solar energy are still not efficient.&nbsp; Solar-derived electricity is thus two to three times more expensive<p align=left>Column: 2522<p> than our electricity tariffs for households.&nbsp; While costs will decline with the advent of better technology, fossil fuels such as oil and gas will still remain a dominant part of the global fuel mix in the medium term.&nbsp; Singapore is no exception.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless, our energy strategy is to continue to diversify our energy sources and invest in research and development in clean energy, including solar energy.&nbsp; To facilitate new energy technologies such as solar energy, we have adopted open and flexible regulations, such as removing the market participation fee for all facilities that are paid for export to the grid.&nbsp; EMA has also put out information on how to install and connect photovoltaic systems to the grid.&nbsp; The National Research Foundation has set aside $170 million for research into clean energy, with a focus on solar energy.&nbsp; EDB has launched a $17 million Clean Energy Research and Test-bedding platform to test-bed solar photovoltaics, and to determine the optimal solar energy systems for Singapore.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HEARING AND EYESIGHT PROBLEMS IN SENIOR CITIZENS--><p align=left>Column: 2522<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:HEARING AND EYESIGHT PROBLEMS IN SENIOR CITIZENS:::2524--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>HEARING AND EYESIGHT PROBLEMS IN SENIOR CITIZENS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Treatment--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Treatment)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

We have an urban population and basic healthcare is easily accessible.&nbsp; Residents are well served by family physicians and polyclinics for any screening of eyesight and hearing problems.&nbsp; Optometrists and opticians in shopping centres and HDB estates provide competent eye checks.&nbsp; When patients require further medical follow-up, they are referred to specialists for management.&nbsp; Needy patients are heavily subsidised and Medifund provides an additional financial safety net.&nbsp; Many voluntary welfare organisations supplement the Government's efforts with additional assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The survey quoted by Prof. Mehta asked very basic questions of its respondents.&nbsp; For example, it asked the residents,&nbsp;\"Do you have an eye or a vision problem?\".&nbsp; Given the high myopic rate of Singaporeans, we are surprised that only 14% of those above 55&nbsp;answered \"yes\" to such a question.&nbsp; Among these respondents, about half answered \"no\" to a question that asked, \"Are you receiving medical treatment from a doctor?\".&nbsp;As not all problems need to be attended to by doctors, the answer by these members of the public should be understood in that context.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key is to ensure that basic healthcare is available to all.&nbsp; In Singapore's situation, we believe that unmet medical needs are not a severe problem.&nbsp; But we can certainly do more to raise awareness amongst Singaporeans, both young and old, regarding the need to seek professional help for any eyesight or hearing problems.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2524<p>\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, this Bill transfers the functions and powers relating to scientific metrology from SPRING to A*STAR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metrology, Members may be interested to know, is the science of making accurate and reliable measurements.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is critical for industrial development, trade transactions and scientific research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, SPRING undertakes all areas of metrology through the National<p align=left>Column: 2526<p> Metrology Centre (NMC).&nbsp; These include standardisation, accreditation, certification and conformance as well as scientific metrology.&nbsp; NMC, therefore, maintains national measurement standards and develops measurement technology to administer these standards.</p><p><br><I>Reason for amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me elaborate on why we propose to transfer these functions to A*STAR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Harnessing synergy between metrology and R&amp;D</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, this transfer will allow Singapore to harness the synergy between metrology and research and development (R&amp;D). &nbsp;New technological advances will increase the demands for research on metrology.&nbsp; As industries need more complex and exacting requirements, measurement ranges need to have lower thresholds of uncertainty or error.&nbsp; Emerging fields, such as nanotechnology, MEMS and biomedical sciences, will also need highly sensitive measurement techniques.&nbsp; Cutting-edge metrology will require sustained scientific research.&nbsp; And positioning the NMC within A*STAR will allow for such collaboration&nbsp; and harness this synergy between metrology and scientific R&amp;D.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Alignment with industry's advanced technological needs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the transfer will enable us to better meet industry's advanced technological needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the semiconductor industry, new metrology tools and techniques are needed to accurately perform critical measurements, as new materials, processes and device structures are developed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of nanotechnology, new metrology tools have to be developed to<p align=left>Column: 2527<p> enable precise fabrication at nanoscale levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Consistency with international practice</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the positioning of the NMC within A*STAR will align us with international practice.&nbsp; Leading metrology centres around the world have adopted a strong R&amp;D focus and are often integrated with national research agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States is a prime example of a world-leading research-driven metrology centre.&nbsp; NIST researchers continually raise the level of measurement science and technology, making possible the highly precise engineering and manufacturing capabilities required for today's most advanced technologies.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed transfer will not affect SPRING's role as the national standards, accreditation and conformance body.&nbsp; These remain relevant to SPRING's mission to help our enterprises stay competitive in a dynamic market environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, measurement science and technology are essential elements in facilitating a knowledge-based economy. This Bill allows A*STAR to establish and support an advanced national metrology infrastructure, which will serve to strengthen Singapore's competitive position in the global market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr S Iswaran].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:GENEVA CONVENTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 2528<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:GENEVA CONVENTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL:::2532--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>GENEVA CONVENTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.10 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In times of armed conflict, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 lay down basic humanitarian rules to be observed by all parties. One such rule is to recognise certain universal symbols which confer protection on authorised emergency relief agencies.&nbsp; These include military medical services and the international relief organisations.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Geneva Conventions, the Red Cross and the Swiss flag, which is the Red Cross with colours reversed, were the original protected symbols. &nbsp;But while the original intention of the Red Cross was to be a universally-recognised neutral emblem, several Islamic countries had objected to its usage.&nbsp; As a result, Red Cross societies were not recognised in these states. &nbsp;In order to enable emergency relief efforts in these states, the Red Crescent and the Red Lion and Sun emblems were created and added to the Geneva Conventions.&nbsp; But these new emblems were themselves viewed by others as possessing religious connotations.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given these difficulties, the Geneva Conventions introduced another emblem, the Red Crystal.&nbsp; It was designed to be easily recognised and devoid of religious connotations, such that it can be accepted by all countries, regardless of religious orientation.&nbsp; A new protocol, the Third Additional Protocol (APIII) to the Geneva Conventions, was introduced in 2005 to recognise the Red Crystal as an additional universal symbol.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2529<p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore subscribes to the Geneva Conventions and&nbsp;we have&nbsp;signed the APIII.&nbsp; To date, 87 countries have signed the APIII and 19 have ratified it. &nbsp;To play our part as an international citizen, my Ministry therefore proposes that Singapore's Geneva Conventions Act be amended and ratified to extend legal protection to all these emblems.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now take this House through the amendments.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the use of any of these emblems, including colourable imitations, will not be allowed in Singapore from now onwards unless approval is given by the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; Organisations and businesses, which currently use trademark symbols similar to these distinctive emblems for their products or services, will be given a grace period of up to a year to take the necessary measures to comply with the Act.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the maximum penalty for misuse of any of the emblems will be increased from $1,000 to $10,000.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the amended Act will allow for the appointment of public officers as Inspectors to investigate offences in relation to the misuse of the emblems.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments are necessary to ensure that the distinctive emblems are readily recognised and respected in Singapore as trusted symbols of protection and humanitarian aid.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry will work with the Singapore Red Cross Society to educate the general public, businesses and other organisations on the importance of respecting these distinctive emblems.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun and the Red Crystal represent international humanitarian movement emblems with millions of volunteers worldwide whose stated mission is to protect the human race without any discrimination based on nationality, race or religious beliefs.&nbsp; The existence of these movements is aimed at promoting mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace among people the world over.&nbsp; Thus, efforts by the Government to protect all these emblems from being misused are indeed welcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to highlight, Sir, that there are many and a variety of organisations and products currently using, in whole or part, some of the emblems in discussion.&nbsp; These may include private ambulance companies, non-Governmental organisations, pharmaceutical companies on the best of healthcare responders to mass casualty and disaster events, and even on T-shirts.&nbsp; No doubt the 12-month grace period is given, but I would like to&nbsp;ask that the Ministry come up with a public awareness and education programme, which I hear they are going to work with the Red Cross Association, on a wide scale to enhance and increase the spread of information to ensure compliance.&nbsp; Perhaps we can also consider writing in to the companies and organisations which are affected informing them of this decision.&nbsp; It could also be publicised on relevant websites as indicated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many medical units still have their men carry the Red Cross logo on their arms and armbands and also on their uniforms,&nbsp;essentially to depict that it is a medical response team, or even on the medical response vehicles.&nbsp; It appears to be a universal medical or medical<p align=left>Column: 2531<p> response sign.&nbsp; Thus, for this enforcement to be effected and effective, we need that awareness creation, adequate explanation and formal information to be given out adequately.&nbsp; The essence of it all is that the new legislation will prevent any misuse on the use of such symbols.&nbsp; In fact, it is important to have symbols that are easily recognisable; yet, at the same time, acceptable to all people of different faiths and beliefs.&nbsp; It is also only through common acceptance that we can promote better understanding of one another.&nbsp; While we want to encourage our people to be more creative, we would never allow them to break the law</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, yesterday there were two members of the public who approached me and asked whether the tone and the shade of the red on the cross would make any difference, and I told them certainly it would.&nbsp; It would again be useful for the&nbsp;Ministry to clarify that&nbsp;publicly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment of public officers as inspectors to investigate offences in relation to the misuse of the&nbsp;emblems is indeed practical and necessary as it underlies our true&nbsp;intentions&nbsp;of safeguarding and protecting the&nbsp;emblems from being misused.&nbsp; Finally, Sir, would it be possible for the Ministry and perhaps the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, or IPOS, to assist with the provision of a toll-free number&nbsp;that will allow members of the public to&nbsp;call and inform if they notice any improper use of the emblems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This morning, while coming to work, three ambulances from three different nursing homes overtook me.&nbsp; I gave way of course.&nbsp; But I paid&nbsp;particular attention&nbsp;to the logos they used.&nbsp; None of the them flouted the Geneva Conventions as they used different&nbsp;but acceptable symbols to do with health, like&nbsp;the traditional serpent.&nbsp; One of them used a red cross, but a stylised cross and in a different colour.&nbsp; So, I think they are permissible symbols.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we will work with IPOS, through their website as well as through their Trademarks Office, to publicise this more.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rational healthcare policies are underpinned by accurate and timely information.&nbsp; For example, should we promote regular breast screening among Singaporean women?&nbsp; If so, for which age groups and at what frequency?&nbsp; Settling such policies requires robust analysis of cost-effectiveness and survival data, without which our decisions will be merely arbitrary or based on data drawn from other countries which may or may not apply to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Good information is especially critical when we have to deal with diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and kidney failure that are major causes of death and morbidity among Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways to collect such information.&nbsp; We do so through periodic surveys but such data can only provide a snapshot of the prevailing situation at a particular point in time.&nbsp; We need to supplement this with continuous time-series data which tracks the incidence and the outcomes of the disease in the population.&nbsp; A well established method for gathering such information is through setting up a national disease registry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With time-series data collected by the registry, we can answer many critical health policy questions,&nbsp;for example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;What is the number of new cases of a disease every year - is it&nbsp;rising or&nbsp;falling?&nbsp; Do we need to adjust the type of health services to meet this changing trend?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;Is the disease affecting a particular segment of the population more than the others - how can we better target our prevention and treatment programmes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;How do people suffering from the chronic disease fare? How long do they<p align=left>Column: 2534<p> survive and how do we compare with other countries?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;Have prevention and treatment programmes made a difference?</p><p><br>&nbsp;<I>Disease Registries</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1968, we set up our first disease registry, which was the Singapore Cancer Registry.&nbsp; So this was almost 40 years ago.&nbsp; This was followed by the Heart Registry in 1988 and the Renal Registry in 1993.&nbsp; Currently, the Stroke Registry is being piloted in some public hospitals.&nbsp; These four registries make up our National Registry of Diseases.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good national registry must meet two criteria.&nbsp; First, it must be comprehensive, ie,&nbsp; it should cover all cases or almost all cases&nbsp;in the country.&nbsp; If a Registry misses out a significant segment of the population, this may result in under or over reporting of disease burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the registry must be well maintained with close tracking of how the disease progresses over time.&nbsp; This requires the submission of individualised information, so that new data can be matched with existing data in the registry, thus avoiding any double-counting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current disease registries suffer a major limitation&nbsp;because it is based on voluntary reporting.&nbsp; While public hospitals have been forthcoming in reporting, many private hospitals have largely not taken part.&nbsp; As a result, our registries are incomplete.&nbsp; A major concern of the healthcare providers is the lack of clarity on the legal basis for the disclosure of individualised information to disease registries, whether they will be breaching medical confidentiality.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Legislation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formal attempts at registering diseases date back to 1728,&nbsp; the year of<p align=left>Column: 2535<p> London's first General Census of Cancer.&nbsp; This was followed by attempts in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, among other countries.&nbsp; Most of these attempts failed due to incompleteness of data, as the reporting was voluntary.&nbsp; The breakthrough came from the United States where a regulation was enacted in 1939, requiring reporting of all cancer cases diagnosed in New York State.&nbsp; Since then, the US has made cancer reporting mandatory in most of its states.&nbsp; Similar laws have been passed over the last 50 years in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Germany, just to name a few.&nbsp; We have studied their legislation&nbsp;and drawn on relevant features when drafting our own&nbsp;Bill.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Registry of Diseases Bill makes it mandatory for healthcare institutions to submit relevant epidemiological data to the National Registry of Diseases for public policy and planning purposes.&nbsp; The Bill also commits MOH to responsible stewardship in the storage and disclosure of registry data&nbsp;by ensuring that patient confidentiality is observed by all persons who maintain and use the data.&nbsp; The Registry is already subject to stringent governance standards in securing the information collected and protecting patient confidentiality.&nbsp; The Bill articulates these practices and provides for powers of enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><I>Objectives</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill aims to achieve four objectives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>One: Comprehensive coverage</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill makes it mandatory for the manager of a healthcare institution to notify the Registry when a person is diagnosed with or undergoes treatment for a reportable disease listed in the<p align=left>Column: 2536<p> Schedule to the Bill.&nbsp; The types of cases that have to be reported will be further specified in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp; The Bill also empowers the Registry to collect information about notified cases from the relevant medical records.&nbsp; The kind of information that may be obtained will be set out clearly in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp; Patient consent is not required.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancer will be the first reportable disease to be listed in the Schedule as the current cancer registry is well established with clearly defined work processes.&nbsp; MOH will add further diseases to the Schedule only if the collection of such information is essential to support national policies.&nbsp; Communicable diseases will not be covered under this Bill, as there are already provisions under the Infectious Diseases Act to obtain information on&nbsp;such diseases for the purpose of disease prevention and control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Two:&nbsp; Basic data requirements</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection of detailed information for every case of a disease&nbsp;will be tedious and expensive.&nbsp; We will therefore only collect data that is essential for public health planning.&nbsp; This will vary for different reportable diseases and the type of information collected will be set out clearly in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp; Any change to the list of information that can be collected will require Ministerial approval and will be published in the Government <I>Gazette</I>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it may be tempting to try and collect as much information as possible to anticipate future policy needs, this is neither feasible nor desirable.&nbsp; Excess data reporting imposes a heavy burden on healthcare institutions.&nbsp; Neither is it efficient nor cost-effective for the Ministry.&nbsp; We also need to respect the privileged access that this Bill provides to patients' medical records.&nbsp; We are sensitive to the fact that healthcare policy questions may change over time, but, instead of<p align=left>Column: 2537<p> collecting a lot of information in anticipation, we will review and make some changes to the data collected by the Registry from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make compliance as painless as possible, the Registry will work with healthcare institutions to facilitate convenient reporting.&nbsp; This includes batch reporting by linkages with hospital information systems, online reporting through the Internet, or submission of simple paper forms.&nbsp; As we are dealing with chronic diseases, instantaneous real-time reporting is not required and a reasonable grace period will be provided.</p><p><br><I>Three: Patient privacy and data security</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to administrative safeguards, such as clearly defined operating procedures with strict access controls to the Registry, encryption of data and regular audits, which are already in place, the Bill imposes a very strict obligation on all officers and agents of the Registry to protect confidential data.&nbsp; Similarly, those persons who request for and receive Registry data are bound to observe conditions of confidentiality set by the Registry.&nbsp; Any person, including a registry officer or agent, who discloses individually-identifiable information from the Registry in breach of the Bill faces imprisonment of up to 12 months, or a fine of up to $10,000, or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Four: Purposes of disclosure</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill clearly lays down the rules as to whom, and for what purpose, and in what form, the information can be released.&nbsp; In addition to its primary use by MOH for healthcare policy planning, we anticipate that the public, doctors, academics and researchers will want to know some key statistics about the chronic diseases.&nbsp; The Registry Office will therefore publish reports of analysed data in simplified form on a regular basis.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Identifiable patient information may be disclosed under the Bill for the purposes of national public health programmes.&nbsp; Such disclosure will need the approval of the Director of Medical Services (DMS).&nbsp; In deciding whether to give his approval, the Director of Medical Services&nbsp;will, amongst other things, consider the aims and objectives of the proposed programme, and whether it has any public health benefits to Singapore.&nbsp; He must be satisfied that the programme cannot be carried out using anonymised data.&nbsp; In addition, the Director of Medical Services must also be convinced that adequate measures will be put in place to protect the individually-identifiable information from unauthorised disclosure.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill permits identifiable patient information to be disclosed for the purposes of medical treatment or for public health research.&nbsp; This will only take place if the person to whom the identifiable information relates has given the requisite consent.&nbsp; NRD data will not be released for other purposes, for instance, to employers or insurance companies.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Main features of Bill</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now run through the main features of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill defines reportable diseases as those listed in the Schedule.&nbsp; Cancer will be the first reportable disease.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part II of the Bill establishes the National Registry of Diseases and sets out its functions.&nbsp; These include the collection of information on reportable diseases,<p align=left>Column: 2539<p> establishment of registers, compilation and publication of statistics, and the provision of information for supporting health services and national public health policies.&nbsp; Clause 3 sets out the various categories of officers that may be appointed to run the Registry.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, in Part III of the Bill, makes the notification of reportable diseases mandatory for managers of all healthcare institutions.&nbsp; The burden is placed on the manager as he has the management and control of the institution.&nbsp; Very limited data will be required to make a notification.&nbsp; Clause 7 empowers registry officers or agents to follow up on the notification to extract patient data from the relevant medical records.&nbsp; The kind of information that can be obtained will be predetermined, and will be listed clearly in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV addresses the issues of confidentiality and disclosure of Registry information.&nbsp; It imposes stringent obligations on registry officers&nbsp;and all other persons who request&nbsp;and receive Registry data.&nbsp; Unauthorised disclosure of identifiable personal information stored in the Registry is punishable with a jail term or a fine, or both.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 allows the Registrar to release anonymised information to any person on request, and to charge a fee and set conditions that have to be met.&nbsp; Clause 10 provides for the release of identifiable personal information for the conduct of national public health programmes, while clause 12 provides for the release of identifiable data for the purposes of public health research but only if the requisite patient consent has been obtained.&nbsp; Clause 11 allows patients to authorise their doctors to retrieve their Registry data if this is necessary for their proper treatment.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2540<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 13 in Part V of the Bill provides for the appointment of investigation officers.&nbsp; Clauses 14 and 15 clothe these officers with enforcement powers that will allow them to investigate offences committed under this Bill.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part VI deals with a host of miscellaneous matters.&nbsp; Clause 17(2) is noteworthy as it clarifies that a person who makes a notification to the Registry or who makes available to the Registry any document or information for the purposes of complying with the Bill will not incur liability for breach of confidence or of&nbsp; professional ethics.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Implementation plan</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Reportable diseases</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the smooth implementation of this Bill and to allow healthcare institutions to ease into this new reporting framework, only cancer will be listed as a reportable disease for now.&nbsp; The other three national-level disease registries maintained by the NRD for stroke, heart and renal disease will be reviewed for possible inclusion over the next two years.&nbsp; Listing of additional reportable diseases will depend on epidemiological and public health needs.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Feedback and consultation</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extensive public consultations were held with doctors, healthcare administrators, ethicists and regulatory bodies, and researchers.&nbsp; There was general support for the Bill, and points of concerns have been addressed in the draft Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Registry of Diseases Bill, and the Registry that it will create, will play a vital role in our public health efforts.&nbsp; It provides for the compilation of important information on non-communi<p align=left>Column: 2541<p>cable diseases that will guide policymaking on national healthcare and the formulation of public health programmes.&nbsp;

I agree with the Minister that to develop rational healthcare policies requires accurate and timely information.&nbsp; This Bill seeks to do just that through the establishment of a National Registry of Diseases, which will help in gathering information in a systematic and continuous manner by requiring all reportable diseases to be registered.&nbsp; In this manner, the Registry will contribute towards the formulation of robust healthcare policies, promote research on major diseases as well as further enhance the delivery of medical treatment to patients.&nbsp; For these reasons, this Bill is timely and will help to develop and improve the quality of Singapore's healthcare services.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I have one major concern as well as several clarifications to seek from the Minister. The Bill provides extensive powers for the Registrar of the National Registry of Diseases (NRD) to collect information and to have access to patients' data.&nbsp; Therefore, protecting patient confidentiality is very crucial to ensure credibility in the system and to win patients' trust.&nbsp; I note that the Minister has dwelt at length on this, citing a number of measures to protect patient confiden-<p align=left>Column: 2542<p>tiality, including the imposition of jail terms and fines for those caught breaching it, which is necessary as we do not want to see a repeat of the Shovron case where there was a clear breach of patient confidentiality.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to consider further tightening some of the provisions to ensure greater protection of patient confidentiality. The Bill provides for the use of anonymised information where the identity of the individual is concealed or protected.&nbsp; I have no major worries with regard to the use of anonymised information, as there are no serious confidentiality issues involved.&nbsp; My concern is more with the laxity allowed in the use of \"individually-identifiable\" information, where the identity of the individual can be readily discovered or ascertained from the information given.&nbsp; The use of \"individually-identifiable\" information is provided under clauses 10, 11 and 12 of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me touch on&nbsp;clause 10.&nbsp; Under&nbsp;clause 10, the Registrar of the NRD may, with the approval of the Director of Medical Services, disclose \"individually-identifiable\" information to \"any public officer or any other person\" for the purpose of conducting national public health programmes concerning any reportable disease. &nbsp;I notice that unlike clauses 11 and 12, it is not necessary to get the consent of the patient before such information is released to the public officer or any person, which is a matter of concern.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify, other than the public officer, who else can have access to the \"individually-identifiable\" information; in other words, who are covered under the ambit of \"other person\" stipulated under&nbsp;clause 10?&nbsp; I would like to suggest that to ensure greater transparency, the Ministry draws up a list of who will be included under the list of \"other person\", so that patients are clear as to the people who have access to their individual medical records.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2543<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek a clarification whether, under&nbsp;clause 10, the identities of patients suffering from the reportable diseases can be made known to the public when the national public health programmes are conducted.&nbsp; If so, this could cause embarrassment and discomfort to patients whose identities are made known to the public, especially if their consent is not even required under&nbsp;clause 10.&nbsp; Hence, disclosure of such \"individually-identified\" information to the public should not be allowed or, at most, allowed only in the most exceptional cases such as when we have a SARS-like situation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on&nbsp;clause 10, I would like to suggest that the Minister consider making it compulsory for the consent of the patient to be obtained before any \"individually-identifiable\" information held by the NRD can be disclosed for the purposes of the national public health programmes.&nbsp; Clauses 11 and 12 already make it compulsory for such consent to be secured before \"individually-identifiable\" information is disclosed to a patient's doctor for his treatment or disclosed for research purposes. &nbsp;I do not see any reason why a similar requirement for consent cannot be imposed under&nbsp;clause 10 before the medical records of individuals with their identities revealed&nbsp;are made available for carrying out national public health programmes. Surely, under clause 11, it is necessary to get the consent of the patient before his record is revealed to his own doctor for medical treatment.&nbsp; I do not see why his consent is not required under&nbsp;clause 10 for national public health programmes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, m y second point is with regard to the disclosure of&nbsp; \"individually-identifiable\" information for public health research.&nbsp; I understand that such information will be<p align=left>Column: 2544<p> released for research purposes, only if the research will help to improve the quality of health services provided for patients suffering from any reportable diseases; or to support any national public health policy initiative or programme.&nbsp; However, I feel that it should be made compulsory for all research applications to be referred to the National Research Advisory Committee to better protect patient confidentiality by ensuring that it is the whole committee, and not just the Registrar of the NRD, who will decide whether researchers will have access to patients' data and identity.&nbsp; Clause 12(5) in the current Bill leaves it to the Registrar to decide whether or not to refer an application by a researcher for the release of \"individually-identifiable\" information to the National Research Advisory Committee, which, in my view,&nbsp;is very weak, as it seems to give an inordinate amount of power to the Registrar.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on&nbsp;clause 2 of the Bill, which defines the meaning of \"requisite consent\", for the purposes of section 11&nbsp;or 12 of the Act.&nbsp; This is a very important part of the Bill but, unfortunately, it is rather scanty.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Ministry to draw up clear guidelines on how to secure consent from patients as, considering the gravity of the diseases covered under the Bill, patients may not always be in a clear frame of mind to make informed decisions without proper guidance. For example, the guidelines could provide that before&nbsp;patients' consent is obtained, they should be clearly informed that they have a choice on whether or not to disclose their personal information. The hospitals, clinics or laboratories should also make sure that patients understand the implications of their choice.&nbsp; For example, if they choose not to reveal the information to the doctors treating them, the lack of information may affect the effectiveness of their treatment.&nbsp; The hospitals, clinics or laboratories should<p align=left>Column: 2545<p> also respect the rights of patients and facilitate them in exercising their right.&nbsp; As this is something new, hospitals, clinics and laboratories should also have information leaflets on patient confidentiality and information disclosure and ensure that these have been read and understood by the patients.&nbsp; The UK's National Health Service has a comprehensive code of practice on patient confidentiality, which can be a source of reference for drawing up our own code and guideline.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is to seek clarification on&nbsp;clause 2 of the Bill on the definition of \"healthcare institution\".&nbsp; I notice that this whole Bill excludes the public sector healthcare institutions.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any other law that covers patient confidentiality in public sector hospitals, polyclinics or laboratories.&nbsp; The Minister had mentioned that public sector institutions are already providing such information voluntarily but nothing was mentioned about what laws govern the use of \"individually-identifiable\" information for patients in the public sector.&nbsp; So the question is, what laws apply and how is patient confidentiality protected in the public sector, as the issues governing patient confidentiality apply equally to both the public and private hospitals and therefore there should be a common set of rules that applies to both.&nbsp; The Minister's clarification on this point would be most helpful.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The healthcare services in Singapore have a reputation of being world-class, reliable and efficient.&nbsp; The combination of excellent healthcare infrastructure, availability of skilled medical professionals and the latest medical technology has made Singapore the convincing healthcare services hub in the region.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in order for Singaporeans to benefit from the excellent medical services available, rational and well-thought through healthcare policies are necessary, and I fully agree with the Minister's comment that good healthcare policies are underpinned by accurate and timely information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently a few disease registries for the common medical conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, renal disease and, most recently, stroke.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is currently no law to make the reporting of these diseases mandatory and, as such, the data collected is largely from the public healthcare institutions, which submit it on a voluntary basis.&nbsp; This has inevitably resulted in incomplete collection of data with limited usefulness for national level policy planning and research.&nbsp; In fact, inaccurate or incomplete information may in turn give false correlations and become useless for research and disease prevention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of the National Registry of Diseases Bill is therefore important for the following reasons:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The information collected will provide significant contributions to efforts to find causes of diseases;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2547<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; It is the most accurate way to determine the number of people with a particular disease and to identify trends in disease rates;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; It can determine whether demographic factors, such as race, ethnicity, gender, age and place of residence, influence the likelihood of developing the disease;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; It provides systematic ways to link diseases to environmental risk factors, by linking with environmental health databases; and, lastly, and most importantly,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; The identification of factors causing the disease is the first step towards the prevention of the disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Cancer Registry was the first to be set up in 1968.&nbsp; With its well-established processes, it is therefore natural and understandable to make cancer the first reportable disease to be included in the Schedule.&nbsp; Cancer is the leading cause of death in Singapore.&nbsp; It accounts for 28.5% of total deaths in 2006, with ischemic heart disease tailing behind at 18.5%.&nbsp; In order to position Singapore as the centre for cancer research, the Singapore Cancer Syndicate was formed to enhance cancer research and to bring it to the next higher plane.&nbsp; The data collected under this new Act would definitely go a long way to bolster the efforts in enhancing cancer research in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister if the definition of cancer in the Schedule encompasses only malignant tumours.&nbsp; Will there be exclusions, for example, for selected skin cancers, namely, basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin?&nbsp; In certain countries, these cancers are exempted from reporting, as they are rarely fatal and usually do not require hospitalisation.&nbsp; In addition, I would also<p align=left>Column: 2548<p> like to ask the Minister if benign tumours with the potential to cause fatality, such as meningioma of the brain and nervous system, be considered in the definition of cancer in the Schedule?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill is certainly designed with the intent to expand the scope of reportable diseases in the future.&nbsp; The inclusion of other common diseases that afflict Singaporeans, such as stroke, diabetes mellitus, heart and renal diseases, into the Schedule will be useful, and I urge the Ministry to seriously consider doing this sooner than later.&nbsp; This would enable relevant medical information to be collected, analysed and researched to support formulation of effective public health policies on possible prevention and control of these common diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of reporting and data collection, the issue of patient confidentiality is an important one.&nbsp; Well-trained staff and strict procedures must be put in place to protect patients' privacy and medical confidentiality.&nbsp; The data in the Registry must not be released to any other parties, such as employers and insurance companies, without the prior consent of the patient.&nbsp; The use of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes in the reporting should be considered as it provides, to a certain extent, a \"masking effect\" on the disease conditions to untrained personnel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to enhance&nbsp;compliance and to minimise inconvenience to the healthcare institutions and medical practitioners, I am glad to know that the Ministry is considering different modes of submissions, either electronically or paper reports.&nbsp; The entire process should also be made simple and seamless.&nbsp; This is especially imperative for solo medical practitioners who do not have the luxury of manpower to submit the reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the area of mandatory registering of diseases, many countries, such <p align=left>Column: 2549<p>as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had done more and are way ahead of Singapore.&nbsp; The introduction of the National Registry of Diseases Bill is, therefore, timely and would aid the Ministry in the formulation of sound healthcare policies and public health programmes that would benefit Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.12 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I have three brief points to make on the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that&nbsp;the National Registry of Diseases opens a fear that is natural to anything that requires us to declare our own deepest and most private secrets.&nbsp; Who in this House is prepared to make public the operations that he has had over the years, the medications that he takes for chronic conditions, and the&nbsp;infectious illness he or she may harbour?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, with the National Registry, we&nbsp;might all have to do it one day, sooner than later.&nbsp; True, there are safeguards in the Bill.&nbsp; True, this is a move which other countries have adopted.&nbsp; But this does not mean that the people&nbsp;are not worried.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Privacy of medical information</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp; have read&nbsp;of the two-step method to render our individual identities into anonymous digits.&nbsp; But I have also read that \"Identifiable data will be released if deemed necessary in cases like national public health programmes, with approval from the Director of Medical Services.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob, Chairman, GPC for Health, has earlier expressed a concern on this matter.&nbsp; I, too, have the same concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some examples&nbsp;of these national public health programmes?&nbsp; How<p align=left>Column: 2550<p> often do we expect them to occur?&nbsp; What details will the information contain?&nbsp; For example, Mr ABC's blood pressure is 88/130.&nbsp; His cholesterol level is 120 and he has a family history of diabetes, and so on.&nbsp; Will it be as detailed as that?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concern is not unfounded.&nbsp; I was told that the American \"Health Privacy Project\" has data&nbsp;showing that one in five are victims of improper disclosure.&nbsp; These are worrying figures that the Bill or the Ministry&nbsp;has to address and prevent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Benefit to patient</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to my second point.&nbsp; The Ministry has said that it will&nbsp; have to rely on the Registry to effectively contain and manage diseases nationally.&nbsp; The Registry is also expected to become a valuable source of clinical,&nbsp;diagnostic and outcome data to practitioners and researchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds good but all rather vague.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to enlighten us on a few points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to tell us if he can, the expected benefits, such as the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Would&nbsp;this mean cheaper healthcare?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Would this&nbsp;mean better planning so that our doctors can be deployed more efficiently?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Or is it so that our financial projections for national healthcare expenditure can be closer to the mark?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How precisely are we patients supposed to be benefiting from this Registry?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The confessional in the clinic</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point is on the relationship that we have with our doctors.&nbsp; Given the<p align=left>Column: 2551<p> fact that doctors now have to declare whatever they know about us to a National Registry, is there a chance that some of us may hold back what we already know and&nbsp;we do not&nbsp;tell our doctors everything because we cannot trust that they would not \"leak\" it to the Government?&nbsp;&nbsp;This, of course, is an unwarranted worry in any event but, in times of stress, people do not always think and act rationally.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my idea is to strengthen the trust and relationship between patients and doctors.&nbsp; We ought to tell patients to continue to trust their doctors and be completely honest with them.&nbsp; We should also stress to doctors on how to explain the privacy protections to their patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do this so that this new initiative does not intrude into the atmosphere of trust and&nbsp;honesty in the consultation room between the doctor and the patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.16 pm </p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, the Government takes a multi-pronged approach towards public health and disease management. Whilst existing laws like the Infectious Disease Act relate to communicable diseases, the National Registry of Diseases Bill before us today relates only to non-communicable diseases. These account for more than 60% of deaths in Singapore and draw&nbsp;heavily&nbsp;from the national coffers in terms of health expenditure.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill seeks to establish a Registry of Diseases and also sets up an administrative framework which deals with the powers, duties and liabilities of the various actors involved. It seeks to regulate information flows.&nbsp; It requires that the Registrar&nbsp;be notified of reportable diseases.&nbsp; It outlines to whom, in&nbsp;what<p align=left>Column: 2552<p> form and for which purposes such information may be supplied to other parties. It seeks to facilitate data collection while providing safeguards to protect the interests of patients in data security.&nbsp; It also imposes penalties in the form of fines and imprisonment to&nbsp;defer&nbsp;breaches of various newly created statutory duties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purposes of this Registry are set out in clause 4.&nbsp; Broadly, these relate to the collection and collation of information on \"reportable diseases\" with a view to publishing relevant statistics as well as the supply of this information to serve two purposes.&nbsp;First, to support health services provided by healthcare institutions to patients suffering from such diseases. Second, to support national public health policies and programmes as well as \"related studies\" or research into such diseases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cornerstone of sound public health policies is&nbsp;a comprehensive informational base on the incidence of reported diseases which bear national significance, such as cancer, which is the first disease listed in the Schedule.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>From voluntary to mandatory reporting regime</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Registry of Diseases Bill is designed to contribute to this.&nbsp; It seeks to formalise or place on a legal basis the existing practice where healthcare institutions voluntarily report certain diseases to the Ministry of Health, or MOH,&nbsp;as a matter of goodwill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good practice becomes law under clause 6, which imposes a mandatory legal duty on managers of healthcare institutions in both the public and private sector to notify the Registrar of reportable diseases. They are to fill&nbsp;out a prescribed form and to submit it within a stipulated time, presumably to be set out under<p align=left>Column: 2553<p> subsidiary legislation, as clause 23(2)(e) of the&nbsp;Bill provides.&nbsp; This information will be given to the Registrar without need for the consent of the patient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will ensure a more complete and comprehensive database by broadening the net of reporting resources. This will enhance the accuracy, reliability and utility of the database.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide&nbsp;some teeth to enforcing this duty, the Bill states that the failure to notify the Registrar without \"reasonable excuse\" or furnishing false information is a punishable offence.&nbsp; Presumably, recourse to the courts is available as to whether an excuse is reasonable, since the&nbsp;Bill contains no clause ousting applications for judicial review.&nbsp;Indeed, clause 17 protects public officers associated with the Registry from legal proceedings for any act done in good faith during the course of discharging their statutory functions - which leaves open the door for judicial action in relation to acts done in bad faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>What kind of information is to be collected?</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of information must be provided in relation to this notification duty?&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that hospitals have different policies in relation to information collected from the patients as well as towards the degrees of confidentiality afforded to patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, is the information to be collected just the details of the type of cancer or would it include the details of the treatment, its outcome, and the personal traits of patients such as their age, gender, sexual history, socio-economic status, occupation, religion, marital status and other associated risk factors?&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand these are standard questions cancer patients have to answer in setting out patient histories, which may vary between healthcare institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2554<p><p><I>A judicious balance?</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the information collected should not go beyond what is needed to serve the objectives of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this raises the issues of privacy and data confidentiality.&nbsp; Related concerns were raised during the public consultation process, which, incidentally, promotes&nbsp;the democratic value of participation and policy-making.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the final product?&nbsp; Is the legal framework provided by the&nbsp;Bill clear and does it strike a judicious balance between the community's right to know and to enjoy good public health policies based on this knowledge and the individual's right of privacy?&nbsp; How do the administrative rules set out in the Bill&nbsp;address the interests, expectations and duties of the relevant actors involved?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Bill provides sanctions for the way information is handled or mishandled, as where there is a failure to discharge&nbsp;a duty of notification or an unauthorised disclosure of information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are the interests of patients protected? This is closely tied in to how the Registrar handles information on reportable diseases which he receives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;Bill distinguishes between two kinds of categories of information:&nbsp;&nbsp;one which is traceable to the patient and one which is not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One category of information, which is non-traceable, is termed&nbsp;\"anonymised\"&nbsp;information.&nbsp; I believe this Bill has created a new word in the English language!&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause&nbsp;2 defines this as information relating to&nbsp;an individual whose identity is concealed, protected or \"cannot be readily discovered\" from that information. Clause 9 provides that where the Director so requests, the Registrar may disclose such information \"on a request&nbsp;by any person\"<p align=left>Column: 2555<p> after paying a fee and subject to any conditions that the Registrar may impose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not stipulate what sort of purposes \"any person\" may request the information for, but presumably, this must fall&nbsp;within the purposes of the Act, that is,&nbsp;to formulate public health policies or for related studies.&nbsp; Could the Minister please clarify if this is the case?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second category of traceable information is termed \"individually-identifiable information\" as it will identify each person diagnosed and treated for cancer in Singapore.&nbsp;Clause&nbsp;5 provides that the register containing this information&nbsp;is private and not open to public inspection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further protect the privacy of the individual, clause&nbsp;8 states that an officer or agent of the Registry or one acting under the direction of the Director of Medical Services cannot be compelled to give evidence before a court with respect to any individually-identifiable information obtained under the Bill. The only exception is where the case concerns the prosecution of an offence under the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general principle under clause&nbsp;8(2) is that the Registrar or its agent or indeed \"any other person\" acting under the direction of the Director or Registrar \"for any purpose related to the Registry\"&nbsp;is duty-bound not to disclose what is in the Register or any individually-identifiable information he came across in performing his office. They are under an obligation of confidentiality, a breach of which attracts legal sanctions under clause 8(3).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are instances where the Registrar, with the Director's approval, may disclose individually-identifiable information to a public officer or \"any other person\"; however, clause&nbsp;10 confines this to the purposes of conducting national public health programmes concerning a <p align=left>Column: 2556<p>reportable disease. This is consistent with the general objectives of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 10(3) indicates that individually-identifiable information is not to be readily granted. The Director must be satisfied that the national public health programme could not be carried out with anonymised information before approving any such disclosure. The clause&nbsp;expressly lists factors which the Director must consider in deciding whether to approve the disclosure and what conditions to attach to a grant of approval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to raise an issue which I hope the Minister can clarify.&nbsp; Under clause 10(2), before the Director approves the disclosure of traceable information, he must consider the identity of the public officer or persons involved in the relevant national health programme.&nbsp; I am wondering whether these persons fall within the scope of&nbsp;clause 8(2) which imposes a duty of confidentiality on any person acting under the direction of the Director or Registrar for \"any purpose related to the Registry\".&nbsp; If they are not, and since they may be handling sensitive information under&nbsp;clause 10 in running public programmes, will the Minister clarify whether a duty of confidentiality will be imposed on such persons under clause 10(2), perhaps through subsidiary legislation?&nbsp; This relates to putting into place measures under the national public health programme to protect individually-identifiable information from unauthorised disclosure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is important because clause&nbsp;10 does not require that&nbsp;a patient with a reportable disease must first give consent before the Registrar, with the Director's approval, can release individually-identifiable information to a person conducting a relevant public health programme. This is distinct from clauses 11 and 12(1) where the requisite consent of the patient is needed before traceable information is released to a medical <p align=left>Column: 2557<p>practitioner treating that patient or to a researcher conducting relevant public health research.&nbsp; The requirement of consent gives the patient some safeguard towards protecting his personal identity or the identity of the healthcare institution where he was treated; he has some say in the matter at least.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A researcher will be subject to certain penalties if he misuses the information for a purpose not specified by the Registrar or disregards the conditions governing the release of traceable information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we can see, the Bill sets out quite an elaborate scheme of statutory duties of reporting, rules designed to guard patient confidentiality and penalties for acts done in dereliction of&nbsp;statutory duty.&nbsp; Part of the rule of law is the principle of having clarity and apportioning obligations and liabilities and guiding conduct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why clause&nbsp;21 causes me some concern.&nbsp; This is a general exemption clause under which the Minister may, either permanently or for a certain period, \"exempt any person or class of persons from any or all of the provisions of this Act\". For example, by publishing an order in the <I>Gazette</I>, the Minister could waive any requirement of confidentiality the&nbsp;Bill otherwise imposes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is an extremely broad power, effectively providing <I>carte blanche</I> for the Minister in his discretion to allow someone to be given blanket immunity from the statutory regime, almost like a \"get out of jail free\" card.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A basic principle of administrative law and good governance is that Parliament confers discretion with the intent it should be used to promote the policy and object of the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The determination of what the statutory purpose is has always been a question of law which courts may review.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As formulated, the discretion on the Minister by clause&nbsp;21(1) lacks clear<p align=left>Column: 2558<p> criteria to guide its exercise, compared to the four conditions set out in&nbsp;clause 10 which guide the Director in deciding whether to disclose information in relation to relevant public health programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger, in relation to clause 21, is that the general exemption might be given for a reason not related to the purpose of the Bill. For example, taking a worse case scenario, a person could be given a blanket exemption as a matter of a personal favour.&nbsp; I am sure that this cannot be the intent of the drafters of this legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfettered discretion would undermine the rule of law as discretion should never be absolute but constrained by specific criteria. This is to prevent arbitrariness and to ensure the&nbsp;legal and regular exercise of public powers.&nbsp; Power may be absolute, but law never is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discretion has to be exercised within the framework and&nbsp;legitimate objectives of the statute. It is important in shaping the scope of Ministerial discretion, to set out the purposes or the basis upon which this discretion is to be exercised, to avoid conferring \"blank cheque\" powers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister further clarify the kind of scenarios where such a broad power may be necessary as set out in clause 21, which would&nbsp;justify bypassing the judicious balance struck by the Bill between patient confidentiality concerns and the community's interest in sound public health policies?&nbsp; Would an unreasonable use of Ministerial discretion be subject to judicial review?&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, rather than providing for a general exemption, would it not be better to have specific exceptions tied to a particular provision or section in the Act?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be helpful to understand the various rationales behind a decision to exempt a person from the operation of different parts of the proposed statute.<p align=left>Column: 2559<p> For example, the justification for waiving confidentiality requirements in some instances may be quite distinct from reasons not to apply the enforcement provisions of the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, this Bill is designed to facilitate and to optimise long-term public policy-making in relation to public health issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An incremental and targeted approach has&nbsp;been pursued which allows the scheme to hit the ground running.&nbsp; At present, only cancer is listed in the Schedule of reported diseases. This is for reasons of gravity and practicality.&nbsp; Gravity, because cancer is responsible for the highest rates of death in Singapore, and practicality, because data collection processes in this respect are the most established.&nbsp; It is also important to socialise or enable the relevant actors to become familiar with this new statutory regime and their responsibilities thereunder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while our Constitution may not contain a right to health, the Government is solicitous towards the healthcare concerns of Singaporeans. Rather than through the mechanism of rights, the Government prefers to formulate and execute programmes to promote this important aspect of human welfare. Consistent with the Government's ethos of pragmatism, a former Foreign Minister once said in 1993 that the Government justified itself to Singaporeans \"not by abstract theories\" but \"by the more vigorous test of practical success\". The proof of the pudding is in the eating, as it were.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is heartening to know that the Government is taking a proactive approach towards anticipating the dimen-<p align=left>Column: 2560<p>sions of future public health problems, to ensure the healthcare needs of Singaporeans are met, to plan for sufficient medical personnel, securing financing for this and identifying priority areas and trends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support that idea of having a National Diseases Registry.&nbsp; It will provide information which will contribute towards the making of sound public health policies. This should promote public welfare and benefit the community at large</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The practice of medicine and healthcare is changing and evolving.&nbsp; There is now a paradigm shift towards evidence-based practices.&nbsp; Basing our policies, healthcare and clinical guidelines on published Western figures and Caucasian population statistics is not acceptable anymore.&nbsp; We have to utilise our own local cohort results, figures, trends, etc, to formulate practice guidelines.&nbsp; Moreover, with our multi-racial and multi-ethnic representations, local figures become highly relevant.&nbsp; This Bill will facilitate the collection of medical and health data for research, disease prevention, planning and control.&nbsp; It will give us our very own unique data applicable for formulation of policies and intervention in our population.&nbsp; And as data collected will be ongoing, it will be a good example of the time motion trial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Disease Registry itself, the Bill will cover cancer, heart disease, renal disease and also stroke.&nbsp; I would like to propose other diseases to be included in the Registry in a staggered fashion over the years, as this will be gradually necessary.&nbsp; Some of the suggestions would be a registry for asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease and also perhaps<p align=left>Column: 2561<p> a genetic diseases registry which will become highly relevant for information sharing, because these are highly specialised diseases in our small society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting up of these registries requires several key factors.&nbsp; First, the cooperation from all stakeholders in order to achieve the complete and comprehensive data we want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a dedicated secretariat to run the system, handle administrative issues, requests, data extraction, etc.&nbsp; Here, Sir, I would like to suggest perhaps that consideration be given for recruitment of retired nurses and healthcare workers, because their background and knowledge will be a bonus for this type of work and they are quite used to issues of confidentiality and will certainly serve us in an advantageous manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the need for a clear legal framework to protect data from abuse.&nbsp; The framework, when ready, should perhaps be made public&nbsp;on the website, so that everyone is aware of the requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the consent acquisition process needs to be formal and clearly specified.&nbsp; This must also include the need to understand the reasons for request of data and its utilisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it will also be optimal if we can follow a relatively similar or standardised structure format for all the registries, eg, the cancer registry, which started many years ago, was one where healthcare staff had to complete the form manually and then faxed or posted&nbsp;out.&nbsp; In this day and age, electronic submission would be most optimal and efficient, and it must certainly be the way to go forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is essential to ensure 100% compliance and participation, and that is why we have this legislation, and this will no doubt affect the quality of data that <p align=left>Column: 2562<p>we get as well.&nbsp; The Ministry needs to set a timeline for entry and data submission.&nbsp; Perhaps this can be set at about&nbsp;2-3 weeks after diagnosis or after discharge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, safeguarding and protecting confidential information must go beyond just having a set of rules, because once improper disclosure of data and information happens, it is already too late, even as there is a hefty punishment for the offender.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For security, Sir, the public will be reassured by the administrative safeguards and level of protection that will be put in place to prevent abuse and minimise errors.&nbsp; These will have to be emphasised&nbsp;to the user and also the applicant to ensure compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would also be good to have the following in place:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, for applicants who wish to request data for a study, there must be support from the ethics committee or the institutional review board approval letter from their relevant institutions.&nbsp; A copy of the study protocol and questionnaire should also be forwarded to the secretariat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, all publications related to the application and use of these data must be sent to the secretariat.&nbsp; At the more preliminary stage, if there are controversial results which are seen, it is important that these must be highlighted to the secretariat as soon as possible.&nbsp; The authors may want to acknowledge the efforts of the Registry staff and secretariat as relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to suggest that applications be divided into at least two different categories.&nbsp; Firstly, the request for generic information and data where trends are important, eg, for policy formulation and guideline writing.&nbsp; Secondly, the request for more personal and individualised information data or report.&nbsp; This must be handled even more<p align=left>Column: 2563<p> cautiously and be reviewed at different levels of staff in order to prevent abuse and protect confidentiality.&nbsp; More public education to explain that the rules being drawn up are watertight to prevent mishandling of information is also going to be beneficial.&nbsp; The public must be assured that the legislation is not meant to be intrusive of their personal medical information and is down with proper safeguards to their privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with reference to Part III,&nbsp;clause 6, on the use of the term \"manager\", different health institutions may define \"manager\" in different terms.&nbsp; I think we need to be a little bit more specific here as sometimes the duties and job description of the manager or certain officers, whether it is a divisional or&nbsp;general manager, or whether it is the chief operating officer who does the job,&nbsp;we need to be clear as to who has the ownership and responsibility of this very important process.&nbsp; And, certainly, I think it will be good if we can specify this a bit more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, for the fees, there should also be some reasonable guidelines, and this should be kept as affordable as possible.&nbsp; In terms of research today, grants are highly competitive and are often quite quickly and rapidly utilised and consumed once they have been received for the many competing needs and requirements on the research projects which are ongoing.&nbsp; Thus, keeping the fees affordable will be very helpful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now just say a few words in Malay, Sir.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20071112/20071112VS_083402.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I> ]&nbsp;We should always adapt ourselves to the situations and needs in the field of medical research, which has made many developments.&nbsp; However, with regard to healthcare, care-<p align=left>Column: 2564<p>ful planning is a very important factor to ensure its effectiveness.&nbsp; For effective planning, we should have sufficient data, which should be accurate, stable, balanced and bring about the desired benefits.&nbsp; In this matter, I laud this National Registry of Diseases Bill which I feel comes at the right time.&nbsp; It is aimed to facilitate research on disease prevention and control, and to make it mandatory for the health institutions to report new cases, and the information collected is used when making our national health policies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I strongly support this Bill. I would like to raise a few facts.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that there should be a committee to study the forms and website to be filled in for all four registries of diseases, which will be formulated soon.&nbsp; These forms, where patients&rsquo; facts, health and diagnosis are filled in, should not be so difficult and lengthy.&nbsp; It should be focused on the important information in brief.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, only the data of Singaporeans should be collected and considered. Although, at present, hospitals and the health institutions in Singapore are widely handling patients from overseas, it is the facts on our indigenous people that will be important in this issue.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, I would like to touch on the issue of consent from the patients.&nbsp; Explanations made should be firm and easily understood to them. They should be informed that their personal data will be handled with confidentiality and fairness.&nbsp; Therefore, any issue of ethical and moral conflict will not happen.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the four Registries are already being used by some of our institutions.&nbsp; For example, the&nbsp;Cancer Registry is organised successfully now.&nbsp; I have read that these Registries will be formalised in two years' time.&nbsp; I would like to suggest, Mr Speaker, that we should implement it<p align=left>Column: 2565<p> as soon as possible when we are ready, because this is an important and good step.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At common law, the courts in many countries still respect the confidentiality of information obtained by a physician in his professional capacity.&nbsp; He cannot divulge that information without the prior consent of the patient.&nbsp; However, in many other jurisdictions, he may be in conflict with the law.&nbsp; The international code of medical ethics that has been adopted in principle by all countries, whose medical associations are affiliated to the World Medical Association, embodies the Declaration of Geneva (1949), which states, \"I will respect the secrets which are confided in me.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In circumstances where there is public interest in which the court requires disclosure of information, the physician may risk imprisonment for contempt of court if he declines to give the information.&nbsp; This is the position in Great Britain, also in Singapore before the passing of this Bill, and in about 15 states in the United States.&nbsp; In about 35 states, however, varying degrees of privilege, precluding disclosure of confidential information obtained in the course of treating a patient are allowed, but the privilege can be waived in certain circumstances, eg, if the patient offers himself or his physician as a witness, although this is not the invariable rule.&nbsp; The tendency of the courts is to allow privilege to the physician.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, allow me to touch on&nbsp;clauses 8 and 10.&nbsp; Clause 8(1) of the Bill protects the anonymity of information submitted to the Registry.&nbsp; Sub-clause 8(2) of the Bill prohibits the disclosure of any individually-identifiable information, and sub-clause<p align=left>Column: 2566<p> 8(3) provides the punishment for breaching sub-clause 8(2).&nbsp; The fine is a hefty $10,000 and a jail term of 12 months, or to both.&nbsp; This heavy punishment gives confidence to patients who have divulged their individually-identifiable information to the Registry to ensure that it will not be leaked to third parties.&nbsp; I am agreeable that there be a provision whereby the Registry can disclose information held by the Registry in an anonymised form on payment of an appropriate fee.&nbsp; However, I cannot agree with clause 10(1) whereby the identity of a patient is disclosed in regard to a reportable disease for the purposes of conducting national public health programmes.&nbsp; I cannot see the relevance of the name of the patient to the disease he suffers from.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Now, may I get some clarification from the&nbsp;Minister on&nbsp;the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 10, 11&nbsp;and 12, will the patient be allowed first&nbsp;to be told that his name shall be revealed together with the sickness?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, will he be allowed to appeal against the Registrar's decision if he objects?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp; Is the Minister willing to establish an appeal mechanism comprising a review committee?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal mechanism is to assure the public that there is no abuse of the system.&nbsp; This assurance is important because a person's sickness is very private to him and normally, he does not want it to be divulged even to a limited number of persons who are strangers. &nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the&nbsp;Members who have spoken in <p align=left>Column: 2567<p>support of this Bill.&nbsp; I particularly want to thank Prof. Thio for a very clear explanation of the various clauses and various obligations and objectives that we set up under this Bill.&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan wanted a clearer explanation of the benefits that patients can expect out of our setting up a National Registry of Diseases.&nbsp; In a way, Dr Lam, in his speech, has clarified,&nbsp;from a doctor's point of view, what are those public&nbsp;health objectives.&nbsp; Let me illustrate in my own way using the example of, say, lung cancer.&nbsp; As I said just now, the Singapore Cancer Registry is now almost 40 years old. And if you look at our earlier set of data, they show clearly that Singapore ranked very high in age adjusted mortality due to lung cancer among men, and we were among the highest among the developing countries at that time.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research on data drawn not only from our own Cancer Registry but from many other global cancer registries proved strong correlation between smoking and lung cancer. So like others, we then embarked on an aggressive anti-smoking campaign.&nbsp; As a result, our smoking prevalence in males dropped from 37% in 1984 to 22% in 2004, now among the lowest in the world.&nbsp; In turn, these efforts have reduced lung cancer rates in males from 65 per hundred thousand population in 1978 to now less than 45 per hundred thousand population.&nbsp; The benefits in terms of lives saved and the miseries reduced are immense.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cancer Registry also helps us to prioritise our research focus, again with a view to benefit patients.&nbsp;Let me give another example -&nbsp;stomach cancer, which is now&nbsp;topical.&nbsp; It is currently the fifth most common cancer among Singaporean males.&nbsp; Among females, it is ranked number seven.&nbsp; Although there&nbsp;has been&nbsp;an overall improvement in cancer survival<p align=left>Column: 2568<p> in Singapore over the&nbsp;years, the five-year age standardised survival rate for stomach cancer remains very low, at only 25%.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;only one-quarter survives more than five years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is obviously room for improvement and we will put some research priority on stomach cancer to improve early detection and its treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the benefits of a disease registry are&nbsp;more easily explained,&nbsp;the key concern, which all Members have rightly focused their comments upon, pertains to privacy and patient confidentiality.&nbsp; How do we protect privacy and patient confidentiality while ensuring that their data can be put to good use?&nbsp; How do we retain the trust of the patients and the public that we and the doctors will not abuse their trust?&nbsp; My Ministry shares these concerns.&nbsp; Indeed, it is precisely because of these concerns that this Bill is formulated.&nbsp; And when drafting the Bill, we strive to balance the potential benefits to society with the rights of the individual to privacy and confidentiality of information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we drew upon the excellent works and the recommendations of the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) chaired by Prof. Lim Pin.&nbsp; Earlier this year, Members will remember that the BAC&nbsp;published its report titled, \"Personal Information in Biomedical Research\", after an extensive public consultation among doctors, members of the public,&nbsp;experts in ethics, international scientists, and so on.&nbsp; Among other things, the BAC concluded that it is \"ethically proper for medical information to be disclosed by physicians to national disease registries without patients' consent, provided that adequate privacy and other ethical safeguards are in place and patients are appropriately informed\".&nbsp; I would suggest Mr Chiam read up&nbsp;the BAC report.&nbsp; Because,&nbsp;while I&nbsp;note&nbsp;what Mr Chiam has said about traditional medical views on sharing of individualised information,&nbsp;developments in recent years have updated many of those views.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2569<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we studied similar legislation in the US, Canada and Australia for reference when crafting the provisions on patient confidentiality.&nbsp; They have much more experience in protecting patient confidentiality and their disease registry legislation has similar provisions on release of identifiable information under certain conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure this House that the data that the Registry collects will be treated with the strictest confidence.&nbsp; First, any unauthorised disclosure of identifiable data would be a criminal offence.&nbsp; Second, we will only collect information that is absolutely essential for healthcare policy making.&nbsp; Third, we will spell out clearly in subsidiary legislation the type of information to be collected.&nbsp; Fourth, any disclosure of information will be in anonymised form.&nbsp; This will be the default position.&nbsp; However, if it is established that disclosure of individually-identifiable information cannot be avoided,&nbsp;then there should be prior consent by patient.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have, however, made a provision in the Bill for power to disclose identifiable information without prior consent in the event that there is such a need to support certain public health programmes.&nbsp; Understandably, these provisions drew the attention of Members, including Mdm Halimah and Mr Sam Tan.&nbsp; This is not a local innovation.&nbsp; And by the way, even the word \"anonymised\" is not a local innovation.&nbsp; Australia, United States and Canada have similar provisions in their registry legislation and for&nbsp;good reasons.&nbsp; The function of a Registry is limited to collection, analysis and reporting of routine statistics.&nbsp; Registry data may however, from time to time, show worrying trends that&nbsp;are beyond the scope of the registry to investigate.&nbsp; The purpose of setting up the Registry is really for us to be aware when&nbsp;a worrying trend develops.&nbsp;&nbsp;And once you identify a problem,&nbsp;you&nbsp;need to get to the bottom of it - why is there a worrying trend?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2570<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider this scenario. Supposing we introduce a new national mass screening programme for a particular cancer, \"cancer X\".&nbsp; After several years, the expectation must be that if the screening is effective and it is well done, then we should expect the incidence rate to go down and with it, survival rate to improve.&nbsp; But supposing that having done so,&nbsp;we found from the Registry data that that is not the case,&nbsp;and we continue to see a rising trend and a significant number of very severe \"cancer X\" cases; in other words, patients presenting themselves at stage four, very advanced stage of severity.&nbsp; What is wrong?&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, you must ask the questions: What is the reason?&nbsp; Is it because the screening is poorly done?&nbsp;Is it generally poorly done or only certain screening centres are particularly bad?&nbsp; Why is that so?&nbsp; What is wrong?&nbsp; Or is it because, while we intended it to be a mass screening, significant segments of a population are not coming forward to be screened?&nbsp; Is it a particular racial group or&nbsp;a particular age group?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think these are critical questions that, as Minister for Health, my job is to try to understand them, so that we can take corrective action.&nbsp; But for us to probe into such a scenario, the Registry may need to release identifiable data to the investigators that we set up, to enable them to match the Registry data with, for example, the cancer screening data, so that the experts can identify the problem and then to address it in order to formulate a more effective cancer programme.&nbsp; So far, we have not encountered such a scenario here. But I have read of such development, which cropped up either in Australia or New Zealand, of a particular cancer screening programme.&nbsp;When they finally investigated and got to the bottom of it,&nbsp;they were&nbsp;able to discover that a particular laboratory was doing the testing poorly so that many of the cancer cases were missed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2571<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the power of such a provision,&nbsp;getting such a conclusion will be almost impossible.&nbsp; So, taking a leaf from the experience of the US, Canada and Australia, we think it is appropriate now to include such a provision in our legislation.&nbsp; Let me assure the House that such disclosure would only be allowed if the Ministry is fully satisfied that a programme cannot be effectively carried out with anonymised data.&nbsp; There will be rigorous scrutiny of every such request before release of data.&nbsp; Stringent requirements will also be put in place for maintaining confidentiality and limiting the use of data for the specified purpose.&nbsp; Certainly, the release of the individualised data is not meant to be public, that so and so has \"cancer X\".&nbsp; It is only to release to the investigators that the Ministry of Health appointed, for example.&nbsp; The Director of Medical Services can also request for appropriate ethical review to assist him in evaluating complex requests for such data.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio asked&nbsp;if officers, under clause 10(2), are bound by the confidentiality requirements of clause 8.&nbsp; Let me clarify here that the Registry officers are bound by clause 8 to protect the confidentiality of identifiable data stored in the Registry.&nbsp; On the other hand, those who received identifiable information under clause 10 to pursue an approved national public health programme will in turn be bound by the conditions imposed under clause 10, to protect the data from unauthorised use and disclosure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah suggested that we refer all requests for individually-identifiable information for public health research to the National Research Advisory Committee, otherwise she felt that an inordinate amount of power would have been rendered to one person in the Registrar.&nbsp; That is a fair point.&nbsp; But let me clarify that, indeed, all research proposals <p align=left>Column: 2572<p>would have been reviewed and supported by the respective Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) which comprise quite a number of people before they are submitted to the Registrar.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And my Ministry has strict operational guidelines for all IRBs and these include guidelines on how informed consent should be obtained.&nbsp; Hence, for each research proposal, several people would have been involved in its approval process.&nbsp; Clause 12(5) is to empower the Registrar to seek a second opinion through the National Research Advisory Committee in the event that he has concerns which were not adequately addressed by the IRBs.&nbsp; I think this is an adequate safeguard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address the other queries by the Members.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Dr Fatimah sought clarifications on clause 2 definitions of the Bill.&nbsp; First, the Bill applies to all healthcare establishments irrespective of whether they are in the public or private sector.&nbsp; Second, the manager or person having the management or control of the healthcare institution would be the one held accountable for notifying the Registry.&nbsp; We have not listed the specific titles as these could vary from one institution to another.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio found clause 21 on general exemption to grant too broad a power.&nbsp; I think she described it as giving me the power to issue \"get out of jail free\" card.&nbsp; That is not the intent.&nbsp; Let me clarify that this exemption power will primarily be used to exempt managers of healthcare institutions from having to notify the Registry of persons diagnosed with or undergoing treatment for a reportable disease,&nbsp;if it will create unnecessary duplication in reporting.&nbsp; This can happen.&nbsp; This is to reduce the overall burden on reporting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure this House that clause 21 will not be used to exempt anybody from the obligation to respect the confidentiality of identifiable information<p align=left>Column: 2573<p> stored in the Registry.&nbsp; This is not the intention behind this provision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio also commented on judicial review and to what extent is judicial review available under the Bill.&nbsp; My understanding in this aspect of the law is that judicial review is available to any person who can show the court that he should be granted relief.&nbsp; I think Mr Chiam&nbsp;made a similar query as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the definition of \"cancer\" by Dr Lam, I stand advised by the professionals. &nbsp;And I think the Director of Medical Services will set up an expert committee to advise him, among other things, to look through the current data submission to the Cancer Registry, to see whether we could add or substract, whether we can improve the form and, along the way, I think they would also sort out the question of which cancer to include and which to exclude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for supporting this Bill, and I share their concerns on patients' confidentiality,&nbsp;and I share it deeply.&nbsp; When drafting the subsidiary legislation, we will be particularly mindful of ensuring adequate checks and balances.&nbsp; And this is part of the reason why we are taking a cautious incremental approach, beginning with the Cancer Registry, which has an almost 40-year history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the call by Dr Lam and Dr Fatimah to expedite the inclusion of other diseases under the Bill.&nbsp; We will learn from the experience of the Cancer Registry before we embark on any such extension.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp;a Committee has been formed to advise the Ministry on future expansion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note the call by Members, including Dr Lam, to ensure hassle-free processes and that fees should be kept reasonable.&nbsp; These are valid concerns and<p align=left>Column: 2574<p> my staff would streamline the notification processes and the use of electronic means of data submission as far as possible.&nbsp; This would help reduce the operating costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the House for their support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill was released for public consultation from June to July this year.&nbsp; The draft Bill has been revised to incorporate suggestions from businesses and members of the public.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2575<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Tax&nbsp;policy&nbsp;changes&nbsp;announced&nbsp;in 2007 Budget Statement</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first highlight the key&nbsp;policy changes that were announced in the 2007 Budget Statement.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(a)&nbsp;Reducing corporate tax rate</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With effect from Year of Assessment 2008, the corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 20% to 18%.&nbsp; This change, together with other related changes,&nbsp;is reflected in the Bill under clauses 18, 20(b), 25(a), 25(e), 25(i), 29, 30, 31(a), 31(b), 31(c), 33 and 35(b).</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(b)&nbsp;Increasing partial tax exemption threshold for companies</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chargeable income of companies that qualifies for partial income tax exemption will be increased from the current $100,000 to $300,000 with effect from Year of Assessment 2008. With the change, 75% of the first $10,000 of chargeable income and 50% of the next $290,000 of chargeable income will be exempt from income tax. &nbsp;Clauses 25(f) and 25(g) of the Bill provide for this change.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(c)&nbsp; Lifting the sunset clause for the Income Tax Exemption Scheme for newly incorporated companies</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, newly incorporated companies may qualify for full tax exemption on the first $100,000 of chargeable income for each of the first three Years of Assessment falling between Year of Assessment 2005 and Year of Assessment 2009.&nbsp; As part of Government's continuing efforts to encourage entrepreneurship, the Year of Assessment 2009 expiry date will be removed.&nbsp; Clause 25(h) of the Bill provides for this change.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2576<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(d) Promoting Singapore as a philanthropy hub</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several changes to the taxation and regulatory framework for charity were announced in Budget 2007. They formed part of our efforts to promote charitable giving and develop Singapore as an attractive international hub for philanthropic and not-for-profit organisations.&nbsp; One major change is the removal of the \"80:20\" spending rule for income tax exemption for charities.&nbsp; With effect from Year of Assessment 2008, we will remove the requirement for charities to spend at least 80% of their annual receipts on charitable objects in Singapore within two years in order to enjoy income tax exemption.&nbsp; All registered and exempt charities will enjoy automatic tax exemption.&nbsp; This will enable charities to optimise their investments and use of funds over time to sustain their charitable programmes in Singapore as well as overseas.&nbsp; These changes are covered by clauses 6(g) and 8 of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new tax incentive scheme has also been introduced to give income tax exemption to approved not-for-profit organisations that can either bring economic value to Singapore with linkages to key industry clusters or contribute to developing Singapore as a philanthropy hub.&nbsp; Clause 11 of the Bill provides for this tax exemption.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(e) Promoting fund management in Singapore</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of Singapore's continuing efforts to promote the fund management industry, the \"80:20\" rule under our tax exemption incentive scheme for non-resident funds will be removed.&nbsp; Details of the revised tax exemption scheme for fund management have been released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on 31st August this year.&nbsp; The revised scheme gives certainty of tax exemption to foreign investors and allows resident<p align=left>Column: 2577<p> investors to also invest in managed funds, subject to specified investment limits.&nbsp; The changes will help to boost the fund management industry and provide fund managers based in Singapore with greater flexibility in sourcing for mandates.&nbsp; These changes are covered by clauses 7, 10 and 42(o).</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Other&nbsp;tax&nbsp;policy changes</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now deal with other tax policy changes which require amendments to the Income Tax Act.&nbsp; Our existing tax policies and incentive schemes are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant.&nbsp; Let me highlight four major changes to our tax policies and incentives that came about as a result of this review process.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(a) Deferral of claim for accelerated capital allowance</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, accelerated capital allowances are granted over&nbsp;three years in respect of capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery used for the purposes of trade, business or profession.&nbsp; Once the claim is made, the law requires that the accelerated capital allowances be made over&nbsp;three years on a consecutive basis.&nbsp; This requirement is now lifted.&nbsp; This change will give taxpayers flexibility to defer the claim for accelerated capital allowances.&nbsp; This change takes effect from Year of Assessment 2009.&nbsp; Clause 16(a) of the Bill provides for this change.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(b) Enhancement and refinement of tax transparency treatment for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scope of the tax transparency treatment currently granted for REITs is further enhanced to encourage the listing of REITs in Singapore.&nbsp; Tax transparency treatment means that the REIT will not be subject to income tax on its qualifying income at the trust level.&nbsp; Instead, the distribution out of such income will be assessable in the hands of REIT unit<p align=left>Column: 2578<p>holders, unless otherwise exempted.&nbsp; With the enhancements, the Comptroller of Income Tax will be able to extend tax transparency treatment to a wider range of income streams derived by REITs from the activities they engage in.&nbsp; This will help to improve the tax competitiveness of our REITs regime.&nbsp; These changes take effect from Year of Assessment 2008.&nbsp; Clauses 6(e), 20(f), 25(b), 25(c), 25(d) and 25(j) of the Bill provide for these changes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(c) Amendment to facilitate income tax data sharing</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the application by individuals for Government schemes such as social assistance, this amendment provides explicitly that the Comptroller of Income Tax may share taxpayer information with relevant Government agencies, subject to the express consent by taxpayers to release the information.&nbsp; This amendment to facilitate income tax sharing will also allow the Comptroller to share non-identifiable taxpayer information with relevant Government agencies to improve research and the quality of statistics for policy formulation and evaluation.&nbsp; Agencies receiving the information will be subject to rules that ensure that the confidentiality of the information is not compromised.&nbsp; These changes are covered by clause 2 of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>(d) Amendment to eligibility criteria for Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parenthood Tax Rebate is currently given for a qualifying child who at the time of birth has siblings in the same household.&nbsp; For reconstituted households after a divorce, both divorcees may want to claim the same child or children from their previous marriage as a member of their separate households, so that any subsequent births in their new families can qualify for the rebate.&nbsp; This change will specify the manner of determining the <p align=left>Column: 2579<p>household membership of children born before the divorce of the parents, so as to avoid the situation of the same child being double counted in separate households for Parenthood Tax Rebate claims.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Madam, while I understand that the Bill is a technical follow-up of the far-reaching changes which were announced<p align=left>Column: 2580<p> during the Budget this year, I want to however raise a few points, especially since the environment has significantly changed since the beginning of this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, first, with respect to clause 6 of the Bill which amends section 13 of the Income Tax Act, that many exemptions are part of the overall bid to make Singapore more attractive as a destination for capital and business activity, and these changes are welcomed.&nbsp; The addition of the new subsection (1)(zm) by clause 6 of the Bill, read together with the amendments proposed in clause 8 of the Bill, which actually repeals section 13M of the Act, exempts the income of charities and abolishes the requirement of charities to spend 80% of their income and the receipts accrued in the past year on charitable projects within Singapore.&nbsp; This is positive in that charities will then avoid the dilemma on spending on&nbsp;objects for the sake of fulfilling this requirement of spending 80% and will also allow them to accumulate capital for major expenditure projects in the future.&nbsp; However, given the possibility now that more charities will accumulate more of their income than previously, we should also ensure that there is proper scrutiny of the affairs of the charities.&nbsp; To this end, we have seen some good measures put in place recently that improve the framework of regulation for charities.&nbsp; For example, we had the appointment&nbsp;in August last year of a full-time Commissioner of Charities and the setting up of the&nbsp;Charity Council, and the National Council of Social Services itself is taking a more active approach in overseeing and investigating the affairs of charities.&nbsp; We have seen that&nbsp;a few charities were recently audited thoroughly, pursuant to the direction of the NCSS, and the reaction to this has been positive, including from the charities involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, overall, this latest move to allow charities greater flexibility in their spending decision is a positive move which will add efficiencies to all charities, in my<p align=left>Column: 2581<p> opinion.&nbsp; When viewed against the strengthening of the regulatory framework covering charities, we see that this loosening up does not however signal a lowering of scrutiny, which is overall good for us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, on the exemptions relating to the funds managed in Singapore, clause 10, which repeals and re-enacts section 13R, provides exemption for income of companies incorporated and resident in Singapore arising from funds managed by fund managers here in Singapore.&nbsp; Clause 7 of the Bill amending section 13C and 13C(a) of the Bill there are a couple of important things that we should note.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I agree with this initiative, and it gives a strong signal that the Government is serious about positioning Singapore as a global wealth management hub.&nbsp; We must however not be too surprised if this leads to the trend of fund managers locating here while managing the funds that&nbsp;are essentially parked elsewhere.&nbsp; In terms of the direct value-add, aside from the actual expenditure in Singapore, their role would be to act, perhaps with the critical mass of the banking and financial expertise here, and improve Singapore's position as an investment destination.&nbsp; We would, however, want to watch closely to see that we do not become a convenient shield for persons to avoid tax liabilities to their states.&nbsp; Can I therefore ask the Minister of State how can we avoid this situation from arising where they just locate themselves&nbsp;here to take advantage of the exemptions but do not really manage the actual funds here in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, turning now to amendments to clause 11, this provides for the insertion of a new section 13V into the Act, which grants partial exemption to law firms involved in international arbitration work of their income derived from such work.&nbsp; The issue which I hope that the Minister of State can clarify is whether the law firms would get undue <p align=left>Column: 2582<p>advantage over other companies which also derive their incomes from overseas operations.&nbsp; I do not think it is healthy to overly help the law firms while companies are treated differently.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I hope the Minister of State can clarify how is this going to be treated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;corporate tax restructuring, we have debated this extensively in this House, especially during the Budget debate.&nbsp; But the lowering of income tax rates alone is no longer an innovative move, as we have seen other countries doing the same.&nbsp; The latest move was made by Hong Kong in October to lower its own tax rates yet again&nbsp;to 15% for personal income tax and 16 1/2% for corporate tax.&nbsp; In the light of Hong Kong throwing the gauntlet down with its rate cuts, I wonder how far we can go, and should go, and also how we hope to remain competitive in the long run when this happens around us.&nbsp; Would the Minister of State also care to comment on how Singapore will be affected by Hong Kong's recent rate cuts, given that we are essentially in direct competition with Hong Kong in attracting foreign companies, particularly in the service industry?&nbsp; I worry that this may be a race to the bottom between Hong Kong and Singapore.&nbsp; Certainly, if we look at the raw numbers of Hong Kong's personal income tax, they are lower than Singapore's.&nbsp; Just focusing on income tax rates might not be the way to go in the future.&nbsp; We need to ensure that the total package we present is nonetheless still attractive for companies to want to come down here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, one question I have not been able to answer is why, in Singapore, we have chosen to make the personal tax rate higher than the corporate tax rate, while in Hong Kong it is the reverse.&nbsp; Could the Minister of State care to comment on what might be the rationale for this difference between Singapore and Hong Kong?&nbsp; For example, is it simply because Hong Kong has a broader base of<p align=left>Column: 2583<p> taxable citizens and residents or very rich citizens and residents so that even collecting income tax at a lower rate would be sufficient but it is not the same for us?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Madam, I would like to talk about one thing which may not be directly related to the Bill but which is in line with the spirit of corporate tax restructuring that is being implemented with this Bill.&nbsp; This is an issue that I hope the Minister of State would urgently look into.&nbsp; In the last nine months, and especially since the Budget announcement early this year, the cost of doing business in Singapore has significantly increased.&nbsp; In many cases, especially for our small and medium companies, their cost increases have rendered their businesses uncompetitive.&nbsp; Not only are we impacted by ridiculous increases in property prices and rentals, costs of raw materials and commodities have also been spiralling upwards.&nbsp; In such a scenario where costs are going up almost uncontrollably, I ask the Minister of State to be prepared to come in soon with new off-Budget measures to help companies cope with the sudden cost increases.&nbsp; And these cost increases were something that many of the businesses have not forecasted or could not forecast.&nbsp; We cannot wait for the next Budget cycle to help these businesses.&nbsp; There is an urgent need for a&nbsp;review by the Government, especially by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, on the issue of rising cost of doing business in Singapore, and I am sure we will have a very interesting debate on this during the Budget debate next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, on the whole, this Bill is implementing changes that we have already approved in the Budget this year.&nbsp; It takes us in the right direction, including in the area of building a business-friendly climate.&nbsp; But, as I mentioned, the environ-<p align=left>Column: 2584<p>ment is quickly changing and I hope that the Minister and the Minister of State are watching these developments closely with a view to intervening fast, if we need to.&nbsp; I support the changes proposed in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.24 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the proposed amendments are notable for their focus on making Singapore a better place to do business.&nbsp; Most notably, the current amendments propose to cut corporate income tax from 20% to 18%.&nbsp; In the current global environment, the pivotal consideration for a company's decision to plant its flag in Singapore might just be our attractive corporate tax rates.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This reduction is in keeping with the global realities of competition.&nbsp; A KPMG survey recently showed a global reduction in corporate tax rates on the&nbsp;average from 27.2% to 26.8%.&nbsp; Countries like Germany, Spain, the UK and&nbsp;France have corporate tax decreases in the pipeline.&nbsp; Hong Kong's corporate tax rate is still 0.5% below ours.&nbsp; The writing is on the wall.&nbsp; In a cut-throat global economy, Singapore must compete on every front, including its tax environment, to attract businesses to invest and operate in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Madam, like my hon. colleague before me, Mr Inderjit Singh, I have concerns with regard to the amendments in the Bill on&nbsp;corporate tax at this point in time.&nbsp; We know that no policy exists in a vacuum.&nbsp; While the income tax amendments are a positive development, the rationale must be clearly communicated to the public.&nbsp; Coming hard on the heels of consumer price increases, the GST hike and the increases in ERP, the lowering of taxes for those perceived to be economically better off in society will&nbsp;draw criticism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2585<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our Government does not explain its intentions clearly, the impression in the minds of the people will be of a government that is a reverse Robin Hood, ie,&nbsp;tax the poor and give to the rich.&nbsp; The Government has a track record of doing what is in the best interests of the country, and we must prevent any attempts to draw connections between increasing prices for the laymen and decreasing tax rates for corporations and top earners.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make it clear that the purpose of these amendments is to benefit all Singaporeans by attracting investment and encouraging enterprise in Singapore, resulting in potential increases in jobs and standards of living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, to do this, the Government should demonstrate with tangible data that these measures are indeed the best way forward.&nbsp; Can the Ministry provide the public with statistics showing that lowering income and corporate tax rates encourages investment and job creation?&nbsp; These would be of great help to MPs in explaining the new measures to their constituents.&nbsp; Such assurances from our leadership will go a long way in keeping the politics of envy at bay.&nbsp; If unheeded, public perception will allow the green-eyed monster to rear its ugly head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Income tax exemptions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the income threshold qualifying for partial tax exemption has been increased from $100,000 to $300,000.&nbsp; With the increase, 75% of the first $10,000 of chargeable income and 50% of the next $290,000 of chargeable income will be exempt from income tax.&nbsp; However, I am concerned that exempting&nbsp;75% of the first $10,000 of chargeable income will make little difference to companies, due to the low income base of $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to question whether this simple two-tier system removes much steam from the company's growth <p align=left>Column: 2586<p>because it will be exempted only by a substantially lower 50% of a significant base of $290,000.&nbsp; Would it be better if we offered exemption for 100% of a higher initial base income so as to encourage entrepreneurship and help in the initial growth of the company, and then a staggered system of taxation by a greater number of tiers?&nbsp; Members may refer to&nbsp;Appendix A, which has been circulated, for an example of how a staggered&nbsp;system of taxation would be better for entrepreneurship&nbsp;than the current&nbsp;simpler two-tiered system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in both systems, the total tax revenue remains the same at $26,550.&nbsp; But because the base income for initial tax exemption is higher, ie, $22,500 as opposed to $10,000, and because this new system offers full tax exemption, growth of new companies would be less affected by tax payments in the initial stage.&nbsp; This system will not reduce Government revenue from companies with a taxable income of $300,000 or more and will reduce Government revenue only marginally from companies with a taxable income of less than&nbsp;$300,000.&nbsp; However, the slight reduction of tax revenue from each such company will be compensated by the increased number of new companies which are formed because of the more supportive tax environment.&nbsp; Members may refer to Appendix B for examples why less revenue will be collected for taxable income falling below $300,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Charities tax exemption</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the move to abolish the requirement for charities to spend at least 80% of their annual receipts on charitable objects in Singapore within two years in order to enjoy income tax exemption is a laudable one.&nbsp; The current requirement is simply unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Profit-making companies may not always be able to find enough investment opportunities in any given year and may keep monies in<p align=left>Column: 2587<p> reserve to take advantage of opportunities when they do arise.&nbsp; Similarly, the fund-raising</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

I would caution, however, that the NKF affair is still fresh in the public's mind and with the&nbsp;financial irregularities in Ren Ci's accounts being the latest talk of the town, the public will be concerned about something that may be perceived as a relaxation of Government's oversight of charities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, to address the public's reasonable concerns, their attention should be brought to the fact that the Charities Act requires charities to furnish annual statements of accounts and annual reports on the activities of the charities during the year. And charities should be informed in no uncertain terms that these requirements will be enforced firmly and vigilantly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Code of Governance for Charities and Institutions of a Public Character should be brought into force as soon as possible, as it sets out further best practices that are conducive to the transparency and good governance of charities.&nbsp; I understand that even though compliance with the Code is not a mandatory requirement,&nbsp;charities and IPCs must either comply or explain why&nbsp;they do not comply with the guidelines of the Code.&nbsp; This will help to assure the public that the Code has bite and will be effective in regulating the conduct of charities and IPCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2588<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, on this note, I support the&nbsp;amendments to the Bill.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.32 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to start by applauding the Government for the way it is converting feedback from the business community into tangible legislation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now comment on a few specifics starting with charities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Charities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, charities were plagued by the need for&nbsp;adherence to some largely arbitrary spending rules.&nbsp; They had to spend all of their trading income and 80% or more of their donations and other income for charitable purposes. This made life difficult for those organisations wishing to build up a war chest&nbsp;for future significant&nbsp;capital outlays as it meant often protracted explanations and negotiations with the IRAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacing of the convoluted&nbsp;and difficult section 13M with the one-liner of section 13(1)(zm) is to be applauded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new section, the income of any charity registered or exempt from registration under the Charities Act will be exempt from tax.&nbsp; Full stop.&nbsp;This clearly recognises that&nbsp;a charity is bound to apply its income at some point for charitable purposes,&nbsp;otherwise, it would simply lose its charitable status anyway. This will make life a whole lot cheaper and easier for such organisations.&nbsp; Hopefully,&nbsp;the governance framework that we put in will ensure that issues that MPs have raised will be properly addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But certainly, from a tax point of view, this will make it easier for charities to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Fund management</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two momentous&nbsp;changes for the industry&nbsp;are now enshrined in the Act.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2589<p>The first is the ability of funds managed from Singapore to be brought onshore and incorporated here and still enjoy tax exemption that&nbsp;was hitherto only&nbsp;available to&nbsp;offshore funds. This recognises the reality that the funds themselves are pieces of paper.&nbsp; It is the people -&nbsp;the managers,&nbsp;the administrators,&nbsp;accountants,&nbsp;lawyers and bankers&nbsp;who create the jobs and bring the&nbsp;expertise. Bringing the funds onshore inevitably will bring all those resources onshore too. This was something&nbsp;a number of us had championed for some years and the changes are&nbsp;a shining&nbsp;example of the Government's eagerness to listen and&nbsp;pragmatic approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is the scrapping of the notorious 80:20 rule which played havoc with funds seeking exemption under the tax incentive for funds managed from Singapore. The rule stipulated that no more than 20% of a fund could be held by Singapore investors. This was arbitrary and&nbsp;all or nothing approach. The replacement of the rule with a far more liberal and \"honesty box\" approach is a major leap forward for the industry.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the wording in the new legislation is somewhat cumbersome and not as clear as the circular that announced the changes. Perhaps, we should have just stuck to&nbsp;the circular.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Aircraft leasing</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good step forward here is an attempt to make Singapore attractive as an aircraft leasing hub with the introduction of section 43Y which provides for a 5% or 10% tax rate on specified leasing income and for 10% for an aircraft leasing manager under section 43Z.&nbsp; However, there is still some work to be done.&nbsp; For example, it is not entirely clear that capital allowances will be available for lessors for the cost of aircraft where each plane is held in its own special purpose vehicle.&nbsp; Indications are that if each special <p align=left>Column: 2590<p>purpose vehicle forms part of an overall leasing group business&nbsp;that there should be no problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the uncertainty for the moment is causing some still&nbsp;to shy&nbsp;away from the risk and look at alternatives. Some clarity in this area would be helpful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This has&nbsp;also been assisted immeasurably by the relaxation to the loss/capital allowance set off rules in section 10D which previously quarantined different types of leases and made most allowances only available to be set off against the rental income, not other income of the lessor.&nbsp; These new changes will inevitably result in the perking up of interest in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the final piece in the jigsaw is something which is more difficult to control.&nbsp; There is no doubt that countries like Ireland still have a more favourable tax treaty network with low withholding taxes and&nbsp;until Singapore can come alongside in this area, competing will remain difficult.&nbsp; This is something that can only be dealt with over time, but it is an area that we should not overlook as withholding taxes are on the gross rentals, which can often wipe out the lessor's margins at a stroke. The lack of a treaty with the US (with 30% withholding tax rates) makes this market largely inaccessible without a deal of risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, the US is the single biggest market for aircraft leasing -&nbsp;so we need to remove this fiscal&nbsp;barrier to enable our companies to compete on an even keel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>REITs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thriving&nbsp;area is the S-REIT industry and there are probably more than a dozen in the pipeline that will hit the streets early next year. There is a need for&nbsp;separate REIT legislation as the&nbsp;path to <p align=left>Column: 2591<p>transparency/exemption is presently fairly tiring and unnecessary.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;legislation has been&nbsp;brought in&nbsp;in an attempt to sort that&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; The&nbsp;difficulty with it is two-fold though.&nbsp; It is still at the discretion of&nbsp;the Comptroller&nbsp;for transparency to apply, so this really undermines the legislation. The second is that the relevant pieces&nbsp;are so badly written (with&nbsp;double, and if you can manage&nbsp;to get to the end of the sentence, potentially triple)&nbsp;negatives.&nbsp; It is also leafed&nbsp;in&nbsp;amongst existing legislation, and so it is very difficult to follow. There have been suggestions for a separate REIT section, rather like the LLP section, and so on, as has been done for the LLPs and&nbsp;business trusts to make it all crisp and clear. But that plea has not been answered yet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would reiterate the desire to see the REIT legislation consolidated, with also the removal of any discretionary involvement by IRAS so that the whole process becomes clear and automatic.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Interest&nbsp;expenses and other borrowing costs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to the legislation include amendments to section 14, the section that prescribes the extent of deductible expenses, in particular, in relation to (non-interest) borrowing costs. While these address certain illogicalities in the current practice, there is still an issue that remains a thorn in the side of many companies, but&nbsp;most acutely of property companies that construct properties that they then&nbsp;rent out. Current practice is not to allow any \"pre-commencement\" expenses, the largest component of which is&nbsp;generally interest expense on borrowings to construct the property.&nbsp; This can amount to two or three years' worth of interest cost and the disallowance adds&nbsp;significantly to the cost of borrowing.&nbsp; Put that in the context of the $5 billion for the <p align=left>Column: 2592<p>Integrated Resort and the sums at stake can be quite staggering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can find few examples anywhere else in a developed world where there is such a restriction on the deductibility of interest expense, and it is true to say&nbsp;there is no commercial rationale for it. We should consider introducing&nbsp;legislation which either loosens up the deductibility of interest in general, or which deems pre-commencement&nbsp;interest expense to have been incurred on the first day of business.&nbsp; This would reduce the cost of finance as well as reduce the pressure on property companies to recoup that cost through enhanced rentals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope my comments and suggestions&nbsp;will be considered by the Second Minister&nbsp;for Finance when he crafts the Budget in early 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me thank all three Members for their support of the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try and respond to as many points and suggestions as possible.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the topic of tax competitiveness has been extensively debated in this House, especially during the past Budget, so I will be specific with regard to the comments.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I would like to reiterate the overall approach which is that the taxation framework would serve as an enabler of economic activity and it would always be changed,&nbsp;designed&nbsp;or refined so as to respond to changing business conditions, to be conducive to the pursuit of new opportunities and, ultimately, to ensure that Singapore's competitiveness will remain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, on Mr Inderjit Singh's comments on the Hong Kong's tax system.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 2593<p>will not speculate on how Hong Kong determines its&nbsp;personal and corporate income tax rates as this is a matter for their policy-makers, except to say that in Singapore, we set our personal income tax and corporate tax rates in a way where we can ensure that it is competitive and encourages work, savings and enterprise. There is no pre-conceived intent to make personal income taxes higher than corporate income taxes or <I>vice versa</I>.&nbsp; So, ultimately, it is really competitiveness that is the key consideration. And as we all know, there is a global trend&nbsp;towards cutting corporate tax rates,&nbsp;so we expect to face continued pressure to lower our corporate tax rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards personal income taxes, there is also the issue of ensuring progressivity within our system. Although Hong Kong has a lower headline personal income tax rate, the vast majority of taxpayers enjoy a lower effective tax burden in Singapore than Hong Kong, because Singapore's tax system is more progressive. In other words, we have lower and more progressive personal income tax rates for the lower and middle income taxpayers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On corporate taxes, I would agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that the headline tax rate cannot be viewed in isolation and it is always the overall tax package that matters. Even though our headline corporate tax rate of 18% is higher than that of competitors like Ireland and Hong Kong, our tax regime is still competitive. Let me elaborate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, with the partial tax exemption granted on the first $300,000 of income as approved in this year's Budget, about 93% of the tax-paying companies&nbsp;will pay&nbsp;tax at effective rates of below 16.5%, which is Hong Kong's tax rate. And about 82% of the companies&nbsp;will pay&nbsp;an effective tax rate of below 12.5%, which is Ireland's corporate tax rate. So there are many more<p align=left>Column: 2594<p> companies here that are actually paying below the respective tax rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's competitiveness is not just about low tax rates.&nbsp; Indeed, the&nbsp; World Economic Forum ranked Singapore as the most competitive economy in Asia and the seventh most competitive economy overall in its <I>2007/2008</I> <I>Global Competitiveness Report</I>.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we will not be complacent and we will continue to monitor the global environment to ensure that our tax regime remains competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Mdm Ho asked if there was&nbsp;a correlation between the corporate tax cuts and&nbsp;investments.&nbsp; We recognise and we have to accept that we live in a competitive world and that companies will locate where it makes the most economic sense for them to do so. Many factors come into play, in terms of determining their investment decisions, but a favourable tax regime is a key factor in helping Singapore attract investments and creating good jobs as&nbsp; a consequence. If we are not attractive as an investment location, then our people will suffer. So corporate tax cuts, as I have said earlier,&nbsp;are a reality. They are not conceived at the expense of Singapore residents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to have statistics showing the direct correlation between tax rates and the investment or job creation.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if we were to track the investment commitments made over the last few years, they have remained healthy at over $8 billion for each of the last three years.&nbsp; I would agree with Mdm Ho that we should continue to share information on the increased economic activity level as a result of the tax incentives and the benefit, in terms of job creation that this has brought to Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho also made&nbsp;suggestions about helping new companies.&nbsp; Madam, I would like to clarify that currently, we already grant a full tax exemption for the first<p align=left>Column: 2595<p> $100,000 of normal chargeable income for new companies that meet the qualifying conditions during the first three years of assessment of their establishment.&nbsp; So this is specifically targeted to help start-up companies.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Also, in the same Budget Statement, the partial tax exemption, as Members have heard, of all companies, not just new start-ups, was raised from $100,000 to $300,000.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor these limits for effectiveness and will make the necessary changes where it is deemed to be helpful.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let me now go to the specific points raised by the different Members.&nbsp; Mr Gautam Banerjee asked if we could allow the deduction of pre-commencement interest expenses.&nbsp; Allowing pre-commencement expenses will essentially touch on the fundamental issue that only expenses incurred in the production of income are allowable for tax purposes.&nbsp; Such expenses are incurred to put the business in&nbsp;a position to start functioning and are not incurred in the production of income.&nbsp; Therefore, that divide would remain.&nbsp; There is currently already a concession to allow tax deduction for certain revenue expenses, including interest expenses,&nbsp;prior to the commencement of business.&nbsp; Under this concession, a business, other than a section 10(e) company, will be treated as having commenced operations on the first day of the accounting year in which it earns the first dollar of its business receipts.&nbsp; Again, as with all tax incentives, this is a situation where we will continue to monitor for competitiveness reasons.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, moving on to Mr Inderjit Singh's point about the international arbitration incentive.&nbsp; Our regime, as I said, serves to promote and enable more economic activities to be carried out in Singapore.&nbsp; In<p align=left>Column: 2596<p> the case of international arbitration, we have to recognise that&nbsp;international arbitration&nbsp;carries high economic value and it is also a very mobile one, much more so than for the other professional services.&nbsp; Arbitrations can be held anywhere, and there is stiff international competition.&nbsp; So we have to be proactive with regard to creating incentives.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incentives for the sector will be consistent with the location of more ancillary support services here in Singapore to serve the regional market as well as the global market.&nbsp; A very good example would be the maritime services sector.&nbsp; The income&nbsp;would be earned in Singapore, as the hearing must be done in Singapore, even if the subject of the dispute does not involve or happen in Singapore or the parties involved do not locate their businesses here.&nbsp; Law firms that are qualified for the tax concession in international arbitration do not compete with companies in other sectors doing businesses overseas.&nbsp; So there is no conflict of interest or competition&nbsp;for incentives.&nbsp; In fact, building Singapore into an international arbitration centre would help Singapore companies which are doing businesses overseas as well, as they can in turn have their arbitration done in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh also raised a topic that is frequently discussed, ie, rising business costs.&nbsp; The Minister for Trade and Industry had extensively addressed the issue of rising business costs in this House in August,&nbsp;so I would not repeat his statements.&nbsp; But, nonetheless, I will note Mr Singh's concerns.&nbsp; I would also like to assure Members of the House that the Government is constantly preoccupied with ensuring that we remain competitive on all fronts, and we are therefore open to receiving suggestions from both the GPC as well as from the industry.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on now to the fund management incentive which both Mr Inderjit<p align=left>Column: 2597<p> Singh and Mr Gautam Banerjee have raised.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new tax exemption scheme for funds under management will be helpful to the Singapore-based fund managers to the extent that it&nbsp;will give certainty&nbsp;that the fund will not incur tax liability in Singapore simply by virtue of the fact that the fund manager is based in Singapore, or when the resident investor's holdings exceed 20%.&nbsp; So it serves to remove that uncertainty.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign investors are attracted to Singapore not solely for tax reasons but because Singapore is a reputable and credible financial hub, and we expect the foreign investors who participate in such schemes to be compliant with the tax laws in their respective home jurisdictions, as it is their responsibility to do so.&nbsp; As it is with any tax incentive scheme, there will be tracking of businesses to ensure that there is no abuse and that there is real substance of economic activity that is carried out in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fund management scheme,&nbsp;Mr Banerjee made a&nbsp;comment about the drafting quality.&nbsp; Madam, there is a need to be legally accurate in our legislation which can sometimes result in lengthy but very specific descriptions.&nbsp; The Ministry is mindful of this and will continue to strike a balance between the need for simplicity and accuracy in our legislative changes.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Banerjee has also given some comments on aircraft leasing.&nbsp; The scheme which was enhanced in this year's Budget really serves to position ourselves better as an aviation hub, as we have both the aviation expertise as well as a well-developed financial services sector.&nbsp; There are increasingly many different complex models with which an aircraft lessor may conduct its activities.&nbsp; For certainty of tax treatment, lessors can always seek an advanced ruling from the IRAS, just to be sure.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2598<p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards tax treaties, I would like to assure Members that we are constantly reviewing our existing treaties as well as exploring new treaties, but this will remain a challenge.&nbsp; Having said that, for this, we aim to attract lessors who are looking to leverage off Singapore's geographical location and advantage in Asia and our competitive cost of operations as well.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving now to REITs, again, I would like to thank the Member for his comments on the drafting quality.&nbsp; His comments are well taken.&nbsp; As I have said, we are always seeking to improve the drafting of legislative changes.&nbsp; In fact, that is why the Income Tax Bill was published for public consultation in June and July to get suggestions on improvements to drafting.&nbsp; For this particular topic, we actually received no suggestions.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the discretion granted to the Comptroller, it is really to enable the Comptroller to respond and to proceed flexibly with regard to the treatment of new business models, as REIT models continue to evolve&nbsp;or change.&nbsp; So this is really more to the contrary, that&nbsp;of providing flexibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the Ministry will work with IRAS to make known the details under which the tax transparency treatment will be granted to approve sub-trusts of REITs, to give certainty to the REIT.&nbsp; So there will be a list and there will be the discretion to provide for flexibility to treat and&nbsp;respond to new models.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would wish to make a clarification here, Madam.&nbsp; There are currently separate pieces of legislation addressing the regulation and governance of limited liability partnerships and business trusts.&nbsp; However, all the income tax matters related to these different business forms are incorporated in the various parts of the Income Tax Act based on whether the positions relate to taxability, tax exemp-<p align=left>Column: 2599<p>tions and so on.&nbsp; But I take the Member's point about drafting for clarity.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Madam, on charities.&nbsp; The 80:20 rule, if I may recapitulate, was previously in place to prevent the hoarding of funds and to ensure that spending takes place in Singapore.&nbsp; But as Members have noted, removing the 80:20 income tax exemption rule will help charities optimise investment and their use of funds to support a more sustained charitable programme in the quest to meet the longer-term needs of the community.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that the removal of the rule is unlikely to lead to poor governance, as there are sufficient measures in place taken by the Commissioner of Charities to ensure that the charities and institutions of a public character (IPCs) manage their resources responsibly.&nbsp; For example, the Commissioner of Charities can suspend or shorten the period of IPCs if there are governance lapses.&nbsp; For non-IPC charities, they could also be deregistered by the Commissioner of Charities on similar grounds.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mdm Ho has noted, the soon-to-be-finalised code of governance for charities and IPCs is not mandatory.&nbsp; But because it is meant to promote self-regulation and not draft more regulations, as this&nbsp;could be too onerous, we are encouraging the disclosure of the extent to which the charity is complying with the code of governance.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I believe I have addressed all the issues.&nbsp; Once again, let me thank Members for their support of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These two sets of&nbsp;measures have been extensively debated in this House -&nbsp;Workfare, during the last Budget and Committee of Supply, and the latter in September this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill before this House today seeks to amend the CPF Act accordingly.&nbsp; It facilitates the implementation of the new CPF interest rate framework to help improve members' retirement adequacy.&nbsp; Amendments in the Bill also create a new Part for the administration of the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme to help low- wage workers increase their incomes and CPF savings. Lastly, some amendments are introduced to strengthen the administration of the Act and to clarify certain existing policies. &nbsp;I will deal will these administrative aspects first.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Strengthen the administration of the Act and to clarify certain existing policies</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 7(a)-7(c), 8(a)-8(c) and 9(a) align the language used in sections 21(1), 21(1A), 21A(1), 21A(1A), 21B(1) and 21B(3) with that used in section 77(1)(h), so as to include \"acquisitions\" or transfers in addition to the existing \"purchase\" <p align=left>Column: 2601<p>when referring to the buying of property.&nbsp; This follows on from the changes in the CPF Act amendment earlier this year for the division of matrimonial assets.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPF (Nominations) Rules are currently prescribed by the CPF Board under the general powers accorded under subsection 77(2)(k).&nbsp; In view of the importance of nominations, clause 12 will make explicit the CPF Board's power to make rules prescribing the manner and circumstances in which nominations may be revoked.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 16 extends&nbsp;the MediShield Scheme to cover the payment of costs incurred by insured members for medical services, in addition to medical treatment. This will allow organ procurement costs to be included as part of organ transplant costs, and be payable from the Medisave Account and claimable under MediShield. This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 1st October 2007, in line with the Ministry of Health's changes on the use of Medisave withdrawals and MediShield claims for organ procurement costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>CPF reforms&nbsp;improve returns on CPF savings</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in my Ministerial Statement on the CPF Reforms in September, I had outlined a number of measures to help members attain a more secure retirement. This included the extra 1% interest paid on the first $60,000 of a member's combined balances, with up to $20,000 from the Ordinary Account, and to defer the Draw Down Age&nbsp;of CPF members.&nbsp; This was&nbsp;to help ensure that members' CPF savings last their lifetime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I announced then that a Deferment Bonus will be given on Retirement Account&nbsp;balances of up to $30,000 for members who are affected by the increase in drawdown age. If eligible members voluntarily defer their draw-<p align=left>Column: 2602<p>down, they will receive the Voluntary Deferment Bonus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill creates a new definition for the additional interest which CPF Board may pay in addition to the base interest. It also redefines the Retirement Account, so that it can receive contributions such as the Deferment Bonus and the Voluntary Deferment Bonus, as well as the extra interest earned from monies in other accounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 consolidates the existing provisions relating to the payment of interest and allows CPFB to pay the extra interest on the whole or part of the amount standing to the credit of a member in any of his CPF accounts. This will allow for the payment of the extra interest under the new structure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 4&nbsp;to 6 provide the consequential amendments needed arising from the fundamental change in clause 3.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5(a) specifies how the base interest and extra interest can be credited into a member's account, such as whether to pay interest into the account where the interest-bearing money stands, or to credit the interest arising from one account to other accounts. This will facilitate the crediting of the extra interest from the Ordinary Account into the Special Account&nbsp;or Retirement Account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, clauses 5(b), 7(b), 8(b), 9(b), 10, 13&nbsp;to 15, 18 and 19 amend different parts of the Act&nbsp;to provide for the recovery or refund of an amount of interest other than that which accrued or could have accrued in the event of any adjustments, transfers or withdrawals. Presently, when transfer or withdrawals are made to the CPF accounts for the use of housing, education and other uses, members are required to refund the principal amount withdrawn in addition to any interest that could have been earned<p align=left>Column: 2603<p> if the transaction had not been made. So in other words, they have to refund the principal and the interest that could have been earned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, CPF Board may also have to refund monies into members' account with interest in certain cases,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;when coverage for the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme is cancelled because the insured is found to have withheld relevant information from CPF Board and, in this case, the premium has to be refunded with interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, under the new interest rate structure, the extra interest that could have been earned would depend on the amount of combined CPF balances at each relevant period, as well as the balances in each CPF account at any one time, which would change due to contributions and withdrawals, including for uses other than housing. As such, it may be quite complex and indeed costly to determine whether the additional 1% interest could have been accrued at each relevant period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore propose to&nbsp;take a more practical approach and the amendments in these clauses thus allow the CPF Board the discretion to recover up to the additional interest that could have been earned.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Workfare Income Supplement Scheme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, to allow older low-wage workers to share in the benefits of economic progress and to reward work, Workfare has been introduced as a permanent feature of our social security system,&nbsp;and it is&nbsp;tied to the CPF system. The administration of WIS will become a statutory function of the CPF Board by the creation of a new Part in the CPF Act for the WIS scheme. This will empower <p align=left>Column: 2604<p>the CPF Board to administer the scheme effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for CPF Board to have regulatory powers over the disbursement of the WIS, the new Part VIA is being introduced into the CPF Act to give the Board the power to credit the WIS CPF component into the eligible members' CPF accounts and to pay the WIS cash component to members directly under the CPF Act. To prevent abuse and deter false declarations under the&nbsp;Scheme, this section also empowers the CPF Board to take action through penalties calibrated according to the severity of the offence. Similar to other offences under the CPF Act, WIS offenders will be subject to a fine not exceeding $2,500 for the first conviction, and to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the second and subsequent convictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Part will also allow CPF Board to conduct recovery and adjustments of WIS already paid out to members. Apart from recovery of WIS benefits paid out under fraudulent circumstances, there may be legitimate situations where benefits will also need to be adjusted. This is because the first payment of WIS is a provisional one and the final payment for that year will be adjusted when the final average income is declared.&nbsp;Let me give examples.&nbsp; For example, a member could have been eligible based on his income for the first half of the year but subsequently becomes ineligible because he receives a high year-end bonus that causes his average monthly income for the year to exceed the WIS wage criterion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, a member who receives a salary cut during the second half of the year may be eligible for higher WIS benefits than that paid out under the provisional payment. The additional benefits would be calculated and the member's final WIS payment would be adjusted upwards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2605<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 17 will insert a new Part VIA, comprising&nbsp;new sections 57A to 57F into the CPF Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 57A and 57B provide for the interpretation of terms found in the new Part and establishes the WIS as a scheme administered by CPF Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 57C will enable CPF Board to distribute cash payments from the Government to CPF members directly besides crediting the monies directly into members' CPF accounts under the WIS scheme. It will also empower the CPF Board to recover, from members or third parties, any cash or CPF paid to members in excess of that which they are entitled to receive, or, if these members were not entitled to receive the WIS benefit paid, such as in the case of fraud. This section also enables CPF Board to recover, on behalf of the Government, any Government debt due from the member out of the WIS, as well as to recover WIS in the event of the member's death, if the Board chooses to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 57D provides for an additional process for recovery via the courts in the event that the member was convicted of an offence under the CPF Act in connection with the WIS benefits, such as falsely declaring his eligibility for WIS to the CPF Board. In conjunction with section 57D, section 57E helps facilitate the administration of the enforcement process by providing for a certification issued by CPF Board which may be used as evidence of WIS amounts paid and amounts recoverable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 57F will provide for regulation-making powers to carry out the provisions of the new Part VIA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 11 of the Bill amends section 24 of the Act, which protects CPF benefits, to facilitate the recovery of WIS under the new section 57C and any <p align=left>Column: 2606<p>regulations made under the new section 57F.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 20 amends section 76, empowering CPF Board to compile statistical information relating to all members, which will help provide data to support the review of this scheme in&nbsp;three years' time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new CPF interest rate structure and Workfare Income Supplement Scheme changes will take effect on 1st January next year, as previously announced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I beg to move.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 2606<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EXEMPTED BUSINESS:::2606--></b><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXEMPTED BUSINESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Motion--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Motion)<BR></B></span><div><BR></b>\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 2. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 2606<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL:::2617--></b><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.09 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is a significant piece of legislation and the substance of it has already been very widely debated&nbsp;last month in this Parliament. For the first time in our history, we now have a long-term income supplement scheme to support low-wage workers, ie, the&nbsp;WIS. &nbsp;Stretched incomes, with income stagnation or decline for the bottom end of our wage earners,&nbsp;are not peculiar to Singapore. Globalisation and technological change have often been cited as the reasons for<p align=left>Column: 2607<p> this income gap. While this is true, inequity can also be partly controlled through the right policies designed by Government, instead of leaving everything completely to the free market. The WIS is clearly one example of a proactive policy, which will benefit our low-income&nbsp;earners while not weakening self-reliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, there are three comments that I wish to make with regard to this Bill, specifically on the WIS scheme.&nbsp; First, currently, the WIS applies only to those who earn not more than $1,500. However, in computing this quantum, the current definition of salary under the Employment Act is used. Hence, instead of just using the basic pay as the basis for computation,&nbsp;overtime pay is included in the computation of the $1,500 salary ceiling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask for this to be reviewed, as it is very common for low-wage workers to work overtime, which can on average come up to about 20% to 30% of the monthly wages. For example, in the security industry, it is common practice for workers to work fixed overtime of about four hours a day, which pushes their salary beyond $1,500. Without the&nbsp;overtime element, their basic pay will be less than $1,000 in&nbsp;most cases. Including the overtime pay acts as a disincentive for workers to work overtime which is difficult to avoid in the current tight labour market where there is a shortage of workers but which means that quite a number of them will not qualify for the WIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the intention is really to encourage our low-income workers to work, then those who work harder doing overtime work&nbsp;or who work on their rest days or public holidays should not be penalised. I request the Minister to revisit this point and to consider the possibility of<p align=left>Column: 2608<p> excluding overtime in determining the salary ceiling of $1,500 under the WIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Madam, as payment of the WIS now depends on regular contributions to CPF, it is important to ensure that employers pay their workers CPF. In this regard, the CPF Board should step up its enforcement efforts to ensure that low-income workers under contracts of service are paid CPF. Could the Minister enlighten this House on the kind of effective enforcement mechanism that is in place today to ensure that employers comply with their obligations to pay CPF?&nbsp;As the CPF contributions are already quite low for our low-income workers, there is no reason for employers not to pay their CPF contributions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Madam, the Workfare Bonus was introduced last year. Could the Minister enlighten this House how many people had claimed the Workfare Bonus and what measures will be taken to educate and inform low-wage workers that they can claim the WIS and how successful has this message been in reaching out to the low-wage workers, bearing in mind that the first instalment will be payable soon?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Madam, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.12 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to seek clarification&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Minister on four aspects of the Bill.&nbsp; The first concerns nominations made by CPF members as to who is to receive their monies upon death.&nbsp; The current section 25 provides that after the nominations are made, they are considered revoked if the member thereafter gets married which makes sense since the circumstances have changed.&nbsp; Clause 12 provides that there may now be other circumstances where a nomination is considered revoked.&nbsp; However, these new circumstances have not been spelt out in the Act<p align=left>Column: 2609<p> but will be prescribed&nbsp;by the CPF Board later.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the revocation of a deliberate nomination by a member is a drastic outcome as it involves inheriting a major asset of the member.&nbsp; Earlier, the Minister mentioned that these other circumstances would actually put into effect what is already in the regulations.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there are any new circumstances for revocation of a nomination being contemplated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Madam, clause 15 touches on the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme.&nbsp; The current section 43(2) provides for the situation where a member takes out the insurance and the Board has reason to believe that he was already incapacitated or suffering from a terminal disease before he took up the insurance.&nbsp; In such an event, his insurance will be cancelled and all premiums he paid using CPF funds will be refunded to his account with interest.&nbsp; Clause 15 will change that to give the Board the discretion only to return part of the interest to the member.&nbsp; I would like to ask why the Board needs to change this position which would seem somewhat heartless in the circumstances as the member is already incapacitated or terminally ill.&nbsp; And I believe that this would include members who are not fraudulent because there is already a provision within section 43 itself allowing the Board not to refund the premiums at all in such circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the last two clarifications concern the new Part VIA providing for the payment of benefits under the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.&nbsp; Under the new section 57C(2), the Government can recover any WIS payments</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

However, Madam, there <p align=left>Column: 2610<p>could be circumstances where it is unjust to recover the monies,&nbsp;for instance, if the monies were paid due to the Government's mistake.&nbsp; For example, the member did not qualify for&nbsp;WIS or was overpaid, and the member may have used the money, not knowing about the mistake as well.&nbsp; Another situation could be the member making a technical error in his application which is not material at all.&nbsp; Should the Government consider refining this provision in order to be fair to innocent members?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the new section 57F allows the Minister to make regulations concerning how&nbsp;WIS payments given to members in cash may be utilised.&nbsp; Madam, WIS is supposed to help members cope with living expenses, and since each person's immediate needs may differ, will restricting the use of&nbsp;WIS cash be a helpful move?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.17 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Madam, thank you for the opportunity to clarify some aspects.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me deal with Mdm Halimah's questions.&nbsp; She is quite right that we have structured the system where we have set the cap at $1,500 and she&nbsp;has asked for this to be reviewed.&nbsp; The $1,500 is the gross salary, which basically means it can include overtime pay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would like to approach this, first, from a larger picture to say what we have put in place and to say that, in principle, nothing is cast in stone yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the front edge of the envelope in having a nationalised income supplement scheme, first among developed countries and, certainly, very few, if any, developing countries do this.&nbsp; And we do this&nbsp;recognising that there is a wage disparity and globalisation is acting on certain wages of our low-wage workers.&nbsp; I say that, both as a mark of our progressiveness but also&nbsp;to sound a <p align=left>Column: 2611<p>cautionary note that any scheme with the best of intentions can degenerate into something&nbsp;which you&nbsp;never conceive.&nbsp; This was what happened to&nbsp;pension schemes worldwide.&nbsp; So we wanted to be careful when we first did it.&nbsp; We did it in a selective manner, and the&nbsp;Workfare Bonus Scheme, which we introduced in 2005,&nbsp;gave us confidence that it could be implemented on a wide scale.&nbsp; Other Workfare schemes, for example, in the States, are for selected populations, not general, and certainly not based on just incomes, including all and sundry under their schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that this can be reviewed, and we have said that we would review it in three years.&nbsp;We have used $1,500&nbsp;a month, which is about the 30th percentile.&nbsp; And this scheme is meant to target specifically those who are older, actually those who are above 45 and earning&nbsp;$1,000, which is about the 15th percentile. I think that is still the correct target to give&nbsp;maximum support.&nbsp; But we also wanted to help those who are earning more and&nbsp;even those who are younger.&nbsp; As recently announced in September, we decided that we would give even more to those who are older,&nbsp;aged 55 and 60, so that, in essence, somebody who is aged 60 earning&nbsp;$1,000 gets $200 a month, a 20%&nbsp;wage supplementation.&nbsp; It is a sizeable contribution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is targeted, it allows us to put more money where we think&nbsp;help is more needed.&nbsp; I think that is also a fundamental&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation principle.&nbsp; We do not want to spread the help too wide because then it becomes difficult. &nbsp;Every time we raise it, we have to give more and certainly there will be a fiscal impact.&nbsp; So, as it is, we think that it will cost us $400 million a year, every year, a fiscal cost, and we have to factor that in.&nbsp; And we want to see how it works because it<p align=left>Column: 2612<p>has not really started.&nbsp; The real scheme, I remind Members,&nbsp;will start next year, and the last two years was the Workfare Bonus Scheme.&nbsp; So I would say that, in principle, we are not closed to reviewing where the wage parameters are, what are the margins we need to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say,&nbsp;let us review what happens, whether it supplements the income, it incentivises work and that it can match, and whether it helps those we want to help, in terms of their daily livelihood and living expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked how many have benefited.&nbsp; From 2006, it was about 340,000.&nbsp; This was the Workfare Bonus Scheme.&nbsp; And from 2007, it was about 362,000.&nbsp; So this was real money going into a large portion of our workforce.&nbsp; If you consider only our Singapore workforce, resident workforce, it is less than&nbsp;two million.&nbsp; We are supporting a group across-the-board, a sizeable group, over 300,000 workers and their families, with Workfare support.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also brought up a very important point -&nbsp;that the CPF is such an integral part of our structure&nbsp;that we ought to make sure that people make contributions.&nbsp; It is not to approach it in a legalistic manner to say that&nbsp;you have to put it in, but because we all recognise that this is really a core system which enables our housing, medical and retirement, and that if you do not do it regularly and early, sooner or later you will have to pay the price of not putting the money into it.&nbsp; And I agree completely with her that we want to&nbsp;put in as much resources as we can and involve as many stakeholders as we can to be able to accomplish this.&nbsp; And that is why we set up the Tripartite Committee for Low-Wage Workers which the Minister of State Gan Kim Yong chairs, and SNEF and NTUC&nbsp;will facilitate this.&nbsp; But the way to do this also has to be customised.&nbsp; There will be groups that we want to take a very hard line.&nbsp; And these are employers who <p align=left>Column: 2613<p>systematically or basically cheat and do not pay their employees CPF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those who say that they are&nbsp;the contract workers, but&nbsp;if it is proved in practice&nbsp;they are&nbsp;the employees, we will take action.&nbsp; So there will be a group that&nbsp;we will use the law and we will&nbsp;send a very strong signal and, from time to time, we will do that to make sure that the employers know that they are liable to pay their employees CPF.&nbsp; I think that there is a place for that, and indeed we will do that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a group, on the other hand, which we do not want to use the stick but carrot, and this is where the Medisave Contributions&nbsp;Draw comes in.&nbsp; And this is where we need persuasion by&nbsp;unions to get these self-employed to put in money so that they can benefit from Workfare.&nbsp; Then there is a group that is in between where we use both measures and we will need all stakeholders to persuade them.&nbsp; Some of these are self-employed, some of these are daily-rated,&nbsp;and we have to explain to them why it is good for them.&nbsp;So I would not underestimate the challenge.&nbsp; There may be 100,000 or&nbsp;150,000 such employees.&nbsp; It is right to focus on them.&nbsp; It is right for MPs to continue to ask what the progress of this is.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think that we have to expand resources to slowly step this up because it is an important component of&nbsp;social security.&nbsp; So I thank her for bringing this up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim asked about certain questions of revocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were very specific.&nbsp; Let me answer what I know and, where there are lapses, I will encourage her to file a specific Question and we will have more time to address them.&nbsp; She asked about new section 25(5).&nbsp; The reason is not that we are trying to change the rules for revocation.&nbsp; They stand as they are.&nbsp; But, previously, the processes and the circumstances of the revocation were in a sense implicit and we wanted to make it explicit because we agree with her that this is a very important point.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2614<p>Who are you giving your money to or nominating?&nbsp; So, basically, the amendment is to make it explicit.&nbsp; The Board's power is to make rules prescribing the manner and circumstances, but the manner and circumstances are not changed from this Act itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked about the circumstances in which a nomination is revoked.&nbsp; As they stand, one of the circumstances now is marriage.&nbsp; She has quite rightly pointed out that it can be revoked by a member's marriage and this makes sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Death&nbsp;of a nominee - it will be revoked when a nominee dies before the member, and this is so that the member's CPF monies may be distributed under the intestacy laws or Muslim inheritance certificate when the member's intended nominee has predeceased him.&nbsp; It can also be revoked&nbsp;on a written notice of revocation. &nbsp;The member should have the right to revoke his nomination at any time as this is his money, so he can complete the notice of revocation.&nbsp; If a nomination is revoked and no subsequent valid nomination is made, the member's CPF monies should be distributed under the intestacy laws and, again, the Muslim inheritance certificate.&nbsp; A subsequent valid nomination by a member would revoke his earlier nomination.&nbsp; This is to make clear that CPF monies will be paid in accordance with the latest CPF nomination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the effect of a revocation when a nomination is revoked and no subsequent valid nomination is made?&nbsp; The CPF monies belonging to the member will be distributed to the Public Trustee, again, according to the intestacy laws and the Muslim inheritance certificate.&nbsp; And if a member has made a subsequent valid nomination, then it will be paid in accordance with his latest CPF nomination.&nbsp; We have discussed this issue internally quite a few times.&nbsp; We want to strike a balance between the ease of application and making sure that members also know that it is something important<p align=left>Column: 2615<p> that they need to do.&nbsp; Simply, if there is no nomination, then the intestacy laws apply.&nbsp; I think that makes sense because that is distributed to his remaining family members.&nbsp; So, as I said, I may not have given all the information&nbsp;that Ms Sylvia Lim has asked.&nbsp; If this is so, I will request that she files a Question to answer those specific questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about clause 15.&nbsp; Let me just say that, in the same vein,&nbsp;when we started our Workfare scheme, we started this section Part VIA in the CPF Act to be able to recover money.&nbsp; But I would not stance it as if, again, in a legalistic manner, that we will try to recover every cent if there is a technical infringement, and we do not want to incentivise work.&nbsp; That is not the aim of it.&nbsp; The aim is really, of course, to create legislation to allow us to act against those who are egregious sinners, those who are plainly fraudulent, and that we can go after,&nbsp;because it is important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I know that our grassroots members are very savvy.&nbsp; I remember once we gave&nbsp;out transportation vouchers and&nbsp;a grassroots member came up to me and said, \"I saw so and so who live&nbsp; there.&nbsp; They are retirees.&nbsp; They live in a terrace house and they were queueing up with me for these transportation vouchers.&nbsp; Why does Government allow this?\"&nbsp; So word gets around, it gets diluted.&nbsp; And if people can get away, in a sense,&nbsp;by cheating the Workfare scheme, falsely declaring, or they know that they have other sources of income, I think it dilutes it, it diminishes it, it really perverts the scheme and distorts it, and it does not allow that scheme to do what it was intended, which was to really help those in need.&nbsp; So all these laws, in terms of adjustments, in terms of being able to recover, are to allow us to act against those people.&nbsp; I suppose it is no different from saying that you fine somebody who<p align=left>Column: 2616<p> is speeding but, if there are mitigating circumstances, then you have to act with compassion.&nbsp; So the DPS was to say that there were circumstances where the CPF Board had to return to the member certain DPS premiums&nbsp;when the policy was cancelled.&nbsp; And I used the reverse example in my speech where I said that we may have to recover because we give the Workfare in two tranches as your income changes.&nbsp; But we wanted not to be tight-fisted, we wanted to give you the money first, and, if there are adjustments in the second half of the year, we can adjust.&nbsp; That was the reason.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But because of the new interest rate structure,&nbsp;1% is given on $60,000 from all combined accounts. Again, we wanted to be flexible because among the three accounts -&nbsp;the Ordinary Account, the Retirement Account and the Medisave Account -&nbsp;it shifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you sell a house and you have a lot of money, suddenly, you do not earn the 1%.&nbsp; Then you buy a new house, you take out from&nbsp;your OA, you are below the $60,000, the 1% comes back.&nbsp; It kicks in.&nbsp; So that 1% moves with three accounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Where it is necessary and, for a few members, we can calculate, I suppose&nbsp;manually, to return it.&nbsp; It is only that 1% on the extra amount;&nbsp; it is not the entire interest, in other words, that flat 4% or the 10-year SGS+1 in which the new interest&nbsp;rate structure is based.&nbsp; That is quite&nbsp;clear.&nbsp; That is not a problem.&nbsp; But the extra 1% is contingent on the $60,000, which makes it a bit more complicated.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, when we are recovering interest, we may have to just say that the<p align=left>Column: 2617<p> extra 1% is difficult to calculate.&nbsp; We can recover&nbsp;but that gives us the discretion.&nbsp; And if there are cases indeed where we certainly do not want to add greater hardship for these cases, we will spend the extra effort to return all the interest, if&nbsp;need be.&nbsp; So let me give the House and Ms Sylvia Lim that assurance.&nbsp; So, that answers the unjust&nbsp;refund under DPS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about the WIS payment in&nbsp;cash.&nbsp; On that last point, I was not quite clear that the CPF Act wanted us to prescribe the manner in which the cash&nbsp;is to be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have to check up on that, but I do not think that that was the intention of the legislation.&nbsp; Once the cash is given to&nbsp; you, I think that is out of our hands and nobody can legislate what you do with it.&nbsp; So let me check on that and return to her perhaps in a written reply, if I may.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;The Commission has presented its Report to Parliament on 30th October 2007.&nbsp; The Commission considered the revisions made to the Civil Service's Management Executive Scheme, which will introduce a salary structure that is more responsive to market wage movements and performance-based adjustments with effect from 1st January 2008.&nbsp; As announced by the Public Service Division, these revisions include an increase of up to 6% to the base monthly salary for eligible officers, a market-based merit increment framework, a new Growth Bonus and increased performance bonus rates that will better recognise and reward outstanding performance.&nbsp; The performance bonus rates for good performers will increase by up to one month while that for better performers will increase by up to 2.75 months.&nbsp; There will also be a High Potential Programme put in place which will provide more training and developmental opportunities and incentive payments to retain high potential officers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In respect of the staff of Parliament, since 2003, the existing Parliamentary Scheme and the Language Executive Scheme (Parliament) had adopted a salary and performance-based framework similar to the Management Executive Scheme in the Civil Service.&nbsp; Following the revisions for the Civil Service, the Commission recommends that a new Parliamentary Scheme (2008) and Language Executive Scheme (Parliament) (2008) be adopted,<p align=left>Column: 2619<p> following the new Management Executive Scheme, with effect from 1st January 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, if sterilised or disposable needles are used and proper infection control measures are followed, the risk of infection is very small.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board has put in place health education programmes, mainly through health education pamphlets, for tattooists, barbers, hairdressers and beauticians.&nbsp; These include information on the precautions that should be taken, such as the use of disposable equipment where possible, thorough disinfection and sterilisation of non-disposable skin-piercing equipment, and the practice of good personal hygiene.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past 30 years, there have been no reports of infectious disease transmission or serious complications from a body tattooing procedure in Singapore.&nbsp; There is no compelling need to regulate the industry. But we will continue to monitor this industry, and leave open the issue of whether to introduce legislation to control it.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION--><p align=left>Column: 2623<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANISATION (UNESCO)--><!--END_COL_TITLE:UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANISATION (UNESCO):::2624--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANISATION (UNESCO)</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.
