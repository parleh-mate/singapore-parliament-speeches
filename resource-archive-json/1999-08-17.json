MAS does not interfere,  but\r\n\r\nit  expects all financial institutions to conduct their business\r\n\r\nactivities,  including dealings with customers, in a transparent\r\n\r\nand  professional manner, and in keeping with the guidelines set\r\n\r\nby their respective industry associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks, whether local or foreign, incur costs in servicing\r\n\r\ncustomers.  They need to impose appropriate charges  to  recover\r\n\r\nthese costs.  Some foreign banks in Singapore have already  been\r\n\r\nimposing  charges  on saving accounts for  a  number  of  years.\r\n\r\nThese  charges  cover the costs of generating and  mailing  bank\r\n\r\nstatements,  operating teller counters, providing  ATM  services\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, local banks have been absorbing the costs\r\n\r\nof providing saving accounts to customers.  These costs had been\r\n\r\npartially offset by cross-subsidies from larger accounts and non-interest   bearing  current  deposits.   But  the   increasingly\r\n\r\ncompetitive banking environment is making it difficult for  them\r\n\r\nto cross-subsidize certain groups of customers with others while\r\n\r\nmaintaining  overall  competitiveness.   Banks  are  also  under\r\n\r\npressure from customers to pay interest on current accounts  and\r\n\r\nimprove their level of services, all of which involve additional\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some local banks have therefore decided to impose charges\r\n\r\non  these accounts.   MAS has to allow them to do so, to compete\r\n\r\non  a  level  playing  field  with foreign  banks.   Banks  will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  phase  in  the  introduction  of  new  charges,  to\r\n\r\nmaintain customer relationship and goodwill and allow them  time\r\n\r\nto adapt.  Banks will also have to actively find ways to service\r\n\r\ncustomers  efficiently  at the lowest cost  possible  to  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is considerable competition among banks in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  competition  will ensure that charges are  reasonable  and\r\n\r\naffordable,  although  not free.  Customers  can  choose  freely\r\n\r\nwhich bank to use. A bank that imposes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexcessive charges or offers poor services will lose customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers also have a role in minimizing bank charges they\r\n\r\nincur.   For example, customers who operate several small saving\r\n\r\naccounts  concurrently may find it makes  sense  to  consolidate\r\n\r\nthese  accounts into one.  This will minimize the costs to banks\r\n\r\nof  providing  these  accounts, and in  turn  the  charges  they\r\n\r\nimpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks service charges do not run counter to our push\r\n\r\ntowards a cashless society.  A cashless society will hinge on  a\r\n\r\nreliable,  secure,  efficient and extensive  electronic  payment\r\n\r\nsystem.   This involves some costs. The challenge is to build  a\r\n\r\nsystem  that will be more efficient, convenient, and  economical\r\n\r\nto use than cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Government in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  banks'  imposition of such  charges  on  small\r\n\r\nsavers,  and whether the Government will consider the impact  on\r\n\r\nlower income families who need to operate a bank account to  pay\r\n\r\nin their salary or whatever by allowing the banks to impose such\r\n\r\ncharges by the MAS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> There is an impact whenever there is a\r\n\r\ncharge which is levied, but it is not a matter for MAS to decide\r\n\r\nor  not to decide, because MAS has never had any rule to require\r\n\r\nbanks  to  provide  free services.   There  are  many  banks  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Some  are  focused on the smaller  savers  and  the\r\n\r\nsmaller customer segment of the market.  Some go for the  middle\r\n\r\nor  higher  segment of the market.  And they have to charge  for\r\n\r\ntheir  services.   It is a facility which many wage-earners  use\r\n\r\nbecause  they  receive their salaries, they have  to  pay  their\r\n\r\nbills and so on.  But, overall,  our philosophy in Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen  that  when  there  are costs, it is  best  that  they  are\r\n\r\nreflected.   So, whether it is medical services, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nyour  utilities   -   electricity  and  water,  whether  it   is\r\n\r\ntelephones,  they  are all not for free, and  yet  everybody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   has   water,  electricity,  medical   services   and\r\n\r\ntelephones.  So there is really no argument\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto be made that banking services should be different.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister whether the provision of more manpower\r\n\r\nintensive   services  such  as  teller  services   at   branches\r\n\r\nconstitutes  a significant proportion of the cost  of  providing\r\n\r\nservices to retail customers in general, and whether banks  will\r\n\r\nmove towards not only providing more cost efficient alternatives\r\n\r\nbut also educating their customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> These are costs which the banks will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  have to estimate, recognise and  minimise  as  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  becomes more competitive.  When it is  a  protected\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  you are just operating in  the  old  way,  and\r\n\r\neverybody puts his money into the same few banks, big and  small\r\n\r\ndeposits,  then the banks are not under pressure  and  they  can\r\n\r\nprovide  services apparently free, which really cost  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney.   Every  ATM transaction costs maybe $1.50 to  the  bank,\r\n\r\nbecause  you  have  to provide the software, the  hardware,  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications,  the  services, reconciliation  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nEvery  counter transaction costs several dollars.   Some  people\r\n\r\ntell me that it may be even more than $10, because there are  so\r\n\r\nmany branches and some branches have very few customers per day,\r\n\r\nand  you  have to pay the rent, utilities, salaries and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAnd the bank manager meets only 10-20 customers per day.  So the\r\n\r\ncosts are very high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, there are teller charges. If you go to a\r\n\r\ncounter  in  order to do some transaction, you have to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthat  service.  If you use an ATM, you also have to pay for that\r\n\r\nATM.   One  way or the other, the cost will finally have  to  be\r\n\r\nreflected.  Banks do not have infinitely deep pockets with which\r\n\r\nto  generate largesse all round.  These are adjustments which we\r\n\r\ncan take a little bit of time but which, eventually, we have  to\r\n\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I am convinced that the banking services will\r\n\r\nremain  affordable.  Singaporeans are not poor,  and  the  banks\r\n\r\nhave a great incentive to reduce their costs and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfind  more  efficient ways of providing these services  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  break even and collect all the little deposits  which\r\n\r\nare available outside there, because there is benefit to them if\r\n\r\nthey can reach out that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister that if DBS were to do the same thing, would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, as the largest shareholder, use its influence?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Government, as the largest\r\n\r\nshareholder, cannot act against the commercial judgment  of  the\r\n\r\nbanks.  DBS has only 40% Government ownership.  So they have  to\r\n\r\nact in their commercial interest.  They have taken over POSBank.\r\n\r\nThere  is a certain understanding that POSBank has come  with  a\r\n\r\nsocial mission and DBS inherits this social mission.  It is  not\r\n\r\nsomething which they can wash their hands off.  There are  parts\r\n\r\nof  it  which need to be gradually rationalised, eg,  the  lower\r\n\r\ninterest mortgage loans which POSBank used to provide and  which\r\n\r\nDBS  has  said, over a period of a few years, it  will  have  to\r\n\r\nadjust  those  to market rates.  Also, on deposits  and  savings\r\n\r\ndeposits,  some adjustments will be necessary.  But  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat they will take their time and do it in a moderate way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B.

Is  he\r\n\r\nsaying  that any customer who has any complaint about any charge\r\n\r\nthat is made has no recourse anywhere, but has to accept it?  Is\r\n\r\nit  not  time,  as  I  have asked before,  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsidered  appointing  a  banking  ombudsman  to  receive   any\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from any customers about any charge imposed  by  any\r\n\r\nbank?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are five major\r\n\r\nSingapore banks and 22 foreign banks with full licences which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide  a  full  range of services.  There are 3  million  plus\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  if  they do not like  the  way  any  bank  is\r\n\r\ntreating  them,  take their custom to another  bank.   And  many\r\n\r\nbanks,  including foreign ones, will be very happy to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  you are properly treated and will not be unfairly charged,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is foolish for them to do that.  They lose business.\r\n\r\nIf  you  feel  that the bank is not being fair to you,  you  are\r\n\r\nfully at liberty to make a public row of it, and the matter will\r\n\r\nbe   debated.   And  you  can  make  a  representation  to   the\r\n\r\nAssociation of Banks.  They will discuss it.

First, how many small account  holders\r\n\r\nare  we  talking about?  Does the Deputy Prime Minister  have  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  how many are, say,  below $500?  Secondly, would  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister consider the need for  transparency  and\r\n\r\nclarity  in  banking charges, especially to give  small  account\r\n\r\nholders  simple  terms which they can understand?   Thirdly,  he\r\n\r\nmentioned  that the social mission of POSBank has been  changed.\r\n\r\nWould he like to indicate how DBS and the Government, as a major\r\n\r\nshareholder  in  DBS, see the change in the  social  mission  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Firstly, on numbers, I do not have the\r\n\r\nfigures.  It depends on where you draw the line.  If you file  a\r\n\r\nQuestion, I will try and look them up for you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on clarity and transparency, I fully agree. That\r\n\r\nis  one of the problems with the present arrangement.  There  is\r\n\r\nno clarity and transparency.  You make a current account deposit\r\n\r\nand  you  can  have $10,000 there and you are paid no  interest,\r\n\r\nneither  do  they  tell  you  that you  should  really  be  paid\r\n\r\ninterest.  In other  countries, you would.  But in Singapore, we\r\n\r\njust quietly do not talk about it.  Now that has changed.  It is\r\n\r\nincumbent  not just on banks but on other financial institutions\r\n\r\n-   brokers, stockbrokers, insurers, fund managers, unit  trusts\r\n\r\n-  that when they provide a service, they should state quite\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclearly  what  is  their fee and what is your  investment.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  unit trusts, one of the factors which an  investor\r\n\r\nmust consider is how much of their payment is fee.  When you put\r\n\r\nin  your contribution, it may be a significant amount that  goes\r\n\r\nstraightaway  to  fees.   Or when you buy  insurance  from  your\r\n\r\nbroker,  a  significant  amount  of  your  premium  may  go   to\r\n\r\ncommissions  to the broker or, if not, payments  in  some  other\r\n\r\nform.   So  those should be made transparent, and similarly  for\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for POSBank's social mission, as I have explained, we\r\n\r\nhave  not  abandoned this social mission, but this is  something\r\n\r\nwhich has to be evolved and adjusted over time.  Where it has to\r\n\r\ndo with the POSBank's mortgage loans where the social mission is\r\n\r\nreally  the  weakest case, we are going to take  some  years  to\r\n\r\nadjust  them  to  market levels.  In other  cases,  like  taking\r\n\r\ndeposits and encouraging savings, that is a mission which  needs\r\n\r\nto  continue.   But  what form DBS should  choose  in  order  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this  mission is something which I  am  sure  DBS  is\r\n\r\nconsidering now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Has the Government the responsibility\r\n\r\nto  balance  commercial interests against social interests?

Whether it is PUB with utilities or Telecom\r\n\r\nwith  telephone  charges,  or  any other  essential  service  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  food, medical care, there has to be really  a  price\r\n\r\nwhich  reflects the cost of providing that service.  Because  we\r\n\r\nhave followed that philosophy, therefore, we have prospered  and\r\n\r\nnearly  everybody  can  enjoy  in  Singapore  a  full  range  of\r\n\r\nessential  services  to the families.  95% have  telephones  and\r\n\r\ntelevision  sets.  So it is not a question of depriving  people.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of having the right system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso that we can prosper and everybody will be able to enjoy these\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, on the issue of\r\n\r\ntransparency,  would it not be good for the banks,  firstly,  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  very prominent by displaying perhaps on their premises\r\n\r\nthe  rules  that they have in relation to not just small  savers\r\n\r\nbut  all  savers?  Secondly, there is a code of banking practice\r\n\r\nwhich governs the relationship of banks with the customers  but,\r\n\r\nto  my  knowledge, it is not even displayed or made  transparent\r\n\r\nand  available to the consumer.

To\r\n\r\ndate  these  investments amount to US$147 million.   The  amount\r\n\r\ninvested  by each statutory board and GLC is small, compared  to\r\n\r\nthe size of its operations.  They financed these investments  in\r\n\r\nthe  normal commercial manner, from reserves accumulated in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of operations and from bank borrowing. They did so  based\r\n\r\non  commercial  considerations, after critically evaluating  the\r\n\r\nproject's viability.  Ten Singapore companies that are not GLCs,\r\n\r\nand   four  non-Singaporean  multi-national  corporations,  also\r\n\r\nsimilarly invested in the project.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also suggested that the full financial\r\n\r\nstatement of the project be presented for debate in this  House.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not appropriate.  It is for the companies  which  have\r\n\r\ninvested  in the project to examine the project's finances,  not\r\n\r\nfor  Parliament.  These are mostly listed companies,  answerable\r\n\r\nto  their shareholders for their own financial performance.  For\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  debate  the project's budget  is  to  change  a\r\n\r\ncommercial   undertaking  into  a  government  one.

The responsibility  of\r\n\r\nensuring  that they are competently and honestly run rests  with\r\n\r\nthe supervising Ministries of statutory boards.  In the case  of\r\n\r\nGLCs,  it  rests  with their board of directors  and  ultimately\r\n\r\ntheir  shareholders, including the Minister for Finance  who  is\r\n\r\nanswerable to Parliament.  If any MP has reason to believe  that\r\n\r\na  statutory  board or GLC is not being competently or  honestly\r\n\r\nrun, he should raise the matter directly in the House either  by\r\n\r\nfiling a Question or moving a motion, and he will receive a full\r\n\r\nanswer,  as  the  Member has received very full answers  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  Suzhou Industrial Park.   However, it is  counter-productive   for  Parliament  to  second-guess  commercial   and\r\n\r\nbusiness decisions which are properly the responsibility of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement and boards of the statutory boards and GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Deputy Prime Minister accept or not\r\n\r\nthat he is playing with the people's moneys and he has a duty to\r\n\r\naccount to them for every cent?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, the game is not over. I have\r\n\r\nexplained  several  times in this House why we  went  into  this\r\n\r\nproject,  what the difficulties have been, how we have tried  to\r\n\r\nturn  the  project around and what solution we have now  arrived\r\n\r\nat.   The  solution will take several years to  work  out.   The\r\n\r\nfinal  accounting is not done and the project  has  to  run  its\r\n\r\ncourse.   There  is  no  suggestion that the  officials  or  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  involved have been derelict in their duty, that  they\r\n\r\nhave  done this without due diligence and without making  proper\r\n\r\ncommercial  considerations.  They  have  gone  in  on  a  proper\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis.  These are statutory boards  and  GLCs  which\r\n\r\nhave to be assessed as statutory boards and GLCs, and not on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  individual projects.  It is not Parliament's business\r\n\r\nto become a deputy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nauditor  of  these companies.  They have auditors to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthey  have done things honestly.  They have boards to make  sure\r\n\r\nthey have acted commercially in a wise way.

Different pupils have different talents and abilities.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to recognise this in order to help each child progress\r\n\r\nat  a pace he is comfortable with, so that he may develop to his\r\n\r\nfullest  potential.  The EM3 stream is designed for  pupils  who\r\n\r\nare  less academically-inclined.  They are just different.   For\r\n\r\nthese  pupils,  we tailor a curriculum which is  different  from\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  EM1  and EM2 streams, so that  they  acquire  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  numeracy  skills  to  prepare  them  for  further\r\n\r\ntechnical  or  other training.  By customising  the  educational\r\n\r\nprogrammes we deliver, we have helped more children complete  10\r\n\r\nyears  of  general  education.  Since Primary  4  Streaming  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in 1991, the percentage of dropouts at  the  primary\r\n\r\nlevel  has decreased from 1.9% of a Primary 1 cohort in 1990  to\r\n\r\n0.4%  in  1998.   There is flexibility in the streaming  system.\r\n\r\nFor  those  who may develop a little slower, there are  \"bridges\r\n\r\nand  ladders\" in place.  For example, Normal (Technical)  pupils\r\n\r\nwho  demonstrate  the  aptitude for academic  studies  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  cross over to the Normal (Academic)  course  or\r\n\r\neven  the  Express  course.   Each  year,  about  5%  of  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical)  pupils  cross  over to  Normal  (Academic)  stream.\r\n\r\nOutstanding  graduates  from ITE also have  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\npursue  a polytechnic education, and aspire for more challenging\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrewarding technical careers.  In 1998, about 550 students gained\r\n\r\nadmission to the Polytechnics for full-time education, based  on\r\n\r\ntheir ITE qualifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1994 and 1998, the percentage of pupils streamed\r\n\r\ninto EM3 was fairly stable, averaging about 9% of all Primary  4\r\n\r\npupils.   In absolute terms, the number of pupils streamed  into\r\n\r\nEM3  increased from 3,648 in 1994 to 4,587 in 1998,  due  to  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the Primary 4 enrolment.  Pupils streamed into  EM3\r\n\r\nat  Primary 5 continue their studies in their own schools;  they\r\n\r\nare not channelled to other schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EM3 pupils are well-prepared for vocational development at\r\n\r\neach stage of the education system.  From the first batch of EM3\r\n\r\nstudents,  about  100  completed their `O'  levels  through  the\r\n\r\nNormal  (Academic)  course and were admitted directly  into  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnics earlier this year.  Most would, however,  typically\r\n\r\nproceed  on  to  do the Normal (Technical) course  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  which  builds  upon their  EM3  curriculum  through  a\r\n\r\ntechnically-inclined  and  practice-oriented  curriculum.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  Normal  (Technical)  course  students  study  Computer\r\n\r\nApplications, a course which is not available to other secondary\r\n\r\nschool  pupils.   The Normal (Technical) course was  started  in\r\n\r\n1994 largely to cater to these students who otherwise would  not\r\n\r\nhave attended secondary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who do complete the Normal (Technical) course can\r\n\r\nproceed  on to post-secondary technical skills training  at  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Technical Education (ITE). The  ITE  Centres  and\r\n\r\ncourses  underwent a major revamp which was completed  in  1992.\r\n\r\nAbout  74% of all Normal (Technical) course students proceed  to\r\n\r\nITE.   As  I  mentioned  earlier,  many  more  move  on  to  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics.   Upon graduation from ITE and  the  polytechnics,\r\n\r\nthey  can  take  up  highly rewarding careers in  technical  and\r\n\r\nbusiness fields, and help meet Singapore's needs for technically-skilled manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nMinister, for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe thorough reply.

Moreover, these students also  participated  very\r\n\r\nactively  in  the  campus activities,  and  some  even  took  on\r\n\r\nleadership roles in student councils.  We believe that everybody\r\n\r\nshould be given a chance, and that not everybody develops at the\r\n\r\nsame  pace.   And  I think our Normal (Technical)  stream  which\r\n\r\nstarted in 1994 has proven us right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Two supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions, Sir.  First, would the Senior Minister of State agree\r\n\r\nthat  while  the  objectives  of  EM3  are  laudable,  there  is\r\n\r\nunfortunately a social stigma attached to some who  attend  EM3?\r\n\r\nAnd  second, if he agrees to that, what can be done in order  to\r\n\r\nreduce this social stigma attached to being an EM3 student?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> I think the social stigma is the result of\r\n\r\na perception problem and a number of other things.  First, there\r\n\r\nis  need for a process of education even for the public and  the\r\n\r\nparents.  Perhaps the most important thing that has happened  in\r\n\r\nthe last two or three years has been the very positive publicity\r\n\r\nthat the media has given to this group of students.  I think  we\r\n\r\nall  recognise - and that is the type of publicity that has been\r\n\r\ngiven  -  that  they are not useless, they are  just  different,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  what we try to emphasise.

They\r\n\r\nare  just different, and we are all built differently, and  that\r\n\r\nis a message which we have to get through to everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State in\r\n\r\nhis  reply  said that 5% of students from the Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\nstream  were  transferred to the Normal (Academic)  stream  each\r\n\r\nyear.  I would like to know what is the number in the cohort  of\r\n\r\nstudents  each  year  who  are  being  transferred  from  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical)  to  Normal  (Academic)  stream.   Secondly,  is  he\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that  this  number  of  students  being  transferred\r\n\r\nrepresents   the  optimum  possibility  for  the  students   who\r\n\r\nacademically  have a higher ability at EM3 and are  able  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred?   Thirdly, is he satisfied  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and  the  schools have put in  enough  resources  and\r\n\r\neffort  to  educate  EM3 students as well as Normal  (Technical)\r\n\r\nstream  students in the secondary schools, given the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthey might have some problems in learning?

With regard\r\n\r\nto whether that is the optimum number or not, there is really no\r\n\r\nquota  or anything of that sort, and it is simply based  on  the\r\n\r\njudgement  of the teachers and schools of what the students  are\r\n\r\ncapable of and the pace at which they are capable of.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  point in pushing students beyond the pace that they can cope\r\n\r\nwith.

This  rule is put in  place  for  practical\r\n\r\nreasons   because  children  who  are  much  older  than   their\r\n\r\nclassmates  often  have great difficulty  fitting  in  socially.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, applications for admission of pupils who are  more\r\n\r\nthan  two  years above the correct age for the particular  level\r\n\r\nare considered on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, at each stage of education, there are\r\n\r\ndifferent  streams available.  The Member may  wish  to  suggest\r\n\r\ndifferent  names  for  them,  but there  are  different  streams\r\n\r\navailable  to  cater  to students with different  abilities  and\r\n\r\naptitudes so that they can study at a pace suited to them.   For\r\n\r\nexample, those students who are more able to do their `0' levels\r\n\r\nin four years do it for four years; those who need five years do\r\n\r\nit   in   five  years.   So  that  also  ameliorates   the   age\r\n\r\nconsideration and the overage issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put matters into perspective, the drop-out rate in our\r\n\r\nschools  is  low  - 0.4% of a Primary 1 cohort  at  the  primary\r\n\r\nlevel,  and  3.5%  at  the  secondary  level.   But  then  their\r\n\r\neducation  does not end there.  There continue to be educational\r\n\r\nopportunities  beyond that if they choose to  do  so.   Overaged\r\n\r\nchildren can have a second chance for education.  They can avail\r\n\r\nthemselves  of the different continuing education courses,  like\r\n\r\nBEST  (which  take them up to PSLE level) and WISE  (which  take\r\n\r\nthem up to secondary level).  Those who have completed Primary 6\r\n\r\ncan  also  take up training at the vocational training  centres,\r\n\r\nafter  which  they  can progress to the Institute  of  Technical\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community or private organisations which wish to start a\r\n\r\nschool to cater to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noveraged  children can do so.

If  there  is a United Nations  Security  Council\r\n\r\nembargo which enjoins its members from exporting any arms to any\r\n\r\ncountry,  we  will, as a member of the United  Nations,  observe\r\n\r\nthat  embargo  and any other sanctions which  are  part  of  our\r\n\r\ninternational  commitments.  As for the general policy  which  I\r\n\r\nindicated  has  been consistently observed by Singapore  of  not\r\n\r\ndisclosing  arms  sales,  this  is  a  policy  adopted  by  many\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of his question, the drift of his\r\n\r\nquestion  shows  that  the Member has a strange  notion  of  how\r\n\r\nmodern  day diplomacy and international relations are conducted.\r\n\r\nThere are some 180 or more countries who are members\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  United  Nations,  different  sizes,  shapes,  forms  of\r\n\r\ngovernment,  constitutional systems, degrees  of  representative\r\n\r\ngovernments,  and most of them have international relations  and\r\n\r\ninteractions   with  each  other.   Countries   do   not   place\r\n\r\npreconditions on the internal systems of government and policies\r\n\r\nwhen   they  establish  diplomatic  relations  and  have  normal\r\n\r\ninternational  interactions.  This is a  fact  of  international\r\n\r\nlife.   If  this were not so and if countries placed conditions,\r\n\r\nthen  very  few  countries  would be  able  to  have  diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations  with  others.   This is not to  mean  that  countries\r\n\r\napprove  and endorse everything that another country  does  when\r\n\r\nthey  have  diplomatic  relations.   Similarly,  for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMyanmar  is  a member of ASEAN, it is a member of the South-East\r\n\r\nAsian  community,  and  we  have  international  relations   and\r\n\r\ninteractions with them just as the majority of the international\r\n\r\ncommunity do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment recognises the military regime, the usurpers, as  the\r\n\r\nlawful  government of Myanmar?

The  constructive  engagement policy  of  ASEAN  is  not\r\n\r\nintended to dictate to the Myanmar government what it should  or\r\n\r\nshould  not  do.  It is referred to as a constructive engagement\r\n\r\npolicy  in  comparison with approaches taken by other  countries\r\n\r\nand  regions,  which is to either isolate Myanmar or  to  impose\r\n\r\nsanctions  on  them.   ASEAN  decided  that  it  would  adopt  a\r\n\r\ndifferent approach of integrating Myanmar within the ASEAN  fold\r\n\r\nand,  in  that  process, encourage Myanmar  to  see  what  other\r\n\r\ncountries  in  ASEAN  are doing and, hopefully,  they  will,  in\r\n\r\ncourse of time, achieve normalcy.

At this press conference, the  President\r\n\r\nspoke  of what he described as a \"long list\" of problems he  had\r\n\r\nencountered  in trying to protect past reserves. In  particular,\r\n\r\nthe President raised four issues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It would take the Accountant-General \"52 man-years\" to\r\n\r\nproduce the list of physical assets of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) One \"unpleasant\" encounter where he had to withhold\r\n\r\napproval  of  a  statutory board budget because  it  would  have\r\n\r\ncaused a draw on its past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Whether Net Investment Income (NII) should be treated\r\n\r\nas current reserves or past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) His \"disappointment\" that the Government did not need\r\n\r\nhim  to unlock the past reserves to finance its package of  cost\r\n\r\ncutting measures, because it had changed its treatment of NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues concern the working of the Presidential\r\n\r\nsafeguards to protect past reserves. The Constitution  had  been\r\n\r\namended in 1991 to provide for a directly elected President  who\r\n\r\nwould have discretionary powers to veto the use of past reserves\r\n\r\nand the appointment of key officials in the public service. Such\r\n\r\na  move  was  without precedent in any country. It was  a  novel\r\n\r\nexperience for both President Ong Teng Cheong, the first  person\r\n\r\ndirectly elected by the electorate to this new office,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past six years have therefore been a mutual learning\r\n\r\nexperience  for the Government and the President. Many  problems\r\n\r\nwere  encountered and resolved. Both sides have worked  together\r\n\r\nto  interpret  the  constitutional provisions,  and  to  develop\r\n\r\nworking   procedures   for  carrying  them   out.   The   agreed\r\n\r\nunderstanding  is  contained  in  the  set  of  Principles   for\r\n\r\ndetermining and safeguarding the accumulated reserves, which was\r\n\r\npublished as a White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give the House a full account of the four issues\r\n\r\nraised   by   President  Ong,  to  clarify  what  had   actually\r\n\r\ntranspired.  In  the  Government's  view,  these  problems  were\r\n\r\nneither  fundamental nor intractable. They arose mainly  because\r\n\r\nof  differences  of  opinion on the accounting  of  Government's\r\n\r\nphysical  assets, and difficulties that arose in  operating  the\r\n\r\nnew  system.  They were inevitable consequences of  the  two-way\r\n\r\nlearning process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Obtaining an Inventory of Government's Assets</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President had said it had taken the Accountant-General\r\n\r\n\"more than two, three years\" to inform him what the Government's\r\n\r\nreserves  consisted  of.  He said that  when  he  asked  for  an\r\n\r\ninventory  of  the  physical assets, the Accountant-General  had\r\n\r\nresponded that it would take \"52 man-years\" to produce.  He  had\r\n\r\nreplied,  \"Never  mind. Go ahead\", and finally he  received  the\r\n\r\nlist plus diskettes a few months before the 1997 elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House must wonder why it would take \"52 man-years\" to produce a listing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's office had requested a listing of physical\r\n\r\nassets  from the Accountant-General, Mr Goh Khee Kuan,  on  18th\r\n\r\nJune  1996. At a meeting with the President on 14th August 1996,\r\n\r\nless  than  two months later, the Accountant-General provided  a\r\n\r\nlisting  of  State  buildings, while the Commissioner  of  Lands\r\n\r\nprovided  a  listing of State lands. Updates  were  subsequently\r\n\r\nsent to the President's office.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this meeting, the President remarked that to protect\r\n\r\npast  reserves,  the reserves should ideally be  denominated  in\r\n\r\ndollar value. In response, the Accountant-General conceded  that\r\n\r\nfollowing  accounting principles, one should take the  value  of\r\n\r\nwhat  was protected at that point in time, but it would take  56\r\n\r\nman-years  (not  52) just to value the existing  properties.  He\r\n\r\nadded  that  for the purposes of protection of the reserves,  it\r\n\r\ndid  not  matter when the valuation was actually  made,  and  it\r\n\r\ncould be at the point of sale. This was recorded in the minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"56 man-years\" does not mean it takes 56 years to complete\r\n\r\nthe  task. A man-year is a measure of the amount of work  to  be\r\n\r\ndone,  and not of the time it will take to do it. It means  that\r\n\r\nit  takes 56 men working for one year, or 28 men working for two\r\n\r\nyears,  or  one man working for 56 years. It is not unreasonable\r\n\r\nfor  a team of 56 men to take one year to value the entire stock\r\n\r\nof  land and buildings owned by the Government. The land was  in\r\n\r\nsome 50,000 parcels, including miscellaneous parcels like roads,\r\n\r\ndrains  and even some reservoirs.  Such land parcels had  to  be\r\n\r\nverified through actual surveys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the President's recollection of what the Accountant-General had said was mistaken. The Accountant-General did not\r\n\r\nsay  that  52  man-years were needed to  produce  a  listing  of\r\n\r\nphysical  assets. He actually said that it would  take  56  man-years  to  conduct a complete valuation of the physical  assets.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  at the time he said this, he had already  produced\r\n\r\nthe listing that the President had requested. He did not produce\r\n\r\nit  only  after two or three years, or only after the  President\r\n\r\ninsisted upon it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that the Accountant-General and the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments have cooperated fully with the President,\r\n\r\nand  have not in any way sought to hinder the President  in  his\r\n\r\njob of protecting the reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether to revalue all State properties at\r\n\r\neach  changeover of Government had arisen earlier. On 15th  July\r\n\r\n1996, the Auditor General had written\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  inform the Ministry of Finance and the key statutory  boards\r\n\r\nand  Government companies (Those listed in the 5th  Schedule  of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.) that he would require all state properties to\r\n\r\nbe  revalued at market value as at the date of changeover of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  He  cited the Constitution, the  impending  general\r\n\r\nelection, and the Audit Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance sought the Attorney General's\r\n\r\nadvice  on  the  Auditor General's directive. On 30th  September\r\n\r\n1996, the Attorney General's Chambers advised that, in so far as\r\n\r\nthe  directive  concerned land, such a complete revaluation  was\r\n\r\nunnecessary  as  a  matter of law. It  did  not  result  from  a\r\n\r\nConstitutional  need to protect the reserves,  as  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether past reserves were being drawn down did not arise unless\r\n\r\na  piece  of land is actually about to be sold off or alienated.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the proposed revaluation was a waste of  resources,\r\n\r\nas  firstly the reality was that much of state land would remain\r\n\r\nas  state  land, and secondly the value of each  piece  of  land\r\n\r\ndepended   on  planning  and  zoning  restrictions,  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment could change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry forwarded this opinion to the Auditor General.\r\n\r\nThe  Auditor  General then revoked his directive to revalue  all\r\n\r\nproperties  at changeover, stating that there was now  no  legal\r\n\r\nbasis to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to protect State lands and buildings in the reserves is\r\n\r\na  complex  issue  which the Government and  President's  office\r\n\r\nsubsequently   studied  in  much  greater   depth.   The   final\r\n\r\narrangements  agreed upon make up an entire  two-page  paragraph\r\n\r\n(Paragraph 10 in Part A.)of the White Paper on Principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Withholding Approval of a Statutory Board Budget</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong said that public officers should change their\r\n\r\nmindset, and report to the President any improper transaction\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich may draw down the reserves. He said that he suspected that\r\n\r\nsome public officers in the Executive, including some ministers,\r\n\r\nconsidered the President a nuisance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President cited as an example one \"unpleasant\"\r\n\r\nencounter  when he had to withhold approval of the budget  of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board. Its expenditure of $27 million had exceeded its\r\n\r\nincome surplus of $23 million, which would have caused a draw on\r\n\r\nits  past  reserves.  He  said he was prepared  to  approve  the\r\n\r\ndrawdown,  but  there were problems because  of  its  accounting\r\n\r\nsystem. He brought the matter to the Government's attention, and\r\n\r\nthe matter was resolved and he approved the budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory board in question is the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund Board. The chronology of events is as follows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8th November 1996, the CPF Board put up its budget for\r\n\r\n1997 to the President for routine approval. The budget showed an\r\n\r\noperating surplus of $23 million. The submission was accompanied\r\n\r\nby a declaration signed by the Chairman, Dr Andrew Chew, and the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Manager, Mr Lim Han Soon, that the budget was  unlikely\r\n\r\nto  draw  on  the  Board's reserves which were  not  accumulated\r\n\r\nduring the current term of office of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th December 1996, the Principal Private Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  President  informed  the CPF  Board  that  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential  Advisors  (CPA)  had  noted  that  the  Board  had\r\n\r\nbudgeted  a  capital expenditure of $27 million, which  exceeded\r\n\r\nthe  budget surplus of the year by $4 million. The excess  would\r\n\r\nhave to be funded by the Board's accumulated surpluses. But with\r\n\r\na  changeover of government scheduled to take place soon, all of\r\n\r\nthe  Board's  accumulated surpluses would become past  reserves.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the CPA wanted the Chairman and the General  Manager\r\n\r\nof the CPF Board to clarify the basis on which they made their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeclarations, \"knowing full well that there will  be  a  General\r\n\r\nElection soon\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Manager replied on 7th December 1996 to explain\r\n\r\nthat the CPF Board accounts were on an accrual basis. In accrual\r\n\r\naccounting, capital expenditure is depreciated over  the  useful\r\n\r\nlife  of  the asset, rather than in one lump sum in the year  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  The operating surplus of $23 million projected  by\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Board had already charged annual depreciation  of  $11\r\n\r\nmillion  against  the  year's income. Therefore,  there  was  no\r\n\r\ndrawdown  on past reserves, whether the elections were  held  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Manager further explained that even on a cash\r\n\r\nbasis, the CPF Board would still project a budget surplus of  $7\r\n\r\nmillion.   On  a  cash  basis, we would indeed  deduct  the  $27\r\n\r\nmillion capital expenditure from the projected operating surplus\r\n\r\nof  $23  million,  but  we  would also  have  to  add  back  the\r\n\r\ndepreciation  of $11 million. Otherwise we would  in  effect  be\r\n\r\ndeducting  the capital expenditure more than once,  erroneously.\r\n\r\nThe CPF Board's budget and accounts were thus in order and there\r\n\r\nwould not be any drawdown on the CPF Board's past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the President did not accept the CPF Board's\r\n\r\nexplanation.  He  wrote to the Prime Minister on  16th  December\r\n\r\n1996,  stating  that  he would approve the  budget  because  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  was  not wasteful and was in the  public  interest.\r\n\r\nHowever,  following the Constitution, he would be gazetting  his\r\n\r\nopinion  that the budget was likely to draw on the past reserves\r\n\r\nof the CPF Board after the changeover of Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not agree with the President's approach.\r\n\r\nThe   Prime   Minister  replied  the  next  day  repeating   the\r\n\r\nexplanation given by the CPF Board, and requested the  President\r\n\r\nto  hold  back  gazetting his opinion. He suggested  that  since\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be a difference in interpretation of the budget,\r\n\r\nwe  should get the Accountant-General or the Auditor-General  to\r\n\r\nstate  whether  or  not  there would be a drawdown  on  reserves\r\n\r\nfollowing the changeover of Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President replied on 20th December 1996. He agreed to\r\n\r\nhold  back gazetting his opinion, and stated that he would  also\r\n\r\nhold  back  his  approval  of the budget  until  the  issue  was\r\n\r\nresolved. In response to the Prime Minister's proposal  to  seek\r\n\r\nthe views of the Accountant-General and the Auditor-General, the\r\n\r\nPresident wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My duty does not include clarifying with the professional\r\n\r\nbodies  the principles and interpretation. That duty  lies  with\r\n\r\nthe Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also explained his reservations over accrual\r\n\r\naccounting as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My concern here is that this approach (i.e. accrual\r\n\r\naccounting)  will  allow  a profligate Government  to  hide  its\r\n\r\nlavish spending under the guise of capital expenditures.  In the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  it  is  the Government  which  would  have  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  whether  this is a principle  that  should  guide  my\r\n\r\nactions.   And in the absence of clearly enunciated and mutually\r\n\r\nagreed  principles and procedures for dealing with such matters,\r\n\r\nI would rather err on the side of stringency.  If the principles\r\n\r\nhad  been settled earlier, this uncertainty about what is or  is\r\n\r\nnot a draw would not have arisen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accrual accounting is a standard practice not only in\r\n\r\nstatutory   boards   in  Singapore,  but  in  commercial   firms\r\n\r\nworldwide.   Companies and statutory boards have auditors  whose\r\n\r\nduty is to ensure that what are declared as capital expenditures\r\n\r\nhave in fact been properly spent on capital items.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nunder the Constitution, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman\r\n\r\nmust  declare  whether  the budget is likely  to  draw  on  past\r\n\r\nreserves,  and board members and CEOs have a duty to inform  the\r\n\r\nPresident of any proposed transaction which is likely to draw on\r\n\r\npast reserves.  As an additional safeguard, the appointments  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman,  Board  and CEO of the key statutory  boards  and\r\n\r\nGovernment companies are subject to the President's veto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the President's stand, the Government took an\r\n\r\nexplicit   decision  reaffirming  that  statutory   boards   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  companies should continue to prepare their  accounts\r\n\r\nand   budgets  on  an  accrual  basis.  This  has   since   been\r\n\r\nincorporated in the White Paper on Principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th January 1997, the Prime Minister wrote to the\r\n\r\nPresident  seeking  his  agreement to  accrual  accounting,  and\r\n\r\nexplaining the safeguards in place.  On 30th January  1997,  the\r\n\r\nPresident  replied stating that he had approved the CPF  Board's\r\n\r\nbudget and agreeing to the principle of accrual accounting.  But\r\n\r\nhe  still  said  that \"the concern that a profligate  government\r\n\r\ncould  hide  its  lavish spending under  the  guise  of  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure was not fully addressed.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account of events makes clear that no public officer\r\n\r\nfailed in his duty to report a possible drawdown on reserves  to\r\n\r\nthe   President  in  this  instance.  The  Government  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand why the President regarded this genuine difference of\r\n\r\nopinion as \"unpleasant\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Net Investment Income - Is it Current or Past Reserves?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President raised the question of whether Net Investment\r\n\r\nIncome  (NII)  should  be treated as current  reserves  or  past\r\n\r\nreserves.  He said that he had been told that according  to  the\r\n\r\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), NII constituted\r\n\r\ncurrent  reserves,  but  he was not  sure,  as  he  was  not  an\r\n\r\naccountant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper treatment of NII is not a question of opinion.\r\n\r\nIt  depends  on  the  constitutional  definition,  and  on  what\r\n\r\nconstitutes standard accounting practice.  On these matters, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not act arbitrarily on its own. It takes  legal\r\n\r\nadvice  from  the Attorney General's Chambers, and  professional\r\n\r\nadvice  from  the  Accountant-General and  the  Auditor-General.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the  President  and the CPA  can  obtain  legal  and\r\n\r\nprofessional advice, should they wish to. The Constitution  does\r\n\r\nnot  envisage either the Ministers or the President and the  CPA\r\n\r\nhaving to be their own lawyers or accountants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain what exactly NII is. NII is the interest\r\n\r\nand dividend income earned from investing Government's reserves,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnet  of expenses on investment and debt servicing.  NII does not\r\n\r\ninclude  any capital gains or losses that may be made  from  the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of  investments,  which are classified  as  Investment\r\n\r\nAdjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, the President has custodial powers\r\n\r\nover  \"reserves  which were not accumulated during  the  current\r\n\r\nterm of office of the Government\". The Attorney General's advice\r\n\r\nis  that  this  definition does not cover NII,  because  NII  is\r\n\r\naccumulated during the current term of office of the Government.\r\n\r\nThis  is  so  even when this NII is derived from investing  past\r\n\r\nreserves   that   are  themselves  locked  up.  Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  second key does not extend to NII.   The  President\r\n\r\nhas not challenged this legal opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treating NII as current income is also the standard\r\n\r\napproach under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also said that the Government had locked up\r\n\r\nNII  as  part of past reserves since 1992, but last year decided\r\n\r\nthat  \"the NII should now belong to the current account\".   This\r\n\r\nis not accurate.  The actual situation is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, NII is and has always been current\r\n\r\nincome.  The Government has not changed this treatment. However,\r\n\r\nit  has  carefully studied whether it should do so, and lock  up\r\n\r\npart  of NII as protected reserves, especially that part of  NII\r\n\r\nearned from investing past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complex issue. We have to project the likely\r\n\r\nstate  of  the economy and the budget position of the Government\r\n\r\nover  the  long term, to assess how much revenues the Government\r\n\r\nwill  have  and what it will need to spend.  This involves  many\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  We must also weigh carefully the proper  balance\r\n\r\nbetween restraining a profligate government on the one hand, and\r\n\r\nallowing a responsible government enough flexibility to  operate\r\n\r\non  the  other.  The matter is not pressing, and  if  we  decide\r\n\r\nhastily  and  make  a mistake, it will be difficult  to  reverse\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Government, not the President, who first raised\r\n\r\nthe issue of NII\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin January 1992, well before President Ong took office.  Against\r\n\r\na  backdrop of comfortable surpluses, the Government decided  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  more conservative stance of locking up  all  the  NII\r\n\r\nearned  from  past  reserves, and to amend the Constitution  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose,  not  immediately, but  after  about  a  year  of\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, subsequently the Government did not follow up to\r\n\r\namend  the  Constitution.  Revised projections  of  revenue  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure showed that earlier expectations of continuing large\r\n\r\nsurpluses  had  been  too optimistic  The  Government  therefore\r\n\r\nlooked for more flexible alternative ways to protect the NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter has been discussed at length between the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, the Cabinet and the President's office. The\r\n\r\nGovernment   seriously  studied  including  a   more   stringent\r\n\r\ndefinition of NII in the White Paper on Principles.  It  finally\r\n\r\ndecided against doing so, because the present uncertain economic\r\n\r\noutlook  made long-term budget projections difficult.  A  second\r\n\r\nreason was that doing so would cause the Principles to go beyond\r\n\r\nthe  Constitutional provisions.  The Principles cannot  override\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution; they can only give effect to them.  A  future\r\n\r\ngovernment  would not be bound by the definition of NII  in  the\r\n\r\nPrinciples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President and CPA have given their opinions, including\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion to lock away half of the NII from past reserves.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has  carefully  considered  their  views.   The\r\n\r\nsuggestion to lock away part of the NII has merit.  But we  have\r\n\r\nto  find the right basis for determining how much to lock  away,\r\n\r\nas  a fixed proportion like 50/50 may not be appropriate for all\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   The Government therefore has  not  yet  made  a\r\n\r\nfinal decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1999, the Government informed the President's\r\n\r\noffice that while it had earlier been inclined not to change the\r\n\r\nstatus quo treatment of NII, it had relooked at the calculations\r\n\r\nand concluded that there could be a case for protecting NII or a\r\n\r\nsignificant part of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  would  require a Constitutional amendment, rather  than  a\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the Principles which would have no  legal  force.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  needed time to study how best to  protect  NII.\r\n\r\nThis  study could lead to an amendment of the Constitution  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while NII continues to be current reserves, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  aware  of the problem which  the  President  has\r\n\r\nhighlighted, and has been working with him and the CPA to find a\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No Need to Draw on Past Reserves Because of NII?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also expressed his \"disappointment\" that the\r\n\r\nGovernment declined his offer to unlock past reserves to finance\r\n\r\nits  package  of  cost  cutting  measures,  and  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  able  to  do  so because  it  had  changed  its\r\n\r\ntreatment of NII to count as current reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the Constitutional and financial position. As\r\n\r\nI  have  just  explained, NII has always been  current  reserves\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution. In any case, the  Government  has  not\r\n\r\nneeded to fall back on NII at all, whether these constitute past\r\n\r\nor current reserves, to fund its special packages and the budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.  Through careful financial stewardship, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  accumulated sufficient budget surpluses within its  current\r\n\r\nterm  of  office for this purpose.  The budget surplus does  not\r\n\r\ninclude any NII, because NII has always been an item \"below  the\r\n\r\nline\" in the Government budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed this House during my FY99 Budget Debate round-up\r\n\r\nspeech on 9th March 1999, that between 25th January 1997,  which\r\n\r\nis  the  day the present Government took office, and 31st  March\r\n\r\n1998,  the Government had generated an operating budget  surplus\r\n\r\nof  $6.3  billion.   After  taking  into  account  the  expected\r\n\r\ndeficits  in  FY98  and FY99, we would still have  a  cumulative\r\n\r\nsurplus of $368 million as at 31st March 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has turned out, in FY98, instead of the budget\r\n\r\ndeficit of $466 million\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noriginally  estimated,  we achieved a  budget  surplus  of  $925\r\n\r\nmillion.  Hence,  by the end of FY99, we now expect  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncumulative budget surplus, since this Government took office, of\r\n\r\n$1.8 billion, excluding NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Government has had no reason to ask the\r\n\r\nPresident  to unlock past reserves, regardless of the  treatment\r\n\r\nof NII.  This is a positive outcome of our prudent policies, and\r\n\r\nnot a cause for \"disappointment\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained that while there were difficulties between\r\n\r\nthe President and Government, they arose from honest differences\r\n\r\nin  views.  The Government has extended full cooperation to  the\r\n\r\nPresident and the CPA, and made no attempt to obstruct  or  show\r\n\r\ndisrespect  to the President.  Despite the problems encountered,\r\n\r\nthe Government remains committed to protecting past reserves and\r\n\r\nmaking the institution of the President with custodial powers  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nMembers know, I had originally wanted to make this statement  on\r\n\r\n3rd  August,  but decided to postpone it because the President's\r\n\r\nwife  had  just passed away.  Ideally, this statement should  be\r\n\r\nmade  later  because  President Ong  Teng  Cheong  is  still  in\r\n\r\nbereavement.   But  the  President's term  will  expire  on  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember and it would not be proper to make the statement after\r\n\r\nhe has left office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu has addressed the specific items raised by\r\n\r\nthe  President at his press conference on 16th July.

It\r\n\r\ncould  not just be the initial difficulties experienced  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  After all, the problems happened three or four years\r\n\r\nago.  The public will continue to speculate that there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust  be  more  problems  with  the  relationship  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the President which it does not know about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public reactions to President's statements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media have already reported some of these comments and\r\n\r\nconjectures.  For example, Mr Viswa Sadasivan, Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nFeedback Unit's Political Matters Group, told the Straits Times:\r\n\r\n\"If  a  President who is a former Deputy Prime Minister  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  push around in that way, I shudder to think  what  a\r\n\r\nnewcomer to the scene would face.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Kevin Tan of NUS told the Straits Times [30th July]:\r\n\r\n\"The  trouble  is: either the President should be  a  figurehead\r\n\r\nPresident,  or  an executive President.  To do a little  bit  of\r\n\r\nboth is terribly confusing.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay told Asiaweek [30th July]: \"There are two\r\n\r\nimplications here - bad and good - that shock people.   The  bad\r\n\r\none  is  that even though Ong was an insider, it was still  hard\r\n\r\n[for him] to get straight answers.  The good one is that Ong did\r\n\r\nnot see himself as a rubber stamp\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also published an article in the Straits Times\r\n\r\n[6th  August] together with Mr Zulkifli Baharuddin, stating that\r\n\r\n\"the elected presidency remains an institution whose powers  are\r\n\r\nnot yet fully worked out and accepted by all.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Wall Street Journal [9th August] reported that\r\n\r\nthe  President  had talked of a \"long list of problems\"  at  his\r\n\r\npress  conference,  and linked this to the President's  decision\r\n\r\nnot to stand, stating: \"Many political analysts believe that  Mr\r\n\r\nOng wanted a second term but was discouraged by senior political\r\n\r\nfigures.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERC, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy based in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, has marked down its rating of Singapore, in a recent\r\n\r\nreport   [Asian  Intelligence,  28th  July]  comparing  national\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  different Asian countries.  PERC  stated  that\r\n\r\nwhile  Singapore's  institutions were still professionally  run,\r\n\r\nthere were controversies suggesting that they may face\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome   challenges   in  future.   PERC  cited  the   President's\r\n\r\nrevelations  of  \"behind-the-scenes struggles he  had  with  the\r\n\r\ngovernment   and   bureaucracy  during  his  term   of   office.\r\n\r\nApparently,  the former deputy prime minister took  his  job  of\r\n\r\nprotecting  the  nation's reserves . rather more seriously  than\r\n\r\nmany had expected when he was chosen for the post back in 1993.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need for Government to respond</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not regard it as unusual for the President to\r\n\r\npublicly acknowledge differences between him and the Government.\r\n\r\nIt  shows the independence of the Presidency in the two areas in\r\n\r\nwhich  he  is vested with custodial powers, and this  will  help\r\n\r\nfuture  Presidents.  Unfortunately, President Ong's  criticisms,\r\n\r\nboth direct and implied, went beyond these differences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to guard its honour and integrity\r\n\r\njealously.  If there are doubts over its probity, the Government\r\n\r\ncannot  command  respect and would lose its moral  authority  to\r\n\r\ngovern.   So  the  Government has consistently  defended  itself\r\n\r\nwhenever its reputation has been unjustly called into question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am duty bound to respond to the points raised publicly by\r\n\r\nthe President at his press conference.  I am pained and saddened\r\n\r\nto  have  to  do  this now, at such a difficult moment  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident   personally.   Indeed  at  the  time  of  the   press\r\n\r\nconference,  his  wife was already gravely ill.   But  it  is  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility I have to discharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implications of President's Statements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's statements have left the following thoughts\r\n\r\nin the public mind:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Government had been unhelpful and uncooperative\r\n\r\nwith the President in the discharge of his duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Public officers, including possibly some Ministers,\r\n\r\nregarded the President's checks as a nuisance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government might have withheld information from the\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government had disregarded the independent views of\r\n\r\nthe President; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The President's difficulties with the Government may\r\n\r\nhave  caused him not to seek another term, since his health  was\r\n\r\n\"fine\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Teething problems</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the President's comments puzzled me. I thought\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the President had developed a  good  working\r\n\r\nrelationship.  Mr Ong Teng Cheong had done a good job in his six\r\n\r\nyears  as  President.  We had worked together to  make  the  new\r\n\r\ninstitution of the President with custodial powers  succeed.   I\r\n\r\ndid not expect him to cast doubts on the Government, that it was\r\n\r\nunwilling  or  reluctant  to  give  him  full  access   to   all\r\n\r\ninformation   and   documents   for   him   to   discharge   his\r\n\r\nconstitutional duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were indeed difficulties in working the new system of\r\n\r\nPresidential safeguards in the initial two or three years.  This\r\n\r\nwas  due  to  the  complexities of  the  issues  involved.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  had set up a new system.  The President was  new  to\r\n\r\nthe job;  indeed the job itself was new.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These initial difficulties were not unexpected. In our\r\n\r\nspeeches  at  the swearing in ceremony of the President  on  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember  1993,  both  the President  and  I  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nchallenges and likely problems ahead.  I said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My Government has not the slightest intention of using the\r\n\r\nfinancial   reserves   .   to  finance  wasteful,   unproductive\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   We will not squander the financial reserves  which\r\n\r\nwe  have  so  painstakingly accumulated.  . I do not  intend  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  a situation which will give you cause to  exercise\r\n\r\nyour  veto powers.  I have no doubt, however, Mr President, that\r\n\r\nif you are ever in disagreement with what my Government proposes\r\n\r\nto  do in the areas spelt out in the Constitution, you will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to exercise your constitutional authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr President, you and my Government will have to work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  give effect to the letter and spirit of  this  new\r\n\r\nsystem  of checks and balances.  I pledge you my fullest support\r\n\r\nand cooperation and that of my Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe President replied in his speech:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The legislation creating the institution of the Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is  still new.  While its philosophy and  intent  are\r\n\r\nclear, the detailed Constitutional provisions have not yet  been\r\n\r\nfully tested out.  Nor is there established precedent on how the\r\n\r\nElected  President  actually exercises  his  powers.   Both  the\r\n\r\nPresident  and  the  Government will  have  to  feel  their  way\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to developing a sound working relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the  Prime Minister and his Government.   As we accumulate\r\n\r\nexperience  with the new system, we can refine the arrangements,\r\n\r\nand  define  through  practice and  precedent  how  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident will function.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed this is what the Government, and I believe President\r\n\r\nOng,  have sought to achieve over the past six years.   Most  of\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties that arose were resolved after discussion  and\r\n\r\nexplanation.  I regarded them all as teething problems.   As  we\r\n\r\nsolved  them, we refined and elaborated on the arrangements  and\r\n\r\nworkings  of the Presidential safeguard.  Many of the  items  in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper on principles for determining and safeguarding\r\n\r\nreserves first arose from careful deliberations by both  parties\r\n\r\nto deal with such practical problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our experience working the new system, we\r\n\r\namended  the Constitution several times to refine the provisions\r\n\r\n- in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998.  The President supported all the\r\n\r\nchanges,  except for one - the amendment to Article  22H.   This\r\n\r\nconcerned  the  President's power to veto  proposed  legislation\r\n\r\nwhich circumvented or curtailed his discretionary powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President took the view that he could veto the proposed\r\n\r\namendment  to Article 22H.  However, in the interest of  testing\r\n\r\nout  the system, he requested that the matter be referred to the\r\n\r\ncourts  for  a  ruling, and indicated that  he  would  abide  by\r\n\r\nwhatever ruling that was made.  The Constitution was amended  to\r\n\r\nset up a constitutional tribunal.  The matter was referred to  a\r\n\r\ntribunal  of three judges, which ruled that the President  could\r\n\r\nnot veto the proposed amendment to Article 22H.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding these successive refinements to the scheme,\r\n\r\nwe still cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsider  the system of a custodial President fully  tested  out\r\n\r\nand  in  its final form.  It is still running in, and  may  well\r\n\r\nneed  further fine-tuning to make it workable.  That is why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not  yet  entrenched  the  provisions  in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  to  give  the  President  a  veto  over  proposed\r\n\r\namendments to his discretionary powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Differences healthy - Full cooperation rendered</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not expect the President to agree with\r\n\r\nit  on  every  issue where he exercises custodial powers.   That\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time the two should hold different  opinions  on\r\n\r\nthese  issues is healthy, and to be expected.  The President  is\r\n\r\nassisted  in  his  duties by a Council of Presidential  Advisers\r\n\r\n(CPA)  of  six  members.  These are men of  substance  who  have\r\n\r\ndistinguished  themselves  by  their  balanced  judgment.    The\r\n\r\nPresident  and  Prime Minister each appoint  two  members.   The\r\n\r\nChief  Justice and the Chairman of the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nappoint  one each.  The President then appoints the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Council from among the six members.  Under the Constitution,\r\n\r\nthe  President  has  to consult the Council  before  making  his\r\n\r\ndecisions concerning reserves and key appointments.  Differences\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government  and the President  are  therefore  not\r\n\r\npersonal,  but reflect the independent judgment of the President\r\n\r\nand the Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministers and I treated all queries and requests of the\r\n\r\nPresident  and CPA seriously.  Whether the Government agreed  or\r\n\r\ndisagreed with the President, his queries and requests had to be\r\n\r\nanswered.   And  they  were  answered.   At  no  time  did   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  withhold  information  or  co-operation   from   the\r\n\r\nPresident or show him any disrespect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what Mr Simon Tay and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin\r\n\r\nwrote  in the Straits Times of 6th August, the Government  fully\r\n\r\naccepts  the  custodial  powers of the President.   It  was  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which created this new institution  to  oversee  two\r\n\r\nareas: reserves and key appointments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Government worked out its powers and enacted the provisions\r\n\r\nin  the  Constitution.   So  it wants  the  new  institution  to\r\n\r\nsucceed.  It has absolutely no reason to obstruct the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Information Withheld?  Procedures Exist</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong urged public officers to change their mindset\r\n\r\nand  see  it as their constitutional duty to help the  President\r\n\r\nprotect past reserves.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is not possible for the President's office with a very\r\n\r\nsmall  staff  to know what's going on.  The civil servants  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening in the ministries and departments.  We  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered in the past that, if they don't tell us, most of  the\r\n\r\ntime we would not know.  And by the time we know, it may be  too\r\n\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implied criticism of the Government is not justified.\r\n\r\nI agree that if a civil servant knows that his political masters\r\n\r\nare drawing down reserves behind the President's back, he should\r\n\r\ninform the President.  But I do not think that every transaction\r\n\r\nof the Government, or every land sale, should be reported to the\r\n\r\nPresident.  This would go beyond what is required of  all  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  and  also  beyond the scope  of  the  duties  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident as laid out in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are established procedures for drawing up Government\r\n\r\nbudgets, approving expenditures, and acquiring and disposing  of\r\n\r\nassets.   The accounting officer of a ministry is the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary,   not  the  Minister.   The  accounting  officer   is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the ministry's budget and its expenditure,  as\r\n\r\nwell as the proper accounting and management of public money and\r\n\r\nassets.   The  Government budget is prepared by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.   When it is presented to Parliament, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  is  required by the Constitution to certify whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  there  has  been  a  drawdown on past  reserves.   That  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in Article 147.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Article 148G of the Constitution imposes on\r\n\r\nthe  Auditor-General and the Accountant-General a duty to inform\r\n\r\nthe  President  of  any  proposed  transaction  which  to  their\r\n\r\nknowledge  is likely to draw on past reserves.  Members  of  key\r\n\r\nstatutory boards, the boards of key\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  companies, and their CEOs have a  similar  duty,  as\r\n\r\nrequired under Articles 22B and 22D.  All these appointments are\r\n\r\nsubject to the President's veto.  It is up to these officials to\r\n\r\ndevise  their  own  systems,  staff  support  and  channels   of\r\n\r\ninformation  in  order to discharge their constitutional  duties\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore there is adequate mechanism for keeping the\r\n\r\nPresident  informed  of  what  is happening  in  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nDepartments   in  time,  rather  than  after  the   fact.    The\r\n\r\nPresidential safeguard is designed to work through officials  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government whom he has vetted and can rely  upon,  and  not\r\n\r\nthrough a large parallel staff in the office of the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Using NII In Regional Crisis?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President said that his greatest disappointment was his\r\n\r\ninability to use the second key during the economic crisis.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  this  was  because the Government  had  decided  that  Net\r\n\r\nInvestment Income (NII) should go into current reserves  instead\r\n\r\nof  past reserves.  The implication was that the Government  had\r\n\r\nchanged  the  rules  in  order  to  circumvent  the  second  key\r\n\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President did tell me that he would agree to draw down\r\n\r\nthe  reserves, should the Government need to use them  to  fight\r\n\r\nthe  regional  crisis  and  prevent Singapore  from  going  into\r\n\r\nrecession.   I  thanked him, but told him  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould try its best not to draw on past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Richard Hu has explained, the Government had\r\n\r\naccumulated   substantial  budget  surpluses  since   the   1997\r\n\r\nelections,  before  the  crisis struck.   The  budget  surpluses\r\n\r\nexclude net investment income, which are \"below the line\"  items\r\n\r\nin  the Government accounts.  But the accumulated surpluses were\r\n\r\nenough to pay for the budget deficits we expected last year  (FY\r\n\r\n98)  and  this  year  (FY 99), beyond the current  term  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident.   Thus we have not needed to use the  net  investment\r\n\r\nincome  at  all.  Whether the net investment income  was  earned\r\n\r\nfrom  current  reserves or past reserves made no  difference  to\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President was thus mistaken in thinking that it was\r\n\r\nbecause the Government had redefined net investment income to be\r\n\r\ncurrent income that it did not need him to use the second key.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may think that had the President used the\r\n\r\nsecond  key,  we would not have needed to cut CPF contributions.\r\n\r\nLet  me  explain  that drawing on past reserves would  not  have\r\n\r\nsolved our economic challenges.  It would only generate a  false\r\n\r\nsense  of well-being, when our real problems are to ensure  that\r\n\r\ncompanies survive and Singaporeans have jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business costs had become too high. We had to bring\r\n\r\nthem down to restore our competitiveness.  We reduced Government\r\n\r\ntaxes  and  charges.   But we also had  to  cut  wages  and  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions,  which form a major part of business  costs.   We\r\n\r\ncould not avoid tightening our belts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proof of a policy is in its outcome. Our rational\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the economic crisis is working.   Our  economy  is\r\n\r\nrecovering  strongly,  and  we  have  earned  the  respect   and\r\n\r\nconfidence of investors and economic analysts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President meant well in offering to unlock past\r\n\r\nreserves  for the Government to use to counter the crisis.   But\r\n\r\nit  is for the Government to decide whether reserves need to  be\r\n\r\nused under any given circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A Custodial, Not An Executive President</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the comments and reactions after the President's\r\n\r\npress  conference have shown misunderstanding or confusion  over\r\n\r\nthe  President's role under the Constitution.  For  example,  Dr\r\n\r\nKevin  Tan,  in Straits Times of 30th July, maintained  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  either  have  a  figurehead President  or  an  executive\r\n\r\nPresident,  and that to do a bit of both is terribly  confusing.\r\n\r\nAllow  me with the authority of the Attorney General to  correct\r\n\r\nthis ill-informed view.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no confusion. The true Constitutional\r\n\r\nposition is very clear.  The President exercises custodial,  not\r\n\r\nexecutive  powers.   Only  the  Government  exercises  executive\r\n\r\npowers.   Under  the Constitution, the Cabinet  shall  have  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  direction and control of the Government.  In  contrast,\r\n\r\nthe  President's  custodial  powers are  reactive  and  blocking\r\n\r\npowers.  The President does not have any executive power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this clear when I moved the Constitutional\r\n\r\namendments  in this House on 4th October 1990 to provide  for  a\r\n\r\nPresident with custodial powers.  I then said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let me stress here, however, that the Bill does not\r\n\r\ntransfer  the power of government to the Elected President,  nor\r\n\r\nvest  in  him  absolute veto power.  Firstly,  even  though  the\r\n\r\nPresident  is  elected by the people, he  is  not  the  Head  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   He  is the Head of State.  He  is  not  the  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive  of  the  country.   The  Prime  Minister   is.    The\r\n\r\ninitiative and responsibility of governing Singapore stays  with\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\"     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the Hansard of 4th October 1990 [Cols 464, 465].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Constitution retained the principle, which\r\n\r\nexisted  before  we  created the custodial President,  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  always  acts on the advice of the Government,  except\r\n\r\nwhere  the Constitution explicitly provides otherwise.   Article\r\n\r\n21 of the Constitution states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"21.-(1) Except as provided by this Constitution, the\r\n\r\nPresident  shall,  in the exercise of his functions  under  this\r\n\r\nConstitution  or  any other written law, act in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  advice  of  the Cabinet or of a Minister acting  under  the\r\n\r\ngeneral authority of the Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's new custodial powers are to veto certain\r\n\r\nactions  proposed  by the Government:  to block  the  Government\r\n\r\nfrom  spending  past  reserves or to stop  the  Government  from\r\n\r\nmaking  appointments to key positions.  If the majority  of  the\r\n\r\nsix  members of the Council of Presidential Advisers agree  with\r\n\r\nthe President, his veto is final.  Otherwise, the Government can\r\n\r\noverturn  the  President's  veto  with  a  two-thirds  vote   in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No article of the Constitution gives the President any\r\n\r\npower  to initiate any action, or to appoint, promote, transfer,\r\n\r\nremove\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor dismiss any officer, or to spend money, or recommend that the\r\n\r\nreserves  be spent.  That right is with the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission.  It is not the President's  task  to\r\n\r\nset policy or run the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate. The Prime Minister is the Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive  of  the  Government.  All  Ministries  and  Statutory\r\n\r\nBoards  answer to him.  The civil service reports to  him.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  not the President, chairs the Defence  Council\r\n\r\nand  has  the overall responsibility for the SAF and the defence\r\n\r\nand security of the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle this distinction between custodial and\r\n\r\nexecutive  powers is sharp, but in practice it may be  less  so.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  Prime  Minister may  consult  the  President\r\n\r\ninformally  before putting up a name for a key  appointment,  or\r\n\r\nthe  President  may  inform the Prime  Minister  that  unless  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board's budget is revised, he will have to rule  that\r\n\r\nit draws upon past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such two-way informal communication is essential to the\r\n\r\nsmooth working of a custodial President system.  But it must not\r\n\r\nblur or obscure the Constitutional position:  that the executive\r\n\r\npower remains with the elected Government.  Singapore has always\r\n\r\nhad  a  Parliamentary system of government, not  a  presidential\r\n\r\none.  The Constitution provides for a directly elected President\r\n\r\nwith  custodial, not executive, power.  Singapore does not  have\r\n\r\nan executive President, because Parliament did not create one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Did The Government Oppose President Ong's Re-Election?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious doubt which the Government must clear up\r\n\r\nis  whether President Ong's problems with the Government are the\r\n\r\nreason  he  is  not  seeking re-election.  Indeed,  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  or some Ministers, opposed his re-election  because\r\n\r\nof these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President opened his press conference saying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Because precisely you asked about my health, we've waited\r\n\r\nuntil  my latest health examinations to tell you about my latest\r\n\r\nhealth condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current health condition is good; I'm physically fine.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  that,  I decided not to  stand  again  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming  Presidential Election.  I find no compelling reasons  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, the next day, reported it this way:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Ong made it a point to begin the press conference by\r\n\r\nstating  that  his health was \"fine\" and, by inference,  not  an\r\n\r\nimpediment to another six-year tenure if he had so desired.  His\r\n\r\ndoctors had declared his cancer to be in complete remission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state clearly that the Government did not object to\r\n\r\nthe   President   standing  for  re-election  because   of   any\r\n\r\ndifficulties in its working relationship with the President.  It\r\n\r\nhad no reason to do so.  The Cabinet found no fault with the way\r\n\r\nthe President had performed his duties, and the way he exercised\r\n\r\nhis  custodial powers.  He discharged his duties faithfully  and\r\n\r\nindependently.   It  did  not see the  differences  between  the\r\n\r\nPresident  and the Government that arose from time  to  time  as\r\n\r\nirreconcilable or unhealthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Cabinet would have been happier if Mr Ong Teng\r\n\r\nCheong  had  been  able  to  continue  for  another  full  term.\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  have had the benefit of a  well-respected  and\r\n\r\nexperienced President, who had been involved over the  last  six\r\n\r\nyears in establishing the processes by which the President would\r\n\r\nexercise his newly created powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government did have one reason to be concerned\r\n\r\nshould President Ong seek re-election, namely, his health.   The\r\n\r\nhealth  of  the  person holding the office of President  is  not\r\n\r\nmerely  a  personal matter.  It is a matter of state as  it  can\r\n\r\naffect  the  proper  functioning of a  key  institution  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cabinet knew that President Ong had lymphoma and the\r\n\r\ndisease was progressing.  It was concerned that his health might\r\n\r\nnot permit him to discharge the duties of President normally and\r\n\r\nfully  for  another  6-year term.  The  public  also  knew  that\r\n\r\nPresident  Ong  had lymphoma.  If he stood for re-election,  the\r\n\r\nstate of his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealth  would  be  a  natural  and  proper  question  that   the\r\n\r\nelectorate would ask.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President discussed his intention to seek re-election\r\n\r\nwith  me  on  several occasions.  He first told me that  he  was\r\n\r\nthinking of standing for re-election in February this year.  The\r\n\r\nPresident made it clear that he was not asking for my permission\r\n\r\nor  the Government's permission to do so.  He was just informing\r\n\r\nme as a matter of courtesy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcomed the President's intention to stand for re-election. But I also advised the President that he should\r\n\r\nobtain medical reports on his condition from his doctors, to  be\r\n\r\npublished if he decided to stand for re-election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President went to the United States in March, to see Dr\r\n\r\nSaul  Rosenberg  of  Stanford University  Medical  Centre.    In\r\n\r\nApril,  the Cabinet met to discuss what position to take on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's re-election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I circulated two medical reports on the President to\r\n\r\nCabinet - one by Dr Rosenberg, and another by Dr John Wong,  who\r\n\r\nis  the  President's principal physician.  It is normal practice\r\n\r\nfor  the Prime Minister to receive such reports.  I have  to  be\r\n\r\ninformed  whenever the President or a Minister  is  hospitalised\r\n\r\nfor a serious ailment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked Dr John Wong to be present at the April Cabinet\r\n\r\nmeeting, to explain the medical terms and the prognosis for  the\r\n\r\nPresident, in simple laymen's terms.  Minutes were recorded, and\r\n\r\nI gave a copy to the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of the medical reports and Dr John Wong's\r\n\r\nexplanations,  the  Cabinet concluded that there  was  a  strong\r\n\r\nlikelihood   that  the  President's  health  would  affect   the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  his official duties in the next few  years.   For\r\n\r\nthis reason alone, the Cabinet unanimously decided it could  not\r\n\r\nsupport  the re-election of President Ong, should he  decide  to\r\n\r\nstand again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conveyed the Cabinet's view to the President. I knew his\r\n\r\ninterpretation of his medical prognosis was more optimistic than\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet's.  The President said that he would decide whether\r\n\r\nor  not  to stand in June.  It was for him to decide,  he  said.\r\n\r\nThe  Cabinet  could only offer its view.  I agreed with  him  on\r\n\r\nthis  point.  It was for the President to decide what he  wanted\r\n\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th July, the President told me that he had decided not\r\n\r\nto  seek re-election, and that he would announce his decision at\r\n\r\na press conference on 16th July, which he did.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President and I enjoy a good working and personal\r\n\r\nrelationship.  We have been friends and colleagues in Government\r\n\r\nsince  1977,  ie,  over  20 years.  Our discussion  on  his  re-election was open and cordial.  It was his decision to make, but\r\n\r\nI felt that it was only right that he knew the Cabinet's view.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>President Ong Teng Cheong's Contributions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to place on record before this House President\r\n\r\nOng Teng Cheong's significant contributions as Singapore's first\r\n\r\nelected President.  He took his job seriously.  He has helped us\r\n\r\nto test the powers and workings of the new institution, and iron\r\n\r\nout  ambiguities  in the powers of the President  vis-a-vis  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   He set the pace to get the Government to  complete\r\n\r\nand  publish  the White Paper on \"The Principles for Determining\r\n\r\nand  Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and\r\n\r\nthe Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all, he has demonstrated that the two-key\r\n\r\nsystem  to safeguard Singapore's reserves and key public  sector\r\n\r\nappointments can be made to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Ong stood for election to be President, some\r\n\r\ndoubted whether a former senior Cabinet Minister and PAP  leader\r\n\r\ncould  exercise  independent judgment or make decisions  against\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment   in  his  new  role.   But  friendships   and   past\r\n\r\nassociations  have not affected President Ong's independence  of\r\n\r\njudgment  in  the  two  areas where  he  has  custodial  powers.\r\n\r\nPresident Ong has shown what the Government expected all  along:\r\n\r\nthat   when   an  honourable  man  assumes  this  constitutional\r\n\r\nposition,  he  has  to exercise the powers of  that  institution\r\n\r\nwithout fear or favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the Council of Presidential Advisers,\r\n\r\nPresident Ong has established an effective institution for those\r\n\r\npowers  vested in the Presidency.  That is a major  contribution\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be holding a farewell reception for\r\n\r\nPresident Ong on 30th August.  At that function, I shall  pay  a\r\n\r\nformal  tribute  to  him  for  his significant  achievements  as\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister a question or\r\n\r\ntwo?   I understood him to say that the Cabinet would have  been\r\n\r\nhappier  if the President had decided to seek re-election.   But\r\n\r\nthe Cabinet was concerned whether he was medically capable.  But\r\n\r\nthe  President  had said in his statement that his  doctors  had\r\n\r\ngiven  him  a  clean  bill,  that his  cancer  was  in  complete\r\n\r\nremission  and the President clearly indicated that  his  health\r\n\r\nwould not stand in the way of his becoming President.  May I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister to explain to this House on what  basis  or\r\n\r\ninformation  did  the  Cabinet conclude that  he  would  not  be\r\n\r\ncapable of discharging his duties?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, the President had\r\n\r\ntold  the  public at his press conference regarding his  present\r\n\r\nhealth situation.  But the Cabinet had two medical reports,  one\r\n\r\nfrom  the  President's  doctor in the  United  States,  Dr  Saul\r\n\r\nRosenberg,  and the other from his physician in  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nstudied the reports and it was quite clear from the reports that\r\n\r\nif  you should focus or project the President's health condition\r\n\r\ninto  the  future,  there was a very strong likelihood  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to perform his duties normally.  In a  sense,\r\n\r\nit is like looking at a glass of water, whether it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none-third full or two-thirds empty.  The Cabinet had to take the\r\n\r\nadvice  of the doctor and take a very careful view of  what  the\r\n\r\nPresident's future condition would be like.  And it  is  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  our  understanding of the President's future  medical\r\n\r\ncondition,  as  given in the medical reports, that  the  Cabinet\r\n\r\ndecided  that  it  could  not support  the  re-election  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  But it is a matter for the President to decide.   He\r\n\r\ncould  still have decided to stand for re-election and it  would\r\n\r\nbe his right if he wanted to stand for re-election.  But we have\r\n\r\ngiven  our  views  on the basis of what we think  would  be  his\r\n\r\nfuture  medical condition, as advised by the doctors,  and  that\r\n\r\nCabinet could not support his re-election.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has  been\r\n\r\ninconsistent  when  they supported President Ong  Teng  Cheong's\r\n\r\nattempt at the Presidential office six years ago knowing that he\r\n\r\nalready had a similar medical condition and now, given that  the\r\n\r\ncondition  has not changed, it is not supporting his bid  for  a\r\n\r\nsecond term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not been\r\n\r\ninconsistent.  We knew of the President's condition in 1992 when\r\n\r\nhe  was  first struck with low-grade lymphoma.  And again,  from\r\n\r\nmedical  advice,  we  knew the likely progression  of  low-grade\r\n\r\nlymphoma  that,  in the first six years of this  disease,  there\r\n\r\nwould  have  been no great problem for the President to  perform\r\n\r\nthe  functions.  But the next six years would not be  quite  the\r\n\r\nsame.  If you ask his doctors, they would tell you that, in  the\r\n\r\nnature  of things, the next six years would not be the  same  as\r\n\r\nthe  last  six  years.  And it is on the basis of the  next  six\r\n\r\nyears  that  we are concerned with.  The doctors were  right  in\r\n\r\ntheir assessment, as shown in the last six years.  The President\r\n\r\nhad performed his duties quite normally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  and  the  Prime Minister for their  clarifications.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister for Finance - unfortunately I  do\r\n\r\nnot have the Budget book here to refer to - what is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napproximate size of the Net Investment Income and is it found in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  book.  More importantly, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  how  come the President,  who  is  supposed  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the reserves, was mistaken regarding the definition of\r\n\r\nNet  Investment  Income.  And how come he did not  realise  that\r\n\r\nthere was no need to draw down reserves as a result of the cost-cutting  measures because there was actually, as Dr  Richard  Hu\r\n\r\npointed  out, a budget surplus?  It would seem to me  that  that\r\n\r\nkind  of information would be readily available to the President\r\n\r\nwhose  official  and constitutional function is to  protect  the\r\n\r\nreserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rather puzzled by this state of affairs and more\r\n\r\nimportantly, the Prime Minister has mentioned that  he  and  the\r\n\r\nPresident have been friends and colleagues for a very long time,\r\n\r\nbut  it seems to me that there has actually been a breakdown  of\r\n\r\ntrust  between  the Government and the President where  this  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  so that matters of definition, matters of information\r\n\r\nas  it  were,  do  not  seem to be readily conveyed  across  the\r\n\r\nvarious  offices.  Could the Prime Minister please  explain?   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  more  than  just  a question  of  differences  of\r\n\r\ndefinition or opinion.  I am rather puzzled that there is a very\r\n\r\nsignificant  difference,  not so  much  of  opinion,  but  of  a\r\n\r\nbreakdown of trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am equally puzzled\r\n\r\nand  I  am  still  puzzled  as  to why  the  President  did  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  fully  the meaning of the NII  as  explained  by  Dr\r\n\r\nRichard Hu.  The President did not deal with me directly on most\r\n\r\nof  the  issues.   He  dealt with the civil  servants,  normally\r\n\r\nthrough his Principal Private Secretary.  I would normally  come\r\n\r\ninto  the  picture when they could not resolve  certain  issues.\r\n\r\nAnd of course when it came to my attention, I would then look at\r\n\r\nthe  matter  and involve other Ministers who were  concerned  to\r\n\r\nresolve  the issue.  I do not think there was this breakdown  in\r\n\r\ntrust.   It  may be differences in the approach to the problems.\r\n\r\nAnd  as far as the Government was concerned, there was never any\r\n\r\nreluctance in our case to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncooperate.   Where  we disagreed we explained our  disagreement.\r\n\r\nWe finally sorted out whatever issues that we had.  I do not get\r\n\r\na  sense  that there was this breakdown in trust.

And  as  shown,  he  has  an\r\n\r\nindependent viewpoint on many issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the medical condition of the President, I did not want\r\n\r\nto  be too explicit since the President is not standing for  re-election.   I think it would be unfair to him.  But  being  less\r\n\r\nexplicit,  Members here may not understand what exactly  is  the\r\n\r\nposition  and  why there is this difference.  I would  say  that\r\n\r\nthere was a difference in interpretation of the medical reports.\r\n\r\nWe have to be advised by the doctors and we had to ask questions\r\n\r\nthat  we were not sure as to what certain words meant.  We  were\r\n\r\nalso  advised  by his doctor that for the next six years,  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  strong likelihood of certain events taking  place.\r\n\r\nThe President, from his point of view, can quite rightly look at\r\n\r\nthe  other  aspect that these are all statistics. And  from  his\r\n\r\npoint of view, he is the best judge of his own health.  He  said\r\n\r\nhe  felt  \"fine\" and I have no reason to doubt him that he  felt\r\n\r\n\"fine\".   It  is  a  question of how we  interpret  the  medical\r\n\r\nreports.  But in our case, we were guided by professional advice\r\n\r\nand not just how we felt over the medical reports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Prime Minister whether this issue of staff\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupport  for the President would be helpful because in the  past\r\n\r\nwhen  there was no elected President and there was no  need   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  reserves, the President only had  one  Principal\r\n\r\nPrivate Secretary.  I am not saying that we should have  a  full\r\n\r\npresidential staff, but perhaps some more senior support for him\r\n\r\nwould  be  helpful  in  his interaction  with  the  other  civil\r\n\r\nservants who are on a senior level.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, the\r\n\r\nPresident had just a personal secretary.  There was no Principal\r\n\r\nPrivate  Secretary.  The  difference  is  that  the  PPS  is  an\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officer.  Your private secretary looks after your\r\n\r\noffice  management and so on.  We felt that it is not  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the President's office to have a large staff because if you\r\n\r\nbegin  to man the President's office in order to check the civil\r\n\r\nservants, we must have a super Auditor-General to check  on  the\r\n\r\nAccountant General.  You need to have your own lawyer  to  check\r\n\r\non  the  AG's office and you begin to build a White House staff,\r\n\r\nas  you call it, which would then have its centre of power,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  totally  unnecessary because the  key  appointments  are\r\n\r\nsubject  to the veto powers of the President.  Under the  system\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  devised, the President should work  through  the\r\n\r\npeople in Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too only have a Principal Private Secretary. I have a\r\n\r\nPress  Secretary but I felt that he would be underworked, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  given  my  Press Secretary three jobs.   He  is  my  Press\r\n\r\nSecretary.  He is also holding a position as Deputy Secretary in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Information and the Arts so that  he  can  know\r\n\r\nwhat is going on and keep me informed of news.  And I still find\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  underworked.  So I thought he should also  be  the\r\n\r\nChief  Executive  Director  of the  People's  Association.   And\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  he  also\r\n\r\nattends  briefings regularly in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nThis  is  how we use staff.  We do not just have people who  sit\r\n\r\naround  looking for little faults here and there.

He is not seeking re-election.  It is irrelevant now to\r\n\r\npublish the medical details of the President's health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other question whether we are setting a new\r\n\r\nprecedent,  I  think  health  is  important  but  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  requirement.  We have not put this  in.   It  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult for us to devise a way where we have  to  define\r\n\r\nhealth  before  a person can stand for election.   But  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  any potential candidate who wants  to  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection as President should be asked the question by the press.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  your  health  condition? Do  you  have  an  underlying\r\n\r\ncondition  which  you know, over time, will  lead  to  problems?\r\n\r\nNobody  can forecast how a heart will tick over time, or whether\r\n\r\nor  not  you may get cancer.  Nobody can forecast. But  at  that\r\n\r\npoint  of  time, do you have an underlying condition  which  you\r\n\r\nknow  must progressively lead to bigger and bigger problems  for\r\n\r\nyou.  I think it is a fair question for the press to ask.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  at  this  stage it is wise  for  us  to  change  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  or the Presidential Elections Act  to  make  it  a\r\n\r\nrequirement for health to be declared publicly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

I said,  \"What  is  your  health\r\n\r\ncondition?\"   He  told  me  that he is  able  to  discharge  his\r\n\r\nresponsibility.

The Prime Minister is puzzled\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhy  the  President, who was the Deputy Prime Minister, did  not\r\n\r\nunderstand clearly that the Government does not need to draw  on\r\n\r\npast reserves, and thereby made such statements.  And he is also\r\n\r\npuzzled  as to why the President decided to cast doubts  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Based on the sequence of events the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  given,  in  terms of whether to support the re-election,  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Prime Minster is implying that the reason why\r\n\r\nthe  President  has cast doubts and raised so  many  issues  and\r\n\r\ndecided  not  to stand for re-election was because  the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nfailed to support his re-election,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Prime Minister's opinion on whether\r\n\r\nor  not the routine function of the elected President should  be\r\n\r\nmade more transparent, so that Singaporeans would know what  the\r\n\r\nelected President is doing, rather than at the end of the  term,\r\n\r\nthe elected President comes out with something which has already\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is that although the Prime Minister says\r\n\r\nthat  the  elected  President can work  through  the  Government\r\n\r\nsystem, the civil servants and all that, I wonder how would  the\r\n\r\nelected  President know if the Government or a  statutory  board\r\n\r\ndecides that it has to sell land or dispose of assets within the\r\n\r\nbudgeting period.  Would the Prime Minister clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on his first question,\r\n\r\nit  is one that can only  be answered by the President.  I would\r\n\r\nnot  know why he did not understand the NII and I would not know\r\n\r\nwhy exactly he chose to criticise the Government.  But I thought\r\n\r\nit  is necessary for the Government to state its position  on  a\r\n\r\nvery  basic area where we had disagreement, and that is  whether\r\n\r\nwe  supported his re-election or not.  The rest is for people to\r\n\r\ndraw their own conclusions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of leaving matters to the last and at the\r\n\r\nend  of the term of the President before we discuss them openly,\r\n\r\nI  think  when  there are disagreements, if it  justifies  being\r\n\r\naired  publicly, they will be aired publicly.  It is up  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndecide.  In the case of Article 22H, it was discussed openly  in\r\n\r\nParliament.

There was a suggestion by the Prime  Minister  that\r\n\r\nPERC has already indicated that the standing of our institutions\r\n\r\nand  our  Government has been affected.  My question is  whether\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister is planning to take any concrete measures  or\r\n\r\nmoves to strengthen and improve our institutions, if damage  has\r\n\r\nalready been done by this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment, there is\r\n\r\nno need for us to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthink  of   ways to strengthen the institution.  It is  how  the\r\n\r\ninstitution is being implemented which is important.   The  fact\r\n\r\nthat we are debating this institution is part of the process  of\r\n\r\nworking the system.  The President has taken certain issues into\r\n\r\nthe  open.  He has let his views be known.  We react  in  a  way\r\n\r\nthat  we should.  We come to Parliament.  We explain why and  we\r\n\r\nexplain away the mistaken perception of the President.  So it is\r\n\r\nmore on how this system will be implemented.  And when we have a\r\n\r\nnew President, I have no doubt that he would have a new style of\r\n\r\nmanaging  certain things in the two areas that he  has  got  the\r\n\r\npowers.   And  we  will still work the process through  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  we  will come to Parliament and  explain.

The\r\n\r\nprinciples  have just been published in a White  Paper  and  the\r\n\r\npoints he clarified after the President's comments are new to me\r\n\r\nand  the whole House.  I think if I have to make comments again,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  different in the light of the clarifications  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that point, let me ask three questions. First, I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, as CEO, stands by the duties under  Article\r\n\r\n146 that the civil servants must report.  A few minutes ago,  he\r\n\r\nsaid that he thinks it is an offence.  But can I ask him, as the\r\n\r\nCEO,  to  state very clearly to the civil service that  this  is\r\n\r\ntaken  as  a  clear  offence and a breach of the  constitutional\r\n\r\nduty.  That point has to be made just as importantly, as he  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  President must have the  moral  courage  to  be\r\n\r\nindependent when necessary within his limited powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope the Prime Minister will consider that\r\n\r\nthere is a need at times to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nair  both agreements and disagreements.  I recollect that in the\r\n\r\nlast ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, can you ask your questions, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. I hope the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill  take  occasion  to  share  points  on  which  the  elected\r\n\r\nPresident  agrees  with the Government that his  action  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary, just as disagreements may surface later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would ask the Prime Minister whether in the next\r\n\r\nsix   years,  the  next  term  of  the  elected  President,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will entrench the Presidency within the Constitution\r\n\r\nand  therefore  strongly establish an accepted  office  for  the\r\n\r\nelected President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my statement just now\r\n\r\nhad  made  it  very  clear  that civil  servants,  ie,  CEOs  of\r\n\r\nparticular  Ministries or statutory boards have a constitutional\r\n\r\nduty  to  perform and, as CEO, I have made it very clear,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  done  in  my statement, that if they have  any  reason  to\r\n\r\nsuspect  that  reserves  are  being  drawn  down,  wittingly  or\r\n\r\nunwittingly, they must indeed tell the President.  In  fact,  it\r\n\r\nis a constitutional duty.  If a civil servant who is required to\r\n\r\ndo so does not do so, he is derelict in his duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion by Mr Simon Tay that we should, from time to\r\n\r\ntime,  raise  in  this House points which have  been  agreed  to\r\n\r\nbetween  the  President and the Prime Minister, I think  we  can\r\n\r\nconsider that.  If it involves a matter of principle, I think we\r\n\r\nshould  let  it  be aired over here.  But if it is  just  merely\r\n\r\nagreements on routine matters, I do not think we need to come to\r\n\r\nthe  House  or we need even to go public on that.  But  where  a\r\n\r\nprinciple is involved, a new principle in particular,  where  we\r\n\r\nhave  settled between the President and the Government, I  think\r\n\r\nit is useful to keep the House informed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether we would entrench the Presidency in the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  in terms of our inability to change  the  Article\r\n\r\nwithout  his  permission in the next term, I would not  want  to\r\n\r\ncommit myself at this stage.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  better  for us to work the  system  and  be  very\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  we have a good system before we entrench  those\r\n\r\npowers in the Constitution.  Otherwise, it is very difficult for\r\n\r\nus  when we find that we should in fact do things in a different\r\n\r\nway to try to change the Constitution, because the President can\r\n\r\nblock  it.   So  I would rather err on the side of  caution.   I\r\n\r\nwould  say that we should try to entrench that within  the  next\r\n\r\nsix years, but I would not want to commit myself at this moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, this is a follow\r\n\r\nup question on the functions of the CPA.

Secondly,  would  the  Prime  Minister  undertake   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate what were these unpleasant encounters\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat the President had or, maybe his Principal Private Secretary\r\n\r\nhad, and also to ensure they would not occur again?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we talk about\r\n\r\ncivil  servants having the responsibility under the Constitution\r\n\r\nto  report  to  the President, it is not all civil servants  but\r\n\r\nonly  those who are designated with the responsibility to do  so\r\n\r\nunder the Constitution.  The President has the right to call  up\r\n\r\nanyone  for  information  which he wants.   It  is  for  him  to\r\n\r\nexercise  that  right if he needs to get further explanation  of\r\n\r\ncertain issues or figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the unpleasant encounters, I would not know unless\r\n\r\nthe  President raises them with me, privately or publicly, which\r\n\r\nhe  has  done through the press conference.  I thought he  would\r\n\r\nprobably have identified the major unpleasant encounters in  his\r\n\r\nlong  list  of  problems at the press conference,  and  we  have\r\n\r\naddressed those episodes in Parliament earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to go back\r\n\r\nto  the question of the President's health.  If the condition of\r\n\r\nthe  President's  health  is crucial  to  the  consideration  of\r\n\r\nsupport  given by the Cabinet to a candidate, why  was  not  the\r\n\r\npresent candidate, who is 75 years old and is known to have  had\r\n\r\na bypass, required to submit a medical report, even if he is not\r\n\r\nrequired by the Constitution to do so?  Instead, we require  the\r\n\r\nsame of President Ong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no legal basis\r\n\r\nfor us to get the candidate to submit a medical report.

Unless  I  go around asking the civil  servants  and\r\n\r\nMinisters whether they indeed found the President's checking  on\r\n\r\nthem a nuisance, I would not know whether it is true or not.  So\r\n\r\nit is not necessary for me to send out a general circular to the\r\n\r\ncivil service and the Ministers to change their mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> As health was the\r\n\r\nmain  reason why the Cabinet rejected, and also at the point  in\r\n\r\ntime,  like  what the Prime Minister said, we had supported  the\r\n\r\nPresident  even  though he had lymphoma, as a  doctor,  we  have\r\n\r\nalways been taught that low grade lymphoma would be difficult to\r\n\r\ncure,  but  it  generally runs a fairly long  course.   In  this\r\n\r\ninstance,  what  I want to know, and I think it is  also  public\r\n\r\ninterest,  unless the course of the disease has taken a  drastic\r\n\r\nchange to become a high grade disease, or the disease cannot  go\r\n\r\ninto  total remission, there would be little reason for  Cabinet\r\n\r\nnot  to  support him, if the lymphoma remains as it was  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Perhaps the Prime Minister would like to clarify this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's low\r\n\r\ngrade  lymphoma has indeed transformed into high grade  lymphoma\r\n\r\nmore than a year ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister said just now\r\n\r\nthat  unless he sends a circular to civil servants to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether  anyone  finds the President a nuisance,  he  would  not\r\n\r\nknow.   I  would like to ask him if he would tell  us,  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  whether  he  has  asked  any  Minister  here  who  finds\r\n\r\nPresident Ong troublesome and a nuisance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> I do not think it is necessary.

I think it is totally irrelevant.  The point\r\n\r\nis,   no  Minister  has  withdrawn  any  cooperation  from   the\r\n\r\nPresident,  and  when most Ministers see him, we  call  him  \"Mr\r\n\r\nPresident\".   There  is  no disrespect shown  to  the  President\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  So it is totally irrelevant for us to try and guess\r\n\r\nwhether Ministers regard the President's performance of his duty\r\n\r\nas  rather  vexing to them.  I think we have always  cooperated,\r\n\r\nand  we should cooperate, and we will continue to cooperate with\r\n\r\nthe new President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  would have been very glad to hear the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsay  in  this  House  that the Government was  not  looking  for\r\n\r\nsycophants  to run for the post of President.  If  that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase,  what  was  the need for the Cabinet to shortlist  certain\r\n\r\npeople  and  then  finally decide on Mr  S.  R.  Nathan  as  the\r\n\r\nCabinet's choice?  Is it not better to leave the judgment to the\r\n\r\nelectorate  to  decide who should be their  President?   Is  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister aware that there is a feeling among  great  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that they have been completely left out,  cheated,\r\n\r\nof their chance to choose the President?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has two\r\n\r\nroles.   One  is  ceremonial, serving as a symbol of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  other  are  the custodial functions that he has  under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  The two roles are now merged into one person  and\r\n\r\nany  Government  would want to ensure that whoever  becomes  the\r\n\r\nPresident is somebody who can do Singapore proud, and can do the\r\n\r\njob competently.  So we, as a Government, would therefore always\r\n\r\nhave  a vested interest to ensure that the right man emerges  to\r\n\r\nbecome  the  President.   But  there  is  nothing  to  stop   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam from finding someone who qualifies under the rules to\r\n\r\nstand   for   election  against  somebody  whom  the  Government\r\n\r\nsupports,  and  the  people can decide.  In  this  instance,  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  has  failed  to  find  somebody  who  can  become  a\r\n\r\ncontestant  in the arena against Mr S. R. Nathan.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nrule against it.  It is within our right to try and get the best\r\n\r\ncandidate  for  Singapore.  Singaporeans are  not  cheated.

I  do not think we need to repeat  them.   We  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for  honourable  men  and  women  who  can  perform   a\r\n\r\nparticular function.  You do not just want to have somebody  who\r\n\r\nhas  bought and sold some shares, some private tutors or  failed\r\n\r\npoliticians, to demean the post of the Presidency, and  let  the\r\n\r\npeople  decide.  We regard the Head of State as a very important\r\n\r\ninstitution  and  it is best that we have the right  person  who\r\n\r\nfulfils  certain  criteria  to  stand  for  election  for   that\r\n\r\nparticular  post,  and the matter has been  decided  over  here.\r\n\r\nParliament has decided.  The people have elected the PAP.   This\r\n\r\nwas  an  issue  way  back in the 1988  election.   We  won.   We\r\n\r\ndefeated  the  argument by Mr Jeyaretnam.

Mr Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> One of the details in the President's press\r\n\r\nconference  which  caught the attention of the  people  was  the\r\n\r\nreference to the reply of the civil servant saying that it would\r\n\r\ntake 52 man-years.  We have heard clarifications that it was  56\r\n\r\nman-years.   May  I  ask  the  Prime Minister,  given  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  has  a right to access the information under  Article\r\n\r\n22F  of the Constitution, is it, in his opinion, the right thing\r\n\r\nfor  a civil servant to tell the President roughly how much time\r\n\r\nit  would  take to answer his question?  Is that fulfilling  the\r\n\r\nduty under Article 22F?  Secondly, whether in his own experience\r\n\r\nas  Prime  Minister,  civil servants  come  to  him  and  before\r\n\r\nanswering his questions, tell him roughly how many man-hours  it\r\n\r\nwould take?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, I have seen a copy of the minutes\r\n\r\nof  the meeting where the President asked for the information to\r\n\r\nbe  given.   I have read the minutes and there was no indication\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  that the Accountant-General was being  disrespectful\r\n\r\nor  rude.   The President wanted certain information and  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  right  for  the Accountant-General to explain  that,  \"Mr\r\n\r\nPresident, Sir, if you would like to have all the lands owned by\r\n\r\nthe  Government valued, it would require 56 man-years.\"   I  saw\r\n\r\nthe  minutes.   The minutes were approved by the President.   It\r\n\r\nwas  entirely  obvious  to  me  that  this  was  a  very  normal\r\n\r\ndiscussion between a respectful civil servant and the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nexchanges  this  afternoon establish two  important  principles.\r\n\r\nFirst,  this  new  institution which  we  have  established  can\r\n\r\nfunction.   In a way, it was perhaps as well that the  President\r\n\r\nchose in his farewell press conference to vent his frustrations.\r\n\r\nHe  left  the Government with the unpleasant task of  having  to\r\n\r\nrebut him in public.  I have heard the exchanges this afternoon,\r\n\r\nand I would like to add these few points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integrity of the Government is of crucial importance to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Many  people  do  not  like  what  they  call   the\r\n\r\nauthoritarian, dictatorial attitude of the PAP, which I have led\r\n\r\nsince  1959.  That was 40 years ago.  We started with a  reserve\r\n\r\nof  about $50 or $60 million in the kitty.  We are now  able  to\r\n\r\nguard  for the future of Singapore, and the troubles we may  run\r\n\r\ninto from time to time, over S$150 billion.  It's not as big  as\r\n\r\nthe Saudi oil reserves, but it is not peanuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before my colleagues and I became unable to function, we\r\n\r\ndiscussed  amongst  ourselves whether we could  trust  a  future\r\n\r\ngeneration  to exercise the same prudence, the same  care,  over\r\n\r\nwhat  we have accumulated and may need in the future.  It is  an\r\n\r\nopen  secret  that  some  of  my  colleagues  think  that  I  am\r\n\r\nattempting  something which is futile.  Because if a  generation\r\n\r\nis determined to spend its way through its patrimony, it will go\r\n\r\nback  from rags to riches to rags.  But at least we should  have\r\n\r\nsome mechanism to get the people to pause.  Let me explain how a\r\n\r\ngovernment works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been in charge of the CPIB from 1959 to 1990. It has\r\n\r\nnot  got a huge, enormous apparatus ferreting out what is  going\r\n\r\non  in immigration and the customs, and in tenders.  But it  has\r\n\r\nexperienced  investigators who can detect  signs,  and  you  can\r\n\r\nalways  be  sure that when something wrong is taking place,  and\r\n\r\nsomebody is being shortchanged, that matter will come out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan worries about whether the President is\r\n\r\ngiven the right information.  Let us suppose for one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoment  that  what my colleagues and I feared did take  place  - that  we  have a spendthrift, reckless, adventurous, opportunist\r\n\r\ngovernment  that is willing to spend its way to prosperity,  and\r\n\r\nis  stripping  off the family heirlooms.  Does anybody  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  believe, in the culture that we have created, that public\r\n\r\nservants  will  quietly see their pensions go  down  the  drain?\r\n\r\nBecause  as  these reserves are drained away, the value  of  our\r\n\r\ncurrency  will drop, as the rupiah dropped.  They are  going  to\r\n\r\ntake  every step to protect their future, and will do  so.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is  how the CPIB works.  Have no doubts, I have no doubts,\r\n\r\npeople will go and see the Auditor-General, lower officials,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretary or the CEO of a statutory board is  not\r\n\r\non  the job, and say, \"Look, this is something dreadfully wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd this will lead to all of us being left with nothing.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as Mr Lim Kim San and Dr Goh have argued with me\r\n\r\nbefore  we  brought  these  provisions  to  the  House,  a  good\r\n\r\nmobiliser  can  play  ducks and drakes with the  electorate  and\r\n\r\nswing  it  around  against  the President  and  his  Council  of\r\n\r\nAdvisors, and can get it through a referendum, then all is lost.\r\n\r\nBut  if  you  have  these  checks,  you  have  certain  hurdles,\r\n\r\nobstacles, then I hope that there will be people in this  House,\r\n\r\nin  spite of a large majority for the Government, who will  say,\r\n\r\npause,  think  about  it  before you  take  this  step.   Unlike\r\n\r\nIndonesia, Malaysia or Thailand, you have nothing to  pledge  to\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank.  You have not got hidden reserves of oil,  gas,\r\n\r\nuranium,  copper  or  gold.   It is  that  kind  of  climate  of\r\n\r\nintegrity, high standards that is our best protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we put up with a lot of frivolous, irrelevant attitudes\r\n\r\nfrom some opposition members.  What we have embarked on is for a\r\n\r\nvery  serious purpose.  Why should I, before I stepped down from\r\n\r\noffice, put impediments in the way of my successor, if I did not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that this obstruction, this inconvenience, could  prove\r\n\r\nto be a very valuable break, a circuit breaker, if the need were\r\n\r\nto  arise?   Today's exchange, as a result of what the President\r\n\r\nsaid  on 16th July, was useful as part of the education  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister - I am glad\r\n\r\nhe  is in the House - in his interview to the press he has  said\r\n\r\nthen  that the President is not a check on the Government,  that\r\n\r\nit  must  be  the  Opposition who  will  be  the  check  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

When he came in, the  system  was\r\n\r\nfunctioning.  I did not believe that the one-party  system  that\r\n\r\nmany  African countries had constitutionally legislated for  was\r\n\r\ngood  for the country.  It is bad for the PAP MPs if every  time\r\n\r\nthey  went  for election, only PAP candidates can stand  against\r\n\r\nthem.   The very fact that they can be contested, and  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  want some opposition, keeps them on their toes.  So  the\r\n\r\nsystem  works.  It behoves us to remember that the system  works\r\n\r\nonly if there are men and women of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintegrity  to  man  it.

In\r\n\r\npower,  after  they opened up in Vietnam, the whole  country  is\r\n\r\nawash  with corruption and they have had to hang their  bankers,\r\n\r\ntheir customs officers.

I do not  blame\r\n\r\nthem.   Therefore, this setback which we had, which could become\r\n\r\nmuch  more  serious,  was  a reminder of  how  things  could  go\r\n\r\ndreadfully  wrong.  One day President Suharto  was  supreme;  in\r\n\r\n1997  he mismanaged a crisis.  In May 1998 the country began  to\r\n\r\nunravel.   It  is  a  natural sequence of  the  passing  of  the\r\n\r\ngenerations.  He had to face a generation of Indonesians that no\r\n\r\nlonger shared with him - the fight against the Japanese, against\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch  -  but a generation that had increasing frustrations\r\n\r\nand anger at what they saw was mismanagement of their resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I say that my successors will be as fortunate in\r\n\r\npassing on the baton to their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuccessors?   Can  Mao Zedong predict that Deng  Xiaoping  would\r\n\r\ninherit his mantle because he castigated him and rusticated  him\r\n\r\nthree  times?  Can Deng Xiaoping predict that Zhao Ziyang  would\r\n\r\nfail  him?   Or  that Jiang Zemin would stay for so  long?   Can\r\n\r\nJiang  Zemin be certain that his next president will be as  wise\r\n\r\nand astute?  Nobody could foresee what happened.  Therefore,  we\r\n\r\ntry  our  best  to  have institutions in place.   They  are  not\r\n\r\nperfect.   In  the  end, they may all fail.

I\r\n\r\nwould  just  like  to  clarify the  point  whether  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident is a check and balance against the Government or  not.\r\n\r\nI  fully  understand the point that the powers of the  President\r\n\r\nare  custodial.  But I would like to quote from Hansard  of  4th\r\n\r\nOctober  1990  from  the then First Deputy Prime  Minister,  now\r\n\r\nPrime Minister [Hansard Vol. 56, No. 7, col. 461].  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My Cabinet colleagues and I believe that a good system of\r\n\r\ngovernment  must have checks and balances.  There are inadequate\r\n\r\nchecks in our present parliamentary system of government.  [This\r\n\r\nis in argument of the Elected President.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear in mind that in introducing this Bill, the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  in  fact  clipping  its  own  wings.   Once  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional amendment is effected, this Government will  have\r\n\r\nsome of its powers checked.  The new Prime Minister will need to\r\n\r\nseek  the  concurrence of the President in certain key areas  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.  I will be the first Prime Minister to be subject to\r\n\r\nthese new checks and safeguards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this same desire of wanting to check the potential\r\n\r\nabuse  of power which prompts us to introduce additional  checks\r\n\r\non the government in three new areas, not mentioned in the first\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  [referring  to the ISA,  proposed  Maintenance  of\r\n\r\nReligious Harmony Bill and CPIB investigations].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSo,  pardon me if I am obtuse, Senior Minister, but I thought  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask for clarification on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is a technical point which Members\r\n\r\nshould know.  The Prime Minister, when he was First Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  made this statement when he moved the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill.   He is not a lawyer by training.  Therefore,  he\r\n\r\nuses  words in a non-legal way.  If I had delivered that speech,\r\n\r\nI would not have used those words because \"clipping one's wings\"\r\n\r\nwould  evoke  in  my mind the swans we have at Botanic  Gardens.\r\n\r\nThey  are  there because they cannot fly away.  And I would  not\r\n\r\nhave  used  that  metaphor because I  would  not  want  a  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister who cannot get up on his feet and do what he wants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers are enshrined in the Constitution. Never mind\r\n\r\nwhat  the Ministers or Prime Minister say when they move a Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  goes  through  the process.   It  goes  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  It comes back.  Finally, it goes through  the  Third\r\n\r\nreading.  It is usually a perfunctory ritual.  But it underlines\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that you have read this for the Third time and  these\r\n\r\nare  the  words  that  define  the  powers.   Therefore,  I  was\r\n\r\nsurprised  to see this academic constitutional lawyer  from  our\r\n\r\nuniversity  -  and I was alarmed when I read he is teaching  our\r\n\r\nstudents  constitutional law - that he  had  not  read  our  own\r\n\r\nConstitution  and  that  he  believed  that  the  President  was\r\n\r\npartially  ceremonial and partially executive.  If he  had  read\r\n\r\nthe  provisions, he would know that in no Article or sub-Article\r\n\r\nof  the Constitution is the President given executive power.  He\r\n\r\nhas a certain veto, a certain blocking power.  Partly because  I\r\n\r\nwas,  by training, a lawyer, so as the principal provisions were\r\n\r\nenacted, I took some care to make quite sure that this mechanism\r\n\r\nwe  were putting into place would not obstruct a government from\r\n\r\ndoing  what  it  legitimately should be able to  do.   Take  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, read it, quote the Constitution to me  and  if  we\r\n\r\ndisagree  on the meaning, there is the court.  You cannot  quote\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and say, \"On that basis, I ask the President\r\n\r\nto clip\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhis wings.\"  I strenuously recommend against that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister, when he says\r\n\r\nthat  the  President has no executive power, is his decision  to\r\n\r\nsay \"no\" to the Government's proposal to use the reserves not an\r\n\r\nexercise of executive power?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not here, Mr Speaker, to show that I\r\n\r\nam  a better lawyer than the Non-Constituency Member.

Since then,  an  inter-agency\r\n\r\nCommittee  led  by  the  Registrar of Trade  Marks  and  Patents\r\n\r\nstudied  international trends and developments.   They  proposed\r\n\r\nthe changes in the Bill to meet the new challenges presented  by\r\n\r\nthe  development of new technology and the increasing popularity\r\n\r\nof electronic commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments address the more urgent needs of\r\n\r\ncopyright owners and users of copyright materials in the on-line\r\n\r\nenvironment.    It   will  improve  copyright   protection   and\r\n\r\nenforcement measures for copyright owners in cyberspace, thereby\r\n\r\npromoting  the use of the Internet by businesses.  It will  also\r\n\r\npromote  greater legal certainty for both copyright  owners  and\r\n\r\nusers  of  copyright  works, as well as intermediaries  such  as\r\n\r\nnetwork   service  providers,  concerning  the  application   of\r\n\r\ncopyright protection in the digital environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating these proposals, the Committee considered\r\n\r\nvarious   international  models,  including   the   1996   World\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty and the 1996\r\n\r\nWorld   Intellectual  Property  Organisation  Performances   and\r\n\r\nPhonograms Treaty.  The Committee has a wide representation.  In\r\n\r\naddition   to   representatives  of  the  relevant  governmental\r\n\r\nagencies, the Committee also included representatives  from  the\r\n\r\nNational  University of Singapore and the media.  The  Committee\r\n\r\nalso  consulted the Law Society and various industry players  on\r\n\r\nthe substance of its proposals.   Sir, this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis a Bill arrived at after an extensive consultative process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to improve copyright protection in cyberspace</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those introductory remarks, let me move on to\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  amendments.  I would first deal  with  the  first\r\n\r\ngroup  of  amendments, i.e, those intended to improve  copyright\r\n\r\nprotection  and  enforcement measures for  copyright  owners  in\r\n\r\ncyberspace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect is that concerning temporary or electronic\r\n\r\nreproduction  right. One of the key rights of a copyright  owner\r\n\r\nis  the  exclusive  right to make copies of his  works.   It  is\r\n\r\npresently  not  very clear if this exclusive  right  extends  to\r\n\r\nelectronic  copies and transient copies made in  the  electronic\r\n\r\nenvironment.  The Bill clarifies this by extending the right  to\r\n\r\ncover  electronic  reproduction.  Such an  extension  will  give\r\n\r\ncopyright  owners an effective means to control the  copying  of\r\n\r\nworks  that  they  make  available on the Internet  and  through\r\n\r\nelectronic transmissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Protection for compilations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, development in computer technology and the\r\n\r\nadvent  of the Internet has led to a proliferation of multimedia\r\n\r\nworks.   The issue of copyright protection for multimedia  works\r\n\r\nhas  become  increasingly important.  A multimedia work  can  be\r\n\r\nmade  up  of different types of underlying works, such as  sound\r\n\r\nrecordings,  photographs, film clips  and  write-ups.   Each  of\r\n\r\nthese  underlying  works presently enjoys  individual  copyright\r\n\r\nprotection  but the multimedia work itself, that is, the  effort\r\n\r\nexpended  in selecting and compiling these individual underlying\r\n\r\nworks together, may not be protected by copyright.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill address this anomaly by\r\n\r\nreplacing the existing definition of \"literary work\" in  section\r\n\r\n7 of the Act with an expanded definition set\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout  in a new section 7A.  Currently, \"literary work\" is defined\r\n\r\nto include a compilation in words, figures or symbols.  There is\r\n\r\nuncertainty  as  to  whether  this is  confined  to  compilation\r\n\r\nconsisting  solely of literary works (in which case,  multimedia\r\n\r\nworks   would  not  be  protected),  or  if  it  also   includes\r\n\r\ncompilation   of  different  kinds  of  work  (in  which   case,\r\n\r\nmultimedia  works  will  be  protected).   The  Bill   therefore\r\n\r\nprovides  a  new  definition  which says  that  \"literary  work\"\r\n\r\nincludes  a compilation of any form of works.  This will  afford\r\n\r\ncopyright  protection to multimedia works.   This  new  form  of\r\n\r\nprotection will be limited to the intellectual creation involved\r\n\r\nin   the  selection  or  arrangement  of  the  contents  of  the\r\n\r\nmultimedia  work.   The protection will be in  addition  to  and\r\n\r\nindependent  of  the copyright protection which  the  individual\r\n\r\nunderlying works may already enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Protection for electronic rights management information</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright owners are increasingly using electronic rights\r\n\r\nmanagement  information to protect their rights  in  cyberspace.\r\n\r\nElectronic  rights  management information includes  information\r\n\r\nattached electronically to a work which identifies the work, the\r\n\r\nauthor  or copyright owner and any terms and conditions relating\r\n\r\nto  the  use  of the work.   Clause 34 of the Bill provides  for\r\n\r\ncivil   remedies   against  tampering  with  electronic   rights\r\n\r\nmanagement  information.   The legal  protection  of  electronic\r\n\r\nrights  management information will help copyright owners better\r\n\r\nprotect their rights in cyberspace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to provide legal certainty</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the second group of amendments aimed at\r\n\r\nproviding  greater  legal  certainty  for  the  application   of\r\n\r\ncopyright protection in the digital environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Browsing exception</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the use of the Internet has become\r\n\r\nincreasingly prevalent.  It has become an invaluable  source  of\r\n\r\ninformation and entertainment for many in the world today.  I am\r\n\r\ntold that every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime  a  person views a web page on the Internet, he  causes  at\r\n\r\nleast  six  copies  of  the web page to be made.   Consequently,\r\n\r\nthere  is  some uncertainty whether copyright is being infringed\r\n\r\nwhen  one  browses through the Internet.  The new  section  193E\r\n\r\nintroduced  by clause 21 of the Bill makes clear that  copyright\r\n\r\nis  not infringed when end users cause incidental copies  to  be\r\n\r\nmade in order to view, listen or utilise works made available on\r\n\r\nthe Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Limitation  of  liability  for  network  service  providers  and removal of infringing materials by network service providers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to what are probably the central provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  Network service providers play a vital role in the on-line  delivery of content for copyright owners.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the  legal  framework  gives  network   service\r\n\r\nproviders certainty about their liabilities and responsibilities\r\n\r\nto copyright owners.  Clause 21 of the Bill therefore introduces\r\n\r\nsections 193B to 193D to address these concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments ensure that network service providers are\r\n\r\nnot liable for any kind of incidental copying that may occur  in\r\n\r\nthe  technical  processes of carrying out their activities  (for\r\n\r\nexample, caching).  The amendments distinguish between materials\r\n\r\nto  which  the  network  service provider  provides  access  and\r\n\r\nmaterials which are hosted by a network service provider at  the\r\n\r\ndirection  of a user.  In the latter case, section  193C  allows\r\n\r\nthe  protection  to  be  lifted if a  copyright  owner  files  a\r\n\r\nStatutory  Declaration that those materials are  infringing.   A\r\n\r\nnetwork service provider faced with such a Statutory Declaration\r\n\r\ncan do one of two things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can immediately remove the materials as demanded by the\r\n\r\ncopyright  owner.   If he does that, he retains  his  protection\r\n\r\nunder  section 193C against copyright infringement actions.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  section  193D  protects  the  network  service\r\n\r\nprovider  against  any action brought by persons  who  want  the\r\n\r\nmaterial  to remain on the network.  By adopting this course  of\r\n\r\naction, the network service provider ensures that he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  be sued for copyright infringement for materials  hosted\r\n\r\nby him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the network service provider can choose to\r\n\r\nignore  the Statutory Declaration.  Once he does this, he  loses\r\n\r\nthe legal protection conferred on a network service provider  by\r\n\r\nsection  193C.   This  does not mean that  the  network  service\r\n\r\nprovider    automatically   becomes   liable    for    copyright\r\n\r\ninfringement.   What  it  means  is  that  the  network  service\r\n\r\nprovider's  liability  will  then  have  to  be  determined   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the other general provisions in  the  Copyright\r\n\r\nAct, and it also means that he can no longer rely on the special\r\n\r\nimmunity  given  to  a network service provider.   Why  would  a\r\n\r\nnetwork  service  provider choose this  course  of  action,  and\r\n\r\nthereby throwing away the network service provider immunity  and\r\n\r\nrisk  being found liable for copyright infringement under  those\r\n\r\ngeneral legal provisions?  He may want to do so, for example, if\r\n\r\nhe  is confident, that the material is not infringing.  A person\r\n\r\nwho  makes  a  false Statutory Declaration can be  punished  for\r\n\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new sections 193B to 193D finely balance the\r\n\r\nrights and interests of copyright owners, users of materials and\r\n\r\nnetwork  service  providers.  They provide legal  certainty  for\r\n\r\nboth  network  service  providers as well as  copyright  owners,\r\n\r\nwhile  preserving  at the time, a certain level  of  freedom  of\r\n\r\naction for network service providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transfer of electronic copies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 of the Bill further introduces a section 193F to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  transfer of works in the  digital  environment.\r\n\r\nThis  clarifies  that if a person who has bought  an  electronic\r\n\r\ncopy  of  materials transfers it, the transferee will  have  the\r\n\r\nsame  rights  as  those enjoyed by the transferor  provided  the\r\n\r\ntransferor does not keep any copy for himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>\"Reasonable portion\"</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on some minor amendments to extend existing\r\n\r\ncopyright\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcepts to make them relevant to the digital environment.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  concerns the concept of \"reasonable portion\".  Currently,\r\n\r\nthe  Copyright Act permits copying of a reasonable portion of  a\r\n\r\ncopyrighted work under certain circumstances.  As a guideline, a\r\n\r\n\"reasonable  portion\" is defined by reference to the  number  of\r\n\r\npages  of  the work.  Such a measurement may not be possible  in\r\n\r\nthe  electronic  environment.  Clause 3 of  the  Bill  therefore\r\n\r\nextends the definition for works in the digital format by  using\r\n\r\nthe measurement of electronic bytes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exceptions for libraries and archives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment concerns the exception for libraries\r\n\r\nand archives to make a copy of a work for preservation and other\r\n\r\npurposes  and  the exception for anyone to make  a  copy  of  an\r\n\r\nunpublished  work kept in a library or archive for research  and\r\n\r\nprivate study in sections 47 and 48.  These amendments remove or\r\n\r\nreplace words like \"microform\" and \"manuscript\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exceptions for educational institutions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment concerns the ability of educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  make copies of works within prescribed  limits\r\n\r\nfor  educational purposes.  Clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill extend\r\n\r\nthis   permission  to  include  copies  of  works  on   networks\r\n\r\ncontrolled or operated by educational institutions.   This  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate educational institutions using Internet and other new\r\n\r\ntechnologies  to  conduct distance learning  courses  and  other\r\n\r\neducational activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Performers' protection</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we introduced provisions in the Copyright Act to\r\n\r\nprotect performers' rights.  These provisions are found in  Part\r\n\r\nXII  of  the  Act.  Based on feedback which we have received,  a\r\n\r\nnumber of measures are introduced in this Bill to fine-tune  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  concerning performer's rights  and  to  allow  those\r\n\r\nrights to be protected more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in order to conform with international norms,\r\n\r\nperformers' rights are extended to allow performers to have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecourse  against commercial dealings in pirated  recordings  of\r\n\r\ntheir  performances  and  to make such  commercial  dealings  an\r\n\r\noffence.   Secondly, the present restriction in the Act  against\r\n\r\nassignment by performers of their right to sue is removed.  This\r\n\r\nwill   allow   performers  to  take  action  through  collective\r\n\r\nmanagement   agencies.   Thirdly,  the  Bill   also   allows   a\r\n\r\nbroadcaster  and a performer to agree to a period  of  retention\r\n\r\nfor  recordings of his performance made for broadcast  which  is\r\n\r\nlonger  than  the statutory prescribed period.   This  amendment\r\n\r\nwill give effect to existing commercial practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Border enforcement measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Copyright Act was amended to introduce\r\n\r\nborder enforcement measures.  These are in sections 140A through\r\n\r\n140R  of the Act.  These provisions allow a copyright owner  who\r\n\r\nsuspects  that  a  shipment  of pirated  goods  is  coming  into\r\n\r\nSingapore to alert the Customs and Excise Department so that the\r\n\r\ngoods can be seized.  Certain safeguards have already been built\r\n\r\ninto  the provisions when they were introduced last year.  Based\r\n\r\non   feedback   and  experience,  two  further  safeguards   are\r\n\r\nintroduced by clauses 18 and 20 of the Bill to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nborder enforcement provisions are not abused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first safeguard will empower an authorised officer to\r\n\r\nrequire  a  complainant to give security in relation to  damages\r\n\r\nwhich he may be ordered to pay for wrongful seizure.  The second\r\n\r\nsafeguard is to allow a person aggrieved by the seizure to apply\r\n\r\nto the court for compensation if the complainant fails to follow\r\n\r\nup on the seizure by taking infringement action, or having taken\r\n\r\ninfringement   action,  the  court  then   rules   against   the\r\n\r\ncomplainant or if the complainant withdraws the action.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to wrap up, may I quickly touch on the remaining\r\n\r\namendments in the Bill.  Clause 13 deletes section 108(2) so  as\r\n\r\nto  widen the scope of the public performance rights of authors.\r\n\r\nClauses 15\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand 17 amend sections 120 and 136 to widen the category of items\r\n\r\non  which the court may make a delivery up order.  The amendment\r\n\r\nto  section 136 further allows an application for search warrant\r\n\r\nto  be made in any court.  Currently, such applications can only\r\n\r\nbe  made before a magistrate.  Clause 22 amends section  199  to\r\n\r\nprovide that a broadcaster's right to re-transmit a broadcast by\r\n\r\ncable  without  infringing copyright in the underlying  work  is\r\n\r\nrestricted to broadcasts originating in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Future directions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, let me say that this Bill reinforces\r\n\r\nSingapore's commitment to provide a strong intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights  regime  to encourage the growth of a knowledge-based  or\r\n\r\ninformation  economy  and  to promote  e-commerce  and  creative\r\n\r\ninnovations.   As  technologies are ever  evolving  and  as  new\r\n\r\nissues   surface   as  a  result  of  the  constantly   changing\r\n\r\nenvironment, I must say that this Bill is by no means  the  last\r\n\r\nword  on the subject.  We will continue to monitor international\r\n\r\ndevelopments  and we may have to propose further refinements  to\r\n\r\nour copyright regime to cope with the technological developments\r\n\r\nas  and when the need arises.  We are committed to ensuring that\r\n\r\nour  copyright law will be responsive to the changing  needs  of\r\n\r\nindustries  and we will continue to evolve to take into  account\r\n\r\nnew developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the Minister's motion and the three  purposes of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to address, however, certain\r\n\r\nwider  concerns and make certain clarifications which will  help\r\n\r\nin the future interpretation of the Act in the market place.   I\r\n\r\nam  also  glad that the Minister says that this Bill is not  the\r\n\r\nlast  word, and I therefore think that even if these issues  are\r\n\r\nnot addressed today, they can be addressed in a future copyright\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to realise that copyright was a right\r\n\r\ncreated to protect the authors of books, and it has been  slowly\r\n\r\nextended  over  the  years  and centuries  to  include  dramatic\r\n\r\nperformances,  sound  recordings,  films  and  now  the  further\r\n\r\nextension into the world of e-commerce and the Internet.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery  important  to realise too that some of the older  concepts\r\n\r\nhave to be changed, because as the Minister has mentioned, every\r\n\r\ntime  we browse and surf the Internet, we are actually breaching\r\n\r\nsomebody's copyright, because we are copying his material on  to\r\n\r\nour  computer.   It is therefore good to have this  Bill  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  may  one day be important for us to think  of  a  sui\r\n\r\ngeneris  protection, not to extend copyright but to think  of  a\r\n\r\nspecific right to protect computerised material.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like to raise certain issues in\r\n\r\nclause 3 of the Bill which redefines the proposed section  7  of\r\n\r\nthe Copyright Act.  Under the proposed section 7(2), there is an\r\n\r\nattempt to indicate what reasonable portion means in the context\r\n\r\nof electronic material.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old world of paper, we could say that 10% of a book\r\n\r\nwould  be a substantial copy, and anything beyond that is not  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  portion  to use.  However, I am a  little  concerned\r\n\r\nthat we are now trying to extend this paper world rule into  the\r\n\r\nelectronic medium and trying to say that instead  of 10% of  the\r\n\r\nmaterial,  we now talk about 10% of the bytes.  And 10%  of  the\r\n\r\nbytes, to me, is really an arbitrary and rigid definition for an\r\n\r\nelectronic medium.  For example, if I take two pages from a book\r\n\r\nof  100  pages, that is not an infringement under the 10%  rule.\r\n\r\nBut  two  pages  from an electronic work of similar  length  may\r\n\r\nactually  contain  two pages in format which contain  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nbytes.   It  could be, for example, in PDF format, video,  sound\r\n\r\nor  animated graphics, which require a lot of bytes.  Or perhaps\r\n\r\nin  these  two  pages,  the  author  has  embedded  his  digital\r\n\r\nwatermark and therefore there are a lot of bytes in there.   And\r\n\r\njust by taking two pages from the book, not knowing that he  has\r\n\r\nembedded this digital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwatermark,  I  have infringed his copyright.  I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  assure  us  that this  indeed  is  not  the  case.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a blind extension of the old rule is not good enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 4 which is a new section 7A, there is an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  include multimedia material in  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"compilation\".   Most web sites today would be  compilations  of\r\n\r\nsome  sort.  There will be different things in there  -   texts,\r\n\r\ngraphics,  animations, video and so on.  And it would really  be\r\n\r\nuseful to say that these things are also protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to explore the further question which\r\n\r\nis  whether  we  should  really try and extend  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nliterary  work  to  these areas, or whether we  should  actually\r\n\r\nstart thinking of a special right, perhaps a database right  and\r\n\r\nspecial computer compilation right.  Some countries have  indeed\r\n\r\ndatabase  law.  However, computerised material does not  contain\r\n\r\njust computer databases.  And under section 7A, that appears  to\r\n\r\nbe the intention.  The compilation should be of various relevant\r\n\r\nmaterials  which includes sound recordings, cinematograph  films\r\n\r\nand so on.  But sub-section (3) of the proposed section 7A deals\r\n\r\nwith  compilation  or  table wholly  of  relevant  materials  or\r\n\r\ncompilation   or   table  of  partly  relevant   materials,   or\r\n\r\ncompilation of data.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"data\" here is not stated but I suppose\r\n\r\nreading in the context, it refers to computer data and therefore\r\n\r\nyou either have a compilation of relevant materials wholly or in\r\n\r\npart or just purely computer data.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do believe however that the word \"data\" is not just\r\n\r\nsimply a technical word for bytes and bits of computer data, but\r\n\r\nit  also means nuggets of facts and figures which together  form\r\n\r\ninformation.  And therefore that is the plain English meaning of\r\n\r\nthis  word  and  it would mean therefore that a compilation  can\r\n\r\neither  be  of  relevant materials like video, tapes  and  sound\r\n\r\nrecordings  and/or  data.  And so when this section  deals  with\r\n\r\ncompilation as disjunctive references, I take it that it  misses\r\n\r\nout on the fact that a database\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor an Internet site may contain video and data at the same time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister could also clarify this rather  technical\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, \"relevant material\" here is defined but I think\r\n\r\nit  probably misses out on certain aspects of computer databases\r\n\r\nand  web  pages,  and that it does not appear  to  me  to  cover\r\n\r\nanimated  graphics or unpublished computer programmes  basically\r\n\r\non  the exclusio unius principle, ie, in the first definition of\r\n\r\n\"relevant   material\",  it  refers  specifically  to   a   work,\r\n\r\n\"including  a computer program\".  Therefore, subsequently,  when\r\n\r\nit  says in paragraph (d) \"a published edition of a work\", there\r\n\r\nwould be no reference to a computer program.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to make about this Bill is that in\r\n\r\nclause  10,  in  the proposed section 51(3) and (4),  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  exemptions given for teachers who teach in  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   Sometimes  they  do  have  to  make  copies   of\r\n\r\ncopyrighted material and we do need to give them some protection\r\n\r\nfrom   being   prosecuted  or  sued  for  breaching   somebody's\r\n\r\ncopyright.  I hope, however,  and this is not clear in the Bill,\r\n\r\nthere  is protection for a teacher who is teaching a class using\r\n\r\na  laptop  and - besides the fact that he has got to download  a\r\n\r\nwebsite and other relevant copyrighted materials on his laptop - sometimes,  he may actually need to access on-line, say,  eg,  a\r\n\r\nwebsite  to demonstrate the features of the website.   Sometimes\r\n\r\nnot  all  classrooms have got the on-line connection, or perhaps\r\n\r\nthere  is an on-line connection but the teacher feels that  when\r\n\r\nhe  teaches,  he  wants to be sure that he  can  logon  to  that\r\n\r\nwebsite  without  having to wait for traffic to  clear,  without\r\n\r\nhaving  all  kinds of unexpected problems.  So he  may  actually\r\n\r\nwant  to download the whole site onto his laptop, and then refer\r\n\r\nto  it  in  the  course of his lectures.  As I  read  currently,\r\n\r\nclause  10,  it  does not seem to protect him in  that  sort  of\r\n\r\nsituation, because when he downloads a whole website to  protect\r\n\r\nhimself from unexpected downtime, for example, he would actually\r\n\r\nbe breaching the 5% or the 500-page rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point I want to make is on clause 21 which is\r\n\r\nthe proposed section 193B.  There is this further elaboration of\r\n\r\nwhat a network service provider will be protected against.  When\r\n\r\nI  first read this Bill, Sir, I realised that there is a general\r\n\r\nimmunity to network service providers given in section 10 of the\r\n\r\nElectronic  Transactions Act.  And when I heard  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech in this House, I have the understanding - and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will correct me if this is the wrong understanding   - that   there   is   the  general  immunity  in  the   Electronic\r\n\r\nTransactions Act, and what we are legislating here  is  that  in\r\n\r\ncertain  circumstances where copyright is concerned, we  have  a\r\n\r\nspecial immunity for certain network service providers who  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they can come under this protection and therefore it  does\r\n\r\nnot   prejudice   his  general  defence  under  the   Electronic\r\n\r\nTransactions  Act.  If it does prejudice his  position,  then  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  this House to include the words \"without prejudice\"\r\n\r\nto  the Electronic Transactions Act as a prefix, so to speak,  a\r\n\r\nclause which prefixes this new section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my final point is that under clause 21 of the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich proposes a new section 193C, particularly subsections 2(a)\r\n\r\nand  2(c), there is mention of control and I seek the Minister's\r\n\r\nclarification.  \"Control\" is not defined and it  could  well  be\r\n\r\ntechnical.   Most  of the time it is a technical  control.   But\r\n\r\nwould it be possible for somebody to argue in court that because\r\n\r\nthe  ISP has put in certain contractual provisions, for example,\r\n\r\nto  prohibit  a  user  from accessing  pornography  on  pain  of\r\n\r\ndamages,  that  he  therefore has control and  is  out  of  this\r\n\r\ndefence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point under this clause I want to raise is that\r\n\r\nthere is a procedure of what I would call a notice to take down.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if a network has got infringing material and the\r\n\r\ncopyright  owner says, \"I send you notice to take it  down,  you\r\n\r\nmust  do so.\"  As it is phrased currently, I think there is some\r\n\r\nroom  for abuse.  First of all, it is possible where the  stakes\r\n\r\nare   high  enough  for  somebody  to  allege  infringement  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  send  a statutory declaration purportedly  signed  by\r\n\r\nhim.  And then there is no timeframe to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  down the pages and there is no procedure to challenge this\r\n\r\nnotice to take down.  It, first of all, should be necessary, not\r\n\r\njust  to  have a statutory declaration, because a person,  where\r\n\r\nthe stakes are high enough, may say, \"I am happy to be fined for\r\n\r\nperjury, but I want to stop this competitor in his tracks.\"   So\r\n\r\nit  would  be  necessary for a properly authenticated  statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration, or perhaps a court order.  Secondly,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nimportant to clarify how an overseas copyright owner can  get  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration that is valid under Singapore law.   What\r\n\r\nhappens  if his own law does not allow for or does not permit  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration?  There is also a need to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthere is a certain time frame to respond and a redress mechanism\r\n\r\nperhaps  for  abuse of the notice to take down.  This  procedure\r\n\r\ncan also be evaluated in a court of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on clause 21, I would certainly hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncan  clarify,  because the words \"network service provider\"  are\r\n\r\nnot  defined, whether perhaps a search engine provider would  be\r\n\r\nsuch  a network service provider.  In the circumstances where  a\r\n\r\nsearch engine provider may actually allow a user of the Internet\r\n\r\nto   download  certain  copies  of  other  people's  copyrighted\r\n\r\nmaterials, would a search engine provider then be deemed to be a\r\n\r\nviolator,  infringer or a facilitator of that  infringement?   I\r\n\r\nhope  that with these clarifications, the Bill would  be  a  far\r\n\r\nmore  understandable provision when it is applied in the  market\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand to support the\r\n\r\nCopyright (Amendment)  Bill.  However, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law to deliberate on several areas of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 3 -</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(2A)(a) states what constitutes a reasonable\r\n\r\nportion for copying as not exceeding 10% of the total number  of\r\n\r\nbytes.  May I ask the Minister why this portion is fixed at  not\r\n\r\nmore than the 10% stipulated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(2A)(b) states \"in a case where the work is\r\n\r\ndivided into chapters, exceeds,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  aggregate, 10% of the total number  of  bytes  in  that\r\n\r\nedition  but contains only the whole or part of a single chapter\r\n\r\nof the work\".  This is rather ambiguous, if not confusing.  Does\r\n\r\nthis mean that copying of 10% of each chapter is allowed or that\r\n\r\nthe  total copying of the whole edition regardless of the number\r\n\r\nof chapters should not be more than 10% of the whole text?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 10 -</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 51(5) specifies that a person cannot make a copy of\r\n\r\nany  other  part of that work \"within 14 days after the  day  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the previous copy was made.\"  I would like the Minister's\r\n\r\ndeliberation  on this time interval.  In my opinion,  a  shorter\r\n\r\nperiod  like  seven  days  would,  in  fact,  be  better  as  it\r\n\r\nfacilitates the users' need for research.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clauses 15 and 17 -</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 120(1), the words \"predominantly used\" have not\r\n\r\nbeen  defined.  Similarly, the words were used again in  section\r\n\r\n136(a) and not defined.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 23 -</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 201B is unsatisfactory because it would cause some\r\n\r\ninjustice.  When the partnership or the body corporate has  been\r\n\r\ncharged   or   punished,  the  individual  should   be   spared.\r\n\r\nPunishment  to  both  individual and  the  partnership  or  body\r\n\r\ncorporate  would result in duplicity of charges and  punishment.\r\n\r\nIf  the  individual should be culpable, then he should  be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible and not the partnership or body corporate.  However,\r\n\r\nif  it  is  intended  to  be a collective punishment,  then  the\r\n\r\npartnership   or  body  corporate  be  punished  and   not   the\r\n\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Dr Toh See\r\n\r\nKiat  and  Dr Lily Neo for their comments.  Before I  deal  with\r\n\r\ntheir specific points, since the issues they have raised touched\r\n\r\non  fairly  technical  matters, let me make  a  few  preliminary\r\n\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I am not an expert on some of these technical issues\r\n\r\nand  I  will  bow to my colleagues on technical issues  such  as\r\n\r\ndigital  watermarks, animated graphics and so on.   But  let  me\r\n\r\nassure  my colleagues that these and other questions of  details\r\n\r\nhave been carefully considered and formulated by an inter-agency\r\n\r\nCommittee  which included experts from different agencies,  such\r\n\r\nas   the  National  Computer  Board,  staff  from  the  National\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore who are well versed in computer  law  as\r\n\r\nwell as representatives from other agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to make is that on the solutions and\r\n\r\napproaches which I referred to and which are to be found in  the\r\n\r\nBill, I do not expect them to please or satisfy everyone because\r\n\r\nthere are so many different ways and approaches to solving these\r\n\r\nvery   difficult  problems  in  the  context  of  ever  changing\r\n\r\ntechnological  developments.   Also,  different  countries   are\r\n\r\ngrappling with these issues and have adopted diverse approaches.\r\n\r\nWe  could, of course, wait for months and years to see  how  the\r\n\r\ndust  has  settled  in  other countries.   But  because  of  the\r\n\r\nconsiderations which I have alluded to in my speech just now  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  last year, we want to have an effective and up-to-date\r\n\r\ncopyright  regime  and intellectual property right  regime.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to make changes as and when the need arises.  So we cannot\r\n\r\nwait  for  all the developments which have taken place and  then\r\n\r\ndecide  which  is the most perfect solution.   It  is  really  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  judgment.   In arriving at the approaches,  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken  into account the developments in other countries as  well\r\n\r\nas the existing scheme in our Copyright Act because our approach\r\n\r\nhas  been  that  if  the  existing scheme  for  other  forms  of\r\n\r\ncopyright has worked fairly well, then we will try to follow  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible  a  similar approach and we  will  try  to  be\r\n\r\nconsistent.   But as I said, this is not the last  word  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me turn to some of the specific\r\n\r\npoints  raised  by  Dr Toh See Kiat, in the order  in  which  he\r\n\r\nreferred  to.   First, he talked about clause 3 (section  7)  on\r\n\r\n\"reasonable portion\".  Of course, he has a point as  to  whether\r\n\r\nwe could leave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"reasonable  portion\"  undefined  for  electronic  documents  or\r\n\r\nwhether  10% of the bytes is arbitrarily rigid.  Let me  explain\r\n\r\nthat  the  approach  we  have taken  is  to  define  \"reasonable\r\n\r\nportion\"  for electronic works because we wanted to  provide  in\r\n\r\nthe  legislation a minimum level of certainty.   Therefore,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition, I should stress, is not exhaustive.  It is expressly\r\n\r\nprovided that the definition does not limit the meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nphrase  \"reasonable portion\".  If, say,  more than  10%  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber of bytes is copied, the court could still regard that  as\r\n\r\ncopying only a reasonable portion, because it all depends on the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of the case.  I am advised that such  flexibility\r\n\r\nwill  address  the special cases which Dr Toh See Kiat  referred\r\n\r\nto, such as the example concerning digital watermarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he referred to questions of compilation, whether it is\r\n\r\nconjunctive or disjunctive in clause 4 (new section 7A).  Let me\r\n\r\nsay that this definition in subsection 3 is actually intended to\r\n\r\ncapture any compilation that falls within either paragraph  (a),\r\n\r\n(b)  or  (c).   The  definition should not be made  conjunctive,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  we did so, then it will imply that the  compilation\r\n\r\nmust  satisfy  all three paragraphs before it can be  protected,\r\n\r\nand that is not the intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also made a point about \"relevant material\". The\r\n\r\nway  the phrase \"relevant material\" is defined in section  7A(3)\r\n\r\nis  to  include  a work and a work is defined in  section  7  as\r\n\r\nmeaning   a  literary,  dramatic,  musical  or  artistic   work.\r\n\r\nTherefore, graphics would be an artistic work and is a  relevant\r\n\r\nmaterial.   A computer program is a relevant material regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether  it is published or not.  A published edition  of  a\r\n\r\nwork  is  specifically mentioned because  there  is  a  separate\r\n\r\ncopyright in the typographical format that lasts 25 years  in  a\r\n\r\npublished  edition.  There is no need to state computer  program\r\n\r\nagain  in  paragraph (d) since paragraph (a) already mentions  a\r\n\r\ncomputer  program, and that will cover published and unpublished\r\n\r\ncomputer programs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat also spoke about clause 10, new section\r\n\r\n51(3) and 51(4), and talked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  the  teachers' possible problem.  Let me say,  in  reply,\r\n\r\nthat  the 5% rule applies in the print media as well.  Thus,  in\r\n\r\nthe  print media, if he looks at the provisions of the Act,  the\r\n\r\nteacher  can  only  make multiple copies of 5%  of  a  work  for\r\n\r\nteaching purposes without infringing copyright.  But it is  felt\r\n\r\nthat there is no reason not to apply the same restriction in  an\r\n\r\nelectronic  environment.   I should  also  point  out  that  new\r\n\r\nsection 51 only applies to making a copy on a network controlled\r\n\r\nor  operated by an educational institution.  I realise  that  Dr\r\n\r\nToh See Kiat would favour a more liberal regime where even if he\r\n\r\nwere  to  download it onto his personal laptop,  from  a  policy\r\n\r\npoint of view, it would be difficult to give a blanket exemption\r\n\r\nfor  downloading for teaching purposes.  But let me at the  same\r\n\r\ntime  point  out that teaching online is facilitated because  if\r\n\r\nthe  teaching is done through real time access to websites, they\r\n\r\ncan always rely on the exception for browsing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat referred to clause 21, new section 193B,\r\n\r\nand  whether we should insert the words \"without prejudice\".   I\r\n\r\nshould  point  out that the proposed new section 193B  is  wider\r\n\r\nthan section 10 of the Electronic Transactions Act because there\r\n\r\nis  no  requirement that the material is a third party  material\r\n\r\nwhich is found in section 10 of the other Act.  Therefore, there\r\n\r\nis  no  need  to  insert \"without prejudice\"  since  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnarrower  than section 10.  It is wider.  In other  words,  this\r\n\r\nprovision  is  more detailed only because it is meant  to  apply\r\n\r\nexclusively  to  the  question  of  copyright.  The   Electronic\r\n\r\nTransactions Act has a different objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also talked about terminology control, technical\r\n\r\ncontractual  provisions, ISP prohibiting  users  from  accessing\r\n\r\npornography, and so on.  I think the answer to this  is  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the control required is over the network.  The conjunctive\r\n\r\nend  for  operator  and  control in section  193C(2)(a)  is  the\r\n\r\noperative element.  Therefore, it must be a network operated  by\r\n\r\nthe  NSP  as  well.  An NSP is only obliged to remove  materials\r\n\r\nfrom such a network.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about the requirement of statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration.  I would say that we should not read too much  into\r\n\r\nthe  term purported as a statutory declaration really has to  be\r\n\r\nauthenticated.   As  Dr  Toh  See  Kiat  knows,  it  has  to  be\r\n\r\nauthenticated by a Commissioner of Oaths.  Having a  requirement\r\n\r\nfor court order, in my view, would be too cumbersome as the real\r\n\r\nidea  here  is  to give copyright owners a quick redress  before\r\n\r\nthey  take  out copyright infringement actions.  So  nobody  has\r\n\r\nsaid about statutory declaration.  But I do not think people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore take statutory declarations that lightly because there\r\n\r\nare  penalties which follow if one makes a statutory declaration\r\n\r\nfraudulently.  The requirement of a statutory declaration, in my\r\n\r\nview, itself should suffice to prevent abuse because there is  a\r\n\r\nredress  for  prosecution for false statutory declaration.   Any\r\n\r\naggrieved  party can also take out a civil action for  malicious\r\n\r\nprosecution against a defender who has made a false declaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this provision concerns Singapore's network service\r\n\r\nproviders,  I  think  it is reasonable  for  us  to  expect  the\r\n\r\ncopyright  owners  would contact the network  service  providers\r\n\r\nthrough agents located in Singapore.  It is foreseeable that  in\r\n\r\npractice,   such   declarations  may  be  made  for   collective\r\n\r\nmanagement agencies.  As I have said, mechanisms for redress for\r\n\r\nabuse  of notice can be taken care of by civil action.   In  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, as he referred to the system in the US, there  is\r\n\r\na challenge mechanism because the notice is not required to be a\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration as far as I understand the United  States\r\n\r\nsystem,  and there is less safeguard against abuse.  But  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  incorporated  the  safeguard in  the  notice  through  the\r\n\r\nrequirement of a statutory declaration before a Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nOaths,  the  challenge  mechanism  involving  NSP  may  not   be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  That is the explanation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the timeframe in which the NSP should act, I think a\r\n\r\nreasonable time is a tested formula, and I doubt if a NSP  would\r\n\r\nnot act within such reasonable time when it receives a statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the questions raised by Dr Lily Neo, first, she\r\n\r\nalso touched on clause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n3  (section 7, subsection 2A) on \"reasonable portion\".   Let  me\r\n\r\nrepeat here again that section 7(2A) is an extension of existing\r\n\r\nsection  7(2A) into the digital environment.  The 10%  yardstick\r\n\r\nis  actually  taken  from section 7(2A) which  provides  that  a\r\n\r\nreasonable portion includes a copy of not more than 10%  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  pages in a work.  The approach of taking  10%  as  a\r\n\r\nyardstick,  of course, was taken sometime back when  we  enacted\r\n\r\nthis  particular  provision  in 1987.   It  is  felt  that  this\r\n\r\nprovision  has worked quite well all these years.  And  when  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to  insert  the  new section 7(2A)  to  make  the  term\r\n\r\n\"reasonable portion\" relevant to the digital environment, it was\r\n\r\nfelt  that there was no good reason to depart from the yardstick\r\n\r\nof  10% which has been used all these years.  While it is  clear\r\n\r\nthat  copying only 10% for the purpose of research  and  private\r\n\r\nstudy  will  not amount to infringement, I want to  stress  that\r\n\r\nthis does not mean that copying more than 10% will automatically\r\n\r\nresult  in  infringement.  In other words,  where  more  than  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  portion is copied for the purpose  of  research  and\r\n\r\nprivate  study, we then deal with the issue whether the  copying\r\n\r\nis  a  fair  dealing in the light of circumstances of the  case.\r\n\r\nAnd as Members know, there are other provisions which relate  to\r\n\r\nfair dealing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also touched on provisions which talk about\r\n\r\nwork  being  divided  into chapters and so  on,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nambiguous, if not confusing.  Here again this phrase is a mirror\r\n\r\nof section 7(2B), the existing provision.  The amendments merely\r\n\r\nextend  the  application  of an already  existing  provision  to\r\n\r\nenable  its  application  in a digital  environment.   What  the\r\n\r\nprovision  really  says  is that \"reasonable  portion\"  means  a\r\n\r\nsingle chapter of the work or 10% of the work, whichever is  the\r\n\r\ngreater.   But this is based on an existing approach already  to\r\n\r\nbe found in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 10, Dr Lily Neo raised the question of 14 days\r\n\r\nand  7  days.   Here again I want to point out that  the  14-day\r\n\r\nlimit  is  the approach already to be found in existing  section\r\n\r\n51.  The Bill merely extends the existing provisions so as to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  them applicable in an electronic environment.  Section  51\r\n\r\nis   more   appropriate  for  multiple  copying  by  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  If her concern, as I understand it, is about  the\r\n\r\nproblems  which  researchers and students may face,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\npoint  out to her that students or researchers can rely  on  the\r\n\r\nfair  dealing  provision in section 35  for  private  study  and\r\n\r\nresearch.  And in section 35, there is no 14-day limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Dr Lily Neo referred to clauses 15 and 17 concerning\r\n\r\nsection  120(1) on the phraseology \"predominantly used\" and  why\r\n\r\nthis  has  not  been  defined.  We have not  defined  this  term\r\n\r\nbecause in some instances, and this is one, it may be better  to\r\n\r\nleave  it to the courts to apply the provisions to the facts  of\r\n\r\nindividual  cases.   It  is  not  possible  really  to  give   a\r\n\r\ndefinition  to  every  term because circumstances  may  vary  so\r\n\r\nvastly.  In appropriate circumstances, for example, in the  case\r\n\r\nwhere  a photocopying machine has been found to be predominantly\r\n\r\nused  for  making  infringing copies by  the  defendant  on  the\r\n\r\nparticular   facts  of  a  case,  the  court  can   order   that\r\n\r\nphotocopying  machine, for example, to be delivered  up  to  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo then referred to clause 23. It is a provision\r\n\r\nrelating   to  offences  committed  by  partnerships   or   body\r\n\r\ncorporate.   Let me say here that this provision is not  new  in\r\n\r\nour  laws.   An equivalent provision can be found in  the  Trade\r\n\r\nMarks  Act  and the Patents Act.  In fact, you can find  similar\r\n\r\napproaches  in  at least 20 other pieces of legislation  in  our\r\n\r\nstatute  books.  The provision really gives flexibility  whether\r\n\r\nto  charge  only  the  corporation or the individual,  or  both.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the  facts of the case would make it  appropriate  to\r\n\r\ncharge  only one or the other.  Sometimes it would be  necessary\r\n\r\nto charge both the corporation and the individual to ensure that\r\n\r\neither one or the other is not let off unfairly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that this is not what lawyers referred to as\r\n\r\na  \"strict  liability\" provision.  In other words, the  partners\r\n\r\nwho  are directors and who are proved to be ignorant or who have\r\n\r\nattempted to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprevent  the  commission of the offence would not be  caught  by\r\n\r\nthis  provision.  In other words, the prosecution will  have  to\r\n\r\nproduce evidence against these people before they are convicted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have touched on the main provisions. But my\r\n\r\nreply should not be taken to dismiss their ideas and suggestions\r\n\r\nout  of  hand.   There  are many different approaches  to  these\r\n\r\ndifficult,  tricky issues of copyright.  The fact that  we  have\r\n\r\nadopted  these measures shows that we would like to  give  these\r\n\r\napproaches a try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made amendments as a result of feedback and\r\n\r\nexperience  to  some of the other provisions  which  we  enacted\r\n\r\nsometime ago.  And so it goes on.  Copyright is one area of  the\r\n\r\nlaw which is fast evolving.  So we will see how these provisions\r\n\r\nwork.   I  hope that in the light of experience, they will  work\r\n\r\neffectively.  But our consultations with the industry and  other\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies  as  well as  the  different  agencies  and\r\n\r\nMinistries  will  continue.  And it may  be  necessary  after  a\r\n\r\ndecent  interval of time to come back to this House if  we  find\r\n\r\nthat the provisions need updating.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nIn   referring  to  a  classroom  situation,  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that in the print medium situation, the teachers  are\r\n\r\nallowed  5% copying and that where online teaching is used,  the\r\n\r\nteacher  would have ample protection.  I am just concerned  that\r\n\r\nin the situation we are in today, we want to have a nation of IT\r\n\r\nusers  and  teachers must therefore have the utmost  freedom  to\r\n\r\nteach and use facilities that sometimes may not be there,  in  a\r\n\r\nsense  that not all classrooms have online connections  and  not\r\n\r\nall  students  can  afford.  In a print  medium  situation,  the\r\n\r\nstudents  can buy books if more than 5% is used.   But  not  all\r\n\r\nstudents will be able to afford an online connection, especially\r\n\r\none without wires in a classroom situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> His concern is noted. I will discuss it\r\n\r\nwith the Committee.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreally  a  question of balancing.  From the  point  of  view  of\r\n\r\npromoting  the  interests of our educational  institutions,  the\r\n\r\nideal  situation  of course is if they do not  have  to  observe\r\n\r\ncopyright at all!  But we have to balance the interest of  users\r\n\r\nof  copyright in the private sector, individual users, corporate\r\n\r\nusers,  educational users, state users of copyright as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of copyright owners.  This is really the  heart  of\r\n\r\ncopyright  legislation - how do you balance competing  interests\r\n\r\nto  strike  a  balanced regime that promotes  and  protects  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  copyright owners, and at the same  time  does  not\r\n\r\nhinder  the dissemination of knowledge, acquisition of knowledge\r\n\r\nand eventually the advancement of our national interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Prof. S.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Land Surveyors Act was enacted in 1970 to provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  registration of land surveyors  and  to  regulate  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  cadastral survey works in  Singapore.   Cadastral\r\n\r\nsurveys  are  surveys  to  record land  boundaries,  subdivision\r\n\r\nlines, buildings and related details. The Act requires surveyors\r\n\r\nto  be registered with the Land Surveyors Board before they  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to undertake cadastral surveys. However, the  Act  does\r\n\r\nnot require surveyors who undertake non-cadastral surveys to  be\r\n\r\nregistered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-cadastral surveys include topographical, engineering\r\n\r\nand   hydrographic  surveys.   These  surveys  are  related   to\r\n\r\ncadastral  surveys as they share the same set of survey  control\r\n\r\npoints and are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvariably  related to the parcel boundaries. This is especially\r\n\r\nso   with  the  introduction  of  modern  equipment  using   new\r\n\r\ntechnology   such  as  global  positioning  system   (GPS)   and\r\n\r\nInformation   Technology.   These  two  types  of  surveys   are\r\n\r\nincreasingly overlapping in scope.  Surveyors carrying out  non-cadastral  surveys  should  therefore  be  conversant  with  the\r\n\r\ncadastral survey system and practices.  Their surveys will  then\r\n\r\nbe  consistent  with  cadastral survey plans,  thereby  reducing\r\n\r\ninconsistency and errors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as surveyors undertaking non-cadastral surveys\r\n\r\ncurrently  need not register with the Land Surveyors Board,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  cannot  discipline any non-registered  surveyor  for  any\r\n\r\nnegligence  in undertaking non-cadastral survey works.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe   Board   cannot  take  disciplinary  action  even   against\r\n\r\nregistered  surveyors  for any negligence  in  undertaking  non-cadastral  survey  works  as the Act  only  regulates  cadastral\r\n\r\nsurveys.   These  errant  surveyors can  currently  continue  to\r\n\r\nundertake  even  cadastral survey works. Conversely,  registered\r\n\r\nsurveyors  who are suspended from practice by the Land Surveyors\r\n\r\nBoard  can  still undertake non-cadastral survey  works.    This\r\n\r\nsituation is not desirable for the surveying profession.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.17 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will also check the undesirable practice\r\n\r\nof  non-cadastral  survey  works being certified  by  registered\r\n\r\nsurveyors who have not supervised or been involved in the actual\r\n\r\nsurveys.  For example, in April this year, a registered surveyor\r\n\r\nwas  sued for an erroneous setting out survey plan signed by him\r\n\r\nbut  carried out by a surveying technician operating on his own.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, two rows of terrace houses up to roof  level  were\r\n\r\ndemolished.   The  case  was settled out  of  court.   The  Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Board  received a complaint  against  the  registered\r\n\r\nsurveyor  but  could  not act as it was a non-cadastral  survey.\r\n\r\nThis case is bad enough.  Let us not wait for a major\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisaster to happen before doing something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, there is a need to amend the Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Act  to regulate surveyors undertaking  non-cadastral\r\n\r\nsurvey  works.   Clause 9 has the effect of requiring  surveyors\r\n\r\nundertaking  any survey, whether cadastral or non-cadastral,  to\r\n\r\nbe   registered  as  Registered  Surveyors  and  to  hold  valid\r\n\r\npractising certificates.  This will improve the quality of  non-cadastral survey work as all registered surveyors will  have  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  rules made by the Land Surveyors  Board  for  non-cadastral survey work.  Besides upgrading professional standards\r\n\r\nand  ensuring  accountability of all practising surveyors,  thus\r\n\r\npromoting  public interest, this measure will also increase  the\r\n\r\npool of Registered Surveyors.  Sir, indeed, upgrading of skills,\r\n\r\nespecially  professional  expertise,  is  a  fact  of  life   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This happens in other professions too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, rightly so, surveyors registered under the Act\r\n\r\nmust  possess acceptable qualifications specified  in  the  Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Rules.   They must also pass prescribed  examinations\r\n\r\nconducted by the Land Surveyors Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement to register surveyors who undertake non-cadastral surveys will take effect immediately for new entrants\r\n\r\nto  the surveying profession.  For practising surveyors who  are\r\n\r\ncurrently not registered, a 4-year extension will be granted for\r\n\r\nthem to prepare for and pass the prescribed examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the requirement to upgrade and register will mean\r\n\r\nadjustment  on  the part of those affected.   Some  may  not  be\r\n\r\nhappy.   They  include  members  of  the  Society  of  Surveying\r\n\r\nTechnicians.     However,   they,   like   their    professional\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  the  Singapore  Institute  of  Surveyors   and\r\n\r\nValuers,  should  make  the  effort to  upgrade  by  taking  the\r\n\r\nnecessary courses and examinations.  That is why the requirement\r\n\r\nto  register will only take effect in four years' time.  This is\r\n\r\nample time.  For those who have demonstrated that they have made\r\n\r\nthe effort but still fail\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto make the grade within these four years, they can apply to the\r\n\r\nMinister  to extend this grace period for another two years.   I\r\n\r\nwill  move  an amendment to the Bill in the Committee  stage  on\r\n\r\nthis later.  For those surveying technicians who do not have the\r\n\r\nnecessary  academic or professional qualification, I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore Polytechnic is prepared to conduct  a  part-time\r\n\r\nAdvanced  Diploma course to enable them to obtain the  necessary\r\n\r\nacademic qualifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other main amendment is to provide for the\r\n\r\nregistration  of field assistants, renamed assistant  surveyors,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act.  They are also called Surveying Technicians  in\r\n\r\nthe  industry.   In  practice,  field  assistants  making  field\r\n\r\nmeasurements  in  cadastral surveys have been  registered  since\r\n\r\n1972.   This  Bill  makes registration and the Board's  approval\r\n\r\nbefore a registered surveyor can employ an assistant surveyor to\r\n\r\nundertake both cadastral and non-cadastral work a requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field assistants are employed by registered surveyors to\r\n\r\nenter  land and buildings, to demarcate property boundaries  and\r\n\r\nto make and record field measurements.  Such field data are used\r\n\r\nin  survey  computation and plan drawings by office  staff.   As\r\n\r\nfield data are the primary data source of any survey work, field\r\n\r\nassistants  should  possess  prescribed  qualifications  and  be\r\n\r\nregistered  under  the  Land Surveyors Act.   Like  the  earlier\r\n\r\namendment,  this will improve the quality of survey services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 40 out of 400 field assistants provide\r\n\r\nsurveying  services on their own account, independently  of  any\r\n\r\nfirm  of registered surveyors.  As an effect of the Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nrequire  all  forms of survey to be conducted by  or  under  the\r\n\r\nsupervision or direction of a registered surveyor, some of  them\r\n\r\nmay be concerned that their firms would be phased out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MinLaw has taken time to carefully consider this\r\n\r\nconcern.  Here, an important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint  to note is that the Act will not take effect immediately,\r\n\r\nbut  only after four years.  As I had mentioned earlier,  during\r\n\r\nthis  time, field assistants who want to practise on  their  own\r\n\r\nafter   the   transition   period  should   upgrade   themselves\r\n\r\nprofessionally  by taking the part-time Advanced Diploma  course\r\n\r\nat  the  Singapore  Polytechnic.  I  understand  that  the  Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Board  had asked Singapore Polytechnic  to  run  this\r\n\r\ncourse  for  interested field assistants.  It  will  take  about\r\n\r\nthree    years   to  obtain  the  necessary  qualification   for\r\n\r\nregistration.   On top of that, as I mentioned  earlier,  anyone\r\n\r\nwho   despite   good  efforts  fails  to  pass  the   prescribed\r\n\r\nexaminations can apply to the Minister for an extension of up to\r\n\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers has\r\n\r\nbeen  consulted  on these amendments and supports  them.   Major\r\n\r\nusers of non-cadastral surveys such as MINDEF, HDB and JTC  also\r\n\r\nsupport the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment brings the practice of land surveyors in\r\n\r\nline  with  all the other professionals like the architects  and\r\n\r\nengineers.  In the past, architects and engineers used  to  have\r\n\r\ntwo  different  classes.  They used to have Class  2  registered\r\n\r\narchitects who consist primarily of those who have worked in the\r\n\r\nprofession mainly as draughtsmen for many years.  They have  not\r\n\r\ngone  through  any  formal training but have  gained  sufficient\r\n\r\nknowledge and experience to undertake simple architectural work.\r\n\r\nAt  that  time,  building  projects were  relatively  small  and\r\n\r\nsimple.  But as Singapore progresses and becomes a global  city,\r\n\r\nbuilding  projects become larger, in terms of size  as  well  as\r\n\r\ncomplexity.  The demand and standard of architectural works have\r\n\r\nalso  become  higher  and higher.  As a result,  this  class  of\r\n\r\narchitects  has slowly been phased out and the registration  for\r\n\r\narchitects is now only confined to architects who are graduates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom accredited universities with sufficient experience and have\r\n\r\npassed  a professional practice examination.  Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\ntimely  for the land surveyors, whether they do title survey  or\r\n\r\nnon-title survey, to be subject to the same regulatory standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As building projects become more and more complex, the\r\n\r\nskills  and experience of surveyors doing non-cadastral  surveys\r\n\r\nare  just  as  demanding,  if not more than  cadastral  surveys,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the magnitude of the project size.  For example,  a\r\n\r\nmistake in the setting out of a building, whether in the  siting\r\n\r\nor, more critically, in the dimension, will create serious legal\r\n\r\nand financial consequences.  The mistake, quoted by the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State,  on the erroneous survey of the two rows  of  terrace\r\n\r\nhouses will be pale in comparison to the mistake made on a high-rise multi-million dollar project.  The amount of money involved\r\n\r\nwould be enormous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is argued that, in cases like this, there is recourse\r\n\r\nfor  the aggrieved party to turn to common law.  However,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom   the  legal  dispute,  there  is  also  the  question   of\r\n\r\nprofessional   liability  and  accountability  for   negligence.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  important that all practising  surveyors  be\r\n\r\ngoverned   by   a   regulatory   board   that   oversees   these\r\n\r\npractitioners, similar to that of the architects and  engineers.\r\n\r\nLike  any other such changes, there will be people who would  be\r\n\r\naffected  in  the  transition.  I am glad that the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState is moving an amendment to allow those who are caught,  ie,\r\n\r\nthose  without sufficient qualification, to seek an  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  themselves  so  that  they  can  be  qualified  for\r\n\r\nregistration.   The present surveying course in  the  university\r\n\r\nwill  only require four years to complete.  Therefore, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  those  experienced practitioners in the present  surveying\r\n\r\nfirms  would have the necessary experience and skills to upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves and be able to pass the prescribed examination  after\r\n\r\nattending  the  three-year part-time courses  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad that the Singapore Polytechnic has provided\r\n\r\nthis part-time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAdvanced  Diploma course to cater to these surveyors.   However,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  Minister of State's explanation, I  am  still  not\r\n\r\nconvinced   by  the  provision  in  clause  16A  that  assistant\r\n\r\nsurveyors  must be approved by the Board before they  are  being\r\n\r\nemployed.   As registered architects and engineers  assume  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  all their undertakings,  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nexecuted  by them personally or with the help of their assistant\r\n\r\narchitects  or engineers, and whose employment does not  require\r\n\r\napproval  from  their respective Boards even  though  they  also\r\n\r\nperform  field work on behalf of the professionals, why then  is\r\n\r\napproval  from  the  Land Surveyors Board be  required  for  the\r\n\r\nemployment of assistant surveyors?  I hope the Minister of State\r\n\r\ncan further comment on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I\r\n\r\nshall  be very brief.  The Minister has pointed out the need  to\r\n\r\nhave  this Bill.  I am glad that this Bill will help in  raising\r\n\r\nthe standards of land surveyors in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in countries like Singapore, with its small size and\r\n\r\nvery  densely built, it is important that land surveyors have  a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard, like the other professions.  I am very  relieved\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister of State has also assured that those who  are\r\n\r\ncaught in the transitional period will be given a further chance\r\n\r\nof another two years because somebody has written to some of the\r\n\r\nMPs here.  And I am glad that the Minister has acceded to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law will require every land surveyor to be\r\n\r\nregistered.  It will prevent any person from being employed as a\r\n\r\nregistered  surveyor  or  an  assistant  surveyor  without   the\r\n\r\napproval  from  the  Board.   This  is  very  important.    Most\r\n\r\nprofessional bodies require certain registration and I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat this provision will help in lifting the standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would urge the Land Surveyors Board to do is to\r\n\r\nhave  courses conducted from time to time, just like the medical\r\n\r\nand  legal professions are doing. It is important for us to have\r\n\r\nregistered surveyors.  It is very important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor us in Singapore to improve ourselves by attending courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I support in principle the Land Surveyors (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  basically  aims to raise professional  standards  of  all\r\n\r\nworks performed by the land surveyors in Singapore.  This is  in\r\n\r\nline  with  our current efforts to achieve world-class standards\r\n\r\nof service in all our institutions to maintain our international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in our keenness to introduce legislative changes\r\n\r\nto  achieve  a  higher standard of practice  and  service  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular industry, due consideration must also be given to the\r\n\r\ninterest  and  welfare  of the existing  service  providers  and\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have  contributed to the growth of  the  industry.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not only to avoid or reduce undue hardships  to  those\r\n\r\nadversely  affected by the legislative changes of  the  industry\r\n\r\nbut  also  to help them to accept and adapt to these changes  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can continue with their service and contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment to the Land Surveyors Act, all land\r\n\r\nsurveyors including those who do not conduct cadastral  surveys,\r\n\r\nwill  be  required to be registered under the  Act.   Currently,\r\n\r\nonly  land  surveyors who conduct cadastral surveys need  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered.   The  existing definition of  \"cadastral  services\"\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Land Surveyors Act (Chapter 156) would be  rendered\r\n\r\nobsolete,  and  the  amendment would then be applicable  to  all\r\n\r\ntypes  of survey services.  Directly affected by this new ruling\r\n\r\nwould be those surveyors who may have a track record of relevant\r\n\r\nand  time-tested  surveying experience, but lack  the  requisite\r\n\r\nprofessional qualification to register themselves with the  Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Board  in  order to enable  them  to  continue  their\r\n\r\npractice in the surveying industry.  Under the new ruling,  even\r\n\r\nthe registered surveyors would also not be able to employ any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassistant  surveyor unless the Land Surveyors Board is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the  person  to  be  employed  as  an  assistant  surveyor\r\n\r\npossesses the necessary qualifications recognised by the  Board.\r\n\r\nThese  constitute substantial changes from the current  industry\r\n\r\npractice  and  require careful thought especially  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntheir impact on both the service providers and the end-users  of\r\n\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would therefore like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he could provide statistics on the  number  of\r\n\r\nnon-registered  surveyors and assistant surveyors  who  will  be\r\n\r\nadversely affected by these legislative changes and what sort of\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  being taken to help those surveying professionals\r\n\r\nadapt  to these changes so that they can continue their practice\r\n\r\nto make useful contributions and earn a living in their field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  studied  the  supply  side of the surveying  profession  in\r\n\r\nintroducing  such  a  legislative change.  Is  there  already  a\r\n\r\nshortage of qualified professional surveyors to meet the growing\r\n\r\nindustrial  needs?   Moreover, I wish to  ask  whether  the  new\r\n\r\nrestriction  will lead to a severe shortage of  supply,  thereby\r\n\r\nhindering  the  construction work and increasing the  price  and\r\n\r\ncost of the surveying works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 does provide a transitional provision, whereby\r\n\r\nall  land  surveyors who conduct surveys, other  than  cadastral\r\n\r\nsurveys, be permitted to engage in carrying out such surveys for\r\n\r\na period of four years from the date of commencement of the Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  (Amendment) Act 1999.  However,  in  my  opinion,  an\r\n\r\ninterim  period of four years may be insufficient for  the  land\r\n\r\nsurveyors who are currently not registered surveyors to  prepare\r\n\r\nthemselves for the new industrial criteria.  I am however,  very\r\n\r\npleased  to  note the latest amendment in the Bill which  states\r\n\r\nthat upon receipt of application filed before the expiry of  the\r\n\r\nfour-year  period,  the  Minister  would  consider  granting  an\r\n\r\nextension to the original transitional period of four  years  by\r\n\r\nanother two years, and making it six years in total.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I fully advocate the\r\n\r\nrationale for upholding the excellent service standards  in  the\r\n\r\nland  surveying  business, especially  in  Singapore's  service-oriented  economy, we must also ensure that those  who  will  be\r\n\r\nadversely  affected  will be given the necessary  assistance  to\r\n\r\nadapt  to  the  changes, and that the costs of  delivering  such\r\n\r\nservices are kept competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill as\r\n\r\namended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to associate myself with some of\r\n\r\nthe  comments made by NMP, Mr Tay Beng Chuan, just before me and\r\n\r\nI will try not to repeat the points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that clearly in this time of economic crisis, we\r\n\r\nhave  two  quite  different  but intertwining  concerns  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy  as a whole.  First is to  help  people  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood and the second is to upgrade to be  ready  for\r\n\r\nthe  new competition.  In this broader context, I find that  the\r\n\r\nBill  makes sense.  It does affect existing people.  It  affects\r\n\r\nthe  surveying technicians which others have spoken  about.   It\r\n\r\nmakes them unable to continue their practice as individual shops\r\n\r\nor  their  own businesses in non-title surveys.   And therefore,\r\n\r\nit  does  affect  their livelihood.  These are  a  small  but  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  number of sometimes very experienced individuals  who\r\n\r\nknow the ground well and who know their work.  And they have, in\r\n\r\nthat  sense, a legitimate concern.  In particular, one of  their\r\n\r\nconcerns  is  that  legislation seems  to  go  beyond  what  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  and UK requirements are as regards surveys  and  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of surveyors.  If I could invite the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  to  comment on that.  If that is so, why is it  necessary\r\n\r\nfor Singapore to go beyond the Australian and UK requirements?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, while we are affecting the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  this  small but  necessary group, as I mentioned, the  other\r\n\r\nimpulse  and  requirement in Singapore's drive to become  world-class  is to upgrade to be competitive.  And here, I think  that\r\n\r\nwe should, in principle, support\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  registration and on improvements.   The  Minister\r\n\r\nwithout  Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon Heng said it  quite  well  in  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.   He  said  that our degrees are in a  way  time-barred.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not a guarantee of perpetual employment or  perpetual\r\n\r\nrelevance to the economy that is emerging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, the push for upgrading is the correct one.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  then  need is to assist people who want to  make  that\r\n\r\nupgrade,  that  is,  to make that possible  for  them  with  the\r\n\r\nminimum  disruption. There would, of course, be  disruption  and\r\n\r\nnot everyone would be happy to have his or her normal livelihood\r\n\r\nand  normal  way of life disrupted.  But I think the  amendments\r\n\r\nproposed  by the Minister of State - to have a time period  upon\r\n\r\napplication,  possibly  six years, and  the  new  course  to  be\r\n\r\nconducted  by  the polytechnics for the advanced diploma  -  are\r\n\r\nnecessary and sufficient.  But there is another hurdle of course\r\n\r\nafter that.  After the qualifications, there would still be  the\r\n\r\nexaminations  set  by  the Board and  I  would  ask  that  these\r\n\r\nexaminations be fair and foster suitable standards,  given  that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be in some ways a larger variation of quality  and\r\n\r\nqualifications of people coming into the examinations.  That  is\r\n\r\nto  say,  in  the past where it was mainly people of  university\r\n\r\ndegrees who sat for the examinations and only a small number  of\r\n\r\nthem  qualified,  we are going to have examinations  set  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  candidates without university degrees and,  instead,\r\n\r\nwith advanced diplomas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort of the Minister to accommodate these changes is\r\n\r\na  very  good  one  and  shows that the Ministry  is  trying  to\r\n\r\naccommodate differences.  This is not to preserve a monopoly  of\r\n\r\na  small clique, either the existing technicians or the existing\r\n\r\nsurveyors.  I think we must agree that a closed shop  in  either\r\n\r\nsense  would be a bad thing for the construction and development\r\n\r\nindustry  of Singapore and Singapore as a whole.  Only  a  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people  benefit from a closed  shop.   We  would  be\r\n\r\nbenefiting  if  we  were to professionalise in  a  way  that  is\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and allows the pool of professional  and  qualified\r\n\r\npeople to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincreased  and  to  give the existing technicians  a  chance  to\r\n\r\ncompete on fair and even terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, may I declare my\r\n\r\ninterest   as  an  employee  in  a  construction  and   property\r\n\r\ndevelopment  company which would have, on many  occasions,  used\r\n\r\nthe  services of these surveyors and, in fact, our own staff  do\r\n\r\nperform  non-cadastral  surveys and  they  are  unregistered  at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to thank the Minister of State for his\r\n\r\nexplanation.   In  particular,  I  really  want  to  thank   the\r\n\r\narrangement  that  his  Ministry has  made  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  for  the  advanced  diploma  course  and  also  the\r\n\r\nadditional amendment to extend the period from four to six years\r\n\r\nupon application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I fully agree with the need to register\r\n\r\npractitioners  in this profession for the reasons  mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State.  However, my apprehension is not in  the\r\n\r\nneed  to register but in the method of registration.  Right now,\r\n\r\nthe amendment as it is requires these people to be registered as\r\n\r\nassistants  of  currently  registered surveyors  or  people  who\r\n\r\nqualify  under current standards to be registered with the  Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Board.   I  understand that  though  there  are  more\r\n\r\nregistered   surveyors,  actually  the  number   of   registered\r\n\r\nsurveyors    currently   practising,   that   means    providing\r\n\r\nprofessional services for a fee, is only about 20.   This  means\r\n\r\nthat there is a possibility that if we cannot get more into  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  we  might end up a closed shop and a very uncompetitive\r\n\r\nmarket situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like the Minister of State to assure this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  if  such a situation arises, he  would  change  the\r\n\r\nmethod of registration to, for example, having a second registry\r\n\r\nfor non-cadastral surveys or even certain types of non-cadastral\r\n\r\nsurveys.  Then at least these people who perform the simpler non-cadastral surveys can be registered in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  own names and probably maybe different standards be  set.\r\n\r\nBut  of  course,  they  cannot do the more complicated  or  more\r\n\r\ncomplex  tasks  and  also certainly not the title  or  cadastral\r\n\r\nsurveys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, at least there would be sufficient\r\n\r\npractitioners   in   the   market  to  provide   a   competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment. The reason that I am asking for this is that survey\r\n\r\nwork is a whole range of very simple surveys to very complicated\r\n\r\nsurveys.   It  is not like architectural work where the  minimum\r\n\r\nstandard  involved is relatively much higher.  But  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrange.   For  example, in the construction company that  I  work\r\n\r\nfor,  we  do a lot of very simple non-cadastral surveys on  site\r\n\r\nand these are done by our own professionals. They could be civil\r\n\r\nor  structural engineers, and they can do this. It is  not  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot do it.  Of course, the starting point is  that  the\r\n\r\nproper   cadastral   survey  is  done  by  a  fully   registered\r\n\r\nprofessional.  But from the reference points, it is  really  not\r\n\r\ndifficult for somebody who is trained in engineering to do  very\r\n\r\nsimple surveys within the site.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, once you remove the word \"cadastral\" from the Act, as\r\n\r\nit  is the intention of the amendment, then the question arises:\r\n\r\nwould  this type of very simple non-cadastral surveys be  caught\r\n\r\nnow  by the legislation?  Does this mean that anybody doing this\r\n\r\ntype  of work, whether the person is providing a service  for  a\r\n\r\nfee or whether the person is doing it as a staff of, let us say,\r\n\r\na  construction company has to be registered?  Would the current\r\n\r\nengineers  that are doing it now, where they actually  are  very\r\n\r\nfully competent to do it, have to be registered too?  And if so,\r\n\r\nwould they have to take any additional examinations because,  as\r\n\r\nI  said, these are all very simple survey works and anybody with\r\n\r\nsome  understanding of simple engineering skills should be  able\r\n\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like the Minister of State to\r\n\r\nconfirm   that   the   registration  only   applies   to   those\r\n\r\nprofessionals offering professional services for a fee and  they\r\n\r\ndo  not apply to staff of companies that actually do such simple\r\n\r\nsurveys for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  company.  May I give an analogy that if a doctor were  to\r\n\r\nprescribe medicine for somebody, even if it is a matter of  just\r\n\r\na  panadol  pill,  then obviously, he needs to be  a  registered\r\n\r\npractitioner.   But  if  I feel sick, and  on  my  own,  I  take\r\n\r\npanadol, it is self-medication.  Certainly, I do not need to  be\r\n\r\na  registered  doctor to prescribe panadol for myself.   So,  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  it  is the same thing.  If  I  ask  somebody  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  non-cadastral survey for me,  then  I  am  asking  a\r\n\r\nprofessional  for his services.  Then he should  be  registered.\r\n\r\nBut  if  one of my staff, for example, were to do a simple  non-cadastral survey on my construction site, then it is as if  that\r\n\r\nthe  company  is prescribing self-medication. I would  certainly\r\n\r\nlike  the Minister of State to confirm that there is no need  to\r\n\r\nregister such persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to reiterate, I support the intent of the Bill to\r\n\r\nregister  all those who provide professional surveying services.\r\n\r\nI  am  only concerned with the implementation of the intent.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  hope  that  should the implementation  be  less  than\r\n\r\nsatisfactory,  the  Minister of State  or  his  successor  would\r\n\r\npresent another amendment Bill to this House at a future date.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I rise to express the concern of\r\n\r\nthe  Society of Surveying Technicians.  I believe they have also\r\n\r\nwritten  to  other Members of this House and most of the  points\r\n\r\nhave  been  raised by speakers before me.  But I  just  wish  to\r\n\r\nraise three points with the Minister.  Firstly, I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether the cost of surveys would increase because of this\r\n\r\namendment Bill, as the number of survey firms would be limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like the Minister of State to assure this\r\n\r\nHouse  that the existing practitioners would not be at the mercy\r\n\r\nof  the  registered surveyors after the Act is amended.  Because\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, as it is now, requires them to be registered with the\r\n\r\nregistered  surveyors as assistant surveyors.  It  seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat it is all under the registered surveyors' power or they are\r\n\r\nat  their  mercy.  The market talk has been that the  registered\r\n\r\nsurveyors are waiting for money to come, because they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  bound to make a lot of money as they will be the only  ones\r\n\r\nwho  will be able to practise when the amendment Bill comes into\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like the Minister to consider a suggestion\r\n\r\nwhich was made by Mr Heng Chiang Meng.  Is it possible for us to\r\n\r\nhave  different classes of surveyors, instead of just registered\r\n\r\nsurveyors  that encompass everything?  Like in other trades,  we\r\n\r\nhave  technicians,  electricians and we also  have  professional\r\n\r\nelectrical   engineers.    There  are   different   classes   of\r\n\r\nprofessionals.   Is  it  possible to consider  having  different\r\n\r\nclasses of surveyors doing different types of surveys?  They can\r\n\r\nregister directly with the board and practise, and they  can  do\r\n\r\nwhatever submissions that are needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank all the speakers\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken.  The different speakers who have spoken  have\r\n\r\ninjected various viewpoints to the discussion, some of which  we\r\n\r\nhave considered carefully after receiving representations.  What\r\n\r\nI want to say at the outset is that, as captured very poignantly\r\n\r\nby Mr Kenneth Chen and also repeated by Mr Simon Tay and others,\r\n\r\nthe  key  objectives of the amendments are, firstly, to  promote\r\n\r\naccountability  of surveyors.  Currently the  situation  is  not\r\n\r\ntenable, because there are people doing non-cadastral works  who\r\n\r\nare not accountable to the Land Surveyors Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, promote public safety and interest. Mr Chen, who\r\n\r\nis  an  architect, brings this up very well, that  as  Singapore\r\n\r\nprogresses in terms of  building styles and complexity, there is\r\n\r\na need to upgrade our surveyors.  Apparently simple mistakes can\r\n\r\nresult  in enormous losses.  And the example I gave in my speech\r\n\r\nillustrates this point, where two rows of shophouses had  to  be\r\n\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should start my speech on this point - the basic\r\n\r\nobjectives of the Bill.  Having said this, I want to debunk  any\r\n\r\nallegation  that this Bill is to protect those who  are  already\r\n\r\nregistered.  This is related to what Mr Tay Beng Chuan has said.\r\n\r\nHe asked whether the amendments\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  result in a shortage of registered surveyors.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe intent of this Bill is to require all professional surveyors\r\n\r\nwho   are  offering  survey  works  of  whatever  form,  whether\r\n\r\ncadastral or non-cadastral, to register.  Currently, only  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  doing  survey  works of the  cadastral  type  need  to\r\n\r\nregister.   There  are currently about 30 of  such  unregistered\r\n\r\nprofessional surveyors offering non-cadastral survey works,  who\r\n\r\nare  not  yet  registered, which means that they  will  have  to\r\n\r\nregister.    What  they  will  do  is  to  take  the   necessary\r\n\r\nexaminations.   They  will  also  familiarise  themselves   with\r\n\r\ncadastral  work,  and  then  they  will  register.   They   will\r\n\r\ntherefore  add  to  the  50-odd  registered  surveyors  who  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  on the register, so that there will in fact  be  more\r\n\r\nprofessional surveyors.  That is the first point.  This will not\r\n\r\nreduce the pool but will increase the pool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of this is that these amendments will\r\n\r\nindeed  give  impetus to field assistants to register.   In  the\r\n\r\nAct,  they are renamed \"Assistant Surveyors\" and called  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry \"Surveying Technicians\".  The impetus will be there for\r\n\r\nthem  also to register, particularly those who want to  practise\r\n\r\non  their own.  As I have said in my speech, there are about 400\r\n\r\nsuch  field assistants currently.  In fact, many will  be  quite\r\n\r\ncontent with doing what they are doing now.  They are working in\r\n\r\nGovernment departments and statutory boards, or they are working\r\n\r\nas  field assistants for registered surveyors and they are quite\r\n\r\nhappy   doing  that.   So  they  will  not  want  to  take   the\r\n\r\nexaminations   to  upgrade  themselves  to  become  professional\r\n\r\nsurveyors.  But there will be some who will rise to the occasion\r\n\r\nand  indeed these surveying technicians who have been  operating\r\n\r\non  their own, if they still want to continue operating on their\r\n\r\nown, then it is quite likely that they will take the route which\r\n\r\nis  open  to them.  The Singapore Polytechnic is organising  the\r\n\r\nadvanced diploma course for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news for Mr Simon Tay is that the Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic is working towards a situation where they will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincorporate  the examinations which normally the surveyors  will\r\n\r\ntake  at the end into the course.  Because it is a part-time  3-year course, it will be comprehensive enough to also incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  legislation examination and the field work aspect into  the\r\n\r\ncourse.   I do not think it has been finalised yet, but I  think\r\n\r\nthey  are  working towards that, so that it will  actually  give\r\n\r\nincentive for those who want to continue providing survey  works\r\n\r\non  their  own to register.  This is an important point  because\r\n\r\nthis will in fact give the impetus, not only for upgrading,  but\r\n\r\nfor  more  to become registered.  Hence, we will have  a  larger\r\n\r\npool  of  people  offering  a higher quality  of  work,  thereby\r\n\r\nenhancing competition and keeping costs competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main point is the point that Mr Heng Chiang Meng\r\n\r\nmakes,  where he talks about the large variety of survey  works.\r\n\r\nHe  asks  whether  or not a separate register can  be  kept  for\r\n\r\npeople  who  want to do simple survey works.  I  should,  first,\r\n\r\nclarify that there are two registration exercises.  The first is\r\n\r\nto be registered as professional surveyors, and the other one is\r\n\r\nregistration as field assistants for those who are  working  for\r\n\r\nor  employed by registered surveyors.  That is how the amendment\r\n\r\nBill is structured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen realises this, because under the new\r\n\r\nsection  16A,  all registered surveyors who  want to  engage  or\r\n\r\nemploy  field  assistants will need approval of the  Board,  and\r\n\r\nthereafter a register is kept for them.  Mr Chen asked why  this\r\n\r\nneeds  to be so.  I have mentioned in my speech the reasons  why\r\n\r\nthis  has to be so, because these field assistants are the  ones\r\n\r\nwho actually do the field work on the ground.  And in the nature\r\n\r\nof  the  profession, they work very much on their own, no  doubt\r\n\r\nunder the direction and supervision of the registered surveyors,\r\n\r\nbut  the registered surveyors cannot be there all the time.  The\r\n\r\ndata  that they collect on the field is very important.  It will\r\n\r\nbe the original source data based on which the office staff will\r\n\r\ndo  the computation and draw up the field plans.  So there is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to ensure that field assistants are of a certain standard.\r\n\r\nHaving  said  this,  here  the standards  will  not  be  raised.\r\n\r\nRegistration for field assistants doing cadastral\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork  has  been  required since 1972.  So  it  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nextending  it now to field assistants doing non-cadastral  work.\r\n\r\nThe requirements are quite basic  -  a diploma in surveying work\r\n\r\nfrom  the polytechnic.  If not, then they need to pass a  course\r\n\r\nin  cadastral  survey  conducted by the Singapore  Institute  of\r\n\r\nSurveyors and Valuers.  These are not overly strict requirements\r\n\r\nfor field assistants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether, in Singapore, we are running\r\n\r\nahead  of other countries.  In fact, we are not the only country\r\n\r\ndoing this.  Our system is quite close to the Australian system,\r\n\r\nand there are three states in Australia which also regulate both\r\n\r\ncadastral and non-cadastral surveys.  Having said this, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  need  not be apologetic that we are progressive.  As Members\r\n\r\nhave  quite rightly captured the spirit here, the fact is  that,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, we are land scarce and high density, and we  have\r\n\r\nlittle   room  for  error  in  the  positioning  of   buildings,\r\n\r\nstructures in our estates and infrastructural developments.   As\r\n\r\nhas  been  said,  the  cost of remedying  such  defects  can  be\r\n\r\nenormous.   I  think  what we are doing is  justified,  more  so\r\n\r\nbecause of the increasing overlapping between cadastral work and\r\n\r\nnon-cadastral work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the old days, we could have people say, \"I just do\r\n\r\nnon-cadastral work.\"  But with the advent of modern  technology,\r\n\r\neg,  the  Global  Positioning System (GPS), the  use  of  modern\r\n\r\nequipment, the overlap is becoming increasingly large.  There is\r\n\r\nindeed  a need for those who do non-cadastral work to also  know\r\n\r\nabout cadastral work and what it entails.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point addresses Mr Heng's question. He has asked\r\n\r\nwhether we are going to make further amendments to the  Act.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not think we want to have a separate register for people who\r\n\r\nsay  that they are doing simple works.   What I can ask the Land\r\n\r\nSurveyors  Board  to  consider is to see,  without  jeopardising\r\n\r\npublic  interest and safety, for these very simple  minor  works\r\n\r\nwhich  do  not  require certification by a registered  surveyor,\r\n\r\nmaybe  levelling of drains and so forth, whether or not we could\r\n\r\nprovide an exemption from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Land Surveyors Act for these simple works.  But I think this\r\n\r\nis something that I cannot give an assurance now.  It is an idea\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Heng has suggested which the Land Surveyors Board  can\r\n\r\nstudy,  because  under the Act, the Minister,  if  he  deems  it\r\n\r\nsuitable,  can  make an exemption.  But the important  point  is\r\n\r\nthat public safety must not be jeopardised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed all the points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, will the cost of surveys go up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I have mentioned just now that\r\n\r\nthe  amendment will result in more surveyors entering the  field\r\n\r\nand providing quality survey work.  So with more surveyors doing\r\n\r\nthe  work, cost will be kept competitive.  Nobody can assure you\r\n\r\nthat  cost will not go up or cost may go down.  I think it is  a\r\n\r\nfunction of the marketplace.  What we can say is that it is  not\r\n\r\na monopoly or closed-shop situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister of\r\n\r\nState has answered my question regarding those people doing very\r\n\r\nsimple, non-cadastral work, not as professional services, but as\r\n\r\nstaff  members;  for example, as the engineer in a  construction\r\n\r\ncompany  doing  work  within its own construction  site.   These\r\n\r\npeople  are not providing professional services.  But as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, these people are doing some simple work, for example, some\r\n\r\nmeasurements  here and there from certain reference  points,  as\r\n\r\npart  of  their  job.  Under the present definition,  these  are\r\n\r\nactually survey works.  I am trying to say that for this type of\r\n\r\nwork you do not need a registered surveyor to do it.

The refinements include extending the tax exemption\r\n\r\nto  include  non-residents who have permanent establishments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, provided that such non-residents do not purchase  the\r\n\r\nsecurities  using  funds  from  Singapore  operations,  and  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the 'Approved Bond Intermediary' (ABI)  scheme.\r\n\r\nUnder  the ABI scheme, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\r\n\r\nwill  evaluate  a  financial institution's debt origination  and\r\n\r\ntrading capabilities in Singapore on an overall basis.   Once  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  institution has been awarded  ABI  status,  all  debt\r\n\r\nsecurities  lead managed by it would be treated  as  'qualifying\r\n\r\ndebt  securities'  and there would be no  need  for  an  ABI  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy,  on  a transaction-by-transaction basis,  the  test  of\r\n\r\n'substantial  arrangement in Singapore'.  Clauses  5,19  and  21\r\n\r\namend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also announced the introduction of an automated procedure\r\n\r\nfor the existing Tax Exemption Scheme for Syndicated Facilities.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  give  arrangers upfront  certainty  on  whether  a\r\n\r\nfacility  qualifies  for tax exemption.  Clause  16  amends  the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to locate and perform their\r\n\r\nheadquarters functions in Singapore to service network companies\r\n\r\nworldwide,   I   announced   tax   exemption   for   Operational\r\n\r\nHeadquarters  which  perform  at least  one  substantive  global\r\n\r\nfunction  in Singapore.  This change takes effect from  Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 2000.   Clause 18 amends the relevant section of  the\r\n\r\nAct for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage finance companies to build up their level of\r\n\r\ngeneral  provisions  further  and thus  strengthen  the  overall\r\n\r\nsoundness  of  the  financial system, I had announced  that  the\r\n\r\nannual limits on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntax  deductions for general provision of finance companies  will\r\n\r\nbe temporarily suspended for two years.  Also, the overall limit\r\n\r\non  tax  deductions for general provisions of finance  companies\r\n\r\nwill  be  raised to 3% of qualifying assets. These  changes  are\r\n\r\neffective  from  Year of Assessment 1999. Clause  9  amends  the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support Singapore's drive towards higher value-added\r\n\r\nactivities in the shipping sector, I announced the extension  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing Approved International Shipping Enterprise  Scheme\r\n\r\nto   cover   income  derived  from  the  operation  of  Floating\r\n\r\nProduction  Storage  Offloading  vessel  and  Floating   Storage\r\n\r\nOffloading vessel (or FPSO/FSO) in Singapore.  This change takes\r\n\r\neffect  from  Year of Assessment 2000.  Clauses 3,  5(b)  and  6\r\n\r\namend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had announced the extension of the One-Year Accelerated\r\n\r\nDepreciation Allowance Scheme to the purchase of new  commercial\r\n\r\ngoods  vehicles  and  buses to replace an existing  old  diesel-driven vehicle which was registered before 1st January 1991, and\r\n\r\nwhich  either  has at least one year of valid  COE  left  or  is\r\n\r\neligible for COE renewal.  Clause 13 amends the relevant section\r\n\r\nof the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more financial institutions to take on the\r\n\r\nrole  of  Singapore Government Securities (SGS) Primary  Dealers\r\n\r\nand  to  provide a significant incentive commensurate  with  the\r\n\r\nobligations  undertaken by SGS Primary Dealers, I announced  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  on  the  income derived by SGS Primary  Dealers  from\r\n\r\ntrading  in  SGS.   Clauses 19(b) and 19(d) amend  the  relevant\r\n\r\nsections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax changes not announced in the 1999 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the other tax changes, which had not\r\n\r\nbeen announced in the 1999 Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to the Special Allowance for\r\n\r\nHotel Refurbishment announced last June as part of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npackage of off-Budget measures, to encourage hotel operators  to\r\n\r\nrefurbish  their premises during the lull period.  Clause  10(a)\r\n\r\nintroduces a new section 14M to grant approved hotel owners  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction of up to 150% of qualifying expenditure incurred on or\r\n\r\nafter 1st July 1998 on the refurbishment of their hotels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change pertains to the payment of upfront\r\n\r\nland  premium  introduced by JTC and HDB.  To  assist  companies\r\n\r\nimprove  their  competitiveness, JTC and HDB  have  allowed  its\r\n\r\nlessees to opt for an upfront land premium for the entire tenure\r\n\r\nof  the land.  Under existing tax rules, such premium would  not\r\n\r\nbe tax deductible nor would it qualify for tax depreciation.  To\r\n\r\nprovide  that  lessees would not be worse-off tax-wise  if  they\r\n\r\nwere  to opt to pay land premium upfront, a new section  14N  is\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  extend  tax deduction  to  the  amortisation  of\r\n\r\nupfront  land premium paid by JTC and HDB lessees for industrial\r\n\r\nland  leases  of less than 30 years.  Clause 10(b) introduces  a\r\n\r\nnew section 14N for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase companies' ability to adjust their equity base\r\n\r\nand debt-equity ratio, and improve companies' return on capital,\r\n\r\nthe  Companies  Act has been amended to allow companies  to  buy\r\n\r\nback  their  ordinary shares using their distributable  profits.\r\n\r\nIn  tandem with this, the Income Tax Act needs to be amended  to\r\n\r\nprovide for the tax treatment of share buybacks, such that share\r\n\r\nbuybacks  or  capital  reduction made out of  profits  would  be\r\n\r\ntreated  tax-wise as a dividend distribution.  The treatment  of\r\n\r\nreceipts from buybacks in the hands of shareholders will  depend\r\n\r\non  the mode of share buyback.  For example, in a normal \"market\r\n\r\npurchase\" where it is not possible for the companies to identify\r\n\r\nthe shareholders from whom they are buying back the shares, what\r\n\r\nthe shareholders receive on the disposal of their shares will be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  sales proceeds, like any other disposal which  they\r\n\r\nmake on the stock exchange, and not a receipt of dividends.  The\r\n\r\nshareholders will not be taxed on the sales proceeds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunless  they are assessable to tax on profits from the  sale  of\r\n\r\nshares.   Neither will they receive any tax credits.   The  same\r\n\r\ntax   treatment   will  also  apply  to  selective   \"off-market\r\n\r\npurchases\" as well as share redemption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4(b) and 4(c) amend the relevant sections of the\r\n\r\nAct  to  provide for the tax treatment of payments made pursuant\r\n\r\nto  buyback  of  shares, capital reductions  and  redemption  of\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, companies have also requested the Stock Exchange of\r\n\r\nSingapore  allow for \"market purchases\" through special  trading\r\n\r\ncounters,  which  will allow listed companies  to  identify  the\r\n\r\nshareholders from whom they are buying back the shares.  I  note\r\n\r\nthat transactions through special trading counters could provide\r\n\r\nconsiderable room for tax arbitrages and abuses.  These  include\r\n\r\nrisk-free  arbitrages,  artificial  arrangements  with   low-tax\r\n\r\npersons  to  transact  in  shares through  the  special  trading\r\n\r\ncounters  to maximise tax refunds, as well as the room available\r\n\r\nto those trading in shares to tax plan or arbitrage arising from\r\n\r\ntheir  ability  to  deduct the cost of  their  shares  from  the\r\n\r\nreceipts  for shares sold through the special trading  counters.\r\n\r\nThis  concern of tax abuse has in fact also been highlighted  in\r\n\r\nthe  media.  To prevent revenue leakage through such abuses, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance  and  IRAS will  be  studying  the  issues\r\n\r\nthoroughly   before  share  buybacks  through  Special   Trading\r\n\r\nCounters may be allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change pertains to the existing tax incentive\r\n\r\nfor SIMEX members.  At present, SIMEX members who trade with non-residents  are granted a concessionary tax rate of 10%  on  such\r\n\r\ntrading income.  Clause 17 amends the Act to make clear that the\r\n\r\ntax  concession is also applicable to transactions made by SIMEX\r\n\r\nmembers  with Approved Fund Managers acting on behalf  of  their\r\n\r\nnon-resident clients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change deals with the tax treatment of cars.\r\n\r\nIn  tandem  with  the  Land  Transport Authority's  vehicle  tax\r\n\r\nrationalisation exercise in March 1998,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges  were  made to the tax treatment pertaining  to  company\r\n\r\ncars,   rental  cars  and  motor  cars  used  for  instructional\r\n\r\npurposes.  Clauses 4(a), 7(c), 11(a), 11(b), 12 and 14 amend the\r\n\r\nrelevant sections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 10% corporate tax rebate for the Year of Assessment 1999\r\n\r\nwas  announced as part of the cost-cutting package  in  November\r\n\r\nlast year.  Clause 24 amends the relevant section of the Act for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change pertains to the 10% cut in employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution with effect from 1st January 1999,  which  was\r\n\r\nannounced  as  part  of the cost-cutting measures  announced  in\r\n\r\nNovember  1998.   Arising  from the  cut  in  CPF  contribution,\r\n\r\nclauses  7(a) and 7(b) amend the Act accordingly to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nmaximum deduction allowable for employer's contribution to  CPF,\r\n\r\nor any designated pension or provident fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last change pertains to Non-Tax Assessment. Currently,\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller of Income Tax issues a notice of assessment only\r\n\r\nto  taxpayers who have been assessed positively to tax.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  where an assessment does not give rise to any tax payable,\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller would only issue a letter (rather than a notice)\r\n\r\nof  non-tax  computation to the taxpayer.  The taxpayer  is  not\r\n\r\nrequired  to  object  within 30 days to the  letter  of  non-tax\r\n\r\nassessment  if  he disagrees with the computation.   The  6-year\r\n\r\ntime  limit  within which the Comptroller can make an assessment\r\n\r\nor  an additional assessment is also not applicable in the  case\r\n\r\nof a non-tax assessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give greater finality to both the Comptroller and the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers for non-tax assessment cases, clauses 22 and 23  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Act to provide for the Comptroller to issue a notice  to  a\r\n\r\ntaxpayer even if there is no tax payable by the taxpayer and for\r\n\r\nthe 6-year time limit to also apply to non-tax assessment cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 4, Amendment No. (1).
