FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to answer part (a) of Ms Denise Phua's Question first.&nbsp;In land scarce Singapore, it is not possible to totally segregate foreign workers from the local community.&nbsp; If Singaporeans do not want to see foreign workers near their residential areas or using common facilities,&nbsp;this will set a physical limit on the number of foreign workers we can accommodate, which will, in turn, limit our economic growth, raise our business costs as well as the cost of living generally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Singaporeans do not want foreign workers in their residential areas, then there may be more illegal housing, that is, many foreign workers will continue to overcrowd in improper housing premises within or near residential areas.&nbsp; This may create even greater health and safety risks, not just to the workers, but also to the surrounding community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the exceptional increase in foreign worker numbers in the past&nbsp;years, there is a current shortage in foreign worker housing.&nbsp; Hence, MND is exploring temporary measures, such as housing them in vacant state properties or temporary dormitories built on state land, that may be nearer to residential areas.&nbsp; The temporary dormitories are needed as many of these workers are already here and living in overcrowded conditions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, going forward, we will monitor the economic situation closely and adjust our longer-term dormitory supply according to the changing demand for housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there is a responsibility for us to make sure that the foreign workers, and indeed all workers, just like all Singaporeans, are housed in decent conditions.&nbsp; That is the reason why we have utilised several ways in order to provide proper housing for the workers.&nbsp; First of all, they can rent private residential premises.&nbsp; But we have a limit on these premises.&nbsp; We do not want overcrowding in these premises.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we have to look at other alternatives.&nbsp; So construction workers are housed on-site as far as possible.&nbsp; There is, again, a limit to the number of workers that we can house on-site.&nbsp; And this is why we need to have another option, which is allowing foreign workers to live in some of our industrial estates.&nbsp; We have allowed factory owners to convert some of their industrial premises into dormitories.&nbsp; Last but not least, we provide purpose-built permanent dormitories for these workers and, in these dormitories, amenities are put in place which will provide the workers with a very decent standard of living.&nbsp; There are minimum living space conditions, living space requirements as well as provisions of all the basic amenities and indeed more than that.&nbsp; Some of the modern foreign worker dormitories, in fact, have fully equipped gymnasiums, cinemas, games area, and so on.&nbsp; So they are actually very adequately provided for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is precisely because we want to provide proper housing for these workers that we are now seeking to convert some of the vacant state properties into temporary premises.&nbsp; There is currently overcrowding in some of the private residential estates, including HDB, and that is a fact that we have to deal with.&nbsp; So we are now trying to quickly bring up to speed some of these temporary accommodation.&nbsp; The Serangoon Garden Technical School was one such facility.&nbsp; It was ready for occupation in a short time.&nbsp; The facilities are there.&nbsp; There is sufficient space for us to put in all the amenities that I talked about earlier.&nbsp; So, yes, I think it is important for us to provide proper housing for all our workers, not just from the point of view of humanity, as Ms Ng put it, but also because there are basic standards of fire safety and basic standards of health and sanitation that we need to take into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the same time, I think we want to make sure that as we roll out these dormitories, the disamenities to the surrounding areas are&nbsp; minimised.&nbsp; That is a balance we have to strike.&nbsp; Hence all the additional features and facilities that we put in, like the road which, by the way, is not just going to serve the dormitory. In future when the site is used for other purposes, once the dormitory moves out, that road will still be relevant and useful.&nbsp; So it is something that will be useful even beyond the lifespan of the dormitory.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to what extent are the local residents, where the dormitories are to be erected, involved in the whole planning process, in terms of amenities to be built or even roads to be constructed to specially cater to this group of foreigners.&nbsp; The reason I ask this question is that, if the local residents were involved to a certain extent, I think it will help to build that ownership of these foreigners coming in to live amongst them.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; Let me explain the process by which we select these premises and also the process of consultation which is relevant to Mdm Ho's question.&nbsp; First of all, when we scan through the list of sites that are available in Singapore, we take into account, not just the availability, but what are the competing uses because there are many other competing uses for these temporary state properties.&nbsp; Having decided that that particular site is suitable for a dormitory,&nbsp;we then&nbsp;go through the process of evaluating the technical feasibility of it.&nbsp; What this means is that we consult the different agencies, like LTA for traffic amenities, NEA to check whether their health or safety buffers are already in place, which means that we would not be able to make use of it, or other facilities or amenities like sewerage, power, and so on.&nbsp; Having gone through the technical consultation and if we find the sites suitable and feasible, we then consult the advisors and also the grassroots leaders.&nbsp; This is the stage where the grassroots leaders are brought into play and this is where any concerns are brought up, and we look at ways of minimising those concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that it is important for us to take that step,&nbsp; to take into account as far as possible the concerns and also put in the mitigating measures.&nbsp; I do have to highlight however that not all the proposals are doable, either because they are too expensive or physically it is just not possible.&nbsp; For example, in the Serangoon Garden case, there was a suggestion to divert the road to another area.&nbsp; We studied it, LTA looked at it, and came to a conclusion that from the traffic safety and&nbsp;traffic hazard point of view, it was not a good idea to redirect that road.&nbsp; There was another suggestion to try to block the disamenities, arising from building the road, ie, to try to block some of the noise, the dust or fumes from the road to the residents.&nbsp; This, we have accepted.&nbsp; So NParks will be planting some trees.&nbsp; So where the concerns are valid and where the mitigating measures are doable, we will certainly take them into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I must come back to the fundamental point which is really that over the last couple of years, we have seen this very sharp rise in the numbers.&nbsp; These numbers are here and we have to accommodate them, and to accommodate them we need to look at not just permanent sites but also temporary sites, and where the temporary sites are chosen and where they cause some inconvenience and disamenities, then let us look at how we can minimise those inconveniences.&nbsp; But it will not go away totally.&nbsp; I think this is something that we all have to accept.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But have we considered putting some of them in the outer islands, for example, Jurong Island, where it could&nbsp;have better spacing and we do not have this kind of problem with regard to space in the residential areas?&nbsp; In terms of logistics, moving up and down, I think we have done that before in Pulau Tekong with our NSmen,&nbsp;by ferrying them up and down through ferries.&nbsp; The second question is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to be rushing to build a lot more temporary dormitories, and I understand that there could be demand today.&nbsp; But looking at the current economic situation where there is slow down in the manufacturing, construction and services sectors,&nbsp;do we still need&nbsp;so many dormitories in the residential areas?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We do try to house the foreign workers as close as possible to their worksites.&nbsp; That is the reason why I said earlier that for construction workers, the first choice is really to provide on-site housing for them.&nbsp; But, again, you must realise that if the construction site is actually quite close to a residential area, there is a limiting constraint there.&nbsp; In the case of Jurong Island, you will be pleased to know that we actually do have dormitories on Jurong Island.&nbsp; In fact, there are two dormitories on Jurong Island and they cater to about 10,000 bed spaces.&nbsp; These are mainly for the process workers, the workers involved in building the petrochemical industries on Jurong Island itself.&nbsp; That is obviously the most sensible thing to do and where it is feasible, we will do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to give Members another example.&nbsp; A huge number of foreign workers are working on the Marina Bay and also on the Sentosa IRs, and so we try to find dormitory space at or near the sites.&nbsp; In fact, some of them are staying on-site, and some of them are staying just slightly away from it.&nbsp; So this is our first choice.&nbsp; But having exhausted this first choice, we now need to go on to the other choices.&nbsp; When we talk about looking for temporary dormitory spaces, we are actually looking at the third or even the fourth alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his second question: do we need such a number of bed spaces if the economy slows down?&nbsp; The demand that has been generated now is due to the exceptional surge in the numbers over the last two years.&nbsp; That is the reason why we need these temporary dormitory spaces.&nbsp; Going forward, of course, we would have to monitor the situation very closely and, if necessary, we would be adjusting the number of bed spaces to deal with it.&nbsp; But I can say that as at this moment, and, in fact, for next year, because the demand, especially for construction workers, is still going to be there because projects are still ongoing, I do not foresee that there will be a drastic drop in the demand for foreign workers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In this case, there is an <I>ad hoc</I> request for land use.&nbsp; I want to ask what is the process for&nbsp;approval of <I>ad hoc</I> use&nbsp;because compatibility of use is important in land use planning.&nbsp; Can the Minister explain the process of this land use <I>per se</I> in the midst of a residential estate?&nbsp; The second question is, how does this acute shortage come about because any employment of foreign workers needs the approval of MOM?&nbsp; Does it mean that there is no communication at all between MOM and MND?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; As Mdm Cynthia Phua said,&nbsp; we do have a long-term land use plan, ie, the Masterplan, which is reviewed every five years.&nbsp; What the Masterplan does is to stipulate the land use plan for various sites in Singapore.&nbsp; But, at the same time, even with the Masterplan, because land is so scarce in Singapore, we do consider short-term uses for state land.&nbsp; Why do we do this?&nbsp; Because (a) it provides flexibility in land use; and (b) more importantly, it allows us to make better use of the land.&nbsp; If you leave the land empty and do not use it at all because there is no urgency for the longer-term use of the land, then obviously that land is going to waste.&nbsp; So there is a wastage or under-utilisation of land on the one hand, and there is a demand on the other hand.&nbsp; If we match the two together, this is where we try to get the compatibility that Mdm Cynthia Phua talked about.&nbsp; I will give Members several examples.&nbsp; There was a shortage in office space a few years ago.&nbsp; We realised that we were not able to generate the additional office space in such a short period of time due to a huge surge in&nbsp; demand for office space in the last two years.&nbsp; So the solution was to tender out sites for temporary office space,&nbsp; for use as transitional office space and, hence,&nbsp; make use of vacant state properties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

These are the short-term uses that I am talking about. So while the Masterplan reflects the longer term planning intention of the site, it does not preclude us from making better use of the land, if it is still vacant, for short term use. This is precisely the situation for the Serangoon Garden site. The Serangoon Garden site's long-term land use planning intention is for it to be a residential site, but there is no need to tender out the site for residential use. There is no urgency for it. So what do we do? Do we leave it vacant or do we look for alternative use?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several alternative uses. We find which is the one that is the most compatible. That is the reason why we decided to &ndash; after looking at all the feasibility studies&nbsp;&ndash; allocate it for foreign worker dormitory. That is the reason why we go for temporary uses even though we have a more permanent planning intention in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also asked whether there was miscommunication between MDA and MOM. We do have a long-term planning framework in place which takes into account demand for foreign worker bed spaces and housing, which in turn, is related to economic growth in the various sectors. So this planning framework allows us to plan in advance&nbsp;&ndash; which is all very fine if the planning parameters or assumptions are as indicated. But in this particular case, the economic growth in the last few years was more robust than anticipated. Just to give Members some figures, construction demand in 2006, when we just came out of the recession, was $17 billion. This year, we expect construction demand to be something like $30 billion, in the space of two years. The number of foreign workers in 2006 went up by 55,000. In 2007, it went up by 102,000, in the space of just one year. And this is not just construction, this is across all sectors&nbsp;&ndash; manufacturing, processes, services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could have said, \"Let us not allow the foreign workers to come in, because this is not what we have planned for. We do not have the space for&nbsp; them to come in. Let us&nbsp;say no to foreign workers.\" What would that mean? If we did not have the number of foreign workers that came in, that would have impacted our growth. That would have impacted the cost of doing business. That would, in fact, have impacted&nbsp;the cost of living because when they come in, there is a reduction in the cost of doing business and, hence, the cost of living. It also meant higher construction cost and delays. So when MPs and residents ask us for upgrading projects, \"When is it coming? When is the lift upgrading coming? Where are the flats? Why are we not building enough flats?\", all this ultimately boils down to whether we have the resources to build and to upgrade. And what are the resources? It is the foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to say no would have created other problems for our economy and our general cost of living. So, we decided to say yes. We decided to go for growth, and then to find ways and means to solve the down-stream problem of looking for housing for them. It is not an easy issue to tackle. It is a challenge. It requires residents to bear with some inconvenience and to make some adjustments. It requires advisers to work the ground to try to convince their residents that overall, on balance, there is a benefit to the economy, to the country and to them ultimately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I submit that this is still the best policy for us, that we go for growth, grab the opportunities when we get them, and where there is a resource constrain, we find ways and means to try to work through the problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:FOREIGN WORKERS IN HDB ESTATES--><p align=left>Column No : 493<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:FOREIGN WORKERS IN HDB ESTATES:::499-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>FOREIGN WORKERS IN HDB ESTATES</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Integration programmes-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Integration programmes)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</B> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower given that there is an increase in the number of foreigners being housed in HDB housing estates: (a) how can we ensure that foreigners comply with good housekeeping and security standards; (b) how are orientation and induction programmes carried out for these foreigners living in the midst of our heartland estates; and (c) what special programmes are being organised to socialise and integrate these foreigners.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for National Development has explained,&nbsp;foreign workers make a significant contribution to our economic growth and, indeed, we do face a shortage&nbsp;of these workers today. Therefore, I think&nbsp;it is more important for us to have sufficient housing capacity to accommodate foreign workers here, while reducing the impact on residents.&nbsp;We do this in several ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we work through the landlords or dormitory operators. HDB flat owners who wish to sublet their whole flat must apply to HDB for approval. They must ensure that their tenants maintain and upkeep the flat and avoid causing nuisance and disamenities to others. If their tenants do not comply with these conditions, HDB will revoke the approval. HDB conducts half-yearly flat inspections for approved subletting cases to ensure that the subletting is in order. For dormitory operators, we require them to provide basic amenities and recreational facilities within the dormitories, to minimise the need for foreign workers to leave the dormitories. We have also broadened the range of amenities, in response to ground feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we reach out to foreign workers to educate them on Singapore's laws and social norms. For example, MOM produces a guidebook in nine languages for distribution to all foreign workers when they arrive in Singapore. The Police has also produced posters and a video in various languages to enhance crime prevention awareness among foreign workers here. These are shown at dormitory roadshows and other events involving foreign workers. NEA has also stepped up educational outreach to foreign workers on public health issues, including putting up banners in the native languages of the foreign workers at areas where they gather and broadcasting anti-littering messages in the buses that ferry foreign workers. Where necessary, the Police and NEA have stepped up enforcement efforts to deter crime and public health offences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we engage and involve the community. Under the Community Safety and Security Programme, the Police appoint foreign workers as Crime Prevention Ambassadors in residential areas near dormitories. These ambassadors perform foot patrols together with grassroots volunteers to deter crime and socially irresponsible acts near their dormitories. The People's Association's grassroots organisations, such as Community Clubs and Residents' Committees, also organise community activities to promote understanding among residents. During community events, exhibition booths are set up with messages on&nbsp;harmonious living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM and other Government agencies will continue to work&nbsp;with local communities to address their concerns about the presence of&nbsp;foreign workers&nbsp;in the community. By working together in partnership, we can make our communities a better place for Singaporeans, as well as foreigners who are here.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> &nbsp; Sir, I come from a veteran estate where foreign workers are a common sight, and I have worked&nbsp;on many of the strategies that the Minister has spoken about.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me put&nbsp;things into perspective.&nbsp; The vast majority of foreign workers who come to Singapore have work and are being paid their salaries.&nbsp; The number of foreign workers that came to MOM each year to seek assistance for salary arrears has remained low&nbsp;at less than 0.2% of foreign workers on average.&nbsp; We do not capture specific data on foreign workers who have come to Singapore without work as such complaints comprise a very small number.&nbsp; As an indicator, the incidence of illegal deployment of foreign workers last year constituted less than 0.05% of foreign workers.&nbsp; This&nbsp;suggests that most workers do have work when they come here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Ministry takes a serious view of employers who do not&nbsp;give their foreign workers work and those who do not pay their&nbsp;salaries.&nbsp; Under the Employment Act, employers who fail to pay salaries can be fined up to $1,000 per charge for first time offenders or face a jail term not exceeding six months or both.&nbsp; For repeat offenders, the fine is up to $2,000 per charge, or a jail term not exceeding one year or both.&nbsp; Up to September this year, we have prosecuted and fined&nbsp;nine employers for non-payment of salaries, out of which&nbsp;two cases involved foreign workers.&nbsp; Members may recall that earlier in 2007, this House passed changes to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act to increase the penalties for offences under the Act.&nbsp; The Employment (Amendment) Bill tabled for First Reading yesterday will also increase the penalty for non-payment of salaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM has&nbsp;put in place measures in the work pass approval process to minimise the possibility of workers being brought in without jobs.&nbsp; For example, construction and marine companies need to show documentary proof that they have ongoing projects before work permits are issued to them.&nbsp; For sub-contractors, an endorsement of work is also required from their principal contractor.&nbsp; We will take action against errant&nbsp;employers but we should be mindful that we are dealing with a minority of errant employers.&nbsp; It is unwise to impose disproportionate restrictions in the work pass system to deal with the errant minority and, as a result, create unnecessary rigidity and inconvenience for the majority of&nbsp;responsible employers and their employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng raised the concern that employers may terminate the work permits of foreign workers and repatriate them if they complain to MOM.&nbsp; In such instances, MOM may allow these workers to change employers and continue to work here on a case-by-case basis if MOM determines that they have not committed any offence.&nbsp; Foreign workers who are needed as prosecution witnesses would be issued special passes which will allow them to continue to stay in Singapore.&nbsp; They are also allowed to be employed by another employer under the Temporary Job Scheme (TJS).&nbsp; In some cases, it may be in the best interest of the workers to return to their home countries, especially when there is no suitable work for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the media reports early this month about foreign workers of three marine companies not being provided with work and were not paid their salaries, my Ministry started investigations into the complaints earlier in September when the workers approached us.&nbsp; Preliminary findings show that these workers have work and were paid for the work done.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there are some irregularities detected in the payment of salaries and we have told the companies to rectify them.&nbsp; As investigation is still ongoing, I would prefer not to discuss specific details of these cases at this point in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;would like to take this opportunity to remind employers that they should ensure foreign workers they bring in are gainfully and productively employed.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the services of the workers are no longer&nbsp;required, the employers should terminate the contracts and facilitate the workers to&nbsp;return to their home countries.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I heard of a practice of employers who use their foreign worker quota as entitlement to bring in foreign workers.&nbsp; How does the Ministry prevent them from subsequently becoming foreign worker agents who sublet these extra workers and giving other employers the ease and flexibility of interim and immediate foreign labour?&nbsp; Such a practice still gives the foreign workers work but at the same time offers the second group of employers the ease and also convenience of foreign labour.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how does the Ministry prevent such a practice, so that Singaporean workers are not discriminated because they are usually more expensive, especially the low-income and contract workers in our population.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, we have different practices for different sectors of the industry because of the nature of the industry.&nbsp; In the construction sector, for example, projects tend to be lumpy and they vary from time to time, so there will be periods in between projects that contractors may not have jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us to facilitate these contractors who have workers with them, whether local or foreign, to be able to provide subcontract work for the main contractors.&nbsp; There will be some flexibility that we will have to allow but we regulate that by ensuring that these contractors, before they employ the foreign workers, do have sufficient work.&nbsp; So we look at their job orders,&nbsp;the contracts that they have in hand, to ensure that they have sufficient work.&nbsp; But, again, as I said, these jobs will fluctuate from time to time, and when they are in between jobs,&nbsp;we need to ensure that there is certain flexibility.&nbsp; But in other sectors, manufacturing and services, for example, the employers have to employ their foreign workers in the job that they have specified in the work permit, so it is quite clear and specific.&nbsp; If the foreign workers want to change employer, they actually have to terminate the work permit and apply for a new work permit with the new employer.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I have four supplementary questions for the Acting Minister, but they are all related.&nbsp; The first question: the Acting Minister has referred to special passes for workers who are required to stay to be prosecution witnesses. &nbsp;I&nbsp;would like to ask the Acting Minister at any given time, approximately how many workers will be on such passes, and of these workers, how many of them actually do manage to make use of the temporary work pass to find alternative employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is this:&nbsp; of these workers who are asked to stay behind to be prosecution witnesses, are there any special provisions to assist them with housing?&nbsp; Because there will be a period of time where they are looking for alternative employment, and so they will not have accommodation, and what assistance will we be giving to them, given that we are asking them to stay in Singapore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question relates to the workers who are not required to stay as prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; My understanding is that they are then repatriated back to their home country.&nbsp; Is there any allowance to help them look for alternative employment because, as I understand it, all these workers want to stay in Singapore to work to pay off their debts incurred when they come here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that leads me to my final question, Sir.&nbsp; Does the Ministry intend to relook the industry structure because all of these workers are vulnerable because of the debts that they incurred when they come to Singapore, which is why they want to stay?&nbsp; Does the Ministry intend to investigate this and look into how the industry can be better structured, so that the workers are not saddled with very high debts before they start work?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the total number of special passes at any time in Singapore is very small.&nbsp; I do not have the specific numbers with me but usually they are given special passes because they are assisting the Ministry in investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those that are stranded or those foreign workers who are given special passes or temporary job permits, when they find employment, the new employer will be responsible for their housing.&nbsp; While they are waiting for new employment, if they are still holding the work permit issued by the&nbsp;current employer, the current employer will be responsible for their housing.&nbsp; And if they are in between, ie, their work permit has been terminated and they are in the meantime looking for employment, the Ministry on a case-by-case basis does help them, together with the various organisations, to provide housing for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the Ministry's interest to ensure that their welfare are looked after.&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances, we also work with the foreign embassies who are here to provide for them&nbsp;and ensure that their well-being is being taken care of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question Mr Siew asked is&nbsp;whether the Ministry helps them with alternative job employment in Singapore.&nbsp; It is really not the core mission of the Ministry to help these foreign workers&nbsp;find jobs.&nbsp; But the Ministry does, on a case-by-case basis, as I mentioned earlier,&nbsp;help these employees find jobs.&nbsp; Recently, for example, we&nbsp;helped a group of foreign workers who have lost their jobs partly because the company has run into financial&nbsp;trouble.&nbsp; We helped them find alternative employers within a short period of time.&nbsp; But, as I said, eventually, if there is really no job, we have to find ways to repatriate them, and the current employers are responsible for repatriating them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last question is about the debt that they incurred.&nbsp; Very often, we find that some of these debts were incurred in their home countries,&nbsp;and these were monies that were paid to the agents in their home countries.&nbsp; And because they are outside Singapore's jurisdiction, what we can do is to work with the foreign missions/embassies here&nbsp;to share with them our information, so that they can in turn put in place structure and regulation in their home countries to prevent manipulation and exploitation of their own workers.&nbsp; But when they come to Singapore, our employment agencies are regulated.&nbsp; I think,&nbsp;a few months ago, I mentioned in this Parliament that we are also tightening the regulation on employers receiving rebates from employment agents.&nbsp; So these are being put in place and we are working with the employment agents to see how we can further improve the framework and&nbsp;structure here.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HIKE IN ELECTRICITY TARIFFS--><p align=left>Column No : 506<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:HIKE IN ELECTRICITY TARIFFS:::519-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

SP Services Ltd, which is a subsidiary of Singapore Power, buys electricity from the generation&nbsp;companies and on-sells it to households.&nbsp; The components of the electricity tariff are: (a)&nbsp;cost of fuel for power generation which accounts for 62% of the overall costs; (b)&nbsp;non-fuel costs of generation (21%); (c)&nbsp;cost of transmission and distribution (16%); and (d)&nbsp;miscellaneous fees like meter reading and billing (1%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 80% of our electricity is generated using natural gas.&nbsp; In the US, there is a separate and distinct market for natural gas which determines its price.&nbsp; In Asia, however, there is no such distinct market and the price of natural gas is indexed to the price of fuel oil, which is the alternative fuel for power generation.&nbsp; So many have wondered why if we use gas to generate electricity, why is there a link to oil, and this is the reason, because you index it to the next best alternative.&nbsp; Countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore buy natural gas through long-term contracts at a price which is tied to the current price of fuel oil.&nbsp; Therefore, when the fuel oil price increases, so too will the natural gas price with a consequential increase in our electricity tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, SP Services adjusts the electricity tariff every quarter to reflect changes in the cost of fuel oil.&nbsp; Since 2004, SP Services has pegged the tariff to a three-month forward fuel oil price.&nbsp; This forward fuel oil price is not a projection.&nbsp; It is the actual price in the commodities market for future delivery of fuel oil in&nbsp;three months' time.&nbsp; This is in contrast to spot&nbsp;price of fuel oil which is the price paid for immediate delivery to customers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Why use the three-month forward fuel oil price and not the spot price to set the electricity tariff?&nbsp; The aim is to provide as much certainty as possible to consumers.&nbsp; A formula based on spot price, which is usually more variable, would mean households experiencing frequent and more volatile changes in their electricity tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have asked the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a chart* which compares the spot fuel oil price and the three-month forward fuel oil price since January 2004.&nbsp; It is clear from the Chart that the spot fuel oil price has greater variability compared to the three-month forward fuel oil price used by SP Services.&nbsp; Members should also note that the three-month forward fuel oil price used in the formula has been lower than the spot fuel oil price in all but&nbsp;five of the 16 quarters since 2004.&nbsp; In other words, the forward fuel oil price number that has been used in the formula to set tariffs had been lower than the spot price and, therefore, the impact on the electricity tariffs is to have it low.&nbsp; Although the tariff formula using this three-month forward fuel oil price cannot insulate the price of electricity from the rising and volatile price of oil, it does help to moderate the impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mdm Ho Geok Choo has asked and&nbsp;Ms Ellen Lee is about to ask why tariff is increasing when spot prices are falling.&nbsp; With&nbsp;the current approach, there is a three-month time lag between changes in the fuel oil price and the actual tariff revision and this time lag works both ways, ie, electricity tariffs move up more slowly when fuel oil prices are rising, and move down more slowly when fuel oil prices are falling.&nbsp; For instance, in July 2008, the spot fuel oil price was Singapore dollars&nbsp;&ndash; we converted everything to Singapore dollars&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;$153 a barrel, which was higher than the corresponding three-month forward fuel oil price of S$112 a barrel.&nbsp; So in July this year, if we had used the spot price&nbsp;to compute the electricity tariffs, it would have been 21% higher than that computed using the three-month forward price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The converse is true in the current quarter, with the average spot fuel oil price in October&nbsp; (about S$109 a barrel) being lower than the corresponding three-month forward fuel oil price (S$155 barrel).&nbsp; If the current lower fuel oil prices are sustained, the benefits will flow through with the same time lag to electricity tariffs in the next quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, on balance, under the current formula, the volatility of electricity tariffs has been relatively low and households have generally paid less for their electricity than if we had used spot prices, as indicated by the green shaded areas of the Chart.&nbsp; The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is studying whether the formula can be further improved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Ms Sylvia Lim's question, I would caution that we should refrain from making arbitrary changes just because the outcomes are inconvenient in a particular quarter or two.&nbsp; What we ought to really think&nbsp;about is, if we make such changes and if they are not well thought out and they are seen by the market to be arbitrary, that&nbsp;would increase regulatory risks, adversely affect investors' sentiment and confidence and, ultimately, it will do more harm than good to our consumers and businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has sought to mitigate the impact of the rise in electricity prices by providing focused and targeted assistance through U-save rebates for those who need help the most.&nbsp; We are also conducting programmes to raise awareness of electricity conservation and facilitate efforts by households and businesses to reduce their utility bills.&nbsp; We have opted not to subsidise electricity because this encourages over-consumption and is unsustainable in the long run, as it is quite evident from the experience of many countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah has asked what has been done to ensure that the pricing by energy companies is reasonable.&nbsp; Since the liberalisation of the electricity industry, the EMA has ensured that electricity tariffs are set efficiently through competition in the electricity generation market, and by regulating Singapore Power on its tariffs for the transmission and distribution of electricity, because Sing Power is a regulated monopoly and also by regulating&nbsp;SP Services, which retails electricity to households.&nbsp; EMA has both in-house expertise and external consultants to advise on its regulation of the electricity industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The liberalisation of the electricity industry has brought about greater competition and efficiency gains among the power generation companies and these have been passed on as real benefits to our consumers.&nbsp; This is clear from the fact that although fuel oil prices have risen substantially by more than 300% since the onset of competition in 2001, electricity tariffs have risen by about 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the sale of the power generation companies by Temasek Holdings, a point that Mr Gautam Banerjee has raised, we can expect market competition to continue to exert downward pressure on electricity prices without compromising the reliability and security of our energy supply.&nbsp; This is because our electricity market regime allows and encourages new generation plants to be built, which incentivises generation companies to innovate and produce or provide electricity at competitive rates.&nbsp; Senoko Power, for example, which was recently sold to a foreign consortium, has since decided to invest in repowering its oil-fired plants with the more efficient gas generators.&nbsp; The divestment of the power companies will benefit Singaporeans over the long term as it will enhance competition, help raise our industry standards to international levels by attracting global energy players, and promote innovation in our energy industry.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah has also asked how Singapore Power (SP) is regulated to ensure that its revenues are translated into benefits for households and businesses in Singapore.&nbsp; Singapore Power&rsquo;s electricity transmission and distribution and its retail business are regulated by the EMA to ensure that the electricity supply is reliable and affordable. In particular, the electricity grid is regulated such that Sing Power is incentivised to enhance system efficiency, and the savings from such efficiency gains are passed on to consumers.&nbsp; In fact, Singapore Power has announced that from 1st October 2008, the charges for transporting electricity have been reduced by between 8% and 11%.&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mdm Ho Geok Choo&rsquo;s suggestion for more clarity on the electricity pricing model, EMA will put out more information on its website to help Singaporeans understand how electricity is priced.&nbsp; EMA is also taking steps to further liberalise the electricity market for households.&nbsp; It has developed a prototype Electricity Vending System (EVS) which allows households to purchase electricity from competing providers with different price plans.&nbsp; Feedback from the upcoming EVS trial runs will allow EMA to evaluate the system, establish its viability, and it will eventually open the&nbsp;market for more retailers to compete to sell electricity directly to households.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> &nbsp; Sir, I want to thank Minister for his very comprehensive response but, honestly speaking, it is quite tough trying to understand what has been explained.&nbsp; I am not representing everybody in the Chamber but I am sure if we were to ask anyone to try to reiterate&nbsp;the formula, it is quite a tall order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience of my grassroots leaders in trying to explain to residents who have come to see us on the&nbsp;increase in electricity rates&nbsp;has been quite tormenting, because they themselves are also finding difficulties in trying to explain.&nbsp; So what I really would like to ask for is for Singapore Power perhaps to do a bit of a PR job here in terms of sending down its officials to help grassroots leaders to do a better job at explaining this increase in electricity rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, in order to boost the confidence&nbsp;of residents so that they&nbsp;know that this is not just an arbitrary decision to&nbsp;increase electricity tariffs, perhaps we could form&nbsp;a council, like the&nbsp;Public Transport Council (PTC), and this may give more confidence and a better chance of understanding&nbsp;how this formula was made.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand the Member's sentiment.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;an inherently&nbsp;complicated industry and the formula reflects that.&nbsp; I have tried to present it in as simple a manner&nbsp;as I can and will be very happy to work with Members to see how best we can translate this into even plainer language that we can communicate on the ground.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the core message which&nbsp;I think it will be difficult to communicate to anybody's satisfaction&nbsp;is&nbsp;why have prices gone up by so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that&nbsp;it is a reflection of the underlying trends in the fuel market and that volatility has been reflected in our electricity prices.&nbsp; And that is something that we will take&nbsp;some effort to explain to residents.&nbsp; But I think giving more data&nbsp;or simplifying the language would not address that in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second point about setting up a council or other mechanisms to regulate the industry or to oversee the formula, I appreciate the Member's sentiment and&nbsp;the sentiment of many in this House that we want to do the best we can for our consumers,&nbsp;households and businesses.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we should just be careful that we do not, because we have one or two inconvenient outcomes in particular quarters,&nbsp;over react and set up new mechanisms and regulatory channels which will completely change the perception of our market.&nbsp; It will be seen as having a greater regulatory risk.&nbsp; And if there is greater regulatory risk, then&nbsp;we must expect that the electricity generating companies here will expect a higher rate of return than what they currently have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; My question was not so much about the competition.&nbsp; It was about whether in a strategic area like power generation, all the players could be owned by foreign shareholders.&nbsp; The UK experience is rather sad in this area.&nbsp; Because, as&nbsp;Members know, the UK nuclear power plants were owned by foreign companies and they found that the development of the industry had been compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;we have shareholders in China,&nbsp;India, UK or&nbsp;Japan owning our power companies, they are not likely to look at the interests of Singapore as the first thing but look at the interests&nbsp;on a global basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Ministry feel that it is strategic enough and that we should at least have some control over the power generation companies in the long term?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran:&nbsp;</B> First of all,&nbsp;we&nbsp;operate it on the principle that&nbsp;it has served us well thus far,&nbsp;that we create a regime where we promote competition.&nbsp; And when&nbsp;we promote competition, the players are incentivised to optimise.&nbsp; Mr Banerjee's point here is that&nbsp;they may be tempted to run down their assets and sub-optimise the long-term development of the assets and the industry.&nbsp; But there are two points here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, if&nbsp;we look at&nbsp;the example that we have today.&nbsp; We have a foreign consortium buying over Senoko Power and the first order of business is to change from oil fired to gas plants which are more efficient.&nbsp; And they know that in the long run, &nbsp;it is going to serve their interests better, business-wise and, of course, in the process, it is going to help our consumers better as well.&nbsp; So&nbsp;the evidence actually is mixed on this and that is why&nbsp;we also need a keen regulator who looks into this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important element in our regulatory regime is to allow ease of entry and exit in two ways.&nbsp; First, the existing players can plan new plants and they are given this flexibility and EMA will be happy to license them.&nbsp; So if a particular Genco is running down its assets and, therefore, sub-optimising, and&nbsp;that they can do better in other fields with a newer plant with better technology, then that will be facilitated and that will ensure some progressivity in our industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also allow new entrants into the industry.&nbsp; It is an open market.&nbsp; We are prepared to allow new players to come in.&nbsp; And this is also why we have opened up our electricity and gas grids.&nbsp; It is a common user system.&nbsp; So anyone who comes in can use the electricity grid to push out the electricity that they generate and use the gas grid to fuel the electricity they generate.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Secondly, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that there are some inconvenient outcomes in certain quarters.&nbsp; But if we trace back the tariff hikes over the last two years, in fact, less than two years since January last year, it has been more than 50% increase.&nbsp; If we look back to January 2004 to now, it has actually doubled.&nbsp; For&nbsp;the public good, which has only one supplier, does the Minister agree that this kind of price increase is not an acceptable situation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, could we not, for example, take a leaf from what is happening in Hong Kong?&nbsp; For example, in Hong Kong, when the Hong Kong electricity company sells electricity, they look at the basic consumption that an average household uses, and that usage is priced at a more favourable rate.&nbsp; And for households that consume more, the excess units are paid at a higher rate.&nbsp; If we are prepared to look at that as a principle, I think the electricity price could possibly be&nbsp;more stable and more affordable.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the formula, subject to any commercial confidentiality issues, I am sure&nbsp;EMA may be happy to oblige.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, whether the electricity change has been excessive,&nbsp;we have got to put it in context.&nbsp; It is against the backdrop of an unprecedented series of price increases in the oil market, and we are all well aware of that.&nbsp; So when&nbsp;we posit that the extreme,&nbsp;we have got to compare it against what is the backdrop, and whether it squares up.&nbsp; I would argue that if&nbsp;we look at the comparison, actually our system has done&nbsp;fairly well, and I think the chart shows that.&nbsp; But that does not mean that we cannot do better.&nbsp; Yes, we can look at what other systems that we can put in place.&nbsp; But I also&nbsp;want to just mention that it is not clear whether there is a better formula or point that&nbsp;we can use as a reference.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we say&nbsp;we want to use spot prices,&nbsp;we can see the implications.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we say&nbsp;we want a fixed price, then the power generating companies are going to say, \"I want a very high fixed price because I have to put up with the volatility in the spot markets.\"&nbsp; So when we design a system, we have to take these things into account.&nbsp; Yes, it is very unhelpful that the timing of this increase and the extent of the increase on this occasion.&nbsp; But when we think about whether we should change and how we should change, we should be quite circumspect about it, and take into account the implications across the board, and not just at one component of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Member compared us to Hong Kong and talked about the Hong Kong pricing system and so on.&nbsp; There are some basic differences between us and Hong Kong I want to highlight, which is one of the reasons why a direct comparison is a bit difficult.&nbsp; One reason is because Hong Kong fuels two thirds of its electricity generation using coal, which is a significantly cheaper fuel.&nbsp; We do not have that option, and I am not sure if we price coal for its carbon emissions and so on whether it will, in fact, be a cheaper fuel.&nbsp; That is the first point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is that the power generating industry in Hong Kong is a more integrated one, meaning the company that sells the electricity, the equivalent of our SP services, is also the company that runs the grid and is also the company that generates electricity.&nbsp; We have broken the industry up into contestable and non-contestable components.&nbsp; Whereas in the case of Hong Kong, they have used an integrated approach and then they deal at that level.&nbsp; There are pros and cons.&nbsp; I think they are different approaches.&nbsp; But, fundamentally, what we want to do is this.&nbsp; We recognise that the oil and fuel market has great volatility.&nbsp; We want to try and minimise the impact of that volatility on our households through electricity tariffs.&nbsp; But we cannot shield our households from the full impact of that volatility or the price increases, because that is not the reality.&nbsp; I think we have to accept that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One is the electricity grid; the second is the gas grid; and the third is SP Services, which does the selling of electricity to households.&nbsp; All of these are regulated monopolies, regulated by the EMA.&nbsp; SP Services is not quite a monopoly but is regulated because it deals exclusively with households.&nbsp; And, essentially, it is regulated to make sure that they do not earn a super normal rate of return.&nbsp; So the EMA uses international industry benchmarks to ensure that whatever rate of return they earn is a reasonable rate of return compared to international standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should there be a reasonable rate of return?&nbsp; It is simply because if&nbsp;we do not have that, and this is the point which Mr Banerjee raised earlier, how do&nbsp;we ensure continual improvement and upgrading of our infrastructure.&nbsp; Let me take Singapore Power's electricity grid as a case in point.&nbsp; They have to invest S$5 billion over the next five years to enhance the grid infrastructure.&nbsp; If they do not earn what is considered to be a fair rate of return by industry and market standards, then they will be tempted to cut back on that investment, because it is not in their shareholders' interest and, therefore, not in the company's interest.&nbsp; So to frame it as investors' pockets versus households' pockets is actually not quite correct.&nbsp; What we should be saying is that we should ensure that there are no super normal returns.&nbsp; But if there are reasonable returns ensured for our companies in the electricity market, then we can be assured that they will do the right things in terms of ensuring the system continues to upgrade itself in technology and efficiency, and those benefits will then percolate to our consumers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:COST INCREASES--><p align=left>Column No : 519<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:COST INCREASES:::523-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Mr Speaker Sir, first, let me sketch out the outlook for inflation for 2008 and 2009, before I proceed to answer the questions from Mr Sam Tan and Ms Irene Ng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inflation in Singapore has started to ease.&nbsp; CPI inflation peaked in&nbsp;the second quarter of this year&nbsp;and is likely to decrease for the rest of the year.&nbsp; On a year-on-year basis, CPI inflation has come down from the high of 7.5% in the second quarter of this year, to 6.4% in August. &nbsp;This reflects mainly the moderation of global food and oil prices, as well as the washing out of the impact of the GST increase in July last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 2009, the Monetary Authority of Singapore expects a reduction in headline inflation to 2.5% to 3.5%, down from the 6% to 7% this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng has asked if the Government will set up a national committee to review cost increases.&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan has also asked if the Government will take steps to ensure that private and public agencies do not raise prices at the same time.&nbsp; Much of the price increases that we have experienced can be traced back to increases in external prices, specifically and especially the price of oil. &nbsp;Higher oil prices have translated into higher pump prices, taxi fares, airfares and electricity tariffs.&nbsp; Several of these price increases are, therefore, happening at around the same time because they have the same underlying cause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the Government step in to intervene?&nbsp; Our principle of allowing market forces to work has served us fairly well.&nbsp; We should let prices reflect the true cost of goods and services. Artificially suppressing prices through committees or other means encourages over-consumption and is not sustainable in the long run.&nbsp; In regulated sectors, such as public transport, telecommunications and utilities, we also have regulatory bodies to ensure that price increases proposed by the industries are not out of line with underlying cost increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For services provided by Government agencies, the Government's approach has been to charge realistic fees that reflect the cost of delivering the services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has been and will continue to monitor the impact of cost increases on Singaporeans very carefully.&nbsp; This is an ongoing exercise in Government.&nbsp; Therefore, there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no need to establish a national committee to do this.&nbsp; Where necessary, the Government can step in to provide targeted assistance to Singaporeans, as we have several times in the past, for those&nbsp;who might need help to cope with the cost increases.&nbsp; This the Government has done over the past few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the Government announced the GST Offset Package, which included GST credits, Senior Citizens' Bonus, U-Save rebates and top-ups to post-secondary education accounts.&nbsp; Members are very familiar with these programmes.&nbsp; The Government has structured these packages so that lower-income Singaporeans, who have been more affected by inflation, receive more benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government&nbsp;understands and appreciates&nbsp;the concerns that Singaporeans have towards rising cost pressures.&nbsp; The practical steps that the Government has taken will go some way towards providing relief.&nbsp; And should the inflation situation worsens, the Government is also prepared to adjust its assistance schemes to help Singaporeans to cope.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</B> :&nbsp; Sir, I agree with the Senior Minister of State's reply when he said that we should not over-react to the sudden surge in prices.&nbsp; But can I submit that Singaporeans have been very restrained?&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, when there are such increases in prices, especially electricity price increase of 21%, there will be protests in the streets and there will be riots.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to be more mindful&nbsp;that Singaporeans feel the pain, and they need to find a way to be assured that the Government is really trying to attend to their needs and their concerns?&nbsp; In my meet-the-people sessions, I see an increasing number of residents, including the middle class, who say they feel an incredible stress because of the spate of price increases.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran:</B> &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think restraint is a virtue.&nbsp; I think we should thank Singaporeans for that restraint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as price increases are concerned, I think we all share this concern.&nbsp; We want to help Singaporeans cope the best they can and to ensure that they can manage their day-to-day living expenses.&nbsp; I think the general approach&nbsp;&ndash; and I reiterate this point because it is important&nbsp;&ndash; that we do not want to unnecessarily interfere in market mechanisms.&nbsp; Every time we do that, we create an entirely wrong perception of the Government and the system here, and we increase the regulatory risk perceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just have to look around at other countries which do this quite regularly to see what the consequences can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I think our key approach must be to ensure that timely and targeted help is given to Singaporeans, not just at the low-income level but across the board.&nbsp; There are two things I want to say about this.&nbsp; First, actually it is more a Ministry of Finance issue, but several schemes have been announced.&nbsp; I think many of them, such as the GST Offset Package and the Growth Dividends actually have gone well beyond the lower percentiles to higher levels as well.&nbsp; So middle-income Singaporeans have also&nbsp;benefited from them.&nbsp; I think the Ministry of Finance has said that the Government will review and act, as necessary, on this score.&nbsp; That is the first thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, if there are any egregious examples of people who are profiteering or taking advantage of the situation to sell, then I think those merit investigation and we have a committee against profiteering set up in MTI under Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan.&nbsp; And we will be very happy to receive those sorts of reports and act on them.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY TARIFF--><p align=left>Column No : 523<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY TARIFF:::524-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me recap the steps that have been taken.&nbsp; Immediately after the deaths of REC Andrew Cheah (a full-time national serviceman) and 2LT Clifton Lam (a regular serviceman) on 10th and 11th June this year, the SAF took a three-day time-out to review its training safety systems.&nbsp; The review established that the systems are good and sound.&nbsp; As for the recent death of PTE Foo (a full-time national serviceman) on 30th September this year, a Committee of Inquiry has been convened and investigations are ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I want to assure Mr Siew and Members of this House that the safety and well-being&nbsp;of our servicemen&nbsp;are taken very seriously.&nbsp; At the last&nbsp;parliamentary session, I explained to the House in some detail our medical screening processes.&nbsp; These medical screening processes are in line with good international clinical practice and are continually reviewed by independent panels of medical consultants and specialists, and where there are improvements that can be made, we will do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety of our servicemen doing training is also taken very seriously.&nbsp; Training is progressive and graduated.&nbsp; Over and beyond having sound training systems, there is command emphasis to ensure that our soldiers are well prepared for training and strenuous exercises.&nbsp; For example, the training schedule is designed so that before any strenuous activity, servicemen do get sufficient rest and follow a proper hydration regime.&nbsp; An attending medic will be on-site during the conduct of the strenuous activity to deliver prompt medical care.&nbsp; In the event of a medical emergency, there are proper and established procedures to deliver prompt and appropriate medical attention to the serviceman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from this, commanders look out for servicemen who show signs that they are not feeling well.&nbsp; Such servicemen would be excused from training to seek medical attention.&nbsp; Servicemen are also reminded to tell their commanders should they feel unwell during or after any training activity.&nbsp; This is important as it is sometimes not easy or possible to know if someone is not feeling well unless the soldier himself tells his commander.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that the well-being of our soldiers is always a priority in the SAF.&nbsp; We have to train our soldiers hard&nbsp;so that they have the ability to fight, and to defend Singapore should the need arise, and it will help to ensure&nbsp;success on the battlefield and that they return home safely after that.&nbsp; So the SAF provides tough and realistic training to our soldiers but the SAF also maintains high&nbsp;safety standards to ensure that&nbsp;safety is not compromised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think both Mr Siew and I know that, despite&nbsp;our best efforts to reduce risk in training, it is not possible to guarantee that there will never be injury or death arising from it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I can assure this House that the SAF will continue to do its best to look after our servicemen and servicewomen in terms of medical screening, proper training systems, training safety procedures and medical coverage during training activities.&nbsp; They are, after all, our sons and our daughters and every life is precious to us.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I only have one supplementary question, which is to ask the Minister what is the status of the inquiries by MINDEF into the deaths of the late 2LT Clifton Lam and the late REC Andrew Cheah, and, given the public interest, will&nbsp;the results&nbsp;be made public.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of 2LT Clifton Lam, the Higher Board of Inquiry convened by MNIDEF has been completed and the cause of 2LT Lam's death is heat stroke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all training activities, trainees are constantly reminded to hydrate themselves.&nbsp; There are water breaks and water parades when trainees drink water.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event when there is an exercise where the trainee is required to take responsibility for himself, such as&nbsp;the training&nbsp;that 2LT Lam was undergoing, which was a three-day jungle confidence course, they&nbsp;were given safety briefings and, in this case,&nbsp;he was&nbsp;provided with four litres of water and purification tablets to purify stream or river water for drinking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HBOI, unfortunately, established that 2LT Lam may not have hydrated himself adequately during this period of training.&nbsp; The HOBI looked into the SAF's safety systems and was satisfied that these were in place and that there was no safety breach, neither was there foul play or negligence on the part of any personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of REC Andrew Cheah, the Committee of Inquiry investigation has been completed.&nbsp; Based on the autopsy report, the cause of REC Cheah's death is acute&nbsp;pneumonitis. I should point out that in neither case was the cause of death linked to medical screening as such.&nbsp; So the case of REC Cheah's death was determined by the autopsy report as acute pneumonitis.&nbsp; This is an acute infection causing extensive inflammation of the lungs.&nbsp; The typical symptoms are cough, phlegm, fever, pain in the chest, body aches and difficulty in breathing.&nbsp; However, it is possible, the doctors tell us, for a person to suffer from lung infection and yet not develop cough or fever, and this was indeed the case of REC Cheah.&nbsp; The infection must have been abrupt and caused his condition to deteriorate rapidly.&nbsp; REC Cheah told his section mates before the two-kilometre walk that he felt a little breathless; and during the walk, his instructor, who was walking with REC Cheah, observed that he looked tired and was breathing hard.&nbsp; However, he had no other observable symptoms such as cough or fever.&nbsp; In these circumstances, it was difficult for his instructors or platoon mates, or indeed for REC Cheah himself, to have known that the breathlessness was caused by acute pneumonitis&nbsp;and not&nbsp;simply fatigue.&nbsp; The instructor had asked REC Cheah whether he was not feeling well, REC Cheah replied that he was just tired.&nbsp; Hence, the instructor allowed REC Cheah to continue with the walk around the stadium in Pulau Tekong camp and did not pull him out as REC Cheah was able to converse with him, answer his questions with clarity in speech and in thought.&nbsp; The COI concluded that the instructor's decision to let REC Cheah continue with the walk was not unreasonable.&nbsp; The COI concluded that there was no safety breach and neither was there foul play or negligence on the part of any personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:MELAMINE-TAINTED FOOD PRODUCTS FROM CHINA--><p align=left>Column No : 528<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:MELAMINE-TAINTED FOOD PRODUCTS FROM CHINA:::531-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B>&nbsp; Sir, Dr Lim asked why AVA did not test milk and milk products for melamine until the incident surfaced.&nbsp; Melamine is an industrial chemical not allowed for use in food production.&nbsp; Prior to this incident, food authorities worldwide did not routinely test for melamine in food.&nbsp; It was unthinkable that anyone would unscrupulously add melamine to purposely give a false impression of the protein content in the food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee asked for assurance to test all food items.&nbsp; It is not possible for AVA to test all consignments of food products for all kinds of chemicals and contaminants.&nbsp; We will need many more laboratories and personnel, and the cost of our food will go sky-high. To ensure food safety, we take a managed risk approach, not a zero-risk approach.&nbsp; What AVA does is to profile the risk of different kinds of food, based on scientific analysis, vigilant surveillance of the prevailing foodborne disease situation, and the track record of suppliers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of milk, for example, the high-risk threats that we test for include chemicals such as heavy metals, residues of pesticides and veterinary drugs, and pathogens such as E coli and Salmonella.&nbsp; This is an international best practice, adopted by well-established food safety authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the news on melamine contamination was first officially reported in China on 12th September this year, AVA took prompt and appropriate action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verification checks on milk imports from China were immediately carried out.&nbsp; Tests were conducted to check for melamine contamination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it became clear to AVA that melamine had been intentionally added to adulterate these products, AVA suspended the import and sale of all milk and dairy products from China on 19th September.&nbsp; This was a necessary precautionary measure to protect&nbsp;all consumers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, samples of all milk and dairy products from China were collected and checked for melamine contamination.&nbsp; We were among the first countries to report unacceptable levels of melamine in various different dairy products and brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AVA also worked with MOH to educate the public on the health issues, and with NEA to take enforcement action at the retail end, including at coffee shops, retail outlets and school canteens. AVA is prosecuting some outlets for flouting the directive to recall implicated products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine the extent of the problem here, AVA has been running tests on all China-made milk and dairy products, and has extended tests to other China-made products that are traded based on protein content. Examples of such products are cereal, creamy soup and soya-based products.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AVA has also directed our importers to check with their suppliers on the country of origin of the milk ingredients used in the manufacture of their products.&nbsp; Samples of milk and milk products made in other countries have also been taken for testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim also asked whether there were any unscrupulous practices by Singapore importers involved in the import of these contaminated products.&nbsp; I am glad to report that so far, AVA has not come across any evidence which may suggest so.&nbsp; However, AVA will remain vigilant in monitoring the market, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action against any unscrupulous importers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Members that AVA has put in place a comprehensive and integrated food safety system to ensure that food imported into Singapore, regardless of its source, is safe for consumption.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every two years, we would invite an international panel of food safety experts to validate the system and give us suggestions for further improvement.&nbsp; The recent visit by the panel in August 2008 found our system to be robust and in line with international standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are not resting on our laurels. There will always be unscrupulous people along the entire chain of food production and distribution who will try to cheat the system to make more profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minister has,&nbsp;therefore, asked AVA to form a unit that will scan the horizon for timely information, dialogue constantly with key industry players, and brainstorm possible ways that people may try to beat the system.&nbsp; In&nbsp;short, Sir, AVA will look at how to strengthen our early warning signs&nbsp;and surveillance capabilities as well as improve its risk analysis to strengthen our food safety management system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It will give us an idea of the magnitude of funding that we can expect should the need arise.&nbsp; Of course, it does not mean that we have to spend the entire amount available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, can the Minister share with the House whether&nbsp;there are any specific plans on how these funds will be channelled, and how much will go into our social security system.&nbsp; On this note, I would like to urge the Government to look at spending more on our social security system, so that the man-in-the-street can stand to benefit more if any assistance is handed out.&nbsp; We are all aware of how embattled the lower and middle lower income are as they face wave after wave of rising costs, with&nbsp;the rise in electricity bills, the latest to slam into their earnings.&nbsp; Also, if I may propose that in exercising fiduciary responsibility on prospects of future earnings, we should take a prudent approach and exercise reasonable care.&nbsp; We should also not be ebullient when crystal-balling into future prospects and earnings.&nbsp; The collapse of several leading banks in the US is a timely reminder of how the impossible is possible indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope, though the Government views its investments and the computation of returns to be based on expected long-term returns, this will not stop the Government from releasing annual statistics on the returns from our investments.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me begin by saying that this debate on the returns on our national reserves could not have come at a more opportune juncture in history. These are no ordinary times, and the turbulence that has engulfed global markets in the last few months has thrown up good reasons for us to re-examine the issue.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one, there is no escaping that the value of our investments, like many other funds, would also be impacted significantly by the financial turmoil, which brings me to my first reason for supporting the Bill, that is, the new spending framework, which adopts a total return approach and safeguards the real value of past reserves, is a significant improvement from the NII framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total return approach which marks the investments to current market value takes into consideration the appreciation and depreciation of the reserves invested.&nbsp; This approach, especially in light of the dramatic fall in asset values, is sound and would better reflect the returns of the portfolio in which the spending is based upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, the NII framework, though more conservative on the surface, could potentially skew investment policy towards having more high-dividend stocks and higher yield bonds in the portfolio.&nbsp; This would limit the growth opportunity of the investments as well as expose the reserves to higher inflation risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, the NII approach could even lead to a situation where we may spend more then 50% of the returns.&nbsp; For example, the stocks and bonds that we invest in may have depreciated in value, but dividends and interest coupons would continue to be paid, as often is the case.&nbsp; Hence, we may well be in a situation where we continue to spend 50% of the dividends and interests that we received even though the investment values of our reserves may have shrunk.&nbsp; Put simply, we could be spending more than 50%&nbsp;of the returns if we take the reduced market investment values into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our reserves are increasingly invested in higher returns emerging market economies, its investment risk will grow correspondingly.&nbsp; Therefore, pegging spending rules to total returns is both timely and necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new framework also preserves the real value of the reserves, with mechanisms in place to safeguard their purchasing power over the long term.&nbsp; Since spending out of the investment returns will be computed on a real returns basis, the Government can budget 50% of the investment returns for fiscal expenditure only after it has been adjusted for inflation.&nbsp; This institutionalises the necessary saving discipline and ensures that our reserves continue to grow adequately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the additional funds freed up under the new framework would primarily be spent on enhancing our economic capabilities and strengthening social cohesion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, unlocking more investment returns for current fiscal expenditure could lead to a smaller kitty for future generations to dip into, and hence possibly deprive them of the opportunities we enjoyed. Surely, that is not the kind of &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; we would like the future sons and daughters of Singapore to remember us for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, if we carefully invest these additional funds to strengthen our global competitiveness&nbsp;in education or capacity building, for example, we will benefit not only the current generation, but lay the groundwork for a better and brighter Singapore for generations to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;The returns for such investments and spending on non-financial assets may not be that tangible, but I believe it will reap us good dividends over the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the new framework would still facilitate the continued growth of the reserves for the benefit of current and future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore&rsquo;s national reserves, given our small, open economy and growing population, must continue to grow so as to adequately \"capitalise\" the country's balance sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I have to refer to the recent financial turmoil, for we have seen how important it is for us to remain a bedrock of confidence in such chaotic times.&nbsp; For example, the Government&rsquo;s recent move to guarantee all bank deposits would not have held much water if it was not backed up by the size of our reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a little red dot like us to remain a compelling destination for quality foreign investments, we need to maintain our AAA sovereign ratings as well as demonstrate our ability to manage a stable Singapore dollar exchange rate regime, in addition to the other economic and security prerequisites.&nbsp; Having a strong balance sheet will allow us to fulfil these objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sense, I applaud the Government&rsquo;s decision to retain the existing 50% spending cap on the expected long-term real return on assets invested by GIC and MAS as well as the NII on the remaining assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, there are no easy fixes to the question of &ldquo;how much should we spend&rdquo;.&nbsp; Even public listed companies often grapple with it as well.&nbsp; For example, a firm with a high-growth strategy would usually opt to retain the bulk of its earnings for re-investment.&nbsp; One with a more steady growth strategy, on the other hand, may prefer to distribute more dividends to maximise shareholders&rsquo; value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, the 50-50 split is prudent and strikes a balance between allowing us to&nbsp;tap on the reserves for&nbsp;immediate use, while growing them over time for the benefit of future generations.&nbsp; I believe that most Singaporeans would find this an acceptable and equitable distribution of the country&rsquo;s wealth.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would also like to raise some points of concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national reserves play a critical role in safeguarding the economic and financial stability of the country.&nbsp; Hence, it is only befitting that we rigorously ascertain the motivation and rationale why the change is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finance Minister, in his Second Reading speech, gave a good account on the areas of increased fiscal spending in the next 10-15 years, forecasted to cost an additional 3% of the GDP.&nbsp; Besides spending on building capabilities and strengthening competitiveness, there will be more social spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The natural public finance-related concern would be whether this change would set an unhealthy precedent where future governments will again dip into our reserves to balance the budget for increased expenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future governments, on their part, can always find equally compelling reasons to justify why it is &ldquo;money no enough&rdquo; for them, and hence withdraw even more from the kitty.&nbsp; Would our national reserves, our last line of defence in any crisis, become a readily available means to balance budget?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore&nbsp;like to ask the Finance Minister to address the basic principles in which the spending rules can be amended, so that the public understands the Government&rsquo;s motivation for the change.&nbsp; Also, can the Minister&nbsp;provide some clarity on where the &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas are, in terms of spending the investment returns?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, what would be most difficult for the man in the street to grasp is this concept of \"expected&nbsp;long-term real rate of return\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those familiar with the endowment fund spending policy would know that such a spending approach involves basing fiscal expenditure on the long-term expected returns on investment, as opposed to actual returns earned year by year.&nbsp; The expected investment returns are then adjusted for inflation to preserve its purchasing power over the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The merits of&nbsp;such a system are also well-documented.&nbsp;&nbsp;It smoothens out fluctuation by avoiding the market volatility inherent in year-by-year investment returns.&nbsp; This, in turn, ensures a more predictable stream of income for the endowment administrator, in this case the Government, to tap on for its fiscal budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is: how is the expected long-term real rate of return derived and what is this figure?&nbsp; Would the Government propose a bigger number if it foresees the need to spend more?&nbsp; Or would a far more conservative figure be used instead so that we do not run the risk of being over-exuberant in our projections?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answers seem to lie in the hands of a list of who&rsquo;s who running the framework.&nbsp; It is stated that the expected long-term real rate of return is determined by the Minister&nbsp;for Finance, in consultation with the board of GIC and MAS.&nbsp; The figure is then submitted to the President, who then decides whether to agree with the proposed rate after consulting the Council of Presidential Advisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, while we can see that lengthy consideration and due process has been given to deriving the figure, we can expect more questions to surface: who comprises the board of directors of GIC and MAS, and how are they appointed?&nbsp; What is being done to ensure that the board, now also tasked to propose to the Minister for Finance the numbers pertaining to investment returns, is independent of the Government?&nbsp; Would there be a possible conflict of interest for the GIC board, which is also tasked to perform as a fund manager for the Government?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the expected long-term real rate of return is THE vital component of this new spending framework.&nbsp; It requires a leap of faith that the expected long-term real rate will indeed be representative of the investment returns over the long run.&nbsp; The expected long-term rate of return figure derived is in effect like a pin number to the ATM machine.&nbsp; I hence hope that the Finance Minister can have this figure and all information necessary for its computation made known in the interest of transparency.&nbsp; This is not a case of the \"devil is in the details\" but, with a spending principle of this importance, the \"god is in the details\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smoothing out of the asset base is also another critical component that needs to be further explained.&nbsp; The amount of capital gains that could be recognised hinges on the asset base in which the expected long-term real rate is applied upon.&nbsp; From the Minister&rsquo;s Second Reading speech yesterday, I gathered that the asset base will be smoothed out over a period of time with higher weighting to the more recent years.&nbsp; In years of rising asset values, the smoothed out asset base value will be lower than the current value, hence enabling the capital gains to be recognised as NIR gradually over a period of time.&nbsp; This concept of smoothing is perhaps also the reason why the Finance Minister can be fairly confident that the new framework would contribute an additional amount equivalent to 2% of the GDP to the budget in the next&nbsp;five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister shed further light if this is the correct understanding and&nbsp;would we still have contribution from NIR in a situation where asset base is declining but the long-term expected real rate of return is still positive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note in the Minister's speech that he expects expenditure to move up slightly higher after&nbsp;five years, that is, more than the additional 3% of the GDP.&nbsp; How would the Government intend to fund this higher expenditure in&nbsp;five years' time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, what matters is not just the nuts and bolts of the changes, but also what do they mean to the man in the street.&nbsp; In the US, this man in the street is now famously characterised by \"Joe the Plumber\".&nbsp; In our case, what does this change mean&nbsp;to the heartlanders, the workers, the professionals, the retirees, the stay-at-home motherss, NSmen, students, and so on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this issue of Net Investment Returns, we have to impress upon Singaporeans what the changes will mean to them, both in the short term&nbsp;&ndash; which essentially refers to what we spend&nbsp;&ndash; and long term&nbsp;&ndash; what we save.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, with this change in spending rules coming amidst an economic downturn in the near term, Singaporeans will hope that the Government will do more to strengthen the social safety nets.&nbsp; Tax-paying Singaporeans will be interested to know whether higher contributions from NIR would lead to the possibility of lower income tax.&nbsp; Would the step up in spending, in areas of capacity-building and infrastructure, lead to more jobs being created in the near future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing our reserves beyond the global inflation rate benefits the current generation as well.&nbsp; It helps secure high international credit ratings, which would trickle down to lower borrowing costs for companies in Singapore and promote economic activities. &nbsp;It strengthens our hand in managing the Singapore dollar exchange rate and renews confidence among foreign investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every extra dollar of reserve we save will give us another ounce of insurance that we will survive as a nation.&nbsp;

If you put a frog in a pot of hot water, the frog will jump out immediately.&nbsp; If you put a frog in a pot of cold water, it will&nbsp;swim happily.&nbsp; If you then very slowly heat up the water, the frog will continue to swim comfortably on and on, and eventually it will die pain-free.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I have spoken in this House about my concern of the Government&rsquo;s intent to widen the definition of&nbsp;NII (Net Investment Income) to include capital gains.&nbsp; I am afraid&nbsp;the Constitutional amendment before us to further change the shape to allow the Government to use the returns on our investment is another step to perdition.&nbsp; I am most concerned and worried&nbsp;this morning when I read the headline of <I>TODAY</I> &ndash; \"Pain Free Spending\".&nbsp; Sir, has our Government sent out the wrong message?&nbsp; Or is this what Singaporeans have come to expect of our Government&rsquo;s budgetary positions and policies?&nbsp; Or is it the beginning of what the frog has suffered&nbsp;&ndash; a case of&nbsp; \"pain-free dying\"?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is no such thing as easy money or pain-free spending.&nbsp; Just look at the two most recent financial crises.&nbsp; The 1997 Asian financial crisis had its root on easy credit on US Dollars, whereby&nbsp;Asian countries were borrowing easy credit on US Dollars to spend in their own currencies.&nbsp; The current sub-prime crisis was also caused by banks lending easy money to those people who could not otherwise afford the mortgage. And, Sir, we know, at the end of the day, we all have to pay for the real cost of these so called \"easy money\" or in the mouth of <I>TODAY&rsquo;</I> s reporter \"Pain free spending\".&nbsp; I therefore urge the Government to continue with its prudent and conservative approach when using returns from our reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was&nbsp;not too long ago that we shifted from the very prudently held stance of accumulating our reserves without spending much.&nbsp; Because of the efforts and prudence of our past Governments, we were able to accumulate and be in&nbsp;the strong position that we have today.&nbsp; Thus, I applauded Minister Mentor when he strongly objected to Dr Wang Kai Yuen&rsquo;s \"Three Buckets\" approach.&nbsp; Since then, we have started&nbsp;using the returns on our reserves.&nbsp; We started with just the interest and dividend, and now with the present amendment, we will also include capital gains.&nbsp; Sir, where do we stop?&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the current Government&rsquo;s reasons for the need to tap more funds&nbsp;from the reserves and I believe that our present Government is responsible and will not mis-spend our reserves.&nbsp; What I fear, Sir,&nbsp;is that we may experience greater pressure to further expand the usage of our reserves. Can we ensure that future profligate governments will not attempt to change the Constitution to draw more from our reserves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to safeguard our reserves against future wasteful and irresponsible government, we have institutionalised checks and balances in the form of the good office of the President, to hold an extra set of keys, for an added set of protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I would like to know if our President&rsquo;s Office has the resources and means to check on the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996, the then Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, in response to the late President Ong Teng Cheong, made a crystal clear view on the role and power of the President and the Prime Minister of Singapore.&nbsp; The President of Singapore is an elected position which does not enjoy executive power.&nbsp; The President is a custodial position. Only the Prime Minister has executive power.&nbsp; On paper and in principle, the difference between the two offices is clear.&nbsp; However, in reality, there might be ground for misunderstanding due to the difference in interpretations.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the incident of the late Mr Ong Teng Cheong&rsquo;s misunderstanding with the CPF Board over the interpretation on the use of their reserves to fund budget deficit can provide some lessons.&nbsp; Let us briefly go back in time in 1995. Then, the CPF Board submitted a budget consisting of expenditure of $27 million and&nbsp;revenue of $23 million, thereby using their reserves to offset the deficit of $4 million.&nbsp; CPF Board&rsquo;s reserves were on an \"accrual\" basis but the late President interpreted it as past reserves because there was an election that year leading to a change of Government.&nbsp; Back then, although the late Mr Ong held a different view from that of the Government, yet he still approved the CPF Board&rsquo;s budget.&nbsp; Given the late President&rsquo;s considerable standing in the eye of the community, what kind of storm and repercussion would have been created if Mr Ong had chosen not to approve the CPF Board&rsquo;s budget then?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am reminded of the stalemate in the United States&rsquo; Presidential Election of 2000, between Mr George Bush and Mr Al Gore, whereby the United States was left for a brief period, without a President pending the legal decision over who had won the Florida State electoral votes.&nbsp; Rubbish piled up and state employees were not paid during that period as a result.&nbsp; Singapore cannot afford to have that scene played out here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before he left office, the late President Ong, in a press release, highlighted several pointers on his tenure.&nbsp; Amongst the more controversial one relates to his regrets on not being able to execute his duty due to a lack of support from the public officers.&nbsp; One example, Sir, was the incident when the late President requested for a list of the State&rsquo;s assets and his subsequent interpretation of the reply from the Auditor-General that it would take \"56 man years\" to compile.&nbsp; That episode also highlighted another possible area for contention.&nbsp; The late President felt that to do his job, it was necessary for a compilation of all the State&rsquo;s assets, including State land.&nbsp; The Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office advised on the basis of the law that there was no need for the revaluation.&nbsp; This difference in opinion had led to the late President feeling that the public officers were not supporting his Office although it had not stopped him from doing his job to support the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we cannot deny the possibility of a future President who interprets his role differently and chooses to exercise his influence differently from the late President Ong.&nbsp; I shudder to think what kind of problems the future President might present to&nbsp;future governments in the event of a difference in interpretation.&nbsp; Singapore cannot afford political stalemate like that of the United States in year 2000 just because of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree that our President's Office is a non-executive one.&nbsp; However, we must equip and prepare the Office so that it would be able to carry out its role as the safe-keeper of our second set of keys.&nbsp; This is not because our current Government is not good.&nbsp; But we need&nbsp;to prepare for the unforeseen circumstances in future, when an irresponsible government is voted in and wants to start to squander away our hard earned reserves.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to call for more support&nbsp;for the Office of the President for him to carry out his functions effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to comment on the benchmark of the real growth that we are using under the new framework of NII.&nbsp; I think one of the inadequacies in this proposal is that it only takes into account&nbsp;the inflation rate.&nbsp; Using inflation as a benchmark only allows our reserves to stay as it is in today&rsquo;s dollar terms but does not allow it to grow.&nbsp; So, in the scenario when the world and our competitors are all performing well above the inflation rate&nbsp;and we just manage to do better than the&nbsp;inflation rate, our competitive edge is actually weakened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose that we should look beyond the inflation adjusted real returns.&nbsp; GIC and MAS hire many top brains&nbsp;from the financial sectors.&nbsp; It is therefore not unreasonable to expect that our reserves should outperform some international benchmarks on a long-term basis.&nbsp; These expected returns should be well above the inflation rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I therefore suggest using some suitable external benchmarks to measure the performance of our reserves.&nbsp; The future Government can only use the return if the rate of real return outperforms those benchmarks and in those instances anyway, only half of the out-performance should be used.&nbsp; If our real return is lower than what our reserves rightly deserve, the Government should not be allowed to use any of our returns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would also like the Minister to consider adding another dimension of benchmarking our reserves by considering the population growth.&nbsp; Let me explain why.&nbsp; If a person leaves behind $4 million to his four children, each one of them would have $1 million. Assuming his asset is to pass on to the next generation of&nbsp;eight grandchildren, and assuming that the asset has grown according to the inflation rate, the next generation would have, in today&rsquo;s dollar terms, been left with only $0.5 million&nbsp;each.&nbsp; Sir, what I am suggesting is that we should make sure that our reserves also&nbsp;grow in tandem with our population.&nbsp; As such, I propose that&nbsp;besides adjusting the returns&nbsp;according to the rate of inflation, we should also adjust it according to the rate of&nbsp;population growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, our population is about&nbsp;four million now. When it grows to&nbsp;six million, our reserves should grow by another 50% .&nbsp; If our reserves grows by less than 50%, effectively our per capita reserve would have shrunk.&nbsp; In that case, we should not then allow the future government to touch our reserves, no matter what the real returns might be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments,&nbsp; Sir, I support the amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 3.50 pm.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><I>at 3.30 pm until 3.50 pm.</I></p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=\"center\"><span class=\"iw-formspub-field-label\" title=\"H20081021_09_01_TeoGS\" style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 4px\"><em>Sitting resumed at 3.50 pm</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><span class=\"iw-formspub-field-label\" title=\"H20081021_09_01_TeoGS\" style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 4px\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><span class=\"iw-formspub-field-label\" title=\"H20081021_09_01_TeoGS\" style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 4px\"><strong>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"iw-formspub-field-label\" title=\"H20081021_09_01_TeoGS\" style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 4px\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</span></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I believe everyone in this House has heard about the story of the goose that lays golden eggs during&nbsp;their childhood.&nbsp; In the fable, the poor goose was killed because the owners got greedy and could not wait for the golden eggs to be laid.&nbsp; Our national reserves is like the goose that lays golden eggs and we had many golden eggs from the goose.&nbsp; We are prudent that we did not consume the entire golden egg each year but we just used&nbsp;half of the shell of the golden egg.&nbsp; The other half of the shell&nbsp;and&nbsp;the entire egg is reinvested to fatten our goose and&nbsp;make it lay bigger eggs each year.&nbsp; This has played an important role in&nbsp;Singapore's growth story over the last few decades.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is at a turning point in our demographic profile. The ageing demographics will mean that the Government will need to spend more on social programmes and&nbsp;healthcare. The Government has made appropriate adjustments and introduced initiatives such as Workfare, ComCare and Medifund.&nbsp; All the initiatives are good but they will need more resources.&nbsp; As a small nation without any natural resources, we are only dependent&nbsp;on our people.&nbsp; We have limited options, in terms of gathering more resources for such initiatives.&nbsp; The Government has highlighted that the increase&nbsp;in GST&nbsp;and the revision of the Net&nbsp;Investment Income to Net Investment&nbsp;Return will provide additional resources to make such initiatives sustainable.&nbsp; The amendment of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore will provide additional resources, but it simply means that we have to be prepared to accept a slower rate of growth of our national reserves.&nbsp; Instead of just taking half the shell, this amendment will allow the Government to use up to half&nbsp;of the entire egg, and the goose&rsquo;s growth will decrease.&nbsp; The question is: how will this amendment affect our annualised inflation-adjusted rate of growth of our national reserves?&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what is our current annualised inflation-adjusted rate of return from our national reserves for the last 10 years.&nbsp; And, with this amendment, how will it affect this particular growth?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional resources derived from the Net Investment Return is the fruit of labour of all Singaporeans, especially the older generation who have contributed and sacrificed so much for this country.&nbsp; To them, I would say that they would not understand&nbsp;the building of a new school or conversion to a single session mean to them.&nbsp; I think our esteemed colleague over here, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, has alluded to&nbsp;Joe the Plumber, which was made famous by John McCain in the&nbsp;Presidential debates.&nbsp; I would like to quote Mr Tan, the retiree.&nbsp; To&nbsp;a typical Singaporean, Mr Tan,&nbsp;a 70-year old retiree, what does this Amendment Bill mean to him?&nbsp; What will&nbsp;the changes mean to him, in terms of building new schools, constructing new highways and expanding new MRT lines?&nbsp; What is the implication to Mr Tan?&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that it is only right that&nbsp;additional resources should be used to support this group of Singaporeans who have sacrificed so much for this particular country. Can the Minister then make provisions to assure Singaporeans that&nbsp;more resources&nbsp;can be channelled into some of these programmes?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have received many comments from the public on my Facebook entry on this topic, and many have expressed concern that our national reserves should never&nbsp;be drawn down unless in emergency.&nbsp; None has urged the spending of the national reserves.&nbsp; And I am glad that Singaporeans do understand the importance of&nbsp;our national reserves.&nbsp; It is the bedrock of Singapore's foundation.&nbsp; I hope the Minister can reassure this House and the people of Singapore that this amendment will bring no harm to the health of our goose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand&nbsp;that to negate the market volatility and gyrations, the Government will be using long-term expected returns rather than actual returns to compute the Net Investment Return.&nbsp; I would like to know what would happen if this projection missed the target range for whatever reasons.&nbsp; If it is over projected, will it lead to an inadvertent draw down on our national reserves?&nbsp; If it is&nbsp;over projected, will this amendment allow for adjustment to increase the amount to be released to the Government later?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With the projected rate of return, will this&nbsp;translate into a key performance indicator or target for the GIC to achieve?&nbsp; If yes, will there be any risk of premature divestment of our long-term investments just to meet short-term targets?&nbsp; How can this be avoided?&nbsp; I do not want the GIC to kill the golden goose just to extract more eggs&nbsp;or to&nbsp;meet short-term targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.53 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliament is considering an important Constitutional amendment to our reserves framework.&nbsp; The immediate issue before us is just a formula change.&nbsp; How much income can the Government draw from the past reserves?&nbsp; We are changing the formula.&nbsp; The new formula will allow us to spend somewhat more.&nbsp; But the deeper significance of this amendment is to establish a more sustainable and equitable basis for spending out of the investment returns.&nbsp; Sustainable and equitable, so that we have resources which can benefit both the present generation and future generations.&nbsp; While we spend for our needs, we also put aside a solid buffer for contingencies, for the proverbial rainy day.&nbsp; That is the deeper meaning.&nbsp; But the most fundamental significance of this amendment is that it reaffirms the importance of protecting our reserves and of upholding the two-key system of our Presidential safeguards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These reserves are a major resource for Singapore.&nbsp; We have no natural resources.&nbsp; All Members who enter this House memorise that as a catechism &ndash; no timber, no iron, no gas, no gold&nbsp;&ndash; just our wits and our strength and our financial reserves which we have built up.&nbsp; And these financial reserves give people, Singaporeans and investors alike, confidence that Singapore is sound, strong and able to cope with anything which may come its way.&nbsp; They are our nest egg and insurance for a rainy day.&nbsp; So that even during tumultuous times like now, nobody has any doubt that we can weather the crisis.&nbsp; Imagine that if we did not have these reserves, would anybody take us seriously if the Singapore Government issued a guarantee on all the bank deposits in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; $700 billion of deposits&nbsp;&ndash; and we guarantee them? Guarantee them using what?&nbsp; Would we have accumulated $700 billion of deposits in Singapore if we did not have that kind of economy and that kind of strength and solidity?&nbsp; So people are prepared to bank here and to trust us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has taken us more than 30 years to build up the reserves to where we are today.&nbsp; We started accumulating them in the 1970s.&nbsp; It was a favourable external environment, which allowed Singapore to grow strongly year after year.&nbsp; We had a young population.&nbsp; We did not need high social spending.&nbsp; Healthcare was a very small proportion of our annual expenditure.&nbsp; The Government could adopt and did adopt prudent and conservative fiscal policies.&nbsp; And so we ran budget surpluses in good times, over many years and, in some years, huge budget surpluses.&nbsp; We were lucky, we were careful, we were successful.&nbsp; We collected the surpluses, we invested them carefully.&nbsp; They became our reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, MAS managed them because MAS was the central bank.&nbsp; MAS had to have enough to meet the needs for balance of payments&nbsp;&ndash; so many months of imports&nbsp;&ndash; and to meet the needs of managing the exchange rate so that nobody would try and have a go at the Singapore Dollar.&nbsp; But when the reserves grew larger than what we needed for the Singapore Dollar and for our balance of payments, then Dr Goh Keng Swee decided to split off a separate organisation&nbsp;&ndash; GIC&nbsp;&ndash; from MAS, solely dedicated to managing the reserves for long-term returns.&nbsp; This is so that it has only one mission&nbsp;&ndash; to manage the money.&nbsp; It is not responsible for the financial system; it is not responsible for the exchange rate&nbsp;&ndash; just make this money grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC was the forerunner of today&rsquo;s sovereign wealth funds, not quite the first in the world, but one of the first.&nbsp; It started with two employees initially, the Managing Director and his secretary, and now it has about 1,000 people working for it, from many nationalities, in offices here, London, New York and elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides GIC, we also built up the Government-linked companies.&nbsp; We started them one by one&nbsp;&ndash; DBS, Sembawang, SIA, Keppel.&nbsp; And as they grew, we transferred them over to Temasek Holdings to be managed commercially.&nbsp; Because we decided the Ministers had better run Ministries, and Ministries should not be running companies.&nbsp; Let us put the companies under proper holdings and proper management.&nbsp; And so we have two professional investment organisations&nbsp;&ndash; GIC and Temasek&nbsp;&ndash; highly regarded around the world for their competence and integrity, and their track record.&nbsp; They hire management internationally.&nbsp; They are meritocratic.&nbsp; They go by results.&nbsp; They are focused on their commercial objectives and their Boards are competent and experienced.&nbsp; They pursued sustainable returns over the long-term, and avoided excessive risk-taking for short-term gains.&nbsp;

We understood the nature of election politics.&nbsp; There are strong pressures to spend more, either for short-term benefits or for political advantage, and every election could become an auction of populist policies to spend the reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Singapore, the first generation of leaders and voters had gone through life and death political struggles and got Singapore out of poverty.&nbsp; We could rely on the fiscal prudence of the Government and the good judgment of the people to safeguard our reserves and to hold the line politically.&nbsp; To do the right thing and to convince people that this is the right thing and to stick by it&nbsp;&ndash; save, work, earn&nbsp;&ndash; not spend, relax, enjoy.&nbsp; But for the long term, we knew that we had to institutionalise safeguards in the system because otherwise we would be in trouble, whether it is a PAP Government or a non-PAP government in power.&nbsp; So we studied this carefully and took the first step in 1991, when we amended the Constitution to create the Elected President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elected President has a number of functions but protecting the reserves was one of the most important of them.&nbsp; And our priority&nbsp;&ndash; the first big move we took&nbsp;&ndash; was to protect the principal sum of the reserves.&nbsp; We said, \"past reserves, all those accumulated by previous governments, that is what should be locked up.&nbsp; Anything which the present Government accumulates, that is the right of the present Government to spend.&nbsp; You earn the money; you have the right to decide what to do with it.\"&nbsp; So we protected the principal sum of the past reserves, but we allowed the present Government to spend the income from those past reserves&nbsp;&ndash; which meant dividends and interests&nbsp;&ndash; on the argument that this is income which is accruing now and, therefore, it is income to the present Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a simple approach but not a perfect one.&nbsp; On the one hand, the Government could spend 100% of the income.&nbsp; So we were not putting aside part of the income to grow the nest egg for the future.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, when we said investment income, it was only interest and dividends.&nbsp; We did not count capital gains and we did not count capital losses, and both capital gains and losses can be significant in managing money.&nbsp; Also, we did not take inflation into account.&nbsp; So, if inflation is high, you may think you are earning money and drawing only on the income when, in fact, you are drawing down on the reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But anyway, we had taken a first major step, to protect the principal sum of the past reserves.&nbsp; Now, we had time to refine the scheme further as we gained experience with the new system.&nbsp; We could sleep at night peacefully and think about how to improve the locks on the door, since the door had already been locked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this new system came into effect, we debated for several years how to refine the balance between providing for present needs, and building up the nest egg for the future. This was the question in the 1990s which many Members would remember as the hotly debated &ldquo;Net Investment Income (NII)&rdquo;.&nbsp; The question is this.&nbsp; We are spending 100% of net investment income-interest and dividends. What proportion of this actually should be made available to the Government to spend?&nbsp; Should we lock up some proportion of the NII as past reserves?&nbsp; Because, although it accrues now when this Government is in office, in fact, the reason that it is coming now is because the principal sum was built up before this Government came into office.&nbsp; And if we are going to lock up some of it, how much would be reasonable?&nbsp; How much is neither too stringent nor too lax?&nbsp; How much is the right split between saving for the future and spending for now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The then President, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, had been a part of these discussions in Cabinet.&nbsp; So when he became President, he was in favour of having the Government change the Constitution forthwith and lock up 50% of the NII.&nbsp; But the Government was cautious.&nbsp; We had already made one move earlier to lock up the principal sum.&nbsp; We did not want to make another precipitate move, which might turn out to be too stringent or ill-judged, so we wanted to take more time to study this carefully.&nbsp; We studied this for several years before eventually deciding that it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; We decided on a 50-50 split between the present and the future, and implemented the new rule in 2001.&nbsp; We could see the pressures were there.&nbsp; MPs naturally want more social spending, and these are pressures which are understandable and which we have to take precautions to protect ourselves against.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why 50%?&nbsp; It is not an exact science why we came to this number, but I think 50% has a certain neatness and feels intuitively acceptable, because it underlines our commitment to continue growing our reserves, while allowing the Government to tap on part of the investment income for current spending.&nbsp; In a sense, we have put equal emphasis on both objectives&nbsp;&ndash; the present and the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus we went from 100% to 50% of NII, but we were not yet ready to change the interest and dividends framework.&nbsp; The other issues still remained&nbsp;&ndash; the question of capital gains and losses and the question of inflation.&nbsp; These had not been tackled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continued to study how we could improve our system.&nbsp; We looked at other governments, like Hong Kong and Norway.&nbsp; We studied some of the US Ivy League universities.&nbsp; The US Ivy League universities are the best, most established, and also the wealthiest.&nbsp; Some of them have built up huge endowments, and they have developed robust, sophisticated spending rules to preserve the value of their endowments, and generate a stable, sustainable income flow year after year.&nbsp; They face very similar challenges as we do, though a little simpler because it is only within the university context.&nbsp; They are only arguing with the professors how much money to spend, but the pressures are similar - how to grow it, how to have a stable flow, how to make sure that they do not overspend in good years and run out of money in bad years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the most interesting of the models is that of Yale University, which had studied this very carefully and worked out a very systematic framework and run it for many years.&nbsp; Fortunately, we had contacts with some of the people who operated the Yale endowments and we were able to pick their brains and understand how and why they did it this way.&nbsp; But we had to take these ideas and fit them into the Singapore context.&nbsp; There were three things we had to consider when we put them into the Singapore context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, economically, we needed a sound formula which would overcome the inadequacies of the present system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, politically, we needed a simple and fair system, which Singaporeans could understand and support and, most importantly, which can withstand political pressures to spend more.&nbsp; And these are very difficult.&nbsp; How to draw the line and stand firm, and not just say more is better?&nbsp; That is a big challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, constitutionally, we needed a scheme which would fit into our system of checks and balances, where the authority is split between Parliament which approves the money, the Government which decides what it wants to spend on, and the President who has custodial powers and can say no.&nbsp; We had, specifically, to take full advantage of the institution of the Elected President with custodial powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to take these theoretical ideas and fit them into our economic, political and constitutional requirements required many papers and a lot of work.&nbsp; We came up with proposals repeatedly, we discussed them amongst the Ministers, the President, and the CPA.&nbsp; We took in their views, and the matter went back and forth.&nbsp; Finally, after many iterations, the result is this Constitutional amendment, which has the President's support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment retains the principle of safeguarding 50% of our gains as past reserves, but it sets an important new basis for calculating the Net Investment Returns, and the key phrase is \"long-term expected real returns\" from our investments.&nbsp; Every word means something.&nbsp; \"Long-term\", because this set of rules looks beyond the current year, or even the next few years, because year-to-year or short-term conditions can be volatile and we want stability.&nbsp; We are talking about long-term, which is something around 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Expected\", because we are looking ahead, trying to judge prospects in a changing world rather than looking into the rear view mirror and going solely by past experience.&nbsp; The past is a guide to the future, but the future is often different from the past.&nbsp; If we look back over the last 20-30 years, those had been good years for markets, especially up till the dot-com boom.&nbsp; Interest rates came down, economies and companies prospered, share values went up, and everything went up.&nbsp; China was coming into the global economy, inflation stayed low, and it was a long boom.&nbsp; If we look forward, there are black, storm clouds right now, but even beyond the storm clouds, I think it would be foolhardy for anybody to project that the future will be the same as the last 20-30 years, and to expect the same returns as we have been getting over the last 20-30 years.&nbsp; So we have to look forward and decide what returns we can expect on a sustainable long-term basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Real\" returns, because we have to take account of inflation, not just the amount in nominal dollars, because every year prices go up.&nbsp; We have to account for inflation and subtract that out, and only deal with the real part of the returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, we are talking about \"returns\", meaning not just income and dividends, but total returns.&nbsp; Interest income, dividends, capital gains and losses&nbsp;&ndash; all forms of returns added together.&nbsp; Therefore, we are looking at long-term expected real returns.&nbsp; Memorise those words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The net effect of this change is to allow us to draw somewhat more than under the old formula, but we need to be careful how we are going to spend it.&nbsp; Broadly, with this additional money, our priorities ought to be on investments in our future&nbsp;&ndash; as Mrs Josephine Teo suggested yesterday &ndash; on infrastructure, education and R&amp;D, on increasing competitiveness and reducing direct taxes.&nbsp; These are indeed the Government's priority areas in the years to come. So this Constitutional amendment will enable us to fund these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also, most importantly, enable us to fund these programmes and investments on a long-term basis, and shield them from the vagaries of year to year economic and fiscal conditions. Because this is based on long-term returns, and we are also going to smooth out the capital sum on which we compute these returns.&nbsp; We are going to draw a steady amount &ndash; both in up years and down years.&nbsp; So that even in down years, long-term programmes can be assured of their funding and can continue.&nbsp; That is in fact a tremendous advantage to us.&nbsp; For example, R&amp;D is inherently a multi-year programme.&nbsp; We put in the investments, build up the laboratories, scientists and the capabilities, and do the research.&nbsp; Maybe 10-20 years later, or maybe even longer we will see the full fruits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other countries where the funding comes out of the current budget, R&amp;D and scientific work is very often whipsawed by short-term budget pressures.&nbsp; This year, in the US and Europe, they are under great pressure because budgets are tight.&nbsp; They have spent their money rescuing banks. How are they going to carry on doing R&amp;D?&nbsp; So, it is very unsettling for the scientists.&nbsp; It is a tremendous advantage for us that we can say in Singapore, we are committed to long-term support for R&amp;D and increasing the quality of education.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

And I am particularly grateful to Dr Ong Seh Hong, who read the <I>TODAY</I> newspaper, and, like me, had his eye caught by the headline which talked about \"pain-free spending\".&nbsp; This is precisely the wrong approach to this issue, because there is no free lunch.&nbsp; And if Members think that we are doing this because we just want more money, that is exactly what frightens us.&nbsp; That is the mindset against which this whole scheme is designed to protect, to prevent such casual wrong-headed squandering of hard-earned reserves&nbsp;&ndash; once gone, it is finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After making this rule change, we will still have to prioritise what we are going to spend on, which items we are going to spend on first.&nbsp; We will need to think carefully what we really need and how much we can afford.&nbsp; That is why when I proposed changing the NII formula two years ago, I also proposed raising the GST to 7%, to fund increased social expenditures&nbsp;&ndash; healthcare, Workfare, more Government help for the low-income and elderly.&nbsp; Because, in principle, social spending is something which is on-going, which if the Government needs to spend on, the people ought to pay for.&nbsp; But investments in the future, in principle, are about transforming the financial reserves into capabilities to generate new reserves.&nbsp; It is not a hard distinction, since money is fungible.&nbsp; But, in principle, I think those should be our mindsets.&nbsp; These two moves&nbsp;&ndash; the NII to NIR and the GST 5% to 7%&nbsp;&ndash; will put us in a sound fiscal position for the foreseeable future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Government is prudent and manages to accumulate surpluses in good years, then it is fair to share some of these surpluses with Singaporeans, eg, through the Progress Package, Growth Dividends and so on.&nbsp; Those, naturally, come out of current reserves.&nbsp; But if we need to spend more than we have available, then the Government of the day has to raise revenue to do this, and has to justify to voters why it is necessary to tax people in order to spend on these good causes.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim yesterday asked a question: will we need to burden the people further?&nbsp; I think she meant it as a rhetorical question but I can give her a serious answer:&nbsp; We cannot say.&nbsp; It depends on what programmes the Government decides to embark on.&nbsp; If we embark on an unconditional needs-based welfare system, such as the Workers' Party has proposed, then we will certainly add to the burdens of the people because then, the sky is the limit, and the money has to come from somewhere.&nbsp; But for this PAP Government, only in an exceptional situation, to meet extraordinary, non-routine spending, would we go to the President and the CPA and make a case why we should draw more from past reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have always to take a long-term view of these matters.&nbsp; Right now, the global financial system is under severe stress.&nbsp; Markets everywhere are in turmoil.&nbsp; America, Europe, Japan, all three economies are in recession or going into recession, and these problems will take more than a few months to clear; at least a year, quite possibly longer.&nbsp; Singapore cannot avoid the fallout.&nbsp; Our economy is competitive, our banks are sound, but we are linked to the world.&nbsp; As the Morgan Stanley economist Stephen Roach says, \"You either believe in globalisation or you believe in decoupling.&nbsp; You cannot be globalised and decoupled at the same time.\"&nbsp; And Singapore is globalised, we are not decoupled.&nbsp; So we have to be prepared for a rough time.&nbsp; This year, we have cut our growth forecast to 3%.&nbsp; In fact, the last two quarters (quarter-on-quarter) have been negative.&nbsp; We cannot predict next year's growth yet, but we can be sure the next one or two years will be difficult.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we are monitoring the environment and our economy very closely.&nbsp; We are preparing measures to help businesses reduce costs, households, especially low-income households, to lighten their burdens, and workers to tide over the downturn.&nbsp; By Budget next year in February, the situation will be clearer, and then we can decide what we will do.&nbsp; We have the resources to do this, and we have the resilience to see ourselves through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is quite a different outlook from the one we had when we decided to make this Constitutional amendment in 2006, just two years ago.&nbsp; Growth in 2006 was more than 8%, the markets were booming, and our investments were doing brilliantly.&nbsp; The formula we have come up with has to work in both circumstances.&nbsp; Supposing we had spent all the investment income in a good year.&nbsp; Then what will happen in bad years, when returns may well be negative, but when we most need the money?&nbsp; Therefore, our spending rule will be based on long-term expected returns.&nbsp; In good years, spend less than what we actually earn, and put aside more for the future.&nbsp; In bad years, try to preserve the value of our investments, but draw on our accumulated surpluses at a prudent rate.&nbsp; In this way, we can stabilise ourselves against volatility year-to-year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not time the Constitutional amendment to deal with this downturn.&nbsp; It was not designed for this downturn.&nbsp; But the amendment will put in place the right spending rule for this and future downturns as well as boom years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one question which I am sure many Members would have asked: in this recession, will we need to go to the President to spend more from past reserves?&nbsp; My answer is this:&nbsp; In a recession, our fiscal stance will naturally have to suit the prevailing conditions.&nbsp; In other words, we naturally have to have looser budgets, the tax revenues will come down, the spending will go up, and we are likely to run a budget deficit.&nbsp; Whether we run a deficit or a surplus, our policy will be dictated by economic considerations.&nbsp; So if we can run a surplus, we will do so.&nbsp; If we have to run a deficit, we will do so.&nbsp; If as a result of having to run a deficit, we need to ask the President's permission to draw on past reserves, then we will seek the President's permission and justify why we need to do that.&nbsp; But, fortunately, we have built up a comfortable buffer of current reserves since the last general election, which we can draw on if we have to run deficits over the next one or two years.&nbsp; Hence, for now, I do not foresee the need to draw on past reserves to finance deficits in the ordinary course of the Government's business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for exceptional contingencies, we will rely on past reserves and we will seek the President's permission to do so.&nbsp; For example, the Government guarantee on bank deposits which we announced last week, which is backed by $150 billion of our reserves.&nbsp; Mr Lim Hng Kiang, who is Deputy Chairman in MAS, has explained why and how we did this.&nbsp; This is not a normal item; this is an exceptional item in an exceptional situation.&nbsp; It is not a routine contingent liability which can be funded from this year's budget or even from the current reserves of this Government because this guarantee depends on the strength of the accumulated reserves of the Government.&nbsp; We do not expect to use up $150 billion.&nbsp; If we are lucky, very little of it will be drawn upon.&nbsp; But everybody must be convinced that the $150 billion is real, that it is there, and should the guarantee ever be called upon, the guarantee will be good.&nbsp; Therefore, this $150 billion is backed by our reserves.&nbsp; In case there is a payout, the past reserves may be drawn upon.&nbsp; This $150 billion has not been drawn yet, so it is not yet a draw on past reserves, but it is a contingent liability.&nbsp; Depending on how things turn out, there could be a draw sometime down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we sought the President's concurrence and the President consulted the CPA.&nbsp; In fact, we briefed both the President and the CPA on what this was about, and they considered the matter and agreed that the Government could issue a guarantee.&nbsp; This is the first time that the President is exercising his custodial powers to approve a potential draw on reserves in the almost 18 years that we have had the elected President system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This episode demonstrates three things.&nbsp; First, how careful the Government has been with money and with reserves; secondly, the importance of having reserves in a crisis; and, thirdly, how the President exercises his gatekeeper function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temptation to spend the money is always there, not just for Singapore but for other countries as well.&nbsp; I am gratified that many MPs have reminded us to be careful and not to go down the slippery path, but the path is slippery and we have to walk without slipping.&nbsp; Consider Norway&nbsp;&ndash; they discovered oil in the 1970s, and have become wealthy.&nbsp; They set up a Petroleum Fund in 1990 because they did not want to spend all the money and then be left with nothing when the oil was gone, like so many other oil producers.&nbsp; So they set up a Petroleum Fund in 1990 and put the proceeds from oil and gas sales into this fund to provide for the needs of the Norwegian population after the oil and gas reserves have run out.&nbsp; Today, the fund has accumulated about US$350 billion.&nbsp; But even in Norway, famously prudent, conservative, hardworking, frugal, Scandinavian people find it difficult to resist the populist push to spend just a little more.&nbsp; Originally, the money was to be totally locked up until the oil ran out.&nbsp; Then in 2001, they said no need to wait for the oil to run out.&nbsp; Every year we can spend a portion of the real earnings of the Petroleum Fund in the budget.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Norwegian Parliament set this as 4% of the value of the Fund.&nbsp; In other words, they considered 4% being the expected long-term real returns.&nbsp; But once they had set the rule, they broke the rule.&nbsp; In 2002 to 2005, every year the Government exceeded 4% on the basis that the economy was not doing well and, therefore, it was necessary to be counter-cyclical and spend more.&nbsp; In 2005, they renamed the Petroleum Fund as the &ldquo;Government Pension Fund &ndash; Global&rdquo;.&nbsp; Actually, it is not a pension fund, but they call it the \"Government Pension Fund &ndash; Global\" to remind Norwegians that this is not money which is meant to be touched.&nbsp; In 2006 and 2007, they spent less than 4%, not because they had gotten more stringent but because the oil prices went through the roof, and the Fund ballooned, so less than 4% was a lot of money.&nbsp; But even then, some Norwegians still clamour for more.&nbsp; In 2006, there was an article in <I>Newsweek</I>, which some Members may remember because the title is striking.&nbsp; The title was \"Trouble in Paradise\", because this is a country which had everything&nbsp;&ndash; oil, gas, etc.&nbsp; It was a welfare state, with all provided for, womb to tomb.&nbsp; But still there was an opposition party arguing that you should pump more oil and make more profits, to improve services and lower taxes.&nbsp; There is no way you can avoid these pressures.&nbsp; Their elections are due next year, then we will see whether the majority of Norwegians continue to uphold the principle of saving for the future.&nbsp; That is Norway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Australia provides another interesting example.&nbsp; In the recent two general elections in 2004 and 2007, the parties have competed to give away goodies to voters, almost like an auction.&nbsp; Australia also had a commodities boom because it has coal, iron ore, natural gas, uranium&nbsp;&ndash; the whole lot.&nbsp; So, in 2004 during the elections, John Howard's government promised to set up a Future Fund to put away part of the budget surpluses to pay for superannuation for retired public employees in the future.&nbsp; In other words, to pay for the future pension obligations of the government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Some Australian reports explained how this happened.&nbsp; His Treasurer, Peter Costello, had presented the Prime Minister with about 20 spending options for Howard to pick a few.&nbsp; He had these 20 possibilities and, according to the report, the Treasurer watched in awe as the PM seized them all.&nbsp; Costello said, \"He ordered everything on the menu: the entree, the main course, the dessert, the vegetarian option.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the most recent election in 2007, Howard announced a A$34 billion tax package on the first day of the campaign.&nbsp;

It's just a matter of timing and presentation before Labor joins the bidding game.\"&nbsp; And sure enough, Labor responded with its own A$31 billion package a few days later.&nbsp; Major newspapers in Australia started to keep track of the cost of campaign promises.&nbsp; They called it a 'pork-o-meter'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, John Howard's promises came up to A$65 billion, while Labor came to A$56 billion.&nbsp; But, finally, the election was not decided on the 'pork-o-meter'.&nbsp; Finally, in that case, the population just decided they wanted a change.&nbsp; They have had enough of the Liberal government and chose Kevin Rudd over John Howard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cite Norway and Australia not to criticise other countries.&nbsp; I am just citing them to show that such is in the nature of election politics.&nbsp; And to prove that, let me quote a passage by an American writer.&nbsp; Who exactly wrote this is uncertain, but Ronald Reagan quoted this twice many years ago and it reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the United States, the champion of democracy, and this is one view of the limitation of their system.&nbsp; When John McCain talks about earmarks, he is really talking about pork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is not immune to these pressures.&nbsp; We too face the reality of election politics.&nbsp; Opposition parties often demand that the Government spend more, particularly near election time.&nbsp; They never ask where the money will come from, least of all explain where the money for their programmes will come from at election time.&nbsp; Therefore, we have to take extra care to safeguard our reserves for the future, to frame the rules to prevent our elections from becoming auctions.&nbsp; Therefore, we need to put in place a system that will subject the government to tight fiscal discipline, regardless of which party is in power.&nbsp; A system which has the support of the population and which is firmly anchored in our Constitution and cannot easily be altered.&nbsp; And that is why we developed the system of a President who is directly elected to be the custodian of our reserves.&nbsp; The President has the legal power and moral authority to say no to the government, if he judges any government action to draw on reserves to be detrimental to the future of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government does not have a free hand to spend the money, because the President holds the second key.&nbsp; This provision binds the PAP Government too, but we support it.&nbsp; In fact, we have imposed this discipline regime on ourselves when we could have chosen not to do so.&nbsp; Why did we do this?&nbsp; Because we believe that it is a vital safeguard for the future, and a responsible Government that adopts prudent budgeting practices will not be overly constrained by the system in its year-to-year operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President's position is intended to be entrenched in the Constitution so that if the Government disagrees with the President's decision, we cannot just change the powers of the President.&nbsp; And the President's position is meant to be such that it cannot be altered by a routine Constitutional amendment&nbsp;&ndash; with a two-thirds vote in this House without the President's consent.&nbsp; However, we have not yet entrenched the Constitutional provisions, as Prof. Thio Li-ann pointed out yesterday.&nbsp; Prof. Thio also asked when we will do this, because it has been a long time since we created the system back in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is this. Our clear and stated intention is to refine the scheme and to iron out the issues that can arise in the light of experience, before we bring the entrenchment provisions into operation and entrench the rules.&nbsp; Our experience since 1990 has shown that this is a wise approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have delayed entrenching the scheme, we have, over the years, made a practice of consulting the President on any amendment which affects his powers, and informing Parliament of the President's view in the Second Reading speech.&nbsp; With one exception, in practice, the President has supported all the amendments which affected his powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last two decades, we have fine-tuned and improved the system of the Elected President in many ways.&nbsp; This present amendment on Net Investment Returns is a major refinement to the reserves protection framework.&nbsp; Prof. Thio said that this is a technical change.&nbsp; I think she is mistaken.&nbsp; This is a major, important amendment.&nbsp; After this amendment, we will operate the revised spending rule for a few years.&nbsp; If after five years, no further major changes are necessary, we will consider entrenching the provisions concerning the President's custodial powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was significant that Ms Sylvia Lim, speaking yesterday on behalf of the Workers' Party, had supported this amendment.&nbsp; It is a responsible approach; we applaud this.&nbsp; It will help us to establish an important rule which both Government and Opposition will accept and uphold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that the Workers' Party now accepts the wisdom of having an Elected President with custodial powers, because that is at the core of this Amendment and is what this whole structure depends upon, and will no longer campaign to abolish the Elected President as it did in the 2006 elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once all the parties accept that the reserves are not to be raided, we can avoid elections becoming auctions, paid for by mortgaging our children's future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a duty not just to govern Singapore properly today, but to do our best to safeguard the future of Singapore.&nbsp; Our reserves are our nest egg.&nbsp; It is not inherited by luck, but by hard work, prudent fiscal policies and sound investments over 30 years.&nbsp; If we had to start from zero today, it would take us far longer to build up the reserves, if at all it were possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The population is ageing, our spending needs are increasing and the economy is no longer growing at 8%-10% per year.&nbsp; Furthermore, the global environment is uncertain.&nbsp; It is unlikely that any global investor can repeat what we have achieved over the last 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this proposed Constitutional change is a workable approach that strikes the right balance between present needs and the interests of future generations.&nbsp; It will enable Singaporeans to benefit from our reserves, and yet conserve the value of what we have built, and continue to grow it over time as the economy itself grows. And this way, we can hand over to our children more than what we inherited from our forefathers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I therefore support the amendment.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.&nbsp; I have the unenviable task of speaking after the Prime Minister.&nbsp;But as&nbsp;these concerns are reflective of my residents and all,&nbsp;please&nbsp;allow me&nbsp;to go through them.&nbsp; I will try to keep them short.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on timing.&nbsp; The timing of this change, although coincidental, could not have come at a better time to boost confidence and reassure both investors and citizens of a proactive Government that thrives on long termism as opposed to short termism.&nbsp; And, in fact, short termism is a fault that most corporate and some governments are guilty of.&nbsp; Of course, with this change, in the short term, the new framework for spending investment returns would, hopefully, translate into an expansionary fiscal policy, which will be most helpful especially during a period of global economic downturn, which we&nbsp;expect in the next 12 months.&nbsp; The real gain, however, is in the long-term funding of the&nbsp;three focus areas of spending, which is&nbsp;growing our economy, creating a top quality home and upgrading our socio-economic infrastructures to cater to an ageing society and rising gini coefficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, transparency.&nbsp; A total returns approach increases transparency as it takes into consideration both income and capital gains&nbsp;which I think better reflects the success or failure, our shortcomings,&nbsp;of our&nbsp;investments of our reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, it is also a congruence with nation building objectives. Using a long-term expected returns approach instead of actual returns earned from year to year makes much better sense, as it is much&nbsp;more congruent with our socio-economic policies, which, I believe, are&nbsp;built on long-term national objectives and projections, rather than dependent on short-term fluctuations.&nbsp; In fact, one of the biggest problems of the financial institutions and its woes is that it has been pandering to short-termism &ndash; looking at quarterly or yearly shareholder value returns, rather than building longer-term fundamentals and infrastructures that will ultimately contribute to a stronger institution and fund performance.&nbsp; Hence, planning and aligning spendings with long-term national objectives in mind will&nbsp;certainly help to focus&nbsp;the Ministry of Finance and&nbsp;Singapore on the right issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, reduce uncertainties. Using a long-term expected returns approach will also help us to even out the volatility of the market place, which in the fast pace flat world today, will witness shorter periods of booms and busts, and add uncertainties to economic development.&nbsp; This approach also has a side effect.&nbsp; It is common knowledge that in business, the number one&nbsp;enemy is uncertainties.&nbsp; Hence, if uncertainties of the market place cannot be helped, reducing the uncertainties of government expenses, or at least the direction of government expenses, will help businesses do their sums, and make Singapore a more attractive place for businesses. &nbsp;This applies, in particular, to economic driver sectors like construction. Perhaps to reduce the uncertainty further, could the Minister give more clarity to what is meant by the terminology 'long term' in today's context?&nbsp; In the fast pace flat world, the notion of time has shrunk, and&nbsp; the term 'long term' is also&nbsp;shrinking.&nbsp; Hence, is the basis of&nbsp;three investment cycles or 20 years an adequate guide for long-term projections, even with periodic reviews?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the expected returns methodology.&nbsp; The Minister mentioned that the&nbsp;historical return may not be reflective of future actual gains. &nbsp;I agree with him.&nbsp; However, would the Minister also agree that projected future rates of return may also not reflect actual future rates of return?&nbsp; In other words, all projections of expected returns, historical or future, carry an inherent risk of not getting it right.&nbsp; The Minister explained that as investment returns depend on asset allocation mix, which can change from time to time, historical rates of return will not be accurate for long-term projection.&nbsp; Perhaps, MOF can use the new asset allocation portfolio and do a regression analysis (or any other statistical methodologies) of the investment portfolio based on historical data, and use this as a reference for projecting 'expected returns'. This will help give a projected range of expected returns based on actual historical data and projected future experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, on the spending benchmark.&nbsp; The Minister mentioned that the new framework for spending investment returns, together with the increase in GST, will add 3% of GDP to our yearly expenditure plans.&nbsp; Can the Minister also enlighten us on what is then the&nbsp;total projected spending as a percentage of GDP?&nbsp; Would it be 18%? And how does that then&nbsp;compares with other developed economies?&nbsp; I understand that at 15%, which is the current spending, it is lower than other developed economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, how much of that increase will go into creating social infrastructures? And&nbsp;who do we benchmark against?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the spending cap of 50%, the Prime Minister has explained that it is an equitable,&nbsp;sustainable and intuitively acceptable number.&nbsp; So I guess&nbsp;I have to accept that explanation too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On excluding Temasek Holdings,&nbsp;although the nature of Temasek Holdings' investment strategy involves higher risks and is still evolving, I trust that the&nbsp;fund managers are still subjected to a projected return regime. &nbsp;There is also a spending cap of 50% which can be called upon to lower or increase the spending funds and, as such, there&nbsp;appears little need to exclude Temasek Holdings from the new regime.&nbsp; But if indeed it is&nbsp;prudent to allow Temasek Holdings to evolve its investment strategy, then could the Minister confirm if a timeline has been set for Temasek's inclusion?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impact on Singapore dollar&nbsp;and reputation.&nbsp; With a higher withdrawal amount and a slower rate of increase on our reserves, may I ask what is the implication on our reputation as a financial hub&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the impact on the strength of the Singapore dollar?&nbsp; Does it have any repercussions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On strengthening&nbsp;our society, I am particularly heartened by the emphasis on spending on social infrastructure to strengthen our society.&nbsp; This, however, has to be done with a huge degree of sophistication, emphasising on the need to adopt a whole of Government approach in tackling social concerns.&nbsp; Singapore is built on the ethos of hard work, integrity and diligence of its people.&nbsp; From a swamp with civil strife, its people worked hard and united under the able leadership of the PAP to arrive at a developed nation status.&nbsp; The next lap will see challenges of a more affluent generation and an ageing society, where traditional work ethics and definitions of \"success\" and \"life\" will be challenged.&nbsp; In fact, traditional values are already being tested as we speak and top of the news today is the headline \"Pain Free Spending\".&nbsp; We have to guard against a complacent society, and one that relies on the Government to be the provider and advisor from cradle to grave&nbsp;&ndash; when to get married or give birth, what jobs and education training&nbsp;are needed, what to invest in, is there a bailout, to retirement planning and maybe even death planning. We need to build a society that is resilient and self-reliant.&nbsp; I remember many years ago in a Budget debate, the Prime Minister, who was also the Minister for Finance, mentioned that the Government could not be the last resort of anything at all.&nbsp; It is therefore critical that Government spending on strengthening our society should emphasise on building capacity within the people for a self-reliant society, rather than provide end products, that cultivates dependency which will erode the ethos of hard work, diligence&nbsp;and self-help.&nbsp; In short, the Government spending on social infrastructure especially should be outcome-based, rather than output-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prudent strategy would be to spend on building an ecosystem for a social economy.&nbsp; According to the Human Resource and Social Development Canada, I quote, \"The social economy is a grassroots entrepreneurial, not-for-profit sector, based on democratic values that seeks to enhance the social, economic and environmental conditions of communities, often with a focus on their disadvantaged members.\"&nbsp; The social economy is built on a caring and sharing society, it is an economy that solutions from within the community.&nbsp; Typically, social economy enterprises are a result of broad-based community development strategies involving the 3Ps&nbsp;&ndash; the people, public and private sectors&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the media,&nbsp;academia and other partners.&nbsp; Social enterprises and cooperatives are examples and integral parts of the social economy which emphasise on giving communities the hand-up, and not just&nbsp;hand-outs. It reinforces dignity and pride even amongst the once down and out, and propels creativity and innovation to problem solving, and creates collective wealth through the production of goods and services.&nbsp; I hope the increased spending would be generously directed to strengthen existing gaps in the social economy; the chief being capacity building, access to finance and research.&nbsp; It is far better to enable the \"many helping hands\" than to become the only hand.&nbsp; Only then, can we strengthen our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a very important Constitutional change which impacts Singapore and Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment, I urge financial prudence on the part of the MOF in the budgeting process.&nbsp; I also urge the strengthening of hands and legs, integrity and mettle, sharpening of eyes and ears on the part of the Presidential key.&nbsp; Sir, I also urge clear, simple communication of these and future Constitutional amendments to all Singaporeans because they are stakeholders of this land and, of course, guardians of our reserves.&nbsp; After all, it is the duty of the people to tell the Government what to do and not for the Government to tell the individuals what they should do with their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The financial turmoil that engulfed the world would certainly set the tone as we debate this amendment.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a layman would call this the perfect storm.&nbsp; And they are probably right as so many small investors are affected.&nbsp; From the profile of people residing in Ang Mo Kio who had spoken to me and their entreaties, I sensed that many have not bargained for their savings to be almost wiped out.&nbsp; And many, totally ignorant till September of what a derivative is, would&nbsp;not have consciously traded a promised 5% annual return in exchange for a downside of total capital destruction, if they had understood the risks or the intricacies of the instruments they have put their money in.&nbsp; Many pleaded for intervention as they are retirees and would not have the economic headroom and lifeline for revival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why is this relevant in this debate?&nbsp;It is relevant because this Government and the previous terms of Government had&nbsp; approached our financial policies with spade loads of conservatism and prudence.&nbsp; It aggressively admonished anyone who pushed for wider leeway in the use of the returns from our reserves.&nbsp; And this resolute stand in the face of pressure to spend more has stood us well in this current climate.&nbsp; Without the bedrock of reserves, how else would the Government be able to guarantee the deposits in Singapore banks?&nbsp; In the days to come, as the crisis unfolds, there would surely be more demands, the likes of which we have not contemplated before.&nbsp; Only the wealth we are sitting on gives the confidence that we would emerge, not only&nbsp; just fine but even stronger.&nbsp; For Singapore has prudently kept its financial firepower dry and would be among the few that can take advantage of investments opportunities that would present themselves in time to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; in the context of this amendment, I believe that two key principles must be religiously upheld.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the continual squirreling away of our gains must be the order of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a Gibraltar rock of reserves is the only way to ensure that the ability of future generations of Singaporeans to react with confidence in crises of the future is not impaired.&nbsp;The outcome of the debate today would set the stage of what Singapore would be like in years to come, the Singapore of our children&rsquo;s generation.&nbsp; The wealth, the international stature that&nbsp;we enjoy, and being able to punch way above our weight in regional politics and international finance, came about as a result of long-term, forward-looking, steadfast and resolute policies.&nbsp; By extension, the second principle&nbsp; must be to maintain a long-term perspective of our challenges and the strategies we have in place to come up on top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These past two years, we have confronted the issues of an ageing population, hence, CPF LIFE; the increasing need to tackle the financial needs of a group of Singaporeans who would be unable to keep up as the income gap grows and inflation persists, hence, Workfare and ComCare; and the burgeoning healthcare costs. We also confronted the need to be an attractive place for global talents to set up home and businesses here by reducing tax rates; and the pressure of continuous investment in the infrastructure prerequisite of a future city that has its appeals for both work and play.&nbsp; Certainly not an easy equation to balance&nbsp;&ndash; rising expenditure while reducing tax rates and at the same time balancing the budget.&nbsp;It would be to our peril if we rely solely on further near term GST increases as a source of additional funding. Or to pray for future GDP growth to fund these growing needs.&nbsp; Pray we should.&nbsp; The Gods may smile on us, but we are better off putting in place the initiatives that would enhance the probabilities that we stay ahead of the game.&nbsp; In the throes of our emergence as a nation some 40-plus years ago, at a time when we had meager resources, it had not stopped us from investing in infrastructure&nbsp;&ndash; Paya Lebar Airport and then Changi, the massive Port of Singapore, Jurong Industrial Park, to name a few.&nbsp; It has not stopped us from investing in education, and it has not stopped us from investing in defence, as we have confidence that we have something to defend for.&nbsp; Now that we have more, we should plant more seeds for the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I support the need to give the Government the flexibility to plan long term in the light of the challenges with this requested ability to dip into the total returns from our reserves.&nbsp; The flexibility to have more resources to deploy to combat our challenges&nbsp; will certainly increase our chance of thriving.&nbsp; We should be less enamoured by the maintenance of the <I>status quo</I>, but more driven by the pursuit of a better life, a sustainable future for our children,&nbsp;be it investment in infrastructure, investment in education of our people, investment in societal fabric, investment in key growth industrial sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that we maintain the ability to tackle our social issues on a long-term basis and also continue to invest in what would position us to be a global metropolis&nbsp;- be it in infrastructure,&nbsp;research or&nbsp;staying Green.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is not a given that the more we spend the better off we would be, I believe that we would enhance our chances.&nbsp; On this belief, I am behind the concept of a long-term expected real rate of returns as the sensible approach in estimating the funds available for current and future needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the very least, the Government spending would not need to be held ransom to the vagaries of the market.&nbsp; However, I hope that calculation of this long-term expected real rate of returns will be made entirely transparent and that governance will be set in place, and the resources made available to ensure&nbsp;that the process withstands scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we strive to divorce ourselves from the volatility that prevailing market conditions would have on the ability of the Government to commit to long-term spending, it is extremely important that we also do not fall into the trap of overspending future income.&nbsp; As such, an explanation from the Minister on why 50% of the NIR is a prudent number is sought.&nbsp; Just two months ago, it may have passed muster.&nbsp; Today, when many have seen their portfolios decimated over a short period of time, it is important that the rationale for this 50% split between&nbsp;now and&nbsp;future be clearly articulated.&nbsp; Further, maybe as a guide to the prudence of the proposed change, can the Minister inform the House what would have been the total funds available to the Government if we had not gone 50% NII in 2001 but gone 100% NII instead, and compared for that same period if we had gone 50% NIR, ie,100% NII compared to 50% NIR in the period 2002 to 2008?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, as we all know, there is a crucial difference between realised and unrealised capital gains.&nbsp; What would feed social needs and investment needs is cash.&nbsp; With so much of Singaporeans' assets tied up in real&nbsp;estate on the island, the strength of the Singapore currency is of paramount importance to all of us.&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp; as we generate the cash to pay for the big bills, we continue to keep a close eye on the strength of our currency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point I hope to get assurance is the continuous emphasis on maintaining a lean Government.&nbsp; It is a slippery road downhill towards a fat government, especially if there is money.&nbsp; This debate would have brought home to many Singaporeans that even as we&nbsp;husband our reserves over the years, they could only have grown, be it compounded at 5%, 8% or 15%, with the skills of the people who have their hands on the throttles in GIC, MAS and Temasek.&nbsp; To expect that we continue to enjoy long-term growth in our reserves depend so critically in the talents that we have.&nbsp; We must continue to lay our hands on the best financial talents and, at the same time, nurture a local crop of expertise so that we can continue to be assured that the investment of our reserves&nbsp;is in competent and loyal hands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

However, what keeps businesses, tourists and foreign investments coming back to Singapore is the confidence they have in us.&nbsp; And this confidence is buttressed by sound transparent policies, supported to a large measure by a broad spectrum of Singaporeans.&nbsp; This can only be possible if we also continue to invest in matters of societal stability.&nbsp; As the Government has more means, today, the call is even more strident.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me close by recounting the story of this 60-year old woman who came to MPS.&nbsp; $50,000 was all she had to her name and which she faithfully placed in fixed deposits.&nbsp; Last year, she was convinced that 6% was better than 1% by switching out of the fixed deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it is $32,000.&nbsp; She panicked and pulled out realising the loss.&nbsp; This is a woman who barely spoke Mandarin, much less being able to understand the&nbsp;legalese of financial documents that she signed.&nbsp; As we debate to release more resources, I hope that we also slay another sacred cow by rebuilding the safety net for Singaporeans of this age group that had been handed the short end of the stick in this current financial climate.&nbsp; Hence, I end by asking the Minister to assure us that enough of the additional funds released through this proposed amendment be put aside for needy Singaporeans who have, for one reason or another, end up in poor conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What will happen if the Elected President takes an adverse approach?&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Government can be crippled, in a sense.&nbsp; So, we are of the view that, perhaps,&nbsp;the office of the&nbsp;Elected President has&nbsp;fundamentally changed our parliamentary democracy system,&nbsp;where the Executive is supposed to&nbsp;be the supreme power elected and trusted by the people.&nbsp; We believe that we can use other alternatives or mechanism to preserve and&nbsp;safeguard our reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;on the other hand, we are also of the view that&nbsp;the Office of the Elected President could potentially&nbsp;serve to cripple&nbsp;a non-PAP government, given the fact that a lot of important appointments require the Elected President's approval. &nbsp;Given&nbsp;the criteria for the office of the&nbsp;Elected President as it is now&nbsp;&ndash; as to who qualifies&nbsp;to participate as candidate for Elected President&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it is likely that&nbsp;he may come from the establishment or he may be a PAP Minister.&nbsp; So, with the political motive at the back, a non-PAP government being elected could be crippled by the Elected President. &nbsp;With all these reasons and thinking behind, I do not think we are currently prepared to review our position.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would first like to thank Members for their very good contributions to the debate and their support for the Bill. I will be addressing the main issues that Members have raised yesterday and today in this round-up speech.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill introduces a new framework for spending the investment returns of the assets managed by the MAS and the GIC. The Government will be spending on the basis of total real returns, which include capital gains and losses.&nbsp; But it will do so by applying a forward-looking assessment of the long-term expected rate of return on these assets, rather than go by actual returns earned year by year.&nbsp; I have explained the reasons for this framework yesterday.&nbsp; There are two outcomes coming out of this new framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we expect to have available additional resources estimated at slightly over 2% of GDP for spending.&nbsp; If you add that to what we currently already derive from Net Investment Income (NII) in the current framework, that will give a total of about 3% - 3.5% of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second outcome is that we do expect that, with the new framework, our reserves will continue to grow minimally at the rate of inflation. But under most likely circumstances, there will be real growth of our reserves&nbsp;&ndash; real growth that should keep pace with the growth of our economy over the long term.<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the GST revenue which amounts to about 0.8% of GDP, the additional revenues that we are getting through the new NIR framework of slightly over 2% will give us an additional 3% of GDP, which should be sufficient for the Government to fund its additional expenditure plans. Hence, we do not expect to raise additional revenue in order to implement our plans.&nbsp; We aim to spend, but spend judiciously, to build up capabilities for the future and strengthen our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have generally agreed that the new spending formula is fair and equitable. We have also agreed that it is a sustainable formula, one that will not lead to the reserves being drawn down, and one that ensures that we continue to generate a future stream of income that will be stable across generations. The questions that have been raised, which are important ones, are largely to do with ensuring that this new framework is implemented prudently and that what we derive in revenues will be spent wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Long-term expected returns</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first turn to the broad theme that cuts across many of the comments raised by Members, which is: how do we derive long-term expected real returns?&nbsp; Many Members have raised this&nbsp;&ndash; Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mrs Josephine Teo, Mr Gautam Banerjee and Ms Jessica Tan.&nbsp; How do we derive long-term expected real returns?&nbsp; And what happens when actual performance, over a number of years, does not match what we expected?&nbsp; This is a valid concern, and I am glad that the whole tone of Members' comments was to underline the importance of not overspending on the basis of expected returns, rather than a desire to want us to spend more, even when actual returns are not sufficient.&nbsp; I think that is the right tone for our debate. Let me explain how we go about this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But before I do, I want to first address a point that both Mr Christopher de Souza and Prof. Thio Li-ann raised, which is about the lack of precise definition of certain terms in the Constitution&nbsp;&ndash; terms such as \"long-term\", \"expected rates of return\" or the inflation indices that we will use in deriving real rates of return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a valid question and we did think hard about what we put into the Constitution or, instead, leave out of the Constitution and put into a White Paper which will be tabled to Parliament after the Bill is passed and gazetted.&nbsp; We have decided to put the technical procedures and operational definitions into the White Paper so that they can be reviewed after some years of experience, rather than hard-wire such details in the Constitution.&nbsp; The details are really quite technical: the exact time horizon that we will use in determining long-term returns, the specific definition of global inflation&nbsp;&ndash; whether it is G3, G7 or some other global index&nbsp;&ndash; or, even more technical, the exponential weighting system by which we smooth our asset base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we put all these things into the Constitution, the Constitution will be even more detailed than the Financial Procedures Act.&nbsp; So, we put it in the White Paper, and let us review it from time to time as we gain experience with the system. In that way, we can make changes from time to time and incorporate them in the way we work the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Governance and transparency</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, therefore, move to the broader issue that was raised with respect to the governance of this process of determining long-term expected returns and transparency.&nbsp; First, let me say that there are basically two approaches to how we can go about this.&nbsp; Two fundamentally different approaches to how we can go about determining long-term expected returns for spending on the Government budget.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first approach is to be fully transparent and have Parliament evaluate whether the expected rates of return are appropriate. I am glad Mr Siew Kum Hong raised this because it is an approach that a few other places practise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second approach, which is the one that we have adopted, is not to go for full transparency but to insulate this process of determining long-term expected rates from political pressures or the mood of the day.&nbsp; This second approach relies on us having the right people in charge.&nbsp; It relies on us having robust checks and balances within the system. It is also an approach which says that if, even with the right people and robust checks and balances, we cannot come to an agreement on the long-term expected returns, then let us have a pragmatic dispute resolution mechanism. And we are opting now for a dispute resolution rule that says we fall back on the last 20 years of historical returns&nbsp;&ndash; neutral, factual and objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PM has spoken about what happens under the first approach. There are live examples of this.&nbsp; PM spoke about Norway and Australia.&nbsp; There are other examples like Chile. And it is almost in the natural workings of society and parliaments that, over time, full transparency and leaving things to the market of political opinion lead to a desire to spend more, conserve less and leave less for future generations.&nbsp; There is an upward bias that is inherent in the spending rules in these countries.&nbsp; At the very least, I would say the jury is out on the model of full transparency in Norway, although I think a sensible person looking at what is happening will want to be very cautious about even trying it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is a different model, which we believe over time, faces less danger of bias in favour of overspending and not conserving our reserves.&nbsp; We insulate the process of determining long-term expected rates from political pressure.&nbsp; We derive the rates of return on the basis of the best professional inputs and advice, so that we get the most realistic assessment of what is likely in the future.&nbsp; But we also set a spending cap in the Constitution, based on the expected real rates of return, a spending cap that is not open to fiscal discretion, no matter what majority the Government has. It is written into the Constitution - 50%&nbsp;&ndash; in addition to writing in sufficient checks and balances in the system between the Government and the President as advised by the CPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an imperfect system.&nbsp; The approach that we have adopted is an imperfect system - it relies on judgment, it is not about perfectly objective data and, more importantly, it relies on having the right people in the right places. That is the pre-condition for this approach to work well.&nbsp; If we do not have the right people in place, it will be a highly imperfect system.&nbsp; But if we do have the right people in place, it is a system which is likely to be superior to the alternative system of complete transparency, in the faith that this market of political opinion will somehow or other conserve resources, spend wisely and prudently.&nbsp; That is our belief, and it is also a belief that has been evidenced by what we can see around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Process for determining the long-term expected rate of return</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is the governance part of it. Next, how do we actually go about the process of determining the long-term expected rates of return?&nbsp; It is not a mechanical process, it is not a purely technical process, but neither is it pure judgment.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not putting a finger in the wind.&nbsp; It is a combination of objective analysis, hard data, professional inputs, but it also relies on seasoned judgment by people who have been in the business for a long time and who are cautious about short-term cycles determining their long-term views of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year, the estimated rates of return will be reviewed by the Boards of MAS and GIC, and the Government.&nbsp; Each year, the Boards will take a fresh look at the long-term expected return over the next 20 years on a rolling basis, so that they can take all new information into account.&nbsp; The Boards will certify to the Government what they believe to be the most realistic view of the next 20 years.&nbsp; The Government considers this and then provides its proposals to the President.&nbsp; The President consults the CPA and then decides whether to concur with the expected rates of return proposed by the Government each year.&nbsp; And if there is no agreement between the President and the Government, then we fall back on the dispute resolution mechanism, uncontentious and simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want to get into great detail on how the Boards of MAS and GIC will, in fact, determine this. Let me just assure Members that there are established methodologies used by well-run endowment funds.&nbsp; And indeed these are methodologies that have been practised for some time for the Boards&rsquo; own purposes in the MAS and GIC. Starting with individual asset classes, for instance, looking at government bonds across various countries, looking at the inflation and growth outlook, and determining the expected rates of return for that asset class&nbsp;&ndash; government bonds.&nbsp; Next, looking at corporate bonds, applying a credit risk premium on top of what we derive for government bonds, and looking at listed equities applying an equity premium, and so on.&nbsp; So, they do it for each of the asset classes.&nbsp; And for each of those asset classes, they also look at historical returns, not just over the last five or 10 years but over decades.&nbsp; And then, finally, adding up the asset classes together, aggregating it into an expected return for the overall portfolio based on the asset allocation strategy of the Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These are robust methods established internationally, which are constantly refined.&nbsp; They are not perfect and they are not purely technical exercises as judgment is involved, but they are robust methods that we can draw on and we constantly share amongst comparable organisations internationally. I would emphasise, once again, that the Boards will take reference from the historical performance of each asset class over varying periods of time.&nbsp; But seasoned investment professionals and the boards of MAS and GIC do also know that historical returns do not always repeat themselves.&nbsp; And, in fact, the historical rate of return that has been earned in the past 20 years is very unlikely to repeat itself in the next 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was not much discussion on this five years ago.&nbsp; But now with the crisis that we are in, there is a sobering up and there are some very good articles on this.&nbsp; I just read one recently in the latest issue of the <I>Economist</I>, either last week or this week, a very useful article&nbsp; pointing out that bear phases and bull phases in the stock market do not just last for five or six years; they last for 17 or 18 years.&nbsp; In fact, if we look at the last two decades, it comprised a 17-year bull run, from 1983 to 2000.&nbsp; Then it collapsed with the tech bubble bursting in 2001.&nbsp; But then there was another bull run from 2003 to October last year.&nbsp; So, despite the tech bubble crash, if we take the 20 years leading up to October 2007, with all the ups and downs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had an average annual return of 10.2%.&nbsp; And MSCI World global-listed equities averaged 7.4%&nbsp;&ndash; a remarkable performance over a long period of time despite cycles in between.&nbsp; So, that is what is called a \"secular period\" in the investment world&nbsp;&ndash; not a cycle, but something that stretches across cycles.&nbsp; It is a secular phase which seasoned investment professionals do not believe will be repeated in the next secular phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that is worth bearing in mind, that the Boards will look very carefully and rigorously with the advice of their teams of investment professionals at what has happened historically, but they are not simply going to project the future based on what happened in the past.&nbsp; Judgment is involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Boards will then provide the Government with what they believe to be the most realistic projections, completely uninfluenced by the spending rules that the Government has employed.&nbsp; The Government then has to decide whether to accept the Board's judgments on the expected rates of return.&nbsp; I would say, in particular, that where there is significant uncertainty over the outlook, the Government will want to err on the conservative side in deciding on whether to take the Board's projections as they are, or whether to moderate it.&nbsp; Where there is uncertainty, as a Government, we will want to err on the conservative side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I quite agree with the MPs&nbsp;&ndash; Ms Lee Bee Wah and Mr Liang Eng Hwa who spoke this afternoon, and several others&nbsp;&ndash; who cautioned against over-exuberance in projecting expected rates of return, and emphasised the need to be prudent in our projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Government provides its proposal to the President, who will seek the advice of the CPA.&nbsp; We do not simply provide the President with a figure.&nbsp; He is not opening an envelope and taking out a piece of paper and the figure is written on it.&nbsp; He will be provided with a full basis from which we have derived the figures.&nbsp; And this means a fair bit of information and analysis&nbsp;&ndash; the historical rates of return for each asset class, why the Government or the Boards believe that those rates of return will or will not be repeated in the future, how we add it all up to derive finally a long-term expected real rate of return.&nbsp; And we will not just provide the President with a 20-year expectation but also with a five- to 10-year expectation of the investment outlook, so the President knows how it compares to our long-term view.&nbsp; It is not blind to what we expect over the next five to 10 years.&nbsp; So full information will be provided to the President, so that he, together with the CPA, would be able to form a judgment as to whether this is a well reasoned assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPA is a highly competent group of people&nbsp;&ndash; experienced, seasoned professionals and business persons who know something about markets.&nbsp; And, more importantly, although they are not investment experts they know how to assess an argument and the information that is put before them.&nbsp; The current Chairman of the CPA, Mr J Y Pillay, was the former Managing Director of MAS and GIC, and is currently Chairman of the SGX; Mr Yong Pung How was the first Managing Director of GIC, and also a former Managing Director of MAS; Mr Dhanabalan is currently Chairman of Temasek, which is not part of this framework for now; Mr Lim Chee Onn is Chairman of Keppel Corporation, and the others, such as Mr Stephen Lee, who all know their stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, the President will always want to ensure that the CPA continues to comprise people who have experience and a proven track record of good judgment.&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan, in particular, and several other MPs have asked whether the President would also be able to get independent advice and assistance from other competent persons.&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; First, I should emphasise, of course, that the CPA is an independent panel.&nbsp; These are not Government representatives. All the members are appointed by the President.&nbsp; But the Government will certainly be very happy to facilitate the President getting advice on the investment environment from other experts, investment consultants or anyone that the President would like to get a view from.&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan had also asked about whether the scheme allows for constructive dialogue, so that it is not a binary system where the President either agrees or disagrees, and if he disagrees, it falls back to the 20-year historical rule.&nbsp; That is the way it should work in practice&nbsp;&ndash; constructive dialogue&nbsp;&ndash; where the President will ask questions and ask for further clarifications.&nbsp; And that dialogue will, I think, facilitate agreement in most circumstances on the long-term expected real rate of return to be adopted.&nbsp; So the dispute resolution mechanism is not the first recourse, but the last recourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Other clarifications</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio Li-ann had also asked a question, which is how the President is going to carry out his constitutional duties without the necessary and complete information.&nbsp; The President has full and accurate information on MAS and GIC, for that matter, Temasek.&nbsp; He can ask for all information that he deems necessary to perform his Constitutional functions.&nbsp; And there has never been any doubt about the President having full and accurate information on these relevant assets&nbsp;&ndash; MAS and GIC.&nbsp; I think Prof. Thio was a little confused by what happened in the previous episode when former President Ong Teng Cheong had asked some questions that had to do with compiling an inventory of the Government's physical assets.&nbsp; The matter was resolved but it had never anything to do with the investment assets managed by the GIC and MAS, which have always been fully transparent to the President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there is no issue of the President not knowing what it is that we are trying to preserve, and not knowing what it is that we are projecting expected rates of return on.&nbsp; The process which I have laid out to the House will be sufficient for the President to perform his custodial role.&nbsp; It is a custodial role, it is not a role which involves the President counter-proposing estimates of his own based on advice from the CPA, but it is a role which requires the President, advised by the CPA, to assess whether the Government's proposal is reasonable and well founded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; to go back to my earlier point about having the right people in charge&nbsp;&ndash; the President would be able to trust in the collective judgment of MAS and GIC's boards. The Board members are people of high standing, integrity and competence.&nbsp; And in response to Mr Liang Eng Hwa's query, each appointment has to be made with the approval of the President based on the President's evaluation of the integrity and ability of each member, whether it is a Minister, someone else in the Government, or someone in the private sector.&nbsp; And the Boards are supported by a whole cast of professionals, some of whom have been in this business and the organisation for a long time, who have been through the market cycles, who know their technical stuff but also come with judgment of their own as to how the markets work.&nbsp; These are well-oiled professional organisations, always improving, and I can tell Members that they are held in rather high regard internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determining the long-term expected real rates of return is not a process which is completely untransparent.&nbsp; I was comparing the two approaches earlier; one, full transparency, let Parliament or the people decide; the other which depends on the right people being in charge and ensuring robust checks and balances within the system, and then a dispute resolution mechanism if you cannot agree.&nbsp; But the second approach which we have taken is not completely untransparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong had thought that people do not know the size of Temasek's assets or returns.&nbsp; Temasek publishes an annual report every year&nbsp;&ndash; size of assets, and, in fact, different ways of computing annual returns, both on market value and shareholder funds.&nbsp; GIC has now published an annual report&nbsp;&ndash; and it will be published every year&nbsp;&ndash; which also provides its average rate of return over the long term, updated each year, and people will be able to see the trend very clearly.&nbsp; Indeed, if you look at GIC's report, you can already see a trend in the rates of return because of changing market circumstances.&nbsp; And we will also publish the dollar amount of NIR in our Budget, just like we currently publish the dollar amount of NII.&nbsp; So, if there is a sudden spike or dip, questions can be asked.&nbsp; So, this is not an untransparent system.&nbsp; Ultimately, it is a system that relies on robust governance.&nbsp; It sets in place in the Constitution checks and balances, and the Government believes this system will work more objectively than alternative systems and better ensure that we preserve our reserves, and that we spend prudently and wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Risks of actual returns deviating from expected returns</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a risk that actual returns will deviate from expected returns.&nbsp; Several MPs have pointed it out, the last was Ms Penny Low.&nbsp; Actual returns may well deviate from expected returns.&nbsp; The markets are uncertain and no one can forecast with precise accuracy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo had asked what if we find that over the first five years, actual returns are significantly different, for instance, significantly lower than expected returns. It is the right question to ask. How have we addressed it in this framework?&nbsp; First, as Mr Gautam Banerjee has pointed out, the risk is mitigated somewhat by that fact that we are only spending 50%. Although expected returns may be higher than actual returns, we are only spending 50%. That is the first mitigant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But most important is the second factor, which is that we will review the expected rate of return annually, afresh, taking all prevailing information into consideration. And it will not be possible to ignore performance over a five-year period in determining what the most realistic forecast is for the next 20. It will not be possible for the Boards to ignore that. They will not ignore actual performance, but they will ask themselves: is this a cycle which is likely to rebound after a few years or is it a secular change in the investment environment that is likely to persist for many years&nbsp;&ndash; in which case, better to adjust the long-term forecast?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first point is the 50% rule, as a mitigant; second point is that there is an annual review and that is the most important point. Thirdly, there is the check provided by the President each year as well, advised by the CPA, who will question the Government on its assumptions. And if the President feels that the last several years are cause for concern because actual performance has been less than expected performance, he will ask the Government some fairly searching questions. And the Boards will have to justify why they have adopted what they proposed for the long-term expected returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should finally mention as a fourth factor, somewhat technical, that there is a self-correcting mechanism in this as well, because if indeed we have persistently lower actual returns, it will reduce the asset base upon which the rate of return is computed. Even with the smoothing mechanism we are adopting, there is greater weight given to recent years.&nbsp; So if we have persistent underperformance, it will reduce the asset base and the Government would have less to spend. So, there is some element of self-correction in the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I should also caution, lest we get too caught up with this idea of paying close attention to actual performance in the bad years, that the whole basis for this framework is to derive a stable stream of revenues for Government based not on one cycle, but the long-term expected performance. We want to avoid being caught up by short-term developments. This is why the task requires considerable judgment on the part of the Boards, the Government, the CPA and the President. When times are exuberant, we have got to avoid being too caught up by it and raising our long term forecast. When we are down in the bear market, we should also avoid being too caught up by it. Make the most realistic and objective judgment of the future investment environment. That is the task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Should Temasek be included in the framework?</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can now turn to the question of Temasek. Several MPs had raised that issue which I had explained in my Second Reading speech as to why we have chosen not to include Temasek Holdings in the framework. Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Siew Kum Hong and others had asked about this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had basically highlighted the main difference between Temasek and traditional international portfolio managers, like the GIC. Temasek's investment strategy involves taking concentrated stakes, both in the public markets, the listed equity markets, as well as in the private markets, direct investment, concentrated stakes. And this means two things.&nbsp; First, they expect to make higher returns, because they are taking higher risks, and indeed they have achieved higher returns. Second, with this strategy, it is inherently more difficult to project well into the future, what your expected returns are. This is common internationally, eg, amongst the major private equity players. If you talk to the major players who have been in this business for a long time and ask them what their expected return is, they will tell you they have a hurdle rate, not an expected return.&nbsp; I have a hurdle rate for any investment I make. That hurdle rate depends on my cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital. And I try and exceed it as much as I can to serve my clients. But they do not come out with an expected rate of return, quite unlike the GICs of the world, for whom there are established methodologies, there are market comparators and benchmarks, which go through constant refining, but there are ways of projecting, five, 10, 20 years into the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh had also asked if the reason why we did not include Temasek was because \"it needs time to digest its recent investments that had come unstuck\".&nbsp; The exclusion of Temasek has got absolutely nothing to do with its recent performance or what we expect over the next few years. I have given the reason why Temasek is excluded.&nbsp; But if the Member is curious, Temasek publishes its results every year. It published its results a couple of months ago. People know what they are&nbsp;&ndash; 7% return market value over the last year, rather difficult year.&nbsp; And next year, I do not have any update on this, but if we have to go by global market conditions, it will be a rough year. They will be publishing their results once again. And you can scrutinise it, evaluate it and make your own judgment about Temasek.&nbsp; So Temasek is transparent in its returns and the Government is not hiding anything in leaving Temasek out of its framework. It will continue to be transparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has a good point. We do want to make sure that we continue, with this new framework, to coordinate Government's overall investments, overall allocation of funds between the MAS, GIC and Temasek. And this new framework will not impair that internal coordination that we do. These are different approaches: MAS&nbsp;&ndash; conservative, somewhat more liquid; GIC&nbsp;&ndash; higher risk than MAS, very broadly diversified across asset classes; Temasek&nbsp;&ndash; heavily focused on equities and taking concentrated stakes as well, the high risk end of the spectrum. What the Government does continually and will be doing going forward, is deciding on how much money to put in each of these bodies.&nbsp; That is why last year, we put an extra $10 billion into Temasek, which is published and known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong asked a specific question which I thought is important for me to address, about the new framework, where we are shifting GIC onto the NIR framework, where we spend 50% including capital gains, and Temasek being left on the NII framework, where we spend 50% of NII which is based on dividends&nbsp;&ndash; which reflect capital gains as well, but not to quite the same extent. His question is whether that framework will incentivise Government to shift funds from Temasek to GIC, in order to get more out and spend now. I think it is a valid question. In theory, it can. It will not happen, certainly, under this Government, because our concern in deciding how much money to put in MAS, GIC and Temasek, is to maximise the value of our overall assets. That is our mission&nbsp;&ndash; maximise the value of our overall assets and ensure that we diversify and allocate funds to achieve that objective, subject to the risk thresholds. We have no incentive to shift funds between agencies in order to spend now. But, in theory, it can happen and that is an imperfection in the system. And I think it is better that we live with that imperfection, rather than try to overcome the imperfection by taking Temasek and putting it now in the NIR framework and facing the problems I spoke about yesterday, which is the difficulty of making the projections and the high degree of uncertainty that we will have in our Budget if we do that. The deviations between actual and expected returns will widen in either direction, with either actual being significantly more than expected or significantly less than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think this is the best approach. We are not casting this in stone for all time. I mentioned yesterday that after some years, we will look at Temasek again once it has settled its diversification strategy, to see whether we want to include it. In the meantime, we continue to spend on the basis of dividends paid by Temasek, which does reflect some of its realised capital gains. That is the prudent approach, in my opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Liquidity issues</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gautam Banerjee and Dr Lim Wee Kiak had asked questions which pertained to liquidity and this is an important issue. Because, as they pointed out, we are spending now on the basis of long term expected returns, which include both realised and unrealised gains because the distinction does not arise when we look at the long-term value of our assets. So, if we are spending on that basis, how do we make sure that we have enough inflow of funds based on actual dividends and interest and realised capital gains&nbsp;&ndash; because the monies we get from the agencies are based on the actual investment performance, not their expected investment performance. So, how do we make sure we have a liquid flow of funds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, just to repeat very quickly a point I made yesterday, by including both realised and unrealised gains in the framework, we avoid a bias in our investments of wanting to sell assets now in order to realise capital gains so that the Government can spend it. This way, we are neutral. We include both the realised and unrealised gains, so that when we sell our assets is of no influence at all. But the question is valid&nbsp;&ndash; do we have enough liquid flow of funds at all times to meet the needs of the Budget without GIC or MAS having to inopportunely sell and liquidate in order to provide the Government with the money?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have studied a range of scenarios and it will be highly improbable that we will end up with this problem. We have asked ourselves the question and studied it, and we will not have that problem. There is a net inflow of funds that the Government gets each year from a variety of other sources. Singapore Government Securities (SGS) issuance alone is quite sizable&nbsp;&ndash; it is about 4% of GDP annually. That alone in almost all market circumstances gives us the fresh liquid flow. Plus there are other sources of liquid funds that we will have at our disposal in other areas, like land sales. We convert land and put it into the reserves, but, in the first instance, you are getting financial assets and if need be, we can use the fund flows for the Budget immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this is a problem that we can tolerate because we do not envisage scenarios where we will really face a shortage of liquid funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Borrowing for expenditure</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo had asked another important question&nbsp;&ndash; are there alternative sources of funding instead of drawing on reserves to meet these important expenditure needs?&nbsp; For instance, can we borrow? And as she put it, currently, Government is, in fact, able to borrow quite cheaply because of our very good credit rating, while we are earning more from investing our reserves, at least historically.&nbsp; Instead of drawing from our reserves and losing the opportunity reward of what we earn on our reserves, why not we just borrow?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, our statutory boards borrow.&nbsp; LTA is going to borrow a significant amount for our transport plans.&nbsp; HDB already borrows very substantially.&nbsp; They issue bonds. And the Government is borrowing through the Singapore Government Securities market, quite a large sum, not for spending, but the funds are invested. The Government borrows in order to develop the financial market and create a risk free yield curve, but we do not spend the money.&nbsp; It is all invested. But there is a limit to how much the Government or the statutory boards can borrow, because credit rating agencies study this very carefully.&nbsp; I think it is absolutely critical that we keep our sovereign credit rating unimpaired through rough times especially, and across the cycles. So, we have got to be very cautious about borrowing more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, more fundamentally, I would say, let us not get into the game of exploiting spreads, exploiting situations where your borrowing cost is lower than what you hope to earn in your returns, and, therefore, find complex strategies to exploit that spread. We have seen how some countries have gone completely awry that way.&nbsp; We have seen how AIG went completely awry that way. AIG had a strong credit rating, borrowed cheaply and invested in high risk complex instruments and did very well for a long time, until the spreads changed. I do not need to elaborate on what happened to AIG, but AIG had problems.&nbsp; So, avoid this problem. There is a good reason why the Constitution has written in safeguards against borrowing in order to fund spending and deficits. This is a sound rule, and there are enough examples of how things have gone wrong otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>What NIR will be spent on</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me come to the question on what we will spend our money on. This additional 2% of GDP, or slightly more, that we will get through the new NIR framework, when added to the revenue of 0.8% of GDP that we obtain from the GST increase, gives an overall revenue of about 3% of GDP. There was a range of views amongst MPs.&nbsp; Several wanted more social spending, to meet a variety of social challenges. Ms Sylvia Lim had emphasised that.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan and several others also felt that there was a need to engage in more social spending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I have to say that our bias and view is squarely in favour of what Mr Christopher de Souza, Mrs Josephine Teo, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and others have said.&nbsp; We have to focus on building up capabilities and productive infrastructure to generate future growth. I will explain why.&nbsp; It is not an irrational bias.&nbsp; We have to bear in mind that NIR, under the new framework, is going to be quite a significant percentage of our total revenues.&nbsp; At 3%-3.5%, say, 3.5% of GDP, the total NIR revenue, if you include the NII already allowed, will be about one-fifth of our total revenues (20%).&nbsp; If we then use that money to invest in social expenditures or consumption of one form or another, that keeps us happy for the moment but it does not generate future growth and future revenues.&nbsp; So, over time, what you find, when you are not generating future growth and future revenues, is that the NIR, as a percentage of total revenues, keeps going up and as a nation we get to be increasingly dependent on this new form of oil.&nbsp; We should avoid being dependent on this new form of oil, but keep to the principle, as PM says, of \"Save, Work, Earn\" as the basis of our society. And avoid pain-free spending.&nbsp; If you want to spend more, let us&nbsp;get revenues for it.&nbsp; If you do not have revenues for it, do not spend more.&nbsp; I think that is the right approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to emphasise once again what I said yesterday, because we are quite serious about this, that is, whatever we are spending, we have got to keep a very close watch on avoiding wastage and unnecessary expenditures and frills, which Mdm Ho Geok Choo and others have pointed out.&nbsp; There is a lot of work going on in Government which does not create headlines but which really leads to savings.&nbsp; Quite recently, we put in place a whole set of smart procurement practices where we procure in bulk across Government agencies, and share services across our statutory boards and Government Ministries, which have reduced transaction costs significantly.&nbsp; We have put in place a capital charge framework so that our agencies will maximise their returns on the resources that are made available to them.&nbsp; And we recently put in place value-for-money reviews where we go in to have a look at how the funds have been used after a project has been implemented, whether the goals have been achieved and whether the funds were used wisely.&nbsp; With all these processes, we will keep disseminating best practices within and across the system.&nbsp; This is continuous work, making sure that we keep a culture of efficiency, economy and stewardship in the use of public funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Growing our reserves</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me take from where I started off. This is not just a framework about deriving more money for spending, but a framework for ensuring that we continue to conserve our resources for the future and that our reserves will continue to grow in line with our economy.&nbsp; To answer Dr Ong Seh Hong's question, which also includes our population size, because if you have a growing population, you have a growing economy, you do want your reserves to be able to cover that. This formula will assure us that our reserves will not decline over the long term in relation to the size of our economy.&nbsp; The ratio of reserves to GDP will not decline over the long term.&nbsp; There will be cycles, but there will be no long-term trend of decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan had in fact asked whether we had a fixed target for our reserves.&nbsp; What size do we aim for?&nbsp; We look at this from time to time and we get teams of economists to try and study the optimal size of reserves.&nbsp; In fact, in my earlier days as an economist at the MAS, I tried this myself. There is frankly no answer to that question.&nbsp; We do not know what crisis will hit us. We do not know what natural calamity, what war, what economic crisis will hit us and what the scale of the damage will be.&nbsp; The more important point is that we must ensure that the reserves continue to grow in line with the size of the economy, and that is what I can assure Members this formula will be able to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current crisis that we are going through internationally is throwing up very interesting lessons about the dangers of not storing up enough in reserves, and living for today.&nbsp; Iceland is the latest example&nbsp;&ndash; it is being played out this week itself, day by day.&nbsp; The Icelanders are very tough, hardy people because of the extreme climate and the way they have had to survive beside large neighbours over the course of their history. They were regarded as a self-reliant people&nbsp;&ndash; and until very recently, Iceland was regarded as the \"darling of the Nordic model\".&nbsp; In fact, their per capita GDP is double that of Singapore's.&nbsp; Iceland is now technically bankrupt.&nbsp; Its reserves are 25% of GDP, but its borrowings, largely by its banks, are seven times its GDP.&nbsp; So its system has collapsed.&nbsp; Foreign banks are no longer willing to accept its currency even for trade payments.&nbsp; So trade has come to a standstill, supermarket shelves are empty, and the government is restricting the use of foreign currency to food, oil and medicine.&nbsp; And, yesterday, they decided to accept a $6 billion loan from the IMF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong people, bright people, capable, and they used to be self-reliant, but a huge error over a relatively short space of time&nbsp;&ndash; over exuberance, over leverage, and not realising the importance of erring on the safe side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Arthur Fong said, \"if you save, you will be safe\", and it is as simple as that.&nbsp; I think we can be confident.&nbsp; We have got strong reserves.&nbsp; It keeps our credit rating strong, good not just for government but, more importantly, for our businesses and banks, lowers the cost of borrowing.&nbsp; And in that way too, our reserves generate sustained income over the long term which will benefit both current and future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that when we spend more, we spend on the basis of what we can afford and we keep that spirit of self-reliance and living by our wits, which Josephine and many others spoke about.&nbsp; That way, we make sure that Singapore continues to be built to search for excellence, and built to last.&nbsp; [<I>Applause</I>].</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.05 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is part of a larger package to support Singaporeans who wish to marry and to have children.&nbsp; Incidentally, we have just voted for a Constitutional amendment which provides more potential funds for the Government to spend.&nbsp; I come from the Ministry which is going to be spending more.&nbsp; The total package for marriage and procreation, we project, will cost $1.6 billion, about 0.6% of GDP per year.&nbsp; So, this is not a small sum of money.&nbsp; I say that so that I hope Members would not be asking me for more but rather scrutinising to make sure I do not over-spend or mis-spend that money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key component of this package is the enhancement of the various leave schemes.&nbsp; This includes extending maternity leave from 12 to 16 weeks, extending childcare leave from&nbsp;two to&nbsp;six days, and introducing&nbsp;six days of unpaid infant care leave.&nbsp; These measures that are targeted specifically at citizen babies only.&nbsp; That means parents must have Singaporean babies and also only in the context of intact families.&nbsp; In other words, it is only targeted at parents of legitimate children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major change that we will be making is that the childcare and infant care subsidies, and the leave entitlements will also now apply to all children, regardless of birth order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also&nbsp;be making enhancements to the Baby Bonus scheme.&nbsp; The cash gift for the first and second child will be increased from $3,000 to $4,000.&nbsp; Currently, the matching Government contribution to the Children Development Account is given only to the second, third and fourth child.&nbsp; This will now be extended to all children.&nbsp; The first child also will receive a matching Government contribution of up to $6,000, and the fifth child and beyond will receive a matching Government contribution of up to $18,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes will be reflected in the Children Development Co-Savings Regulations rather than hard coded in the Bill itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Government-paid maternity leave and maternity-related employment protection</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to Maternity Leave.&nbsp; In 2004, we extended maternity leave from&nbsp;eight weeks to 12 weeks.&nbsp; For the first and second confinements, employers paid for the first&nbsp;eight weeks, while the Government paid for the last&nbsp;four weeks.&nbsp; For the third and fourth confinements, the Government paid for the full 12 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has decided to bear the full costs of&nbsp;the extensions to maternity leave.&nbsp; This Bill will extend maternity leave from 12 weeks to 16 weeks, with the Government paying for the additional&nbsp;four weeks, subject to a cap of $10,000 per&nbsp;four weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last&nbsp;eight weeks of maternity leave can now be taken flexibly over the 12 months following the birth of the child, instead of over six months.&nbsp; This will allow employers and employees to work out the most suitable leave arrangements to meet their mutual&nbsp;needs.&nbsp; Those covered under the Employment Act who are only entitled to 12 weeks of leave will also be able to take their last&nbsp;four weeks of maternity leave flexibly over 12 months.&nbsp; This does not result in additional costs to either employers or the Government but will help to simplify the&nbsp;human resource&nbsp;systems for employers by streamlining arrangements for all employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, an employee needs to have served the same employer for at least 180 days in order to be eligible for maternity benefits.&nbsp; Moving forward, we will shorten the qualifying period so that more of our working mothers will benefit from the enhanced benefits.&nbsp; The Bill will reduce the qualifying period to 90 days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we enhance the benefits for working mothers, the Bill will&nbsp;in tandem ensure that such mothers are well protected from errant and unfair employers.&nbsp; I wish to state categorically that the Government will not condone employers dismissing their employees during their pregnancy without sufficient cause.&nbsp; The Bill requires employers who dismiss pregnant employees without sufficient cause during the last six months of pregnancy to compensate the employee with the payment of the maternity leave benefits that she would have been entitled to if not for the dismissal.&nbsp; This is an extension from the current protection, where pregnant employees in the last three months of pregnancy who are dismissed without sufficient cause are entitled to maternity benefits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also introduces a new measure to protect working mothers who are retrenched.&nbsp; An employer who retrenches a pregnant employee in&nbsp;her three&nbsp;months of&nbsp;pregnancy will be liable to compensate her with the payment of maternity leave benefits, on top of the other retrenchment benefits that the employee is entitled to.&nbsp; Currently, there is no such provision for retrenchment cases but we&nbsp;have decided to introduce this measure in order to further enhance the protection of pregnant employees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.11 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also taken the opportunity to address the situation faced by working mothers who have more than one employer at the time.&nbsp; Currently, these&nbsp;women are only&nbsp;eligible for paid maternity leave from only one employer, and the maternity leave taken with the other employer has to be unpaid.&nbsp; But we recognise that our economy is changing, and more women are likely to take on alternative working arrangements, sometimes with more than one employer.&nbsp; To ensure parity for these women, so that they can continue to enjoy the same level of income when they have a child, this Bill provides that these mothers will be entitled to paid maternity leave from all their employers.&nbsp; The Government will reimburse the employers accordingly for its share.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These last four enhancements, namely, the reduction in the qualifying period, the extension of the protection of pregnant employees who are dismissed without sufficient cause to the last&nbsp;six months of pregnancy, the protection of retrenched employees in the last three months of pregnancy, and allowing for paid maternity leave under more than one employer, go beyond just supporting the formation of families and should be basic employment prerogatives.&nbsp; These enhancements are therefore also covered under the Employment Act as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also another group of mothers&nbsp;&ndash; adoptive mothers.&nbsp; While&nbsp;they do not have the same need for physical recuperation and, therefore, do not receive maternity leave, the Government has decided to reimburse up to&nbsp;four weeks of pay if the adoptive mother's employer voluntarily provides her with leave.&nbsp; This benefit was provided to adoptive mothers whose family size did not exceed&nbsp;four children, including the adoptive child.&nbsp; The Bill now extends this benefit to all adoptive mothers regardless of their family size, in line with our intention to be supportive of larger families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also recognise the important roles that fathers play in raising children and, therefore, both the father and the&nbsp;mother will be entitled to the extended paid childcare leave and the new unpaid infant care leave.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Childcare leave</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004,&nbsp;two days of childcare leave,&nbsp;paid by employers, were introduced for working parents. To enable parents to have more time to care for and to&nbsp;spend with their children, the Bill will increase the childcare leave benefits, such that each working parent with at least one child under the age of seven will be entitled to&nbsp;six days of childcare leave per year.&nbsp; Bringing childcare leave under the Children Development Co-Savings Act will also now allow all working parents with a Singapore citizen child under the age of&nbsp;seven to enjoy this leave benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first&nbsp;three days of leave will be paid&nbsp;for by the&nbsp;employers, which is an increase of&nbsp;one day for employers compared to the current system.&nbsp; But to minimise business costs to employers, the Government will pay for the last three days of the childcare leave, up to a cap of $500 per day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on feedback from employers, we have agreed that it is fair for employers to pro-rate the&nbsp;six days of childcare leave if an employee, who has just joined the company or who decides to leave the company, does not serve the company for a full year.&nbsp; For instance, if an employee works for the same employer for only&nbsp;six months that year, an employer might want to grant only&nbsp;three days of leave.&nbsp; This Bill, therefore, allows pro-ration of childcare leave, to a minimum of&nbsp;two days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should an employee leave in the course of the year after consuming more leave than he would have been entitled to after pro-rating, the employer may recover from the employee payment for those extra&nbsp;days of leave which the employer had already&nbsp;paid for.&nbsp; However, the employer should not recover from the employee payment for those extra days&nbsp;of leave that the Government paid for, unless the employer plans to return money to the Government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure accountability as well as parity amongst all Singaporeans, the Bill sets a limit that the Government will only pay for&nbsp;three days of childcare leave per employee per year.&nbsp; This also applies for an employee who works for more than one employer at the same time.&nbsp; MCYS will set up an online enquiry system for employers to check how many days of Government-paid childcare leave an employee has already taken in that year,&nbsp;including incoming new employees.&nbsp; This will help employers to determine the remaining number of days of childcare leave which the employee is entitled to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance protection for the&nbsp;employees, the Bill also&nbsp;introduces a new penalty of a fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence and $10,000 for the subsequent offences for errant employers who do not grant childcare leave to employees without reasonable cause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Unpaid infant care leave</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we are introducing a new type of leave&nbsp;&ndash; unpaid infant care leave.&nbsp; The objective of infant care leave is to provide working parents with some flexibility to take leave should they need additional time for their newborns.&nbsp; The Bill will provide for each working parent with at least one child under the age of two&nbsp;to be entitled to&nbsp;six days of infant care leave per year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After careful consideration, we&nbsp;decided to make this leave unpaid, as we do not want to inadvertently escalate the costs of doing business in Singapore and ultimately adversely affect the employability of our workers, especially women.&nbsp; This is especially so when we have already enhanced both maternity and childcare leave&nbsp;at the same time this year.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a parent has a child under the age of two, he can take both the unpaid infant care leave as well as the childcare leave, which means 12 days of leave&nbsp;per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to childcare leave, for errant employers who do not grant infant care leave to employees without reasonable cause, this Bill introduces a new penalty of a fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence and $10,000 for subsequent offences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Transitional period</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is scheduled to come into effect on 31st October 2008.&nbsp; The Government will also reimburse&nbsp;our share to employers who voluntarily grant their employees the enhanced leave from 17th August 2008, that is, even before the enhancements&nbsp;were made mandatory through legislation.&nbsp; We chose 17th August because that was the date&nbsp;that the enhanced measures were announced by the Prime Minister.&nbsp; This is also to encourage employers to be generous and to start giving&nbsp;the enhanced leave provisions early, and I am glad that many employers&nbsp;have already done so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For maternity leave, the Government will also reimburse its share to employers who provide 16 weeks of maternity leave to those who delivered on or after 17th August.&nbsp; For births on or after 31st October, it will be mandatory for employers to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For childcare leave, it will be mandatory for employers to give their employees at least&nbsp;three days of leave between 31st October 2008 and the end of the year, although childcare leave given prior to 31st October will also be counted as part of the&nbsp;three days.&nbsp; For those who voluntarily provide more than&nbsp;three days of leave between 17th August until the end of the year, the Government will also reimburse its share accordingly.&nbsp; For infant care leave, employers should give their employees all&nbsp;six days if an employee wishes to take this leave.&nbsp; Given that infant care leave is unpaid, it is unlikely to be used frivolously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me take this opportunity to reiterate that our vision is to make Singapore a great place for families and this cannot be&nbsp;done by&nbsp;Government and legislation alone.&nbsp; Employers and employees have to play their part and they also have to&nbsp;look beyond legislation to embrace the spirit&nbsp;behind such measures, to appreciate that our families and our children are important to us as individuals, and ultimately essential for Singapore's future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having children is a matter of personal choice, personal priority and, ultimately,&nbsp;a vote of confidence in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.19 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Children Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the current Act to enhance, principally, the existing pro-family measures that the Government has put in place.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment is part of the on-going effort to strengthen family bonds and, more importantly, to improve the total fertility rate among Singaporeans which as we are well aware is falling over the years, and is still below&nbsp;the replacement level.&nbsp; This development is consistent with the declining fertility rates in most developed countries, and we are no different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decline in total fertility rate is an issue that no responsible government should ignore.&nbsp; Of course, as some would say, we could rely on immigration to make up for the loss in numbers over the years.&nbsp; As a Singaporean, Sir, I would say that such a move would be folly indeed.&nbsp; Without the majority of the population being born&nbsp;and bred locally, the character and composition of our society would change.&nbsp; Imagine for a moment if a significant number of Chinese in Singapore were replaced by Chinese from the mainland.&nbsp; The presence of such a large number of foreigners with limited or no association with the history of the place, either through family ties or otherwise, would make for a very different Singapore as we know it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, welcome any initiative by the Government, including the ones introduced by the current Bill, to incentivise women to have more children to add to our numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, unfortunately, is not the first time that, as a country, we are addressing this issue.&nbsp; Population and procreation as subjects of public interest continue to vex our leadership going as far back as I&nbsp;can recall, when Minister Mentor was Prime Minister.&nbsp; How do we and in what circumstances should we get Singaporeans to settle down and have more children; and more importantly, to provide the right environment for the children to be properly nurtured and have their potential maximised?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, we have experimented with different policies.&nbsp; These include&nbsp;baby bonus incentive schemes and improving paid maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, our total fertility rate has not improved significantly, which explains why the topic of procreation and family planning surfaces from time to time and continues to preoccupy our minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, giving mothers&nbsp;the monetary incentives and making it easier for them to get paid leave to have more children, I feel, only partially address the problem. &nbsp;I believe the problem of our low&nbsp;fertility rate goes deeper than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our society has increasingly become&nbsp;more competitive over the years.&nbsp; The parents who are in a better position to raise their children well are not inclined generally to want to have children or more children; not unless they can have the assurance that they can raise their children properly without severely affecting their quality of life.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that a fair number of&nbsp;educated women these days choose to work to supplement the family&rsquo;s income, or simply as a career choice.&nbsp; They are also hard put to provide quality care for their children.&nbsp; In other words, many families would want to have the cake and eat it; but many will find the strain of keeping both.&nbsp; With rising costs, and the pressures of providing the best for the children and family with whatever material comfort they can afford, I am not surprised that many mothers are apprehensive about having babies or having more babies for that matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question really is what can be done in the longer term to provide young couples with the assurance that having children is not such a frightening prospect as envisaged.&nbsp; Should our policy approach towards family planning be carried out in a more holistic manner in looking at providing support for the family that is not just focused mainly&nbsp;on giving birth to children, but also in looking after the child all the way to adulthood?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Act and the proposed amendments focus largely on providing incentives for giving births to children.&nbsp; I am, however, of the view that more can and should be done if we want to achieve the desired outcome that was intended.&nbsp; For instance, we give extended paid leave to mothers to bond with&nbsp;the children, but this&nbsp;is only&nbsp;part of the equation.&nbsp; What happens when the children are older and in school, and there is no one to look after them.&nbsp; Should we not also have a comprehensive scheme where before- and-after school care facilities may be strengthened to give working mothers the comfort of knowing that long after their children are born, the Government is there&nbsp;to provide a comprehensive network of support for them.&nbsp; Providing or increasing any subsidy&nbsp;in this regard will give a longer visibility of support.&nbsp; Presently, I am given to understand that the student care subsidy is only extended to those who cannot afford it.&nbsp; Should the funding principle in this regard be restricted to only&nbsp;those who cannot afford it? Or should it also be extended to working mothers to make it easier for them to&nbsp;make&nbsp;a decision about family planning?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many women I spoke to reflect the view that the decision to have children goes beyond&nbsp;financial incentives of giving birth.&nbsp; The constraints cut across our policy landscape and also the way the labour market operates.&nbsp; Let me explain with just two illustrations.&nbsp; First, the common bugbear amongst&nbsp;young couples has to do with the long wait for a subsidised HDB property.&nbsp; Most couples&nbsp;prefer to have their own pad before having children.&nbsp; The option of buying from the open market is not available to many couples.&nbsp; They would not have the means to pay&nbsp;up to&nbsp;$20,000 to $30,000 cash over valuation which is usually asked for if you buy a flat in the open market.&nbsp; Most would, unless they have parents who can help them, have to save up for a period of time before they can&nbsp;afford to settle down.&nbsp; So, typically, by the time a working couple have their first child, they would be in their late twenties or thirties; if at all they decide to have babies.&nbsp; In most cases, the prospect of having three or more children by the time the women are forty seems&nbsp;rather remote indeed because forty is a&nbsp;biological age beyond which having children may be at risk to the women and the child concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;So how many more babies can we have if they are getting married later?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, shortly after the announcement of the extended maternity leave for mothers, there are grave concerns on&nbsp;whether or not this may&nbsp;work against them at the work place.&nbsp; Now I understand that the Government is very concerned about discrimination against women who are pregnant and who have to take leave, and who have been retrenched as a result.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that women these days may not be given the same protection when it comes to seeking employment.&nbsp; Not&nbsp;every employer&nbsp;is&nbsp;as enlightened as we want them to be.&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp;I have been told that some HR staff when interviewing candidates for&nbsp;employment would want to know whether the women are starting a family or whether they are going to be pregnant, or whether they are pregnant.&nbsp; If it was found out that they are going to get married,&nbsp;they are going to settle down and have children, this may alter the final selection as to whether or not they will be hired by the company.&nbsp; The current legislation itself does not extend so far&nbsp;as to protect&nbsp;women in this category.&nbsp; Certainly, while we want to extend the leave given to women to encourage them to have babies, it is a difficult struggle that some employers have in wanting to extend employment to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, therefore, the question of encouraging women to have babies itself must extend through the entire policy landscape, which includes housing, labour, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; So it is a very difficult issue for which the baby bonus and the incentives only settle part of the equation itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other countries which have come up with other models which help to make it easier for mothers to have children.&nbsp; To illustrate, France, for example, has a caregiver model wherein a child minder is afforded by the state to new mothers to help with the chores, understand the concerns of&nbsp;mothers and provide these mothers with&nbsp;specific needs of the new born.&nbsp; France also has a system of collective care, which takes place in&nbsp;the form of creches and day nurseries and these establishments are either run by the councils, private organisations or voluntary bodies, which&nbsp;are set up by the companies for their employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not suggesting for a moment that we follow the French way.&nbsp; First of all, it is&nbsp;too expensive and, secondly, it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;practical and it may lend itself to abuse.&nbsp; However, I cited the French example if only to show the need for us, as I said earlier, to take a more holistic and&nbsp;comprehensive approach to encouraging families to have children or couples to start families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate&nbsp;on the&nbsp;amendment to this Bill in September 2004, Dr Amy Khor had asked if MCYS could consider helping to train more home-based baby-sitters and to consider extending infant care subsidies to parents who choose home-based baby-sitters as opposed to infant care centers.&nbsp; The Minister noted her point and suggested studying this before making any commitment in this area.&nbsp; I am not sure&nbsp;whether the MCYS has come to any conclusion arising from the study in this regard.&nbsp; Yet, again,&nbsp;I cite this&nbsp;as&nbsp;an example of the little&nbsp;initiatives that the Government can provide that&nbsp;will go a long way in providing this holistic support which I spoke about in tipping the mother one step further towards having babies or, for that matter, having more babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we first began family planning, we encouraged Singaporeans to stop at two.&nbsp; Over the years, our tagline changed to asking Singaporeans to have more if they can afford it because of our declining birth rate.&nbsp; The irony is that with Singaporeans who can afford to have more children and who are in a position to provide for their children, monetary incentives are often less of a concern than quality of life.&nbsp; I have spoken to many women on this issue.&nbsp; The common retort has been, \"Can the Government assure me that my child will not suffer from the excessive pressures of our education system?&nbsp; Or can I be sure that my career will not be affected by my juggling between the competing demands of looking after the family and pleasing my bosses? What about my own quality of life? &nbsp;Do I have the right to pursue my interest?&nbsp; Why should my husband be the&nbsp;one to play golf while the family is dumped on me?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as&nbsp;we dig deeper into these issues, we realise that this issue goes beyond maternity leave and savings account.&nbsp; This&nbsp;does not mean that we do not even begin to try.&nbsp; But what it does mean is that we will have to take a&nbsp;comprehensive approach in dealing with this issue.&nbsp; We may&nbsp;have to re-look at the definition of the family by including, perhaps,&nbsp;single unmarried mothers.&nbsp; For now, such a suggestion would come across as being radical and perhaps ahead of our time.&nbsp; But whatever it is, unless we try harder, I personally am not too optimistic that under&nbsp;our current policies, we will succeed in reversing this declining trend of fertility rate in the longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The measures contained in this Bill to promote marriage and parenthood are generous and pro-family.&nbsp; I hope that they will indeed give the much needed boost to our fertility rate.&nbsp; I have received very positive reactions to these measures.&nbsp; The NTUC had discussions and workshops with a few hundred people, including the NTUC women's committee members, unionists and workers, and generally all were supportive of the enhanced leave and other benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These measures are really quite a quantum leap.&nbsp; From 1968 to 2004, our maternity benefits were only eight weeks and unions were even prohibited from asking for more than this even if&nbsp;employers were willing to give.&nbsp; Then in 2004, our maternity benefits were increased to 12 weeks and now to 16 weeks.&nbsp; Within a matter of four years, our paid maternity benefits have doubled.&nbsp; However, the enhanced maternity leave would be quite meaningless if protection of these benefits is weak or ineffective.&nbsp; Hence, way back in 2006, the NTUC had submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Manpower asking for greater protection for pregnant women against arbitrary dismissals and unfair treatment.&nbsp; In particular, we were unhappy that pregnant women who were retrenched would not get any maternity benefits although the retrenchment&nbsp;was due to no fault of theirs.&nbsp; We were also concerned that only women who were six months' pregnant would be protected from dismissals without just cause.&nbsp; We had also asked for the Government to reduce the eligibility period for entitlement to paid maternity benefits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am indeed very glad, Sir, that this Amendment Bill has incorporated these changes.&nbsp; Under the amendments, pregnant women retrenched in their third trimester will be paid maternity benefits.&nbsp; Women who are in their second trimester can now seek redress if they are dismissed without just cause, and women need only to work for 90 days to be eligible for the&nbsp;paid maternity benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, unfortunately, Sir, there is also a flip side to these changes.&nbsp; I have received feedback from our women leaders, who are concerned that married and pregnant women will be discriminated against, as some management had actually confided in them that they are now reluctant to employ women.&nbsp; On the other hand, I have also received feedback from employers, particularly the smaller ones, who are concerned about how to fill the vacancies when women employees take this extended leave.&nbsp; So, the real challenge, Sir,&nbsp; is how to implement the enhanced leave measures in&nbsp;a manner which is fair, sustainable and meet the needs of both employees and employers.&nbsp; There obviously cannot be one solution that fits everyone.&nbsp; There is also a need for greater consultation and discussion between the company and the female employees.&nbsp; This basically depends on the level of trust and confidence that exists in the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge employers to see the long-term objectives of the enhanced benefits.&nbsp; Employers will have to face and respond to the challenge for more flexibility to address the needs of different segments of the workforce.&nbsp; In this way, they can retain talent, build a vibrant and motivated workforce and continue to grow their business.&nbsp; Employers should hire, reward, promote and retain employees based on their merit and contributions and not treat them unfairly because of their pregnancy or family responsibilities.&nbsp; Employers should realise that discrimination does not make good business sense.&nbsp; Even in a downturn, they need to find the right talent.&nbsp; If you are an employer, you want a good job fit and people who will stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our workforce is changing and getting more diverse.&nbsp; Employers need to respond.&nbsp; Talent has choices.&nbsp; No employer thinks that they discriminate.&nbsp; Almost everyone thinks that they are fair and objective.&nbsp; But if you do not challenge your thinking and review your assumptions about job candidates, you may find that you are biased, whether in the job application form or in the interview process.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is not just going to hinder your ability to identify the best candidate but will also impact on what the candidates think of your organisation and what they are going to tell their friends about you as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, employees too have a responsibility to their jobs.&nbsp; Employees should uphold a high standard of performance and should not expect employers to compromise these standards because of pregnancy or family responsibilities.&nbsp; They should also be flexible and work closely with their employers to help in the smooth transition and hand over duties to other employees who are covering for them during their leave period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where possible, employees should be flexible in taking the last eight weeks of the maternity benefit, such as stretching leave over a longer period, taking half-day leave or work on a shortened work week.&nbsp; This&nbsp;would help to minimise disruptions to the company's operations.&nbsp; Employees also need to understand that only a thriving business will be able to generate and sustain good jobs and provide effective work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as the Co-Chair of the Tripartite Alliance&nbsp;for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP), we have been doing a lot of work to address this issue of discrimination against pregnant women or those with family responsibilities.&nbsp; Our work is done through the Tripartite Centre for Fair Employment.&nbsp; Over 800 employers have now pledged support for fair employment and the Centre has made individualised visits to over 100 employers to assist them in the adoption of fair employment practices.&nbsp; Issues relating&nbsp;to discrimination are not straightforward and the Centre organises sharing sessions where the advocates in each pledging company can learn about the progressive practices of other employers.&nbsp; The Centre also runs popular recruitment and selection workshops to help employers and there is already a&nbsp;waiting list for this training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are building momentum and last month, all the members of the Singapore Staffing Association also pledged their support agreeing not only to hire on merit for their organisations but also to promote fair employment practices to their clients.&nbsp; The Centre has also worked with SPH to persuade media advertising agencies on how to position a job advertisement that is not discriminatory.&nbsp; So, even as TAFEP enables employers and makes it easier to be fair, we are also making it more difficult for them to be unfair.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of this month, to further promote the adoption of fair employment practices, there will be a media campaign to challenge mindsets on what one looks for when one hires.&nbsp; At the end of the day, hiring on merit means looking objectively at whether the person can do the job and not the colour of one's skin or the wrinkles on the face or the number of children one has or is going to have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February next year, we will also launch Singapore's first national conference on fair employment, which will bring together leading international experts to help in the practical promotion of fair employment practices in Singapore.&nbsp; So, in this way, TAFEP through the TAFEC Centre hopes that we could do our part&nbsp;in contributing towards an environment where there is less discrimination against women who are pregnant or who have&nbsp;family responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just touch on a couple of points, Sir.&nbsp; First, I would like to say I have a&nbsp;particular concern for women who are employed on contract work.&nbsp; It is very easy for companies to avoid payment of the maternity benefits by structuring the employment contracts as short-term contracts.&nbsp; In this way, they do not have to pay maternity benefits as the women's service is disrupted and they will not be able to qualify for the eligibility period.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify what measures will be taken to prevent employers from resorting to such tactics to avoid payment of the enhanced maternity benefits?&nbsp; Has MCYS or MOM received complaints from women on such practice and how were they dealt with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, employers, particularly smaller ones, with greater cashflow problems have complained that reimbursement by MCYS only after an employee has consumed all her maternity leave, including leave that is taken flexibly, is too rigid as it could mean that, in some cases, they would get paid only after one year.&nbsp; Could MCYS consider reimbursing employers at shorter intervals, which is important for smaller companies?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, there is some feedback from non-working mothers that they have not benefited much from the Marriage and Parenthood Package.&nbsp; They lamented that while they have heeded the Government's call to have more babies, they have not benefited as much as the working mothers.&nbsp; They feel that their loss is greater because they have to give up their jobs.&nbsp; Would the Government consider some benefits for these non-working mothers as well?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the feedback also is that the Government tends to look at the marriage and parenthood issue in a very piecemeal manner.&nbsp; It fails to understand that people are struggling not only to raise children but also to take care of sick, elderly parents as well.&nbsp; Giving childcare leave alone will not be sufficient inducement for those struggling to take care of the elderly sick.&nbsp; Would the Government consider introducing family care leave, which is already found in quite a number of countries?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I agree with the Minister that these measures proposed under CDCA is not the solution.&nbsp; For women to have more babies, it will require the support of the Government, employers and society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these&nbsp;measures, the Government has shown its support for marriage and procreation.&nbsp; Employers could help by creating a supportive environment for the female employees who are pregnant or have young children.&nbsp; Supportive&nbsp;husbands&nbsp;who extend a helping hand at home certainly help to reduce the dual pressures that mothers faced at home and at work.&nbsp; The Japanese example, Sir, is insightful.&nbsp; They have similar provisions, providing generously to women but their fertility rate has not gone up because other factors are at work to discourage parenthood.&nbsp; I think we should look at such examples and examine as to what are the other factors that we need to look at in order to ensure that these marriage and procreation measures will truly be effective in achieving its goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support this Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after the last Marriage and Procreation (M&amp;P) package was announced in 2004,&nbsp;Singapore's total fertility rate has improved very marginally from 1.26 to just 1.29.&nbsp; It is not clear that we can attribute any success to the 2004 package.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, after the National Day Rally in which enhancements to the marriage and procreation measures were announced, I asked young Singaporeans for their responses.&nbsp; The responses have been mixed.&nbsp; Some young couples, especially those with at least one child, tell me that they feel encouraged to have more children.&nbsp; Sadly, a larger number have an indifferent attitude or think that our declining fertility&nbsp;is an irreversible trend.&nbsp; It makes me wonder if M&amp;P&nbsp;2 is&nbsp;doomed to fail from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why then should we commit millions in additional spending each year to support what appears to be a failed or failing policy?&nbsp; It looks like we are throwing good money after&nbsp;bad, with no promise of any significant results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I ask myself, what is the public interest here?&nbsp; After all, getting married and starting families are very personal decisions.&nbsp; Each year, it seems that fewer and fewer young Singaporeans are persuaded to do so.&nbsp; Why can we not just let nature take its own course and stop flogging a dead horse, so to speak?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were just a collection of economic factors, grouping together only to achieve superior economic returns for our human capital, the enhanced M&amp;P package is really irrelevant.&nbsp; We would ask how we can assemble the best possible team to maximise economic returns for each of our team members in Singapore.&nbsp; In other words, there would be no need for babies at all.&nbsp; It is quicker and easier to get ready-made ones from abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Singapore is not just an economy, we&nbsp;are a nation, and so we must address the question of what it means to be a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I think, a nation must have its own citizens born and bred with unquestioned allegiance and willingness to defend it in times of need.&nbsp; This is not to cast doubt on our new citizens, and&nbsp;in no way suggests that they are disloyal&nbsp;or will be fleet-footed in times of trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the depths of feelings will vary and are likely to be different, at least for the first&nbsp;few years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a nation must have its own sense of identity, with a set of unspoken, implicitly held values that bind its people together.&nbsp; In fact, a nation's identity is often expressed most prominently by its diaspora wherever they congregate.&nbsp; Hence, the Greeks in Australia, the&nbsp;Chinese in the UK, and the Jews&nbsp;in America, all form tight communities, despite the fact that they have adopted new citizenships.&nbsp; Singaporeans are no different.&nbsp; We never enjoy each other's company more than when we are all stranded together faraway from home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, a nation must, of course, be able to sustain itself economically, or its people will perish.&nbsp; But economic success is a means to&nbsp;an end of nation-building, providing it with the resources to pursue national ideals and express society's values.&nbsp; In Singapore, our national ideals include that of meritocracy and multi-racialism.&nbsp; In&nbsp;recent times, we have also sought to cultivate an inclusive, gracious and&nbsp;giving society.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I ask myself whether these national ideals can be consistently pursued if we do not produce our own babies, have our own young.&nbsp; Ideals survive and evolve in the transmission.&nbsp; Once the transmission stops, so too will the ideals&nbsp;fade away and morph into something unrecognisable.&nbsp; There is, thus, the inherent risk to our national identity whenever we replenish our ranks with new citizens.&nbsp; To be sure, they inject new ideas, diversity and fresh perspectives, all of which are vital to our continued survival and relevance.&nbsp; But new citizens also change our societal mix and we have to recognise that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we preserve the positive core of Singapore's society,&nbsp;our Singaporean-ness, so to speak?&nbsp; Sir, I think we must continue the transmission to our young.&nbsp; Do we want a Singapore which exists in name only, with nothing particularly unique or special about it?&nbsp; To put it starkly, having more babies is becoming an issue of national survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This,&nbsp;then, to me, is&nbsp;of public interest.&nbsp; As representatives of the people, we have to ask if we can afford to allow a future where there are fewer and fewer Singapore-born Singaporeans to descend upon our nation, without seeking to do something about it.&nbsp; Maybe we have already acted too late,&nbsp; but better late than never.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Government, through its maternity and parenthood policies, reverse the declining trends of the total fertility rate?&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the answer is clearly no.&nbsp; It will take a lot more than Government's actions to make it happen.&nbsp; Few young Singaporeans will be persuaded to have babies for the sake of national survival or as a matter of filial duty.&nbsp; In fact, some are not even persuaded that they should do it for the joy that children bring to themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One disturbing trend is also emerging.&nbsp; On one occasion, someone who was involved with the dialogue that I hosted went so far as to tell me that if the Government guarantees free education for&nbsp;his child up to university level, better still, raise&nbsp;his kids for him.&nbsp; I will have them.&nbsp; Was this person joking?&nbsp; Sadly, he was quite serious about it.&nbsp; No doubt, it is costly to raise children.&nbsp; We can, and should, as a society, help to alleviate the cost of parenthood.&nbsp; But to expect society at large to raise our kids for us is plainly wrong.&nbsp; So I must urge Government not to turn M&amp;P 2 into a monetary contract between Government and the people &ndash;&nbsp;\"You give birth, we pay.\"&nbsp; There should be no place for such warped thinking in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what spirit, then, should we support M&amp;P 2?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that this House must support the Bill because we believe in Singapore. We believe that in Singapore, we have a past that is worth honouring and a future that is worth looking forward to. If we do not have the next generation of Singaporeans, who is there to remember us and honour our legacies? If we do not have the next generation, who is there to create the future for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to my fellow Singaporeans, please have children, more if you can afford it. Do not do it because the Government is giving you a baby bonus. Do not do it because anyone else says you should be obliged to. Have children because you&nbsp;believe in yourself, in your family and in Singapore. Have&nbsp;children so that, your future, our future and Singapore's future is worth creating.&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude my remarks in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;(In Mandarin)</I>:<I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081021/20081021VS_175944.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.]&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, in our many public dialogue sessions, the employers have the strongest opinion regarding procreation measures. Many employers feel that the procreation policies would have negative impact on their companies. They are worried about the increasing cost of business, and difficulties faced during the implementation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time a new policy is implemented, we are prepared to make any necessary adjustments as needed in the short term.&nbsp; But I hope that the employers can take a long-term approach. Let us take Japan as an example. Japan is currently facing a rapidly ageing population and the rate of ageing is faster than any other countries. Japan&rsquo;s population has declined since last year, and the country&rsquo;s labour force has also been shrinking. Japanese corporations are clearly aware of the impact that this trend can have on their business operations and activities. However, it might be too late for the Japanese government to look at increasing fertility rate now. So are we going to be like Japan? Do we want to solve the problem only when it hits us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Government has created a pro-business environment for our companies, and it is a reliable and good place to grow their businesses. Therefore, I hope the employers consider the fact that their stay in Singapore will be over a long period of time, and so they should also support these initiatives involving marriage and procreation. When making adjustments, if employers show their sincerity to employees, then employees on their part should also cooperate with the companies in applying for maternity and childcare leave.&nbsp; Both parties can adopt a win-win approach and try to work out the most appropriate arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us work together&nbsp;&ndash; the Government, the employers and the employees&nbsp;&ndash; and let us join in our common effort to build a pro-family, pro-marriage and procreation society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support this Bill.<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 671-672.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the CDCA Amendment Bill. I believe this Bill is important for our long-term national interests in terms of making us more pro-family as a nation and as employers. These measures, I hope, will go a long way for us to achieve our national interests in maintaining our population replenishment rates.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with my parliamentary colleagues who spoke earlier that the amendments will bring about direct benefits, such as improved financial and leave support, to help prospective parents and those planning to build larger families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also agree with them that the policy also needs a more holistic approach &ndash;&nbsp;though I am not so pessimistic about the long term &ndash;&nbsp;as long as we have an open mind, and work with the young to have an open heart, to be more pro-family, to be more open to set up&nbsp;their own families as they grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to touch upon two main areas today in the implementation of the Bill. Firstly, to protect the interests of women from discrimination&nbsp;in employment and career prospects at the workplace. Secondly, to ensure that women are better protected from unwarranted dismissal under the guise of retrenchment, in particular from companies seeking to cut cost in these difficult times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the improved benefits were announced in PM&rsquo;s National Day Rally speech, there was plenty of joy among those planning to have children. However, as mentioned by my parliamentary colleagues, there were also concerns raised by my peers as well as constituents, on whether they would be discriminated at the workplace as a result. I raised this as a&nbsp;parliamentary question&nbsp;in Parliament before, and I am raising it again today, as I believe that there is more that can be done,&nbsp;as regulation today&nbsp;is reactive and the subtlety in which discrimination is happening in the workplace makes enforcement difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying objectives of the amendments are good, and I agree with them. But I fear, especially given these difficult times, that discrimination against women who are seeking employment may increase with the implementation of this amendment. If a woman aged 25 to 35 walks through the door for an interview, what may precipitate in the back of the minds of the hiring employer or manager is that she may cost them&nbsp;three children&nbsp;times&nbsp;four months of maternity leave and benefits. This may disadvantage the woman job applicant indirectly, as there will always be different means to justify her unsuitability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this may also affect the prospects of women in employment from furthering their careers or particular job postings. For example, I have also received feedback that at annual appraisals, some women have been casually asked by their bosses&nbsp;on whether they plan to have any more kids anytime soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that we should move to disallow this line of questioning to begin with, and engage women workers to be aware of the channels that they can seek redress. Such questions are certainly not warranted, and I think more can be done by MCYS and&nbsp;MOM to educate employers. By that, I mean addressing hiring managers and executives, not just the HR teams, to step up enforcement action against those delving in discriminating practices, though not necessarily their policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also encourage&nbsp;MOM and MCYS to educate women of their rights at the workplace. I have recently discovered one merit&nbsp;in this Bill. The Bill provides for the protection of women in the PMET group, who are generally not covered by the Employment Act, which tends to cover the blue-collar workers. This is particularly important because the women PMET group &ndash;&nbsp;mothers who are managers, executives, professionals and skilled technical staff&nbsp;&ndash; tend to be more costly and have a larger impact on the firm&rsquo;s bottom line. They are often not unionised and are not sufficiently represented and may have more at stake in terms of career prospects and opportunity cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on to my second point, I think that more can be done to ensure that expectant women who are retrenched (clause 21(g) to insert section 84A) are given similar protection, such as those who are dismissed without sufficient cause (clause 21(d) to amend section 84). I am heartened that clause 21(d) which amends section 84 of the Employment Act has been enhanced. With this amendment, an expectant mother is not deprived of her maternity benefits within a period of&nbsp;six months preceding the estimated delivery date for her confinement, instead of the&nbsp;three months that was provisioned before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the insertion of this new section 84A creates a backdoor to the enhancements made in clause 21(d). In the newly inserted section 84A, an organisation that is retrenching or reorganising does not need to compensate a woman on her maternity benefits, if it is not before&nbsp;three months preceding the estimated delivery date. This can potentially peg us back to the old Act, if dismissals can be justified as retrenchment or company restructuring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this poor economic climate, the temptation to cut costs may result in more cases of women being terminated for one cause or another in their first two trimesters. From a management point of view, sometimes it is easier to justify poor business performance and company restructuring, rather than poor individual performance of the staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, I am aware of cases where there are women who are compelled just to hide their pregnancies to as late as possible in order to minimise their risk of being discriminated and dismissed before they reach their final trimester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the top performers and those from larger organisations may be held up as 'poster cases', those in smaller firms and those within the lower quartiles find themselves at risk of being made redundant when companies are under cost pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to recommend that the inserted section 84A be amended to make it in line with section 84 of the Act, to make it harder for employers to justify the dismissals of expectant mothers&nbsp;&ndash; whether the reason being retrenchment or otherwise &ndash;&nbsp;and give them&nbsp;a minimum of&nbsp;six months before their expected date of delivery or confinement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I hope that the Minister can help assure the House on how both MCYS and MOM plan to help our women at all levels caught in such situations and if&nbsp;measures are in place to identify and prove such cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think&nbsp;MCYS and MOM can work even more closely with top executives, managers and business owners to support this Act. Almost all HR practitioners I spoke to are supportive of this Act. But some of the feedback I receive is that management buy-in is very critical because policies and practices can be very different. This is especially so if the working culture is driven by the bottom-line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I have a final request for MCYS to consider, moving on from the women to the men of the house. I think that we should consider implementing paternity leave of&nbsp;between two to four weeks&nbsp;for the birth of each child to promote greater involvement of fathers to support the mothers in the initial stages of child development. This should not be seen as an economic incentive, but to get fathers to increase their involvement in the upbringing of children from day one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I believe that the Act sets us in the right directions in terms of our national birthrate concerns. But I think that we can do more to protect the interests of women&nbsp;in terms of&nbsp;discrimination and unwarranted dismissal. With this, I support the amendments.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Members for the support of the Bill. I will address some of the issues raised by Members on workplace-related measures before my colleague, Dr Balakrishnan, delivers the closing address. Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Mdm Halimah Yacob expressed concern about the impact of the enhanced leave measures on the employability of women.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first clarify that under the current Employment Act, it is already an offence to dismiss employees without sufficient cause during the last three months of pregnancy or to terminate their employment when they are on maternity leave. As part of this year's enhanced marriage and parenthood package, we will strengthen the protection for pregnant employees in both the Employment Act and CDCA. In this regard, we will require employers to pay maternity leave benefits to employees who are retrenched during the last three months of pregnancy or dismissed without sufficient cause during the last six months of pregnancy.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These measures were recognised by tripartite partners as being necessary for ensuring basic employment protection for pregnant employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we should not believe that legislation is the panacea to all discrimination-related problems because it is not.&nbsp; The real solution is to change employers' mindsets so that they understand the benefit of and to adopt fair employment practices and create a family-friendly work environment.&nbsp; This is the reason why the Tripartite Alliance&nbsp;for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) has been set up in May 2006.&nbsp; TAFEP, of which Mdm Halimah is the Co-Chairperson, has done a good job in promoting fair employment practices over the years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address Mr Zaqy's and Mr Sin's concerns on discrimination during the recruitment process, TAFEP has issued a set of tripartite guidelines on fair employment practices that promotes non-discriminatory hiring practices.&nbsp; Employers are advised to avoid questions that are not relevant to the requirements of the job during a job interview, such as whether the candidate intends to get married or set up a family.&nbsp; Employers are also advised to adopt appraisal systems which are fair and objective and reward their employees based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Zaqy and Mdm Halimah that while employers should be fair, employees themselves should also be flexible and try to understand the needs of their organisations as well as the concerns of their co-workers before taking leave.&nbsp; My Ministry will work with the employers and unions on educating and raising awareness of the roles and responsibilities of both employers and employees to facilitate the smooth implementation of the enhanced leave measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah raised the concern about unscrupulous employers who placed women on short-term contract work to avoid paying maternity benefits.&nbsp; To help more female employees to be eligible for maternity leave, including those on short-term employment contract, we have proposed to reduce the qualifying period for maternity leave from 180 days to 90 days.&nbsp; So far, the number of complaints to MOM regarding employers who put female employees on short-term contracts to avoid paying maternity benefits is still small.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, we will monitor the situation carefully and decide what needs to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confident that the majority of employers in Singapore are enlightened and treat their employees fairly.&nbsp; As highlighted by Mdm Halimah, employees who encounter employment-related problems or feel discriminated against at the workplace can approach the Ministry or TAFEP for assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy also requested for statutory paternity leave to be introduced.&nbsp; Dr Vivian has explained that the enhanced childcare leave, as well as the new infant care leave, also applies to fathers.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no immediate need to impose an additional burden on employers by legislating paternity leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah has also highlighted the concerns of increased&nbsp;business costs and the impact of business continuity caused by the absence&nbsp;from work by their female employees.&nbsp; These are genuine concerns that were discussed extensively when my Ministry consulted key employer leaders from the Singapore National Employers' Federation and the Singapore Business Federation earlier this year.&nbsp; Many of their suggestions were incorporated in the finalised leave measures and arrangements.&nbsp; For example, we have accepted the suggestion by some employers for the Government to co-share the cost of these additional measures.&nbsp; This is why the Government will be funding the last eight weeks of maternity leave for the first two confinements and the full 16 weeks for the third and subsequent confinements.&nbsp; The Government will also pay for three out of the six days&nbsp;of childcare leave.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Mr Zaqy's suggestion on extending the requirement for employers to pay maternity leave benefits to female employees who are retrenched from the proposed last three months of the pregnancy to the last six months, I would like to explain that this is a&nbsp;new measure and was formulated based on tripartite consensus after extended discussion.&nbsp; Since it will incur additional costs to employers and retrenchment is really neither the fault of the employer nor the employee, we have decided to limit the requirement to pay maternity leave benefits to the last three months of pregnancy for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Mr Zaqy's concern that employers may disguise the dismissal as a&nbsp;retrenchment exercise, aggrieved employees may approach MOM and we will investigate into each case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also taken in industry feedback on the need for flexibility to allow businesses to manage the impact on their operations. Hence, the last eight weeks of maternity leave may now be taken over a 12-month period from the birth of the child instead of six months.&nbsp; In addition to this, employers may continue to tap on the Work-Life Works and Flexi-Works&nbsp;schemes to help them defray the costs of implementing work-life initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in closing, I would like to urge employers to also implement work-life measures that support employees in both their work and family lives.&nbsp; I am certain that most employers understand the benefits of doing so.&nbsp; While the Government is doing its part to affirm the importance of family and the value of children to our society, each of us has a role to play in creating a more supportive environment to raise our future generations.&nbsp; Employers and employees should work harmoniously to ensure the smooth implementation of our Marriage and Parenthood Package and create a win-win situation where both business and personal needs can be met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank all the Members for their comments.&nbsp; I thank especially the Acting Minister for Manpower for his reassurance that the Ministry of Manpower will take a firm line to prevent discrimination against women at the workplace.&nbsp; I would also urge Members to bear his comments that there is a need for balance and flexibility to be exercised by all stakeholders involved in this.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Sin Boon Ann that raising the total fertility rate requires a comprehensive approach.&nbsp; It is not just a matter of leave or Baby Bonus, and&nbsp;the Member has&nbsp;outlined a series of suggestions, not all of which we can move on,&nbsp;but I can assure&nbsp;him on things like provision of&nbsp;student care, and especially to locate them&nbsp;more conveniently within schools.&nbsp; The HDB is stepping up its building programme.&nbsp; But what we cannot assure every couple is that&nbsp;they will get a new flat in a location of&nbsp;their choice.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if they are prepared to buy resale flats and&nbsp;enjoy the housing grant, there are options for newly-married couples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issues on stress and education system&nbsp;are a&nbsp;much more intractable problem, but we know that the&nbsp;Ministry of Education has made significant measures over the last couple of years,&nbsp;for instance, to teach less learn more.&nbsp; But having said that, at the end of the day, this is a competitive society and no amount of engineering with respect to curriculum&nbsp;or pedagogy is going to remove all stress from that.&nbsp; And that again requires a certain balance and&nbsp;perspective to the approach in life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of an unfair burden between men and women, that is not something we can legislate.&nbsp; I think every couple will have to negotiate their own terms of engagement and an equitable sharing of the burden.&nbsp; But&nbsp;he is&nbsp;absolutely right, an entirely machismic society where men play golf and women are expected to look after the&nbsp;children will inevitably lead to&nbsp;a decreased fertility rate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share a lot of the sentiments that Mrs Josephine Teo expressed, but I am a little bit more optimistic than her.&nbsp; The fact that we have been able to move the total fertility rate from 1.24 to 1.29 is significant in itself.&nbsp; I think even preventing an erosion is a significant achievement.&nbsp; I hope we will see it go beyond 1.3, and if we are&nbsp;lucky, maybe even 1.4.&nbsp; But even at that level, I think it will still guarantee that future generations of Singaporeans will continue to have a hard core of people born and bred in Singapore, who will be able to transmit that cultural and social DNA that constitutes the Singapore identity.&nbsp; So, this investment in marriage and procreation is still worthwhile and although it is not easy and, as I have said earlier, it is expensive, but I believe it is something which we ought to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also go on to say that I have sympathy for Mdm Halimah's suggestion that we look at reimbursing the employers at a shorter interval rather than waiting for the employees to complete their entire term of maternity leave before we reimburse them.&nbsp; Smaller companies may have cashflow problems and it is something my Ministry will study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah has also spoken about non-working mothers.&nbsp; This is a perennial issue.&nbsp; What I would say is that all mothers, including non-working mothers, are entitled and do enjoy the Baby Bonus and their families can also&nbsp;tap on the parenthood tax rebates.&nbsp; But there is a difference, and the main difference is that working mothers are entitled to maternity leave,&nbsp;childcare leave and infant care leave, which they need by definition because they are working, and they need time-off from their work in order to recuperate and look after their children.&nbsp; Similarly, working mothers also enjoy higher rates of subsidies for infant care and childcare because they need these services more in order to enable them to go to work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is not true that we do not support stay-at-home mothers but we do provide them support.&nbsp; But&nbsp;she is right, the playing field is tilted somewhat in favour of working mothers.&nbsp; The majority of women actually are working mothers and, in fact, if you speak to the younger generation, most women do want to have it all.&nbsp; They do want to be able work and to have children and, hence, our focus has been to provide as much support as we can for this group of women.&nbsp; However, we are not making or casting value judgments as to which is a better path.&nbsp; I think, at the end of the day, whether to stay at home and look after your children full time or whether to pursue a career and to depend on childcare or other home-based care solutions is a personal choice.&nbsp; We can help but we cannot make that choice, and there are consequences whichever way we choose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked whether we could consider introducing family care leave.&nbsp; Let me quite honestly sound a note of caution at this point in time.&nbsp; This Bill has just introduced up to 10 new days of extra leave per year for both father and mother of a child under the age of seven, plus an additional one month of maternity leave.&nbsp; I think these are significant additions and alterations to our working regime, and I believe it will suffice for the time being.&nbsp; I am not keen to move more aggressively and in a way which may impair the competitiveness of our companies, especially bearing in mind the economic weather that&nbsp;we are going to face over the next one to two years.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would urge companies to exercise more flexibility.&nbsp; You know, sometimes all they need is an extended lunch or a couple of hours in order to attend to the more urgent domestic duties which they have.&nbsp; So, again, I echo the words of my colleague, Mr Gan Kim Yong, that both employees and employers exercise&nbsp;flexibility.&nbsp; A lot can be achieved without having to resort to legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying I totally agree with Mrs Josephine Teo that this cannot be a transaction between Government and people.&nbsp; This is not a bribe to ask you to have more children.&nbsp; All that we can do is that for those Singaporeans who do want to get married, who do want to have children, we can help them.&nbsp; For those who do not want to, they are entitled to make their own choices.&nbsp; Of course, those choices have implications on the future of Singapore but does that mean that we need to depend more on those who want to have children and, therefore, we need to support them more actively than we have in the past and that does mean a significant commitment of Government resources and expenditure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yes, we have, in a sense,&nbsp;a system in which different priorities and&nbsp;different allocation of resources&nbsp;are made, but we need the understanding of all Members, all Singaporeans, that we need to have such a system in order to keep Singapore going and to make sure we continue to have a hard core of born and bred, locally-made Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Dr Vivian Balakrishnan].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

It has to be weighed against the life-saving benefits of blood transfusion.&nbsp; The only practical approach is to reduce the risk of transmission to its absolute minimum.&nbsp; This is done through a comprehensive series of measures based on international best practices to assure the safety of the national blood supply.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we ban commercial blood-banking, as it tends to attract the wrong type of donors.&nbsp; Instead, blood-banking in Singapore is purely based on voluntary non-remunerated blood donation.&nbsp; This allows us to select the blood donors, focusing on low-risk donors.&nbsp; Second, we test all donated blood for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and syphilis using the latest available screening tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been no reported cases of transfusion transmitted infections in the last 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However, blood transfusion still carries a risk. This is because there is a window period in the early stage of infections such as HIV or Hepatitis when the virus cannot be detected by existing tests. There are also diseases such as dengue, where there is no licensed test available to screen the blood supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we also rely on potential blood donors to do their part. They must answer truthfully on the donor health assessment questionnaire and during the medical screening process. If they have already donated blood, but think that their blood is not suitable for transfusion, they should immediately contact the blood bank to stop the usage of the blood.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the unlikely event of an infection through blood transfusion, the liability of the blood bank will depend on the circumstances leading to the infection.&nbsp; Patients will be compensated if there has been negligence involved. There would be no liability if it has done all it could to prevent such a transmission.&nbsp; Nevertheless, each case will have to be assessed on its own merit.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:PRIVATE EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS--><p align=left>Column No : 647<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:PRIVATE EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS:::652-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>PRIVATE EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Regulation and supervision-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Regulation and supervision)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Lily Neo </B>asked the Minister for Education in view of the study undertaken by the Ministry to enhance the regulation and supervision of the private education sector, (a) whether he can ascertain how many private schools are offering unrecognised degrees from unaccredited universities; (b) how many Singaporeans are in these schools; and (c) what plans does the Ministry have to better protect the interest of students in private schools.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Cynthia Phua </B>asked the Minister for Education in light of the recent reports on private schools offering dubious university courses, (a) what is the Ministry doing to weed out such school operators; (b) will the Ministry take on a stricter role in processing applicants before granting them approval to run a school; and (c) whether there is any restriction on schools using the phrase \"licensed by MOE\" on their collaterals and publicity materials.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for Education if he will provide an update on the status on the implementation of the EduTrust Scheme for private education organisations.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regulatory regime for private education, in place for two decades, is essentially a \"light-touch\" approach.&nbsp; To be registered, a private school will have to meet basic requirements to have appropriate physical facilities that meet building and fire safety standards.&nbsp; For professional aspects, the requirements are also basic. For example, to teach secondary level subjects, the teacher&rsquo;s qualification should be at least 'A' level or equivalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private education institutions can also choose to register their external degree programmes with MOE.&nbsp; Only registered programmes are allowed to enrol foreign students.&nbsp; To be registered, the university awarding the degree must be either accredited by a national accreditation body in its home country or recognised by its own government.&nbsp; As at end-2007, there were 1,100 registered external degree programmes offered by universities from 20 countries through the private schools.&nbsp; As there exists a wide variety of such registered degrees, across countries and even from within the same country, universities and standards do differ considerably.&nbsp; MOE has been careful, therefore, to inform the public through various platforms that registration does not represent endorsement or assessment of the quality of the external degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private schools or external degree programme providers do use the label \"registered by MOE\" but MOE ensures that they cannot substitute registration for any other term that may suggest quality or convey more than what registration stands for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current \"light-touch\" regulatory regime may have been appropriate for a budding private education industry with a few players. However, given the growth of the private education industry in recent years, MOE intends to strengthen the current regulatory framework. This was announced this year during the Committee of Supply debate in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As announced, a new Private Education Bill is being drafted for the introduction of an enhanced regulatory framework which will comprise three components: the establishment of an independent Council for Private Education; an enhanced registration regime; and a voluntary certification system called EduTrust for those that meet higher standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the enhanced registration regime, registration will have a specified validity period.&nbsp; Private schools will be required to provide early notification of changes to the recognition and accreditation status of their foreign university partners.&nbsp; To better deal with private schools that violate conditions of registration, graduated penalties, including fines, would be introduced.&nbsp; Imposing penalties that are in proportion to the severity of the breaches would serve as useful deterrence against poor standards or behaviour, while giving errant schools the opportunity to rectify their violations.&nbsp; Schools that have repeatedly violated conditions will risk being de-registered and not allowed to operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area which we will seek to address more effectively is misrepresentation by private schools in their advertisements and promotional materials.&nbsp; We intend to set clearer rules under the new regulatory regime to curb false and misleading advertisements.&nbsp; This will cover the proper use of quality labels, symbols and trademarks by private schools in advertisements and for these schools to refrain from untruthful claims about the school and its courses.&nbsp; The Council will also be given the necessary powers to direct corrective measures if operators publish misleading advertisements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a benchmark of higher quality, the EduTrust certification scheme will be introduced. Private schools can apply to be certified, if they can satisfy certain academic, financial and student welfare requirements.&nbsp; This serves as a useful incentive for better quality private schools to differentiate themselves in the market place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from implementing an effective regulatory framework, the Council will also play a facilitation role to promote a better understanding of the private education sector through consumer awareness and public education programmes. Such efforts aim to help potential students be more discerning about various educational options available and to make informed choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These enhancements to the private education regulatory framework will enable Singapore to better position itself as an education hub. For prospective students, it will provide more information about the quality of the provider and degrees offered.&nbsp; MOE intends to move the Bill in 2009, after providing for a sufficient period of consultation with stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:INTERIM STADIUMS FOR KEY SPORTING EVENTS--><p align=left>Column No : 651<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:INTERIM STADIUMS FOR KEY SPORTING EVENTS:::654-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>INTERIM STADIUMS FOR KEY SPORTING EVENTS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Provision-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Provision)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Zainudin Nordin </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports while awaiting for the completion of the new Sports Hub, whether the Ministry has plans to provide Singapore's sporting fraternity with a reasonably sized interim stadium(s) for key sporting events and, if so, whether these will be able to meet the international standards in terms of safety, security, comfort, lighting and ambience.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no plans to build an interim stadium whilst the Sports Hub is being built as it is not cost effective.

The more cost effective way is maximise current facilities for our sporting events.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our existing stadiums are undergoing upgrading developments. For example, with temporary stands, Bishan Stadium will see an increase in seating capacity from 3,000 to 10,000.

Assets of convicted loansharks can now be confiscated under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. Passports of loansharks can be cancelled and a 10-year travel ban imposed to prevent them from running syndicates outside of Singapore. Loansharks can also be detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. Police has enlisted the help of external parties such as SingPost to assist with the detection of loanshark activities. Since April this year, persons who apply to update their home address in their NRICs are required to furnish proof that they are staying at that address to minimise the likelihood of borrowers giving false&nbsp; addresses to loansharks. With all these measures in place, the situation has shown some improvement.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first half of 2008, 4,755 loansharking and related harassment cases were reported, a drop of 9.3% from the 5,240 cases over the same period last year. The number of harassment cases is likely to decline for a second year running since the number of reported cases peaked in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been more arrests for loansharking activities. In the first half of 2008, Police arrested 210 persons, compared to 137 persons arrested in the same period last year. In May this year, Police dismantled a large syndicate, arrested 17 people and seized more than $200,000, the largest seizure of cash since 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tapping community resources is another prong in our strategy. In this regard, publicity campaigns have been launched to advise the public against irresponsible borrowing.&nbsp; Public assistance in loansharking cases remains strong. On their part, some local communities have embarked on CSSP projects to complement Police efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police takes pro-active steps to ensure that its resources are optimally deployed to deal with loansharks and the crime situation generally. That is why in 2005, CID set up a dedicated Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Task Force that has worked closely with the six Land Divisions to tackle the problem on the ground, a key objective being to dismantle loanshark syndicates. At the last sitting, I informed the House that CID had recently reorganised its branches, including the AUML Task Force, which previously dealt with specific crime domains, to deal more holistically with all forms of syndicated criminal groups. This allows CID to better respond to the evolving crime scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst we have made some progress, the problem of illegal money lending is not easy to solve. Loansharks evolve their modus operandi to elude detection and apprehension.&nbsp; Organised syndicates are difficult to break down, as the kingpins rarely expose themselves. Targeting runners and those who harass others disrupts but does not destroy the organisation, since this group of people is easily replaced. Breaking down the entire organisation is a painstaking and laborious process. Whatever the economic situation, there will always be desperate borrowers who borrow from unlicensed money lenders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police will continue to monitor the situation closely, and if necessary, introduce further measures to deal with the problem.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:USE OF PATHWAYS AND WALKWAYS--><p align=left>Column No : 655<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:USE OF PATHWAYS AND WALKWAYS:::658-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>USE OF PATHWAYS AND WALKWAYS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Implementation of safety measures-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Implementation of safety measures)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what measures are put in place to keep pathways and walkways safe for children and the elderly from the indiscriminate use of bicycles and motorcycles; (b) whether the there are plans to put in place formal regulations or enforcement officials, other than the dependence on volunteer citizens to monitor the situation; and (c) whether there are also plans to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Town Councils and NParks for pathways that are linked to areas under their responsibilities.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Road Traffic Rules, vehicles including bicycles and motorcycles are prohibited on footways.&nbsp; The only exemption to this prohibition is at Tampines, where a trial to allow cyclists on footways is ongoing.

Under the National Recycling Programme (NRP) for HDB and landed estates, residents are provided with recycling bags or bins by the Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) to store their recyclables. These recyclables are then collected door-to-door by the PWCs every fortnight on scheduled days. In addition, about 1,600 sets of centralised recycling receptacles have been installed in all HDB estates last year. Residents who do not wish to wait for the fortnightly collection can deposit their recyclables into these receptacles at their convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also amending the Environmental Public Health Act to mandate the provision of recycling receptacles for condominiums and private apartments.&nbsp; The amended Act will come into effect on 1st November 2008.&nbsp; Upon full implementation in 2009, all households in Singapore will have convenient access to recycling receptacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the existing recycling infrastructure for households, NEA and HDB are conducting pilot trials on the installation of separate chutes for recyclables in some HDB blocks.&nbsp; A block of HDB flats in Choa Chu Kang was retrofitted to convert an unused refuse chute into a chute for recyclables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial at Choa Chu Kang has shown that the recycling participation rate of households in the block increased from 67% in December 2006 to 93% in July 2007.&nbsp; The amount of recyclables collected through the separate chute was 850 kg per month, which was more than eight-times higher than the typical amount of recyclables collected from a block of HDB flats (average of 100 kg per month).&nbsp; A survey of the residents showed that most of them are motivated to recycle more waste due to the greater convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate chutes for recyclables will also be provided in four new HDB blocks at Fernvale Vista at Seng Kang; at the new eco-precinct <I>Treelodge@Punggol</I>; and at the first two HDB projects under the new generation public housing in the regenerated Dawson estate.&nbsp; These projects would allow HDB to ascertain the additional costs that come with providing the separate recycling chutes, as well as further assess residents&rsquo; receptiveness and monitor the performance of the system, before considering the large-scale implementation of separate recycling chutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, we encourage residents to make use of the recycling bags or recycling bins provided in HDB estates to recycle waste.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:VACANT STALLS IN MARKETS/FOOD CENTRES--><p align=left>Column No : 659<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:VACANT STALLS IN MARKETS/FOOD CENTRES:::660-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>VACANT STALLS IN MARKETS/FOOD CENTRES</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Number-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Number)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how many stalls are vacant and available for rental in all the markets/food centres in Singapore.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

These obligations include upkeep, maintenance and repatriation of their FDWs. The employers are also aware of these security bond conditions and the instances of forfeiture. The conditions are clearly specified in the security bond, which employers must purchase prior to bringing in the FDW. The work permit conditions for FDW employers are also made available to them during the FDW application stage and printed in the employers&rsquo; handbook.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of occasions where the security bond is forfeited is actually very low.&nbsp; For example, in 2007, there were only 60 cases where the security bond was forfeited as a result of the foreign domestic worker leaving the employer&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; We have not forfeited any security bond just because the FDW has become pregnant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM does not forfeit the security bond lightly, but does so only as a last resort.&nbsp; For example, if an FDW leaves the employer&rsquo;s home, the employer is given three months to locate their FDW and repatriate them.&nbsp; Employers are given a further period of three months after the forfeiture of the security bond to locate their FDWs. MOM will consider refunding the security deposits if the FDW is found and repatriated within this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases where it is clear that the FDW has run away because she has committed an offence, such as stealing from the employer, MOM will also not forfeit the security bond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The security bond system has served us well.&nbsp; It ensures that the FDWs&rsquo; well-being is taken care of and we do not see widespread overstaying of foreign workers after their work permits have expired.&nbsp; At the same time, MOM has been careful in enforcing forfeiture of the security bond.&nbsp; As the employment landscape and practices change over time, MOM will review from time to time how the security bond system could be refined to better serve its purpose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SPORTS PROGRAMMES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS PUPILS IN MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS--><p align=left>Column No : 661<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:SPORTS PROGRAMMES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS PUPILS IN MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS:::664-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SPORTS PROGRAMMES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS PUPILS IN MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen </B>asked the Minister for Education with more special needs pupils studying in mainstream schools, what sports programmes are there to cater to their all-round development.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils with special needs are enrolled into mainstream schools if they can benefit from its curriculum.

The Act reminds us of the moral obligation and reciprocity of care that should exist within the family. It also serves as a deterrent to the minority of people who wilfully refuse to support their elderly parents.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1996, 1,411 applications for maintenance have been filed at the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents (TMP), of which 1,047 maintenance orders[1]&nbsp; have been made. The remaining applications were dismissed or withdrawn[2]. Some of the reasons for dismissing applications include: parents not having discharged their duties, children being unable to pay any maintenance despite their best effort, and parents already being adequately maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In keeping with the principles of the Act, effort is made to help families resolve the issue amicably and privately, so as to preserve family relations as far as possible. In 2002, a Pre-filing Alternate Dispute Resolution service was introduced to render alternative assistance such as mediation and counselling. A quarter[3] of the cases will still proceed to file applications for maintenance.<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim and the principles behind this Act and the Tribunal remain sound. But as our population ages, its processes need to be updated so that it remains an effective deterrent to unfilial children and that the elderly receive help in a timely and efficient manner. We will review the processes to ensure that the elderly are served in the following ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will work closely with our community partners, the Community Development Councils and Advisors, to ensure that any elderly parent in need will be offered advice on the provisions of the Act, and the avenues available to him. As far as possible, each case should be amicably resolved through family mediation or conciliation without unnecessarily dragging out the process. We will also establish systematic referral protocols between our community partners and the Commissioner and the Tribunal to ensure that no one falls through the cracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents plays an advocate role for elderly parents who are without support and are unable to represent themselves. The Commissioner works closely with the community agencies to identify such cases and will file the applications at the Tribunal on their behalf. Some elderly may not be aware of the Act and do not know who to approach for assistance. We will need to raise public awareness of the Tribunal process and the Commissioner&rsquo;s role in protecting the vulnerable elderly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, where conciliation and mediation fail, the judicial process under the Tribunal should be accessible and impartial. Justice should be served efficiently so as to remain an effective deterrent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the maintenance orders are issued, they are enforced in the Family Court, in the same manner that orders for wives and children are enforced under the Women&rsquo;s Charter. Tribunal officers conduct post-hearing briefings on the options available to elderly parents should their children fail to abide by the order.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt\">[1] Orders of Tribunal are made whether the outcome was achieved through mediation or Tribunal hearing. <span style=\"LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line\">It typically takes between two to three months from filing to the issuance of an Order of Tribunal.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">[2] <span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\">Cases which need further assistance would be referred to various social agencies for follow up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt\">[3] From January 2002 to June 2008.</span></p>\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SPEEDING CHARGE OF MR PAUL ANTONY FERNANDEZ--><p align=left>Column No : 665<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:SPEEDING CHARGE OF MR PAUL ANTONY FERNANDEZ:::668-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SPEEDING CHARGE OF MR PAUL ANTONY FERNANDEZ</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Preventive measures-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Preventive measures)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Ong Seh Hong </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what were the reasons for the Traffic Police to charge security supervisor, Mr Paul Antony Fernandez, for speeding in spite of him providing proof that he was not the driver; (b) whether there was a need for Mr Fernandez to make 10 court appearances and spending thousands of dollars in legal fees before the charges were dropped; and (c) what measures, if any, are in place to prevent such future lapses.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a traffic offence is detected, Traffic Police will request the driver&rsquo;s particulars from the vehicle owner. A summons notice offering to compound the traffic offence and stating the relevant composition amount would then be issued to the driver. If the driver decides not to accept the offer of composition, he can contest the charge in court.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, a vehicle registered under Evtec Management Services Pte Ltd was captured by Traffic Police&rsquo;s speed camera along Yishun Ave 2 on 11th February 2007. A notice of the traffic offence was sent to the company. The company submitted the particulars of Mr Paul Antony Fernandez as the driver of the vehicle. Based on this input, Traffic Police issued a summons to Mr Fernandez with an offer to compound the offence for $130 with&nbsp;four demerit points. Mr Fernandez was also informed that if he failed to take up the composition offer, the matter would be proceeded with in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Fernandez subsequently appealed to the Traffic Police on 23rd April 2007, claiming that he was not the driver. As he had no conclusive proof of this, Mr Fernandez was advised to check with his employer who had given a statement in evidence that he was the driver. Mr Fernandez sent a second appeal to Traffic Police on 5th June 2007, requesting to view the photograph capturing the offending vehicle first as he wanted to be fully satisfied that he was the driver before settling the composition amount. Mr Fernandez was shown the photograph at the Traffic Police Headquarters on 28th July 2007 which captured the licence plate and positively identified the vehicle as belonging to the company but did not capture the driver&rsquo;s identity. Mr Fernandez subsequently did not accept the offer of composition. He appeared in court on 10th September 2007 to answer the charge but denied committing the offence.&nbsp; This led to a Pre-Trial Conference being fixed on 26th September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From 10th September 2007 to 17th January 2008, Traffic Police expended much time and effort to investigate the matter. Investigations were however hampered as the company&rsquo;s staff failed to keep several appointments with Traffic Police. Eventually, Traffic Police did record statements from Mr Fernandez, Evtec&rsquo;s management and employees, In addition, Traffic Police requested the company to produce relevant records to show that Mr Fernandez was the driver. Evtec claimed that it had installed a new computerised vehicle management system around that period and informed the investigator that the company needed more time to retrieve the relevant information as well as to conduct their own internal investigations. In the end, however, the company could not furnish any documentary evidence to show that Mr Fernandez was the driver. Through counsel, Mr Fernandez then made two representations to Traffic Police on 15th February and 19th June 2008 for the charge to be withdrawn.&nbsp; Further adjournments were thus necessary for Traffic Police to forward the Investigation Papers to AGC for its consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on AGC&rsquo;s assessment, the available evidence set out in the Investigation Papers was insufficient to prove conclusively that Mr Fernandez was the driver of the offending vehicle. Neither was the available evidence able to support Mr Fernandez&rsquo;s contention that he was not the driver. AGC advised that further investigations were needed. As such, the Prosecution applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, reserving the right to reinstate proceedings against Mr Fernandez should new evidence be uncovered subsequently. The District Court granted this application on 21st July 2008.&nbsp; Mr Fernandez subsequently filed an appeal to the High Court that was heard on 3rd October 2008, seeking a full acquittal on the charge. Taking into consideration the fact that Evtec, despite given ample time, had failed to produce any evidence to substantiate their claim that Mr Fernandez had driven the vehicle in question, the prosecution did not object to the appeal. Mr Fernandez was then granted a discharge amounting to acquittal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a rare case and happened because the owner of the vehicle, when challenged by the named driver, took some time but still failed to furnish proof that the driver had indeed driven the vehicle. Hence, it dragged on for several months. Nevertheless, once a reasonable doubt was created as to the identity of the driver, Traffic Police did not proceed with the case.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Section Name: ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Title: HIKE IN ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081021/Chart to Q7to10-Spot Fuel Oil Price.pdf'\">Chart to Q7to10-Spot Fuel Oil Price</a></span></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t<div align=left><span class=normal>MP Name: The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)</span></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
