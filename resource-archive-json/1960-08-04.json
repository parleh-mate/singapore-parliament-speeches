In\r\n\r\nJune  1960,  there  were  10,428  teachers  to  340,521\r\n\r\nstudents,  or a ratio of 1 to 33.

After  the  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nBranch  of  the  P.A.P. had  tabled  its  historic  16\r\n\r\nresolutions  at  the  P.A.P. Special  Party  Conference\r\n\r\ncalled  on 18th and 19th June, the Prime Minister  used\r\n\r\nall  the State and private organs of propaganda at  his\r\n\r\ncommand - the  State organs are like Radio Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe private organs are all his agents, together with  a\r\n\r\nrigid control of the Press - to systematically divert the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  people  from  the  real  issues  by\r\n\r\ndisseminating smears and distortions, by calling  names\r\n\r\nas  what  he  did yesterday, by concocting charges  and\r\n\r\nsmearing  my work in the City Council and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National Development. The offensive propaganda  was\r\n\r\ncarried  out on a grand scale, which the Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\ngovernment had not learned. But it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  all  the same - ineffective. Why was it ineffective?\r\n\r\nIt  is  because  of  two basic reasons..  Firstly,  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  known for some time of the  deviation  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. aims and policies by the Prime Minister and  his\r\n\r\nable lieutenant, the Minister for Finance, who are  the\r\n\r\ntwo  persons responsible for steering the P.A.P. along\r\n\r\nits present actively pro-colonial course. Secondly, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  is  as  good  a  propagandist  as  Dr\r\n\r\nGoebbels   of   the  last  war  was.   He   tells   the\r\n\r\nintellectuals one story. He tells the farmers, hawkers,\r\n\r\nworkers,  petty traders, and so on, another  story.  He\r\n\r\ntells  the businessmen a third different story, and  he\r\n\r\ngoes on ad infinitum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, Mr Speaker - the so-called Minutes\r\n\r\nof  the Party Conference were given to the Press in two\r\n\r\ndifferent  and distinct versions, one for the  English-speaking  members of the public and the other  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  members  of  the  public.  But   what\r\n\r\nhappened?  People  meet at one  time  or  another;  the\r\n\r\nhawker could meet the clerk, the businessman could meet\r\n\r\nhis  employee,  and  the  others,  the  bilingual  and\r\n\r\ntrilingual  speaking  public who could  read  both  the\r\n\r\nChinese  and  the English Press, when they compare  the\r\n\r\nreports   they  find  that  they  have  been  receiving\r\n\r\ndifferent    stories,   in   other   words,   different\r\n\r\npropaganda.  Thus the people realise that  it  is  mere\r\n\r\npropaganda, like Dr Goebbels' propaganda, and not  the\r\n\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth, Mr Speaker, is this. At the Badminton Hall\r\n\r\nrally,  round about 30,000 people attended, half inside\r\n\r\nand  half outside. Is it necessary for me, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nto  convince you with photographs taken at the Hall? We\r\n\r\ncan pass them around later if Mr Speaker will allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

What,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  the  Assembly is concerned with is the  overall\r\n\r\npicture which that strife perhaps has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreated in Singapore.

Though  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  make the necessary clarification, I will  not\r\n\r\nproduce the photographs any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rally at the Badminton Hall, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was convinced that he had failed to divert the\r\n\r\nattention  of the public from the Hong Lim resolutions,\r\n\r\ndespite  his  intensive propaganda campaign  and  rigid\r\n\r\nsuppression of the Press and mass rallies. The Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan scapegoat is not good enough; too small fry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week, there has been little talk about Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan being anti-\"collective leadership\". No  more.\r\n\r\n\"Dr  Goebbels'\" first shot has failed. This is because\r\n\r\nwe  have effectively exploded the so-called \"collective\r\n\r\nleadership\" of the P.A.P. Nobody in Singapore  believes\r\n\r\nit  anymore. So, yesterday we heard in this Assembly of\r\n\r\na  new  scapegoat, the so-called Left-wing adventurers.\r\n\r\nThe   first   scapegoat - Ong  Eng   Guan.   The   second\r\n\r\nscapegoat - the  Left-wing  adventurers.  And  the  third\r\n\r\nscapegoat,  most  probably, will be  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who turned up at the Badminton Hall rally\r\n\r\nwere,   by   implication,   the   work   of   Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers,  and not because the masses supported  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  resolutions.  Mr  Speaker,  how  would  you\r\n\r\nexplain the masses gathering at P.A.P. election rallies\r\n\r\nheld  before  the  P.A.P. formed  the  Government?  Two\r\n\r\nWednesdays ago, at the opening of this Assembly,  there\r\n\r\nwas  the  necessity to direct six lorry loads  of  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade members to stand in front of the Supreme  Court\r\n\r\nto  cheer and shout \"Merdeka\". As I said yesterday, you\r\n\r\ncan lead a horse to the water, but you cannot force  it\r\n\r\nto  drink. The Brigade workers on that morning did  not\r\n\r\nshout  \"Merdeka\". I repeat, Sir, how would you  explain\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmasses gathering at P.A.P. election rallies before  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. formed the Government? Was that the work of Left-wing  adventurers? You cannot effectively explain  away\r\n\r\nthe  masses  who turned up at the Badminton Hall.  They\r\n\r\nturned   up  because  they  supported  the   Hong   Lim\r\n\r\nresolutions  which were concrete expressions  of  their\r\n\r\nhopes  and grievances. They turned up because they  had\r\n\r\nbottled  up in their hearts for the past one  year  the\r\n\r\nbitter disappointment of the Government which they  had\r\n\r\nvoted  in  and  to which they gave such an overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority,  and  which  now betrayed  their  fundamental\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true when the Prime Minister said yesterday\r\n\r\nthat   \"there  was  an  absence  of  deep  and  abiding\r\n\r\ngrievance among the people.\" Mr Speaker, how would  he\r\n\r\nknow?  How would the Prime Minister know when  he  does\r\n\r\nnot  see  the people but shuts himself up in  the  City\r\n\r\nHall?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight in Singapore today is still between the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and the pro-colonialists on the  one  side\r\n\r\nand  the  people on the other side. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ndid  his  level best in his speech to convince us  that\r\n\r\nhis  Government is still a progressive Government.  His\r\n\r\ntactics are simple. After 14 months of strange silence,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister started admonishing the K.M.T., the\r\n\r\ncolonialists,  the European interests, the  colonialist\r\n\r\nnewspapers.   These   are  very   simple   kindergarten\r\n\r\nexercises. I hope this time the Speaker will not refuse\r\n\r\nme  to  practise  a  simple  kindergarten  exercise.  I\r\n\r\nremember when I was in school I used to play this  type\r\n\r\nof  exercise. On one finger is a piece of  paper.  \"Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  see,  this is right.\" But immediately  I  put\r\n\r\nthis finger down, and I put another finger up, and  the\r\n\r\npaper  becomes  left. So we are doing  the  same  thing\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister admonished the K.M.T. and so on. He detained two journalists in the name of K.M.T. right-wing subversion,and he thus hoped the people will\r\n\r\nconsider him left. And then the Prime Minister went  on\r\n\r\nfurther to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The policy of the Communist Party... is to unite with\r\n\r\nall   progressive  forces,  of  which  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nacknowledged as one, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstruggle  against  the  forces  of  reaction,  viz.\r\n\r\ncolonialism, imperialism and feudalism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And he said again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are not unaware that with the Communist on one\r\n\r\nside  of  us and the British colonialist on the  other,\r\n\r\neach side will want to pull us to its side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, are these simple kindergarten\r\n\r\nexercises  convincing? They would be as  convincing  as\r\n\r\nwhen  the former Chief Minister, Mr Lim Yew Hock, said\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, \"Gentlemen, I am anti-colonialist.\"\r\n\r\nWere  the  two  journalists  detained  for  K.M.T. sub\r\n\r\nversion?  Were  they  leaders of the  so-called  K.M.T.\r\n\r\nsubversive organisation in Singapore? What  I  know  is\r\n\r\nthat one of them was detained 15 minutes after my Press\r\n\r\nconference on Sunday, 3rd July, 1960, on his way to his\r\n\r\noffice  near  Cable and Wireless at  Robinson  Road  to\r\n\r\ncable my Press releases to his paper in Kuala Lumpur. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  support  this paper because it  always  writes\r\n\r\nsensational articles. But what happened is this.  Being\r\n\r\na  paper printed in Kuala Lumpur, its editors could not\r\n\r\nbe   called  up  and  be  intimidated,  as  editors  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  newspapers have been regularly  intimidated,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker. Sometimes this intimidation goes  on  for\r\n\r\nhours.  This paper in Kuala Lumpur exploited the  rigid\r\n\r\ncontrol  on Singapore's newspapers, arid its sale  were\r\n\r\nboosted   up  from  several  hundred  copies  to   many\r\n\r\nthousands  of  copies. So the best way  was  to  detain\r\n\r\nthese   two   journalists  and  teach   the   Singapore\r\n\r\njournalists  a lesson. The Chinese proverb says:  \"Kill\r\n\r\nthe cockerel in order to teach the monkey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the colonial newspapers which the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned yesterday? What the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nattacked  was  not  the  Straits  Times.  The   British\r\n\r\neditorial  writers of the Straits Times  are  good,  of\r\n\r\ncourse.  They  wrote two editorial articles  dated  the\r\n\r\n22nd of June and the 24th of June praising the stand of\r\n\r\nthe Lee Kuan Yew Government. Why did the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nnot  mention  about  the Voice  of  America  which  was\r\n\r\npraising him? The person the Prime Minister attacked in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  yesterday,  by implication,  was  a  local\r\n\r\nwriter  named Mr Huang Tze-chin, alias Francis  Huang,\r\n\r\nwho wrote a series of articles in the Sunday Mail about\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  political  crisis. Our  present  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  also used to write similarly. There is nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  about  it. Francis Huang is one who believes  in\r\n\r\nliberal  capitalism, if I can sum it up in  two  words,\r\n\r\nand  if that is a correct description. After his  first\r\n\r\narticle  in  the Sunday Mail on the first Sunday  after\r\n\r\nthe  Party conference, I believe he was called  up  and\r\n\r\ngrilled  for  four  solid  hours.  His  second  article\r\n\r\nnegated  his  first  article.  I  hope,  gentlemen,  to\r\n\r\nrefresh your memory. And being not happy about it,  Mr\r\n\r\nHuang  wrote a third article which negated  his  second\r\n\r\narticle.  So  the  first article was his  article;  the\r\n\r\nsecond  article was the Government's article;  and  the\r\n\r\nthird  article  was  his artic1e to negate  his  second\r\n\r\narticle.  He  negated his second article by  writing  a\r\n\r\nthird article and indirectly telling the people that he\r\n\r\nhad   written  his  second  article  under   Government\r\n\r\npressure.  So  we have these articles  of  Mr  Francis\r\n\r\nHuang  which are his own - the first article, the  fourth\r\n\r\narticle and the fifth article. What had Mr Huang  Tze-chin  written about which the Prime Minister  said  had\r\n\r\nconfused  and  deluded the public? Mr  Huang  Tze-chin\r\n\r\nconsidered  himself a political scientist, and  advised\r\n\r\nthe present ruling clique of the P.A.P. to come out  in\r\n\r\nopen  support of liberalism and capitalism. He was  not\r\n\r\nhappy  that  now they were only supporting  it  in  the\r\n\r\ndark. At the moment, it is actually a game of hide-and-seek. Mr Huang Tze-chin advised a national coalition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that in the days of the Lim Yew Hock Government, there had always been shouts\r\n\r\nof  a  national  coalition, and the Singapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance was thus formed. Mr Huang Tze-chin said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The way can be prepared for a national coalition only\r\n\r\nif  the  suspicions left over by history are  dispelled\r\n\r\nthrough a genuine revival of the bourgeois freedoms and\r\n\r\nthe creation of an atmosphere of genuine liberalism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Suspicions - about whom? About Lim Yew Hock?  No  mention\r\n\r\nis being made of a coalition with whom. Does it imply a\r\n\r\nnational coalition with Lim Yew Hock?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What are the alternatives to the liberal analysis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to allow things to drift towards a smash-up in\r\n\r\n1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is to launch a wave of repression to mop up\r\n\r\nOng and all who are not against him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There will be many, many hundreds of thousands who  are\r\n\r\nnot against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A third is to intensify the present crisis into a\r\n\r\nconstitutional    crisis,   thus    inviting    British\r\n\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth is to give it all up as a bad job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these alternatives bear thinking about, if one\r\n\r\nshifts one's gaze from the tiny cockpit of Hong Lim  to\r\n\r\nthe decisive arena of the 1964 general election.\"\r\n\r\nMr  Huang  Tze-chin concluded his article  dated  17th\r\n\r\nJuly,   1960,   with  an  attack  on  the  Government's\r\n\r\ndetention  of  the two journalists. And  what  did  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister think about this? He said this  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All this talk of absolute democratic rights, laissez-faire liberalism, freedom and human rights, in the face\r\n\r\nof  the stark realities of an underground struggle  for\r\n\r\npower, can only confuse the English-educated world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words, he believes also in guided democracy.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, he also believes in sending riot squad\r\n\r\nvans  to P.A.P. branch meetings, intimidation of  Party\r\n\r\nmembers  by sending C.I.D. men to see them in the  dead\r\n\r\nof night, calling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem up and subjecting them to secret trials and so on,\r\n\r\nwhich  the people have seen in plenty in the  past  six\r\n\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, by implication, the Prime Minister, in his reference to Huang Tze-chin's articles, although he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mention those articles by  name,  wants  the\r\n\r\nEuropean imperialists, colonialists, the bosses of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  who control the Sunday Mail,  to  clamp\r\n\r\ndown  on  writers like Huang Tze-chin. It was the  same\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Lim Yew Hock Government wanted  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  to clamp down on writers like Mr S. Rajaratnam,\r\n\r\nwho  is  at  present  the  Minister  for  Culture.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Prime Minister does not want to clamp down\r\n\r\non  British  editorial writers who praise  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Prime Minister in his speech yesterday\r\n\r\ntalked  about the Communist Party on the one  side  and\r\n\r\nthe  colonialists  on  the  other.  So  a  very  simple\r\n\r\nexercise again, trying to imply that the Government are\r\n\r\nin   the  centre  and  they  are  not  therefore   pro-colonialists. How would the Prime Minister explain then\r\n\r\nthe  presence of expatriates like Thomson,  Blades  and\r\n\r\nMeadows in control of key positions in the machinery of\r\n\r\nthe State? So these expatriates are not colonialists at\r\n\r\nall. And again he implied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"People say the P.A.P. is progressive, so I, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, must also be progressive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  members of the P.A.P. are progressive. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  and even some of the Ministers  are  still\r\n\r\nreasonable. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome   Affairs  and  our  Minister  for   Culture   are\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  nice gentlemen. But it  is  these  two\r\n\r\npersons,  the  Prime Minister and his able  lieutenant,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance, who have in the  past  year\r\n\r\nsteered  the  present Government along  a  pro-colonial\r\n\r\ncourse. The Prime Minister said yesterday - this  one  is\r\n\r\nimportant-yesterday was 3rd August, 1960:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The British want to preserve their economic and\r\n\r\nmilitary interests ... for as long as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May I repeat it again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The British want to preserve their economic and\r\n\r\nmilitary interests...for as long as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Economic and military interests\" are, like in a magic\r\n\r\nshow,  switched  back again after our exposure  at  the\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall rally on the 12th July,  1960.  A  year\r\n\r\nago, on the 17th July, 1959, after the Government  was\r\n\r\nformed,  the  Prime Minister wrote these words  in  the\r\n\r\nPetir editorial:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The British force is a negative one from cur point of\r\n\r\nview.  They are interested in Singapore as a  base  and\r\n\r\nonly  indirectly to a much lesser extent  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaya remaining outside the Communist bloc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, please note, that there was no talk on the 17th of July, 1959, about British economic\r\n\r\ninterests. The British were not interested in  economic\r\n\r\nand other interests any more in July 1959. Suddenly, in\r\n\r\nAugust  1960  they are interested again. What  has  the\r\n\r\nParty   manifesto  said  about  this?  \"Colonies   were\r\n\r\nacquired  mainly for commercial reasons. They  retained\r\n\r\nthem for the same reasons. The economic structure which\r\n\r\na   colonial   power  creates  and  maintains   in   an\r\n\r\nindependent  territory  reveals  the  true  motive  for\r\n\r\nempire  building. The primary function  of  a  colonial\r\n\r\neconomy  is  to  increase  the  wealth  of  the  mother\r\n\r\ncountry.\"  If  I  could sum up  in  a  few  words,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - in  1955, the Colonialists' main objective  was\r\n\r\neconomic. After the Government was formed in July 1959,\r\n\r\nthe  British were not interested in economic  interests\r\n\r\nbut only in a negative way in Singapore as a base. Then\r\n\r\nafter  our  attack, on the third time, the British  are\r\n\r\ninterested in economic interests again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, political issues cannot be settled the way the Prime Minister is settling them, by magic\r\n\r\nwords,  by  twisting  the facts  and  by  shifting  the\r\n\r\nissues.  You  can  notice  the  changes  in  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's basic stand - one day, one stand.  As  I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,  when  I  listened to the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech,  it was like listening to the voice of Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock.  And when I mention Lim Yew Hock, it is the  same\r\n\r\nas  what  I  have  said just now. It is  most  pleasant\r\n\r\nreading  through  the Hansard - three big  volumes - and  I\r\n\r\nadvise everybody to buy a copy! Could you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nreduce the price?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, political issues cannot be settled by shifting the issues. The masses have voted us in and\r\n\r\nasked  us  not  to tax the poor. That is all.  You  are\r\n\r\nshifting  the issue to socialism. The people asked  for\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks  and  you  shift  the  issue   to\r\n\r\nindependence.  Everybody knows  that  the  present  so-called  internal self-government is a mockery. Have  we\r\n\r\nreally  internal self-government? What about the  other\r\n\r\nissues  like military land, assessments, tax on British\r\n\r\nmilitary  trucks  and  so  on?  The  1958  Constitution\r\n\r\ndeparts  in  many fundamental aspects  from  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  drafted  by the all-Party team.  The  people  in\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar accepted it because half a loaf is better\r\n\r\nthan no loaf. You shift the issue to independence.  You\r\n\r\ntalk  about  our water supply as what the  Progressives\r\n\r\ndid. The people asked for talks with the Federation  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  This  was  contained in item  3  of  the  1955\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly election manifesto of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nNow,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have a copy of the  election\r\n\r\nmanifesto  of  the  People's  Action  Party   for   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly elections in April 1955:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Item 3 - Unity with the Federation. The P.A.P. believes\r\n\r\nthat  immediately after the elections in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe Federation, negotiations should be started to bring\r\n\r\nabout the unification of Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember immediately after the elections, I raised\r\n\r\nthis matter with the Prime Minister. He did not want to\r\n\r\nreply.  I  am  just  wondering about his  sincerity  on\r\n\r\nmerger. You cannot shift the issue by asking a question\r\n\r\nwhich  is  irrelevant. This is what the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What is it to be? Independence through talks with the\r\n\r\nFederation  for merger, or independence  for  Singapore\r\n\r\nalone through talks with the British?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  was  no direct reply whether the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwas interested in the election manifesto of 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people talked about fighting colonialism. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister tried to intimidate them. At a  special\r\n\r\nParty conference on Saturday, 18th June, 1960, he  said\r\n\r\nthat  to fight Colonialism was to fight British troops.\r\n\r\n\"Now we have no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachine   guns   and  if  the  British  troops   leave,\r\n\r\nIndonesian troops will come in.\" That is what  he  said\r\n\r\non  18th  June,  1960. Yesterday,  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nimplied this. He said that Singapore \"can be so  easily\r\n\r\ncaptured  and destroyed. Have they forgotten that  some\r\n\r\n80,000 British troops had to surrender in Singapore  10\r\n\r\ndays  after  the  Japanese captured  Singapore's  water\r\n\r\nsupply  situated in Johore?\" The Prime Minister  should\r\n\r\nhave  said  this in November 1955 when the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nformed.  Mr  Speaker, the P.A.P. have  fought  British\r\n\r\nColonialism for five years and we did not fight British\r\n\r\ntroops.  We can only solve political issues  by  facing\r\n\r\nthem and not by shifting the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not talk about the August 1957 affair in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nany  more.  It will do more harm to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nthan  he knows. From what I know, there was a group  of\r\n\r\npeople in the P.A.P. who wanted to capture 8 out of the\r\n\r\n12  seats in the Central. It was not a movement against\r\n\r\nanybody.  The Secretary-General managed to  retain  his\r\n\r\nseat and save his skin, because I heard some weeks  ago\r\n\r\nthat he gave several hundreds of admission cards to non-Party members -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The\r\n\r\nSecretary-General managed to retain his seat, because I\r\n\r\nheard  recently  that  he  gave  several  hundreds   of\r\n\r\nadmission  cards  to non-Party members  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nBadminton Hall to vote him in. It was not enough. And I\r\n\r\nbelieve the ballot papers were not properly counted.  I\r\n\r\nbear  no grudge against anybody because I was out.  The\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  pleaded  with  Tann  Wee  Tiong  and\r\n\r\nmyself  to  come back to the Central later so  that  he\r\n\r\ncould have enough men for his \"front\" to fill up the 12\r\n\r\nseats. This is all the clarification I wanted to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Government's policy speech nothing has been said about the social revolution. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said in cols. 83-5 of Hansard, Vol. 3,  No.  2\r\n\r\nof 22nd April, 1958:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, I said, not as an idle boast, that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill  win the elections if they were held tomorrow,  or\r\n\r\nnext year, short of something catastrophic happening or\r\n\r\nsomething  very  foolish that we do. And  we  will  win\r\n\r\nthem,  apart  from  the question  of  having  a  better\r\n\r\norganisation and having better personnel,  because  the\r\n\r\nother  Parties do not attempt to understand the meaning\r\n\r\nof a social revolution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social revolution!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Have they not ceased to wonder why in the last four\r\n\r\nmonths  the  Government was Just swept  aside  and  the\r\n\r\nattention of the people of Singapore was focused on the\r\n\r\nCity  Council? Why? Because it had captured the  hearts\r\n\r\nand minds of the workers.... For the first time they begin\r\n\r\nto  understand that these magnificent institutions like\r\n\r\nthe City Council, which they had viewed as institutions\r\n\r\nof  bureaucracy  and petty oppression could  be  turned\r\n\r\ninto  public institutions for their protection, welfare\r\n\r\nand benefit. Albeit, they needed some colourful gesture\r\n\r\nlike  throwing out the mace to drive the  lesson  home.\r\n\r\nBut that is the lesson the Labour Front must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearn if they want to know what is going on, and have a\r\n\r\nchance  to  compete at all. The Labour Front leader  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council said - as it was reported in the  last\r\n\r\nfew  days  and with a great deal of silent praise  from\r\n\r\nthe  English  language press - \"Oh well, let's  have  the\r\n\r\nMayor  of  Penang  here but let's  have  none  of  this\r\n\r\nnonsense about, `Down with colonialism and all  that,'\"\r\n\r\nbecause obviously by implication, his Party is  not  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of it. For the first time, the City Council  is\r\n\r\ngoing to mean something to the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Prime Minister continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If we - this year or next year - we are prepared for it\r\n\r\nany  time, - cannot  do  the same  transmutation  for  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  Government  and  make, them   become\r\n\r\nsymbols  of the people's rights and privileges  instead\r\n\r\nof symbols of colonial bureaucracy and oppression, then\r\n\r\nat  the end of our five-year term of office, we will be\r\n\r\nout on our heels and deserve to perish.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Prime Minister continues on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When in pursuit of a social revolution, never pay the\r\n\r\nslightest  attention  to the present  English  language\r\n\r\npress. Praise from them means destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decide what you have to do, decide what is right and\r\n\r\npress on. The more they howl against you, the more  you\r\n\r\ncan be certain that you are on the right track.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, this is what we now hear in the policy speech.\r\n\r\n\"It  would no doubt have, been advantageous, before  an\r\n\r\nelection, to have come forward with lavish promises  of\r\n\r\nindependence   and   socialism.\"   Mr   Speaker,   the\r\n\r\nsocialists do not expect socialism during the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\npresent  regime. Socialism is not the issue.  But  what\r\n\r\nhas  the  Government done during the past year?  Almost\r\n\r\nnothing,  except to pass a multitude of laws,  none  of\r\n\r\nwhich  touches  on  the basic economic  fabric  of  our\r\n\r\nexisting  society, but mostly laws which are  meant  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate the power of the present regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we do not like to talk about social revolution before the elections, and do another thing\r\n\r\nafter  the  elections. We stand for the P.A.P. as  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  understood it, and  on  which  they  have\r\n\r\npinned  their hopes, and for which they have voted  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. into power. It cannot be denied that the present\r\n\r\ninstitutions of Government are still being looked  upon\r\n\r\nby the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  symbols of colonial bureaucracy and oppression.  We\r\n\r\nstand for what the Prime Minister said in April 1958:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"For the first time they begin to understand that\r\n\r\nthese  magnificent institutions like the City  Council,\r\n\r\nwhich  they  had viewed as institutions of  bureaucracy\r\n\r\nand  petty  oppression  could  be  turned  into  public\r\n\r\ninstitutions   for   their  protection,   welfare   and\r\n\r\nbenefit.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  believe  that  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  other  public  institutions  can   be\r\n\r\ntransformed,  as the City Council has been transformed,\r\n\r\ninto symbols for the people's well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the policy speech, the second year is to\r\n\r\nbe  a year of construction - the so-called decisive year.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  this  is so. We hope it will  be  a  year  of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  More  than seven  months  of  1960  have\r\n\r\npassed, but the construction projects contained in  the 1960  Budget  still remain\r\n\r\nlargely untouched.  In  many\r\n\r\ncases,   plans  have  not  even  been  initiated.   The\r\n\r\nconstruction projects in the 1960 Budget were meant  as\r\n\r\na  propaganda show-piece. In 1959, there was hardly any\r\n\r\nconstruction  at  all. The $9 million surplus  of  1959\r\n\r\nwhich  was  boasted about in the policy speech  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  wise public finance. The  money  has  come\r\n\r\nfrom the various taxes on the poor and the white-collar\r\n\r\nworkers. The $9 million surplus should have been  spent\r\n\r\non  public  work projects like the building  of  roads,\r\n\r\nhouses, and so on, to alleviate the sufferings  of  the\r\n\r\npoor   and   to   alleviate  the   acute   problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  particularly during this time  of  trade\r\n\r\nrecession and acute unemployment. The savings from  the\r\n\r\npay-cuts  of the civil servants are not being used  for\r\n\r\nuseful  construction work which would help the  economy\r\n\r\nbut  for  unnecessary  and  wasteful  expenditure;  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  like overseas trips, provision of  cars  and\r\n\r\nbodyguards for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries,\r\n\r\n$20,000  to beautify and air-condition Sri Temasek  and\r\n\r\nchange   its   marble  which  is  already  in   tip-top\r\n\r\ncondition,  and  other  wasteful items  of  expenditure\r\n\r\nwhich even the Lim Yew Hock Government did not think it\r\n\r\nfit and wise to incur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has hardly done any construction work\r\n\r\nduring  its  one year of office. Most of  the  projects\r\n\r\nwhich the Ministers opened were projects conceived  and\r\n\r\ninitiated - and some almost completed - under the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government:  the Thomson Road Hospital,  the  St.\r\n\r\nMichael's Road Market, the post offices, the micro-wave\r\n\r\nstations,  the St. James Power Station and  many  other\r\n\r\nprojects.  The  exceptions were the  community  centres\r\n\r\nwhich   cost  about  $20,000  each.  The  Public  Works\r\n\r\nStanding  Committee, which is under the direct  control\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime  Minister, is in  charge  of  all  these\r\n\r\nconstruction projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, nothing has been mentioned in the policy speech about the funds to finance the proposed\r\n\r\nconstruction  projects  in  this  \"decisive\"  year   of\r\n\r\nconstruction. Is this to be dependent to a large extent\r\n\r\non British and American aid? The British Government has\r\n\r\npromised  $65 million in grants and loans  to  finance\r\n\r\nprojects many of which are of military significance and\r\n\r\nare of no direct benefit to us. What type of aid are we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  obtain  from the United States  through  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank? Mr Speaker, this is very good magic!  You\r\n\r\ndo  not  borrow money from Mr Lee Kong Chian, but  you\r\n\r\nborrow   money   from  the  Overseas  Chinese   Banking\r\n\r\nCorporation.  From  what  we  have  studied  of   other\r\n\r\ncountries,  none  have survived by being  dependent  on\r\n\r\nAmerican aid; as none have survived from praises by the\r\n\r\nStraits Times. We believe in making an attempt to  find\r\n\r\nthe  funds  from  our  own people first.  I  asked  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance in August 1959  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. to  float housing bonds, but this was rejected.\r\n\r\nWe  could have mobilised the people to buy these bonds,\r\n\r\nas we have mobilised them to build various projects. At\r\n\r\nleast we could have made an attempt, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment situation is now worse than before.\r\n\r\nThe  Lim  Yew Hock Government tried to find scapegoats.\r\n\r\nIt blamed the P.A.P. is the present Government going to\r\n\r\nfind  scapegoats in similar fashion? Mr Speaker, blame\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan! The people do not expect us to  find  a\r\n\r\ncomplete solution to our unemployment problem, but they\r\n\r\nexpect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government, in which they had so  much  faith,  at\r\n\r\nleast  to  make  a  sincere and determined  attempt  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  this problem. No honest attempts  have  been\r\n\r\nmade.  Is the Work Brigade an attempt to give  jobs  to\r\n\r\nsome of the unemployed? No. One of the purposes of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade  was,  as  I  said  yesterday,  to  shout\r\n\r\n\"Merdeka\" outside the Supreme Court building. The  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade and the community centres are to be the \"second\r\n\r\nline  of  defence\" of the present Government  when  the\r\n\r\nParty  members have melted away, when few people go  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. branches, and when  they  cannot  get  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  workers  to do work at mass  meetings.  They\r\n\r\nalso  want  the Work Brigade to appear as  \"masses\"  at\r\n\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy speech there is nothing very new about\r\n\r\nthe  activities of the various Government  departments.\r\n\r\nThese  departments  are  just linked  together  like  a\r\n\r\nstreet  directory. Compare it with  any  of  the  three\r\n\r\npolicy  speeches on the activities of these departments\r\n\r\nunder  the  Labour Front Government, and you  will  see\r\n\r\nlittle  difference. Most of the plans  put  forward  in\r\n\r\nthis  policy speech were shaped, planned and  initiated\r\n\r\nby  previous Governments. For instance, the chapters on\r\n\r\nshipping,  the  Port Authority, civil aviation,  postal\r\n\r\nservices, and so on. During the past year, the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment   have  not  been  so  much  interested   in\r\n\r\nconstruction and solving the problems pf the unemployed\r\n\r\nand   the  building  of  a  better  Singapore,  as   in\r\n\r\nconsolidating their own position and seeking their  own\r\n\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of housing is a typical example. The\r\n\r\nS.I.T., after reorganisation in August 1959, planned to\r\n\r\nbuild  10,000  units in the first phase. The  only  two\r\n\r\nlocal  architects  at  that time  with  public  housing\r\n\r\nexperience  in Malaya were recruited. Schemes  of  work\r\n\r\nwere  ready.  Plans and specifications were  drawn  up.\r\n\r\nHousing  sites and levelling were ready,  and  in  some\r\n\r\nplaces  piling  was completed. The Prime  Minister  saw\r\n\r\nthem  with his own eyes when he visited the Queenstown,\r\n\r\nKampong  Koo  Chye, MacPherson Road and  Kampong  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  sites on Friday, 16th September, 1959.  Tenders\r\n\r\nwere advertised. Arrangements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  laying  of  water, gas  and  electricity  and\r\n\r\nstorage services were made. The drainage scheme in  the\r\n\r\nMacPherson  Road  area was completed  in  record  time,\r\n\r\npartly  to alleviate the danger of flood to the farmers\r\n\r\nin  the  Geylang Serai area, and partly to dry  up  the\r\n\r\nMacPherson Road site for the building of S.I.T. flats.\r\n\r\nBut  one  thing was not forthcoming. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  refused to give the money though  he  had  the\r\n\r\nmoney.  I have the correspondence to prove it.  Instead\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance went further and  refused  to\r\n\r\ndefreeze the funds which were promised to the S.I.T. in\r\n\r\nthe  1959 Budget under the Lim Yew Hock Government:  $7\r\n\r\nmillion for the general construction of flats and  $4\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the building of flats on two fire  sites.\r\n\r\nThe  present  4,000 units being let out by the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  as  described  in  the policy  speech  were  all\r\n\r\nplanned  by these same two architects whom we  engaged.\r\n\r\nOut  of  these  4,000  units, tenders  for  1,968  were\r\n\r\nadvertised  before  the Housing Board  was  formed.  We\r\n\r\ncould have advertised for more if we had the money. The\r\n\r\nreason given by the Minister for Finance was fantastic.\r\n\r\nI  did  not  believe it myself. It was that  as  little\r\n\r\nmoney  as possible should be spent in 1959 so  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  1960  Budget  a big sum would be  provided  which\r\n\r\nwould serve as a good propaganda front to boost up  the\r\n\r\neconomy. Mr Speaker, you do not eat today, so that you\r\n\r\ncan have \"two\" bowls tomorrow! The tens of thousands of\r\n\r\napplicants  for  S.I.T. flats have to  suffer  in  this\r\n\r\nmagic  show.  The  purpose of the  1960  Budget,  which\r\n\r\nprovides  for  big construction projects but  is  never\r\n\r\nmeant  to  be fulfilled, is to \"boost\" the economy.  My\r\n\r\nimpression  was  that  only a  small  fraction  of  the\r\n\r\nprojects would be built. You cannot \"boost\" economy  by\r\n\r\nbluff.  Neither  can you consolidate your  position  by\r\n\r\npassing   laws  and  building  community  centres   and\r\n\r\norganising Work Brigade. The masses which turned up  in\r\n\r\ntheir  tens  of thousands to support the 16 resolutions\r\n\r\nat  the  Badminton Hall rally is a concrete and glaring\r\n\r\nexample  of  the bitter disappointment of  the  people.\r\n\r\nTheir   hopes  and  their  dreams  have  been  bitterly\r\n\r\nshattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always stood for honesty and integrity.\r\n\r\nWe  believe in telling the people what we think we  can\r\n\r\nand cannot do. We believe in real construction, the way\r\n\r\nit  was done in the City Council. Targets were set. The\r\n\r\nstaff and the masses were mobilised when required,  and\r\n\r\nan  all-out  effort was made to reach and  surpass  the\r\n\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year has been spent, not on construction, and not\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit of the masses who have supported  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  But one whole year has been spent in  order  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  the  power of the present  leadership,  so\r\n\r\nthat  when  the masses have made up their  minds  after\r\n\r\nsome  doubts:  are  these the people  who  have  really\r\n\r\nbetrayed  them? Are these the people who have  departed\r\n\r\nfrom  the fundamental aims and policies of the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party which they have voted in and on which they\r\n\r\nhave  pinned  their hopes and dreams? - when  the  masses\r\n\r\ndecide  to fight, the Lee Kuan Yew Government  will  be\r\n\r\nconsolidated for such a fight. How do they consolidate?\r\n\r\nThese are some of the ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) laws to control and regulate trade unions, mass\r\n\r\norganisations, political parties and societies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) laws to give undue advantage to the present\r\n\r\nregime in elections;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) creation of so-called mass organisations like\r\n\r\ncommunity centres and Work Brigade to prepare them\r\n\r\nfor  the  time  when  the  Party  members  in  the\r\n\r\nbranches and the masses have melted away;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) television to be immediately installed to take\r\n\r\nthe  place of mass rallies, because there will  be\r\n\r\nfewer  attendances at the mass rallies. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  will  be  able to speak  to  the  masses\r\n\r\nthrough television. Direct and indirect control of\r\n\r\nthe means of propaganda;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) suitable arrangements to ensure that finance is\r\n\r\nnot lacking;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) military exercises, ample bodyguards, security\r\n\r\nguards and fencing for the houses;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) control of the key positions in the Executive,\r\n\r\nthe   Judicature   and  the  control   of   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are three sources of constitutional\r\n\r\npower  in  a democracy: the Legislature, the  Executive\r\n\r\nand  the Judicature. These sources of State power  must\r\n\r\nbe  firmly controlled in the hands of men whose loyalty\r\n\r\nto  the  present regime and the colonial  interests  is\r\n\r\nbeyond  doubt.  The  Lee Kuan Yew Government  can  only\r\n\r\nmaintain  control  of  the Legislature  if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  do not rebel - like the three  of  us  here,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  struggle between those who stick  to  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicies  and  those who have betrayed P.A.P. policies\r\n\r\nbegins.  From the very early days, they have  tried  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the Assemblymen by devious ways; for instance,\r\n\r\nbrainwashing by Mr Thomson, the softening-up  process,\r\n\r\noverseas  trips.  But  the most effective  way  is  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of a way of life to these Assemblymen  which\r\n\r\nmakes them identify themselves with the status quo  and\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to benefit by the social revolution.  The\r\n\r\nExecutive, which is the second source of constitutional\r\n\r\npower, must be in the control, of persons whose loyalty\r\n\r\nto  the Prime Minister and his Minister for Finance and\r\n\r\nwhat  they  represent is beyond doubt. That is  why  we\r\n\r\nhave the Meadows', the Thomsons, and so on, controlling\r\n\r\nmore State power today than in the previous government.\r\n\r\nThe Judicature must also be in safe hands. The story  I\r\n\r\nheard about the non-confirmation of Mr Tan Ah Tah, the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice, is something which the public  will  be\r\n\r\nshocked to know. I quote what the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. said about the Judicature in l956 - Hansard of\r\n\r\n5th December, 1956, col. 1082:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The second issue on which the White Paper has been\r\n\r\nsilent  is the Supreme Court judgeships, it is an  open\r\n\r\nsecret that there has been political wrangling over the\r\n\r\nappointment  of two new judges, dating  from  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the Labour Front Coalition Government was led  by\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Cairnhill.  We  now  know  from  the\r\n\r\nestimates  that  only  one  more  judgeship  is  to  be\r\n\r\ncreated. We wish to make it clear that, whatever this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment says in this White Paper, my Party  believes\r\n\r\nthat   the  principle  of  the  inviolability  of   the\r\n\r\njudiciary  can only be accepted after we Malayans  have\r\n\r\ndecided  who  shall  fill those positions.  We  do  not\r\n\r\naccept  that  those  whom the colonial  Government  has\r\n\r\nappointed  as our judges are inviolate, and  cannot  be\r\n\r\nremoved by this Legislature or this Government. However\r\n\r\nhonest,  however good as lawyers they may be, they  are\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel  of the colonial machinery  which  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable   to  any  Malayan  nationalist.   In   no\r\n\r\nterritory  of  the British Commonwealth  in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia  were European judges allowed to remain in  office\r\n\r\nwhen  the British imperial power finally departed.  The\r\n\r\nonly  exception  was  in Ceylon  where  a  white  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice, who I notice is already a model for the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice  of  the Federation of Malaya, was  allowed  to\r\n\r\nremain  because the Ceylonese Government wanted him  to\r\n\r\nremain. But when that Government decided that he should\r\n\r\ngo,  he  went. That is a principle which we must  first\r\n\r\nestablish  before  we  accept  the  principle  of   the\r\n\r\ninviolability  of  the  judical service.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nunfair to many distinguished judges if my remarks  were\r\n\r\nto  create  the impression that I think they  were  all\r\n\r\ndishonest   and   useless   instruments   of    British\r\n\r\nimperialism. The former Chief Justice of Singapore, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  was a man of great learning and  balance  of\r\n\r\njudgment,  for  whom all members of  the  Bar,  whether\r\n\r\nwhite or black, had considerable respect. That does not\r\n\r\nin the slightest way detract from the principle that we\r\n\r\ncannot  accept a white judiciary imposed  upon  us.  We\r\n\r\nwant the principle established that if we want them  to\r\n\r\nquit, then they must go. Then when we appoint our local\r\n\r\nmen,  they  will be inviolate. They cannot  be  removed\r\n\r\neither  by the Government or the Legislature except  by\r\n\r\nthe most stringent of procedures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I just want to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to his speech made in 1956. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  three sources of constitutional power,  the\r\n\r\nLegislature, the Executive and the Judicature, must  be\r\n\r\nin  safe hands. By the end of the first year of office,\r\n\r\nthe  Lee  Kuan  Yew  government  hopes  to  see  itself\r\n\r\nstrongly  entrenched with the approaching  storm.  They\r\n\r\nknow  that  the betrayal of P.A.P.'s aims and  policies\r\n\r\ncannot  be  left  unchallenged for long  by  the  Party\r\n\r\nmembers and the people. This is what the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmeant  when he said that \"the first year of office  was\r\n\r\none  of reorganisation, consolidation and preparation.\"\r\n\r\nReorganisation, consolidation and preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lee Kuan Yew government still considers that the\r\n\r\nfundamental conflict in our society is one of  language\r\n\r\nand not of economics. He splits Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety  into  the  Chinese-speaking and  the  English-speaking - you  will find this in his speech yesterday - he\r\n\r\nconsiders  the  Tamils  and the Malays  as  numerically\r\n\r\nunimportant  in  Singapore and not what socialists  do:\r\n\r\ninto  economic classes. This will serve to explain  the\r\n\r\nattitude  towards Nanyang University. They always  talk\r\n\r\nabout  external  influences in Chinese  textbooks,  for\r\n\r\ninstance.  But  they never talk about British  colonial\r\n\r\ninfluences,  in text-books used in the English  schools\r\n\r\nand  printed by British commercial firms in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nDue to a wrong analysis of the basic contradictions  of\r\n\r\nour  society,  the Nantah (Nanyang University)  problem\r\n\r\nhas resolved itself into a deadlock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we do not believe that language separates us. We believe in a united Malayan nation of all races.\r\n\r\nA  society is not divided into the languages  that  the\r\n\r\npeople speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our attitude towards education is this: we stand for\r\n\r\nreal  equal  treatment  in  all  the  four  streams  of\r\n\r\neducation. We consider the fundamental conflict in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  as  an  economic  problem,  and  not  one   of\r\n\r\nlanguage. We do not deny, that when Malay is  made  the\r\n\r\nnational  language, the present language barriers  will\r\n\r\nbe  removed. But the conflict in the language  barriers\r\n\r\nis  not  fundamental.  We need a  phased  programme  of\r\n\r\ntargets  to  be  reached in order  to  make  Malay  the\r\n\r\nnational language. We believe in Malayanisation of  all\r\n\r\ntext-books step by step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the effort to promote industries in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But how can we promote industries within the\r\n\r\npresent  political  context?  Industrialisation  is  in\r\n\r\ndirect  conflict  with the interests  of  the  colonial\r\n\r\npower.  This is what the Party manifesto said  in  1955\r\n\r\nabout industrialisation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The need for industrialisation has been stressed even\r\n\r\nby  advocates of colonialism. Yet very little has  been\r\n\r\ndone  about  it,  and very little besides  the  highest\r\n\r\nexhortations  will  be  done so long  as  the  colonial\r\n\r\nstructure  is  maintained in Malaya.  The  colonialists\r\n\r\nprimarily regarded it as an outlet for the manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods of the mother country. The colonial power cannot,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  expected to be enthusiastic  about  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of local industries which might  seriously\r\n\r\naffect the import of manufactured goods from the mother\r\n\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Party manifesto went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All the Constitutional concessions granted so far\r\n\r\nhave   been   particularly  careful  to   protect   and\r\n\r\nperpetuate  the basic economic and political  interests\r\n\r\nof  the colonial power. The retention of basic colonial\r\n\r\ninterests runs through all Constitutional arrangements.\r\n\r\nsince the reoccupation in 1945.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>At  present,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, investment  policy  is\r\n\r\nconcentrated on how to attract foreign investors. We do\r\n\r\nnot  reject foreign investors, but concentration should\r\n\r\nbe  on  how to encourage local businessmen to  turn  to\r\n\r\nindustries.  Local  investors  should  be  given   more\r\n\r\nfavourable  treatment than foreign investors,  and  not\r\n\r\nthe other way round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nmentioned that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government does not wish to give the impression\r\n\r\nthat  there  have  not been mistakes  and  shortcomings\r\n\r\nduring the past year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, this was repeated by the Prime Minister in\r\n\r\nhis speech yesterday [Straits Times of 4th August]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"Minor mistakes of haste, born out of impatience to\r\n\r\nput  the world right, were committed. They were errors,\r\n\r\nnot  of  the  rashness of the policy to be implemented,\r\n\r\nbut  of  the  intemperate haste in  not  preparing  and\r\n\r\ncarrying  the  people, and could have been  avoided  by\r\n\r\nconsultation and discussion.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, what I gathered from the Prime Minister's address  on  the policy speech and from a recent  Petir\r\n\r\neditorial is that these mistakes are not on fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciples but mistakes of triviality - going a  bit  too\r\n\r\nfast  on  legislation. It means that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law,  who, as I have  said  just  now,  is\r\n\r\nanother  possible scapegoat, has gone  ahead  with  too\r\n\r\nmany pieces of legislation during the past year. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  so much with the laws themselves as with the speed\r\n\r\nwith which they were passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are different. We are not worried about these little mistakes of technicalities and form,\r\n\r\nbecause  no  person can avoid these little mistakes  in\r\n\r\nrunning  his Ministry. What we are more concerned  with\r\n\r\nare   the  mistakes  of  the  content  of  policy   and\r\n\r\nfundamentals.  If  we  are sincere  in  rectifying  our\r\n\r\nmistakes,  then  we  rectify  mistakes  of  policy  and\r\n\r\nfundamentals,  such as reaffirming  the  faith  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  revolutionary manifesto of  the  P.A.P.;\r\n\r\nreaffirming   the   faith  in  the   struggle   against\r\n\r\ncolonialism,  and  all the aims  and  policies  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. before it formed the Government;  fighting  for\r\n\r\nthe  detainees  of  the Internal  Security  Council  to\r\n\r\nrelease them without conditions. I made my stand  clear\r\n\r\nin  a  meeting on 28th August, 1959. Since then I  have\r\n\r\nnot been allowed to speak any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-register the trade unions without conditions. What\r\n\r\nwas  said by others yesterday was not, I believe,  what\r\n\r\nhappened..  Mr Speaker, in the Straits Times  of  25th\r\n\r\nMay, 1960, the Minister for Labour and Law gave reasons\r\n\r\nfor the de-registration of trade unions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Byrne gave two reasons for the Government's\r\n\r\naction.  He  said, `There should be  no registration  of\r\n\r\nany  federation  of  trade unions  within  any  of  the\r\n\r\ncategories of unions set out under the new Trade Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1960, until the Ordinance has become law.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  these reasons were later  withdrawn  and substituted because, if they had persisted,  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Ordinance would become law some time or  other;\r\n\r\nperhaps  it would not become law in May, but  in  June,\r\n\r\nJuly,  August, or even September, and they  would  then\r\n\r\nhave  to  restore the unions' registration. So  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  they  had  to  think out  another  reason,  a\r\n\r\n\"really   good  sound\"  reason - the  Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil, which always comes in useful. Anybody  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade   union  movement  knows  that  the  two  reasons\r\n\r\ncontradict each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gambling Bills reversed the P.A.P.'s taxation\r\n\r\npolicy, and is meant to tax the poor and subsidise  the\r\n\r\nrich;  not to tax the rich and subsidise the poor.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  there  are several types of  government.  The\r\n\r\nBritish   capitalist  government  taxes  the  rich   to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  the poor. They follow the Keynesian  theory.\r\n\r\nOur  so-called socialist Government taxes the  poor  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise the rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectify all the mistakes as enumerated in the Hong Lim\r\n\r\nresolutions. You cannot fight these political issues by\r\n\r\nintimidation on a scale bigger than that of the Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock government, by suppression and by temptation.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  you  cannot just ring up the Press  after  a\r\n\r\nBadminton Hall rally and order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem   to  black  out  the  speeches  made,  and  after\r\n\r\nprotestations  by the Press, allow them  to  limit  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  to 500 words. Yesterday I mentioned that  Mr\r\n\r\nThomson's articles in the Press are not limited to  500\r\n\r\nwords.  In the Nanyang Siang Pau, Mr Thomson wrote  an\r\n\r\narticle  on the Police Force, propounding his  colonial\r\n\r\npolitical philosophy, and that article is not less than\r\n\r\n2,500 words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government does not ring up the Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh and say, \"Boys,  500\r\n\r\nwords  for  Mr  Thomson, and Mr Ong  Eng  Guan  1,000\r\n\r\nwords.\"  Spicy words! \"For Mr Thomson, you  can  write\r\n\r\nany amount of words you like. For Mr Ong Eng Guan, 500\r\n\r\nwords  or 300 words.\" I wonder what is going to be  the\r\n\r\ndirective tonight? I am sure it might be 1,000  or  750\r\n\r\nwords.  At  one  of our Press conferences  one  Sunday,\r\n\r\nthere  was  much bargaining: 300 words, 500 words,  750\r\n\r\nwords, and later, after much bargaining on the counter,\r\n\r\n1,250 words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot win the political battle by detaining a\r\n\r\njournalist  15 minutes after he had attended  my  Press\r\n\r\nconference  on  his way to cable my Press  releases  to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur,  so that you can use him  to  intimidate\r\n\r\nother  journalists.

Knowing the\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic limitations,  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\naccepted the reins of Government so that we can advance\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  the  people as  stated  in  our  Party\r\n\r\nmanifesto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have said is nothing new, but\r\n\r\nhas  been repeatedly said by my Party, by my colleagues\r\n\r\nand  even by my ex-colleague, the Member for Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention either to bore you or this House\r\n\r\nby repeating it over and over again, but I particularly\r\n\r\nwish to stress this point, because there are forces  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today, forces which the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\ntermed  Left-wing adventurers, who are trying  to  lead\r\n\r\nthe  people  astray  by desperately  shouting  that  we\r\n\r\nshould abandon the Constitution and reopen fresh  talks\r\n\r\nwith the U.K. Government; Left-wing adventurers who are\r\n\r\nout  to  bring chaos to this country and misery to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Speaker, and just now, I was watching\r\n\r\nthe  performance of my ex-comrade, the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim. He was never so fiery in all the 14 months he came\r\n\r\nto this Chamber. What a change, Mr Speaker! Yesterday,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim brought volumes of the Hansard\r\n\r\nand reminded the Secretary-General of my Party what he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  said  over  a number of years. I am confident  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of my Party knows the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nParty and what he has said over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you will permit me, I would like to quote the speech by the Member for Hong Lim which he\r\n\r\ndelivered in this House at the opening session of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The words which he spoke will reply  to  his\r\n\r\nfiery speeches today. It is at col. 347 of the Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 11, No. 6 of 21st July, 1959:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--Mr Ong Eng Guan-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b>  Mr  Speaker,  the Rendel Constitution  is  now\r\n\r\ndead. We have today in this Assembly on your right hand\r\n\r\nside  43  representatives of the people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the Rendel Constitution as a constitution  is\r\n\r\nnow  dead, we have still remnants of the Rendel era and\r\n\r\nthe pre-Rendel era in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship which the captain and his crew under the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution have navigated for four years  has\r\n\r\nnow  sunk, and a new ship - the State of Singapore - is now\r\n\r\nbeing manned by a strong, youthful and virile crew  and\r\n\r\nthis  ship, we are confident, will chart and  pave  the\r\n\r\nway  to  all  the  hopes to which we  the  people  have\r\n\r\naspired for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we understand the limitations of the present Constitution, which do restrain the political\r\n\r\npower of the elected representatives of the people.  We\r\n\r\ndo  understand those limitations. We do understand that\r\n\r\nthe  elected  Government  has to  work  within  certain\r\n\r\ndefined   powers   and  that  there   are   curbs   and\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  those powers and  functions  which  a\r\n\r\nnormal   fully  elected  Government  is   supposed   to\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we also understand that within the island state of Singapore, we also have limitations on our\r\n\r\neconomy,  limitations  which  even  a  magician  turned\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance cannot solve. I do  not  envy  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Minister for Finance,  for  his  heavy\r\n\r\ntasks.  But  we  the P.A.P., understanding  those  very\r\n\r\nlimitations,  have  come  up  today  and  accepted  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  Government because  there  is  no\r\n\r\nchoice left to the people. For many years, particularly\r\n\r\nduring  the past four years, we have seen that  it  was\r\n\r\nnothing  but inefficiency, waste, corruption and  filth\r\n\r\neverywhere.  The masses cannot get what they  want - even\r\n\r\nthe  basic  necessities  which  any  modern  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be able to provide. And it is the task  of  the\r\n\r\nPAP.  Government knowing the political and the economic\r\n\r\nlimitations  of the present situation, to come  up  and\r\n\r\naccept the responsibility of this Government, as we did\r\n\r\nso  in  the  City  Council. When we were  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,   our  powers  were  as  limited  within   the\r\n\r\nframework of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution   as  our  powers  now  in   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment are limited within the present framework  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Constitution. But we will be taking  a  wrong\r\n\r\nmove  if  we  refuse  to accept the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are working...\"-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Our  way\r\n\r\nis the way of ultimate independence through merger with\r\n\r\nthe Federation, and before that is achieved we have  to\r\n\r\naccept   whatever  limitations  are  imposed  on   this\r\n\r\nGovernment       by       the       so-called       new\r\n\r\nConstitution - limitations imposed on us in  this  island\r\n\r\nState with no raw materials.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And then he goes on by saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Because of the limitations of the Constitution, the\r\n\r\nrole of the Opposition is even much more important than\r\n\r\never.   The  role  of  the  Opposition  is  to  provide\r\n\r\nconstructive criticism to the Government and  not  just\r\n\r\nto attack the Government in all its policies.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, time has changed and so has the Member for Hong Lim. It would not be a surprise if he were to\r\n\r\nsay that he did not write his speech. He was forced  to\r\n\r\nread  it. He did not believe all this when he spoke  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are forces that stay in this country today which believe that Singapore's economic\r\n\r\nills can be cured by shouting anti-colonial slogans and\r\n\r\nabandoning  the present Constitution now. They  believe\r\n\r\nby shouting anti-colonial slogans and abandoning the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution  the workers will automatically  get  more\r\n\r\ndollars tomorrow.

More    schools,   hospitals   and   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities could be found. The P.A.P. Government has\r\n\r\nno  intention of leading the people of Singapore  to  a\r\n\r\nnational suicide. The P.A.P. Government has stated that\r\n\r\nit  has no intention of recklessly abandoning the  aims\r\n\r\nand policies arrived at after long deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Member for Hong Lim honestly believe that\r\n\r\nwith his 16 resolutions the people of Singapore with an\r\n\r\nempty  stomach can defeat colonialism? No, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  Party  has stated that the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\nrequires more flexible and effective tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the basic problem in Singapore today is to find expanding opportunities for our youth, and only\r\n\r\neconomic  and  industrial  expansion  can  solve   this\r\n\r\nproblem.  The  people  of  Singapore  today  need  more\r\n\r\nexpanding opportunities for employment. Schools, health\r\n\r\nservices  and  housing - and  this  is  what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to do for the people in this year of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  No  one can deny that  with  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment there is now greater economic and  political\r\n\r\nstability.  The  people no longer fear  the  Government\r\n\r\nservants and the Government buildings. The large  crowd\r\n\r\nthat  swarm  the  Labour Ministry and the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development is a demonstration of the people's\r\n\r\nfaith  and confidence in the P.A.P. Government to solve\r\n\r\ntheir  problems. These people enter these buildings  no\r\n\r\nlonger  with fear but with dignity and national  pride.\r\n\r\nThe  previous  year,  as  has been  said,  was  one  of\r\n\r\nreorganisation. Naturally it has not been able to  show\r\n\r\nresults  yet.  But  in the present year,  the  year  of\r\n\r\nconstruction,  lots of things - constructive  plans - would\r\n\r\nhe  done  for  the  people. For  instance,  the  common\r\n\r\ncommodity  market  talks are being  held  now;  private\r\n\r\ninvestments of 13 major concerns have applied under the\r\n\r\nPioneer  Industries Ordinance so that they  could  give\r\n\r\nmore jobs to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople   in  Singapore;  the  Jurong  Industrialisation\r\n\r\nScheme and the Government's Five-Year Economic Plan - all\r\n\r\nthese schemes will be put into effect this year and the\r\n\r\ncoming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, from the speeches made yesterday\r\n\r\nand today by the Prime Minister and the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim,  it appears to me that this Chamber is being  used\r\n\r\nas   a  House  to  debate  Party  differences.  At  the\r\n\r\nbeginning,  I  was of the opinion that we were  wasting\r\n\r\ntime,  but the points brought up by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Member for Hong Lim reveal clearly  that  the\r\n\r\natmosphere in the P.A.P. is unhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should go into the main issue, that is, the speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. My Party and I are  of\r\n\r\nthe opinion that the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara is unsatisfactory. It is also unsatisfactory  to\r\n\r\nthe  public. It refers to what will be done and not  to\r\n\r\nwhat  has  already been done. I have read the 24-column\r\n\r\nspeech  many times. What is most strange is that  there\r\n\r\nis   no  mention  at  all  about  the  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I have gone through the speech  in  detail,\r\n\r\nbut I have not come across the phrase \"a non-Communist,\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Malaya\" which was previously  used  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. It may be that since the speech of  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara two weeks ago in this  Chamber,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  a  change  in  the  attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  is not positive in its  stand  on  the\r\n\r\npolitical  situation in Singapore or in  Malaya  today.\r\n\r\nDoes  it  mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the  Government,\r\n\r\nafter  14  months  in office, has now awakened  to  the\r\n\r\ndanger  of  Communism  which  could  bring  about   its\r\n\r\ndownfall? Does it also mean that the Government,  after\r\n\r\n14  months in office, has now only realised that  there\r\n\r\ndo  exist elements which constitute a source of  danger\r\n\r\nto  it  and  to  the people of Singapore?  I  say  this\r\n\r\nbecause the Prime Minister in his speech admitted  that\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty  is  re-organising its  forces  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ndamaging  the economy and the trade union  movement  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. If this is the state of affairs in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday, then I think it would be most propitious for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to change its attitude from  that  of  non-Communist to that of anti-Communist-Then only would  it\r\n\r\nmean  that the Government is positive in its  stand.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that we should be frank and honest. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  always been harping on the fact that it is a  non-Communist  Government and that their actions show  that\r\n\r\nthey  are anti-Communist. Is there another side to  the\r\n\r\npicture?  Could it mean that the Government will  still\r\n\r\nadopt  a non-Communist attitude but that outside forces\r\n\r\nwill  put  pressure  on the Government  to  take  anti-Communist steps? I think the Government should  clarify\r\n\r\ntheir stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Prime Minister has said that the\r\n\r\nobject  of  the  Government  is  to  establish  a  non-Communist, socialist Malaya. My Party and I are of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that  it  is  difficult for  us  to  create  a\r\n\r\nsocialist Malaya until the people of Singapore  feel  a\r\n\r\nsense  of loyalty to the State. This is the fundamental\r\n\r\nissue  in all independent countries in Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nWe  have  seen the different `isms' put into  practice:\r\n\r\nCommunism,  Socialism  and  Liberalism.  But  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  factor is that the people of the State  must\r\n\r\nfeel  a  sense  of national pride. If no  such  feeling\r\n\r\ncould  be  aroused among the people, it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  create  any kind of  `ism' - whether  it  is\r\n\r\nCommunism  or  Socialism.  In  this  connection,   this\r\n\r\nnational feeling is akin to a tree. If the roots of the\r\n\r\ntree are not watered, it will die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G.KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to the\r\n\r\neconomy  of the State of Singapore. The Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  in  his  speech  has said  that  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  now  more stable both  economically  and\r\n\r\npolitically. I do not see how the Government can arrive\r\n\r\nat such a conclusion. It is clear and obvious that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economy  of  Singapore  at  this  moment  is  very\r\n\r\nunhealthy. Thousands of people are unemployed. We  have\r\n\r\nheard  in this Chamber that not less than 58,000 people\r\n\r\nhave  registered for employment in the Labour Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has failed to give a guarantee  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  the  58,000 registered unemployed  people\r\n\r\nwill  be given employment. Furthermore, there are  many\r\n\r\nthousands of unemployed persons who have not registered\r\n\r\nfor employment. In all, there are not less than 100,000\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore who are out of job. Normally,  when\r\n\r\nthe prices of rubber and tin are high, Singapore stands\r\n\r\nto  benefit, although these commodities come  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. But today, although the prices of\r\n\r\nrubber  and  tin are high, yet the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nare not enjoying the prosperity that is experienced  by\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  how  can  the  Government  say  that   the\r\n\r\neconomic stability of Singapore is healthy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to speak at\r\n\r\nlength  on the City Council, but I would like  to  draw\r\n\r\nthe attention of the Members of the House to an article\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P.  Petir and in other newspapers  clearly\r\n\r\npointing out that the previous Government did  not  use\r\n\r\nits  dictatorial powers when it took over the functions\r\n\r\nof  the City Council, although at that time there  were\r\n\r\nmany  allegations  levelled  at  the  then  Government.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there is one question which I would  like  to\r\n\r\nput  to  the  Prime  Minister himself.  When  will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment establish the Public Utilities Board to  run\r\n\r\nthe utility services? This is not a new suggestion,  as\r\n\r\nit  was  decided by a Committee (formed by the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment in 1956) on which members of the P.A.P. also\r\n\r\nsat. We would like clarification from the Government as\r\n\r\nto when this Board will come into existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, the speech\r\n\r\nof the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is most unsatisfactory to\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. in respect of the special position  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays.  Yesterday, my colleague the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan spoke at length on this subject, and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwould  like to add further to what he has said. In  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nmention  at  all  about  the special  position  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays.  However, I am confident, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the Government can implement the provisions\r\n\r\ncontained in the preamble to the Constitution. But what\r\n\r\nthe  Government has done during the past 14  months  is\r\n\r\nfar  from  satisfactory. In the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, no mention has been made as to how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is going to put into effect the  provisions\r\n\r\nin  the Constitution which was agreed upon by U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front, the Liberal-Socialists and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the constitutional talks in London  in\r\n\r\n1957  and  1958. The Hon. the Prime Minister and  other\r\n\r\nMembers  of the P.A.P. have said that the Malays  would\r\n\r\nbe helped in the field of education. I agree with that,\r\n\r\nbut  this should not mean that this is the only way  we\r\n\r\ncould  render  assistance to the Malays.  Education  is\r\n\r\ngood  and  beneficial for our children who will  become\r\n\r\nadults  in  the  future. But what about the  Malays  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  today - those who are out  of  job  and  possess\r\n\r\nnothing?  Are these people to be victimised?  What  are\r\n\r\nthe ways and means by which the Government proposes  to\r\n\r\nhelp   these  people  who  are  suffering?  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is well known that Malays are  unable\r\n\r\nto  get  jobs in commercial firms, except a few British\r\n\r\ncommercial firms which are prepared to offer employment\r\n\r\nto  the  Malays. We know that a great majority  of  the\r\n\r\ntraders in Singapore refuse to offer employment to  the\r\n\r\nMalays   for  Unknown  reasons  except  as   syces   or\r\n\r\ngardeners. Therefore, the Malays are forced to turn  to\r\n\r\nthe Government for help. The Malays are forced to leave\r\n\r\ntheir  fate  in the hands of the Government. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  should  be the responsibility of the Government  to\r\n\r\noffer jobs and help to the Malays in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that as far as the Malays are concerned,\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  relax  the terms  of  employment  and\r\n\r\nconditions governing promotion of serving officers. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, in his speech, has said that in view of\r\n\r\nthe shortage of staff in the Government service, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright  and  proper  that  academic  qualifications  for\r\n\r\nemployment be relaxed. Therefore, it will be  in  order\r\n\r\nfor  Government  to relax the terms of entry  into  the\r\n\r\ncivil service, as far as the Malays are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, on the question of housing, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech has said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will construct 52,000 units at  a  cost  of\r\n\r\n$210 million. I hope that this expenditure will not  be\r\n\r\nconcentrated only on the building of flats at  Kallang,\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  and like places, but also that  Government\r\n\r\nwill  set aside a portion of this sum on projects  like\r\n\r\nthe Jalan Eunos Resettlement, where houses are sold  to\r\n\r\nthe poorer Malays on an instalment basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of health, I have just received the\r\n\r\nreport  of the Ministry of Health for the year 1958.  I\r\n\r\nhave  read the chapter on Infant Mortality, and  it  is\r\n\r\nclearly  seen  that infant deaths are 35  per  thousand\r\n\r\namong  the  Chinese,  and  40 per  thousand  among  the\r\n\r\nIndians.  But in the case of the Malays, I am surprised\r\n\r\nto find that out of every thousand infants born, 85 die\r\n\r\nbefore  they  reach the age of one year.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  the  Minister for  Health  to  institute  a\r\n\r\ncommittee to investigate this high mortality rate,  and\r\n\r\nto put up views and suggestions to Government as to how\r\n\r\nto resolve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now turn to the subject of the Alsagoff Estate. Not long ago I raised a question\r\n\r\nin  this Chamber as to what were Government's plans  in\r\n\r\nregard  to this estate. Then I was of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nAlsagoff Estate would soon be sold and the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents there would be helpless. It is therefore\r\n\r\nproper  that Government should draw up a plan  to  look\r\n\r\nafter the interests of the residents. But at that  time\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance replied to the effect that  he\r\n\r\nhad  no  information  whatsoever that  Alsagoff  Estate\r\n\r\nwould  be sold. Until about five months ago, Government\r\n\r\nwas  not able to do anything about it. The position  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents  there is akin to  that  of  the  people\r\n\r\nliving  in Nee Soon, where the tenure is very insecure.\r\n\r\nSo, I hope that Government, in its Five-Year Plan, will\r\n\r\nspend part of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   money   voted  for  reconstruction  purposes   in\r\n\r\npurchasing  this  estate, cutting  it  into  lots,  for\r\n\r\nultimate sale on instalments to the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will speak on the Islam religion. The Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara in his speech said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government will introduce comprehensive\r\n\r\nlegislation  for the regulation of Muslim marriage  and\r\n\r\ndivorce  and Muslim religious affairs on the  lines  of\r\n\r\nlegislation in the States of the Federation of Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This   is  ideal  and  good.  This  time  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nGovernment, in introducing such legislation, will  give\r\n\r\nample  time to the Opposition for study, and that  free\r\n\r\ncopies of the legislation translated into Malay will be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Muslims in Singapore so that they  could\r\n\r\nclosely  follow  the  legislation  that  affects  their\r\n\r\nreligion.  And  I also hope that Government  will  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  matter  of  zakats  and  wakafs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because such matters are now in  a  chaotic\r\n\r\nstate,   and  should  receive  the  attention  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  Government  also  should   base   its\r\n\r\nproposed legislation on the lines of legislation in the\r\n\r\nStates of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the motion of thanks moved by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his motion, the Prime Minister has given a\r\n\r\ncritical  review of the past and a bold  and  realistic\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the  future. It is my fervent  hope  that\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition would study this  excellent\r\n\r\npiece   of  political  discourse  so  as  to  at  least\r\n\r\nunderstand  the political forces at work in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhether they agree or disagree with the P.A.P. stand is\r\n\r\nimmaterial.  But what is important is that they  should\r\n\r\nbe  aware  of  the  existence of a  perpetual  struggle\r\n\r\nbetween  the forces of the extreme Left and the extreme\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party is a socialist Party,\r\n\r\npledged  to  eliminate  the unjustness  of  a  colonial\r\n\r\nsociety  and the exploitation of man by man. We believe\r\n\r\nin the principles of socialism and of the building of a\r\n\r\nmore just and egalitarian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety. It is therefore out of the question to  expect\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  move  to  the extreme  Right  and,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested by the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan,  to\r\n\r\nadopt  a  fanatical anti-Communist stand. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,   the  methods  of  bloody  revolution   and   of\r\n\r\ntotalitarianism  of the extreme Left convulse  us  with\r\n\r\nhorror. We value too much the democratic ways of  life,\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of the individual, the privileges  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to  be governed by a government of  their  own\r\n\r\nchoice.  It  becomes  therefore  equally  out  of   the\r\n\r\nquestion  to expect the P.A.P. to join hands  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunist forces towards its own extinction.  We  stand\r\n\r\nfor  what  we believe in, and we do so with a firm  and\r\n\r\nunshakeable  conviction  for the  establishment  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent,   democratic,   non-Communist,   socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  As the Communists believe that history  is  on\r\n\r\ntheir  side, so do we believe that history  is  on  our\r\n\r\nside.   This  belief  is  evolved  not  out  of   cheap\r\n\r\nplagiarism,  but  out  of  a scientific  and  realistic\r\n\r\nanalysis of the special conditions obtaining in  Malaya\r\n\r\nin   relation   to  the  tendencies  of   international\r\n\r\npolitical  trends.  In so far as the present  political\r\n\r\nleadership of Soviet Russia dismisses the idea that war\r\n\r\nwould  inevitably  lead  to a  Communist  victory  `and\r\n\r\nCommunist   expansion,  we  believe  that   present-day\r\n\r\nMarxists are capable of moving and modifying their ways\r\n\r\nwith  the change of times. The present deadlock in  the\r\n\r\ncold  war cannot be sustained forever. There must be  a\r\n\r\nthird  force  to  resolve these  two  antagonistic  and\r\n\r\nopposing forces in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaya, we believe that non-Communist socialism is\r\n\r\nthe  answer. We believe this with such deep  conviction\r\n\r\nthat  it would be hopeless for either the extreme  Left\r\n\r\nor  the  extreme  Right to coerce us  into  any  unholy\r\n\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spoken but on very few occasions in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  it is my privilege, of not only being  unlikely\r\n\r\nto  be  misquoted  or  quoted out of  context  both  in\r\n\r\nrelation to time and text, but also of remembering what\r\n\r\nI  have  said  in  this House. On one  occasion  I  was\r\n\r\nreputed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  have  used  language that got  past  the  excellent\r\n\r\nparliamentary  vigilance  of  the  Speaker.  I  vividly\r\n\r\nremember that during the last Budget session,  I  spoke\r\n\r\non  the  need  for the Opposition not to  use  alarmist\r\n\r\ntactics,  not  to make mountains out of molehills,  and\r\n\r\nnot  to  delude the people with false alarms and  half-truths.  I  am indeed sad to note, Sir, that my  advice\r\n\r\nhas  fallen  upon  barren soil. I  have  always  prided\r\n\r\nmyself  on  being somewhat popular with ladies  of  all\r\n\r\nages, and of all sizes! In consequence I have developed\r\n\r\na  human  virtue, or feeling, or whatever you may  call\r\n\r\nit,   of   chivalry.  Notwithstanding   this   acquired\r\n\r\ndisposition, I find it hard to let some of the  remarks\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Member for Mountbatten pass  by  without\r\n\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer again to her alarmist antics, though I must\r\n\r\nadmit  to  remaining  a  silent  admirer  of  her  very\r\n\r\nCarnegiean eloquence and pedagogic ease with which  she\r\n\r\nhandles the Queen's English, puns and all. She kept  on\r\n\r\nharping  about  the  fleeing of capital,  even  to  the\r\n\r\nabsurdity of suggesting that the P.A.P. Government  was\r\n\r\nincompetent and not fit to govern, and that Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government were but political playboys.  I\r\n\r\nwish she would understand the realism of politics or at\r\n\r\nleast  the realism of everyday life. I find it ironical\r\n\r\nthat  I have to explain to a matured schoolteacher with\r\n\r\nrich experience that people resist change, and that  to\r\n\r\nevery  action  there  must be  an  equal  and  opposing\r\n\r\nreaction,  and  that  we cannot  and  must  not  expect\r\n\r\ncapitalists to love socialists. In fact, only 14 months\r\n\r\nafter  a socialist victory in the elections, Government\r\n\r\nhave  not only managed to stop the out-flow of  capital\r\n\r\nfrom   the   country  but  actually   induced   private\r\n\r\ninvestment in Singapore. This is eloquent testimony  to\r\n\r\nthe  ability of the P.A.P. leadership to respond to the\r\n\r\nneeds of our people and of our State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, Sir, the advent of a socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  followed  by  a  transitory  unsettling\r\n\r\nperiod.  This period has been universal and consistent.\r\n\r\nEvery  socialist government, be it the first Government\r\n\r\nof  the  United Kingdom or of Australia or New Zealand,\r\n\r\nhas    had    to    face    difficulties    with    the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommercial world and the civil service. In Singapore in\r\n\r\nparticular, we have a civil service the upper  echelons\r\n\r\nof which are geared to a British standard of living and\r\n\r\nway  of life, whilst the labouring classes stagnate  at\r\n\r\nthe Asian level. The unsettling effect must necessarily\r\n\r\nbe expected to be both exaggerated and prolonged. It is\r\n\r\nhard  to  expect  a  class of individuals,  with  newly\r\n\r\nacquired  privileges and pleasures, to  jettison  these\r\n\r\nprivileges  and  pleasures overnight.  There  has  been\r\n\r\nsufficient  dissertation  on  the  philosophy  of   the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated elite, of which I am one, that I would\r\n\r\nnot wish to repeat the arguments in this House. Suffice\r\n\r\nit  to  mention regretfully that most of  the  English-educated  elite,  nurtured  by  a  colonial  education,\r\n\r\nconfused  by  capitalist-controlled English newspapers,\r\n\r\nand  deluded  by  promises of the previous  government,\r\n\r\nwere  not protagonists of the silent revolution led  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and  inspired by the  Asian  revolutionary\r\n\r\nfervour.  The  natural tendency and response  of  these\r\n\r\npeople   to  a  P.A.P.  Government  was  to  quit,   if\r\n\r\nalternative employment was available and in the case of\r\n\r\nthe    more   highly   paid   Government   officers - the\r\n\r\ndoctors - not   only  was  there  the   availability   of\r\n\r\nalternative employment, but there was also the lucre of\r\n\r\nprivate  practice. This clearly gives the  lie  to  the\r\n\r\nstatement  of  the  Member  for  Mountbatten - that   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health has only one will, and that is  the\r\n\r\nwill  to  see doctors resign from the service.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  every effort is being made to encourage  the\r\n\r\ndoctors to remain in the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be pertinent here, Sir, to mention that the\r\n\r\ndoctors  are  the  first  to  be  offered  professional\r\n\r\nallowances.  In fact, the professional allowances  were\r\n\r\nnegotiated by the doctors to their benefit, so much  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  other  professional officers  became  rather\r\n\r\nunhappy. The professional allowances payable are: -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$225 for officers receiving a basic salary of $1,000\r\n\r\nand above;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150 for officers receiving a basic salary between\r\n\r\n$900 and $1,000;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$75 for officers receiving below $900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary scale of medical officers commences at $820\r\n\r\nper  month, while the other professional officers start\r\n\r\nat  somewhere around $600. Therein lies the  grudge  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  professional officers. They take  a  longer\r\n\r\ntime to reach the maximum of $225 allowances per month.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is also aware that many  of  our  local\r\n\r\nofficers are keen to go overseas for higher studies and\r\n\r\npostgraduate  qualifications. Because of  the  relative\r\n\r\nshortage  of medical staff, they have to be held  back.\r\n\r\nPlans  have  therefore been set  afoot  to  solve  this\r\n\r\nshortage  by recruiting doctors overseas, so  that  our\r\n\r\nown  doctors may not be deprived of the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nspecialise.  In this respect, I am pleased to  announce\r\n\r\nthat  plans  are ahead for the recruitment  of  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed happy to say that today the unsettled\r\n\r\nperiod  is over, both in the world of commerce  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. The English-educated, despite their\r\n\r\nlack  of  revolutionary fervour, has many  virtues.  In\r\n\r\ngeneral,  the English-educated is more liberal  and  is\r\n\r\nnon-communal  in  outlook.  In  particular,  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  is  diligent, intelligent and  able  to  adapt\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  the circumstances and  respond  to  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the people. In the Ministry of Health, we have\r\n\r\nthe fullest co-operation from all our staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the Opposition in  general,  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Mountbatten  in particular,  that  in  the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the opening  of\r\n\r\nthis Parliamentary session, the grammatical tenses must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  prevalent in  the  future  tense.  Any\r\n\r\ngovernment,  to  stress on the past in  such  speeches,\r\n\r\nwould indeed be a dead duck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G.

I  stand  to\r\n\r\ncorrection, Sir, but I do recall that she said that the\r\n\r\nsolution to the criminal and sinful waste of water  due\r\n\r\nto  abuse  of public stand-pipes can be, and  will  be,\r\n\r\nsolved  by  installing water pipes in  each  and  every\r\n\r\nhousehold. Perchance she is unaware that housewives and\r\n\r\nhouseholders  do  not allow water to  flow  freely  and\r\n\r\nunnecessarily from their water pipes because the  waste\r\n\r\nis  charged  in terms of dollars and cents; or  perhaps\r\n\r\nshe  was suggesting that Government should supply  free\r\n\r\nwater  to  all households. If so, the Government  would\r\n\r\nalso have to supply free electricity, free housing, and\r\n\r\nfree  transport.  It  all sounds  very  nice  and  very\r\n\r\nUtopian.  But where do we stop? Who will foot the  bill\r\n\r\nfor these enlarged free social services?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan, in his usual long-windedness, spoke on things which he has always spoken\r\n\r\nin  this  House.  The only new note he  struck  was  to\r\n\r\nappeal to the P.A.P. in all his naive sincerity to drop\r\n\r\nits non-Communist stand and adopt anti-Communism. It is\r\n\r\nperhaps  asking too much of him to understand that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. stands  for  non-Communist  socialism  out   of\r\n\r\nconviction  and  belief, and not out of expedience  and\r\n\r\nconvenience. In his enthusiasm he allowed himself to be\r\n\r\ncarried  over  dangerous ground. And  he  affirmed  his\r\n\r\nfaith   in  communalism  which  the  Federation   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   Tunku  Abdul  Rahman,  has   denounced   as\r\n\r\npolitical  bigotry  and adventurism.  He  went  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  quoting chapter and verse from  a  book  of\r\n\r\nfiction to prove that the Malays founded Singapore. But\r\n\r\nis  all this effort necessary when the special position\r\n\r\nof  the Malays is already written into the preamble  of\r\n\r\nour Constitution?

But\r\n\r\nwe  are  realistic  enough to know  that  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  the  inter-play of forces between the  extreme\r\n\r\nLeft   and  the  extreme  Right,  we  must  compromise.\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  be  independent  by  itself,  either\r\n\r\npolitically or economically, unless with merger with  a\r\n\r\nlarger  entity.  I  am  sure the Member  for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nrealises this. As long as we cannot be independent,  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  other  choice  but to  accept  the  terms  of\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government. The alternative is political\r\n\r\nsuicide,  not  only for the People's Action  Party  but\r\n\r\nalso  for  the  people of Singapore. Unless  increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  factory  chimneys  emit  smoke  into   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   skyline,  unless  the  P.A.P. policy   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice is made real,  socialism\r\n\r\nand  independence  for Singapore will  have  to  remain\r\n\r\nmyths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim talked at length on\r\n\r\nMalayanisation. Surely he should know  that  the  right\r\n\r\ntime and the right place to express his concern was  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1955,  when  the Malayanisation  Commission,\r\n\r\nchaired  by  my  friend,  teacher  and  colleague,  Dr\r\n\r\nSreenivasan,  was  in  session.  Surely  he  cannot  be\r\n\r\nunaware  that  Malayanisation involves the  payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  to entitled expatriate officers.  May  I,\r\n\r\nSir,   quote  from  a  booklet  entitled  \"Scheme   for\r\n\r\ncompensation for loss of career.\" Page 1, paragraph 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The object of the Retirement from the Public Service\r\n\r\n(Compensation)  Ordinance,  1956,  is  to  permit   the\r\n\r\npayment  of  compensation to certain  officers  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government whose services may no  longer  be\r\n\r\nrequired... The Ordinance is in effect a scheme to award\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  certain  categories  of  officers  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of  whom  the  Secretary  of  State  accepted\r\n\r\nresponsibility  when  they  were  appointed  and  whose\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service  will have  been  fundamentally\r\n\r\naltered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In the second paragraph of the same booklet, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In addition to earned pension or gratuity in lieu,\r\n\r\nentitled  officers who retire under the Ordinance  will\r\n\r\nhe eligible to receive compensation...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 11, it again says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every entitled officer will be informed of his future\r\n\r\nprospects by being sent with his option form  a  letter\r\n\r\neither  requiring  him  to retire  or  offering  him  a\r\n\r\nminimum period of assured further service in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  period  of  further service  may  subsequently  be\r\n\r\nincreased but will not be decreased.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Mr Speaker, Sir, the \"period of further\r\n\r\nservice may subsequently be increased but will  not  be\r\n\r\ndecreased.\" Again quoting paragraph 25:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Compensation is the capital amount paid for loss of\r\n\r\ncareer  and will be calculated in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Schedule to the Ordinance. In brief,  the  lump\r\n\r\nsum  is the product of an officer's total annual  fixed\r\n\r\nemoluments  and any personal pensionable allowance  and\r\n\r\nthe  compensation factor appropriate  to  his  age  and\r\n\r\nlength of service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In paragraph 24, it again says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Section 19 of the Ordinance provides for loans\r\n\r\nagainst  compensation. A loan must  not  exceed  three-quarters  of the compensation for which an  officer  is\r\n\r\neligible, and will be subject td interest at  the  rate\r\n\r\nof one quarter per cent per mensem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  it might be pertinent to mention, Sir, that in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  expatriate officers, most of them have  taken\r\n\r\nthis loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, it is not only illegal to\r\n\r\nmalayanise  any post prematurely, but gross  folly  and\r\n\r\nindeed  brinkmanship  to  rid  the  country  of  expert\r\n\r\nofficers  after  having  paid  very  dearly  for  their\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be relevant again to note, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission, which was regarded to be too\r\n\r\nLeft  by the previous Government, stated in its interim\r\n\r\nreport.  I  quote,  Sir,  \"The Interim  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission\", page 13, paragraph 15:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Caution must be exercised in the case of departments\r\n\r\nwhose needs require knowledge and skill so precise  and\r\n\r\nexacting that anything less would invariably mean chaos\r\n\r\nin  those departments.

Member for Geylang Serai in his speech again\r\n\r\nharped  on  communalism.  Already  the  Government   is\r\n\r\nproviding  free  education at all  levels  for  Malays.\r\n\r\nAlready  all  privileges are given to  Malays  both  in\r\n\r\nrespect of higher studies and of employment, and  still\r\n\r\nhe  harps  on it. His latest technique is to  introduce\r\n\r\ninto this Assembly the very well-known infant mortality\r\n\r\nrates  of the various races. The Malays have an  infant\r\n\r\nmortality rate of 85 per thousand up to the age of  one\r\n\r\nyear.  Surely,  Sir, this cannot be attributed  to  any\r\n\r\nmistake  of  the  present  Government.  Surely,  if  it\r\n\r\nreflects  anything at all, it reflects  the  ineptitude\r\n\r\nand   the  incompetence  of  the  previous  Government.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] Why not? Of course, it must reflect  the\r\n\r\nincompetence  of  the previous Government  because  the\r\n\r\nfigures   today   show   the  inefficiencies   of   the\r\n\r\nadministration yesterday. In any case,  there  is  very\r\n\r\nlittle  that the present Government can do about  these\r\n\r\nrates,  because the previous Government had not thought\r\n\r\nit fit to teach the Malays the acceptance of the modern\r\n\r\nmethods of science and medicine. It is well known  that\r\n\r\nthe Malay is conservative in so far as Western medicine\r\n\r\nis  concerned. He still believes in the bomoh and would\r\n\r\nbe  reluctant to go and see a doctor until a very  late\r\n\r\nstage  when the doctor can do very little.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government to educate these Malays  to\r\n\r\nbetter  understand  that  the  facilities  provided  by\r\n\r\nmodern  medicine is in their interest. It  is  in  this\r\n\r\nconnection that we have stressed in the speech  of  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Two Out-patient clinics will be opened at Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nand  Lim  Ah Pin Road.

It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore,  the  intention of this  Government  to\r\n\r\nincrease the number of child welfare centres so  as  to\r\n\r\ngive  the Malays in the rural areas a better chance  to\r\n\r\nbe educated and a better chance to make use of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities  offered  by  the  Government,  whose   only\r\n\r\ninterest is in the interest of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the year that has passed has been one\r\n\r\nof  sustained  activity in the promotion of  the  well-being of our growing working population. When the reins\r\n\r\nof  political power passed into our hands just a little\r\n\r\nmore than a year ago, we boldly declared that we were a\r\n\r\nGovernment  solidly on the side of the workers  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  by  our  actions in the past year honoured  every\r\n\r\nword of that declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took immediate stock of the position and found that\r\n\r\nmuch  of  the  past labour discontent was  due  to  the\r\n\r\nfailure  of the previous Government, i.e. the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock   Government,  to  implement  the  provisions   of\r\n\r\nlegislation which were enacted for the benefit  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of our expanded labour courts have spent\r\n\r\nmuch  of  their  time in the last year adjudicating  on\r\n\r\nindividual  and union claims for arrears in respect  of\r\n\r\novertime, holiday pay, annual leave and other  benefits\r\n\r\nof   which   our  workers  have  been  wrongfully   and\r\n\r\nshamefully  deprived. These arrears in most cases  were\r\n\r\nsuch  that if all defaulting employers were obliged  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  full  extent of these claims,  most  of  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  employers would have been put out of business.\r\n\r\nFor  that reason, a Ministry directive had to be issued\r\n\r\nto  the officials of our labour courts instructing them\r\n\r\nto  limit  these  claims  for arrears  when  they  were\r\n\r\nreceived, to a period of one year only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have had to issue directives to protect\r\n\r\ncertain employers from their own past wickedness, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the disputes which have taken place in the\r\n\r\npast  year  have  not been over wage demands  but  over\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and  temporary lay-offs.  Industries  are\r\n\r\nsometimes  forced to take this action  because  of  the\r\n\r\nfluctuation  in  the  demand  for  their  products   in\r\n\r\noverseas  markets,  or because of a  shortage  or  non-availability  of  the raw materials they  require.  The\r\n\r\nunions have, because of the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurplus  of labour, resisted very strongly such  action\r\n\r\nby  employers, and industrial peace, therefore,  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  maintained under such conditions until a remedy  is\r\n\r\nfound.  Immediate  attention  will  be  given  to   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  a  relief scheme in  respect  of  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries  so  that  workers  who   are\r\n\r\nunfortunately retrenched or temporarily laid  off  will\r\n\r\nbe  provided with temporary relief funds to  tide  them\r\n\r\nover the period when they are retrenched until they get\r\n\r\nnew  employment; or when they are laid off, until  they\r\n\r\nare re-employed. It is obvious, Sir, that such a relief\r\n\r\nscheme,  if it is to be successful, must be limited  to\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries  which  are   tied   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's industrial expansion programme. Commercial\r\n\r\nenterprises which engage only in the import and  export\r\n\r\ntrade   as   well  as  banking,  insurance,   shipping,\r\n\r\ntransport  and  other such concerns  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nexcluded  from the scheme. In circumstances  where  the\r\n\r\nrelief scheme is applicable, the funds will be provided\r\n\r\nby  contributions  from both employers  and  employees.\r\n\r\nThere will have to be a minimum contribution period and\r\n\r\na  maximum  benefit period. An official well versed  in\r\n\r\nthe  operation of such a scheme will be recruited under\r\n\r\nthe  Colombo Plan to advise on how such a scheme should\r\n\r\nbe  set up and to set up the machinery required for the\r\n\r\noperation of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the industrial expansion\r\n\r\nprogramme of the Government gets under way, there  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  closer liaison between the  planning  and\r\n\r\norganising side of industry and the Ministry itself  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry will know in advance the  potential\r\n\r\nlabour  requirements of industry and will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nadjust  the  supply  of labour accordingly.  When  such\r\n\r\nliaison  is  established, it will be possible  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to know well in advance which industry will be\r\n\r\nlaying off staff and which will be requiring more staff\r\n\r\nwithin  a  foreseeable period of such things happening,\r\n\r\nand  planned  switches can therefore be  arranged.  For\r\n\r\nthis  purpose a section will be set up in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwhich  will offer to labour and employers an  efficient\r\n\r\nLabour Market Information Service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  will  help to reduce and minimise  the  hardship\r\n\r\nwhich  labour at present often experiences  when  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of employees are suddenly laid off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Exchange will be considerably improved\r\n\r\nso that employers will be encouraged to make fuller use\r\n\r\nof  the  facilities which it offers  by  placing  their\r\n\r\nlabour requirements with the Exchange. Legislation will\r\n\r\nbe  introduced later in the year to make it an  offence\r\n\r\nfor  any  person,  who  is already  in  employment,  to\r\n\r\nregister  as a job seeker, and registered job  seekers,\r\n\r\nwho  find jobs either through the Exchange or on  their\r\n\r\nown  account,  will be required by law  to  notify  the\r\n\r\nExchange  so  that  their names can be  taken  off  the\r\n\r\nregister.  The use of the Exchange by persons  in  part\r\n\r\nemployment  or seeking a change of job will thereby  be\r\n\r\nprohibited.  Those whose names have long  been  on  the\r\n\r\nregister  without finding jobs either because  of  age,\r\n\r\nphysical  disability or because of lack of aptitude  or\r\n\r\nskills  will  be regarded as unemployable and  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  off  the  register.

There  will be simplification of the documentation\r\n\r\nrequired for record purposes, and classification of the\r\n\r\nrecords will be made on the basis of the answers  given\r\n\r\nat  interviews. The questions asked at these interviews\r\n\r\nwill be designed to elicit the information required for\r\n\r\na  proper  classification to be made. At a later  stage\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Exchange is more up-to-date,  trade  testing\r\n\r\nwill be resorted to so that in due course there will be\r\n\r\navailable at the Exchange, reliable information on  the\r\n\r\nnumbers and various kinds of skilled workers who are in\r\n\r\nsearch of jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special effort will be made to keep a proper\r\n\r\nregister of those who are seeking their first jobs.

A  uniform scheme  of  benefits  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided under the Bill and a uniform scheme of working\r\n\r\nhours  introduced for all employees. Those who work  on\r\n\r\ntheir own account, whether they are paid at piece rates\r\n\r\nor  on  a commission basis on premises provided by  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  will  be  deemed to  be  employees  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of the new law.

This\r\n\r\nwill  put an end to the wholesale evasion of our labour\r\n\r\nlaw  which  daily  takes place in such  premises  where\r\n\r\nemployees  have  to work for much longer  periods  than\r\n\r\neight hours a day without the payment of any overtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprises which are not tied to the Government's\r\n\r\nindustrial  expansion programme  such  as  those  which\r\n\r\nengage  in  the  import and export  trade,  commercial,\r\n\r\ninsurance, banking, transport, shipping and other  such\r\n\r\nconcerns  will be required to provide retrenchment  pay\r\n\r\non\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  scale  laid down when staff are laid off. This  will\r\n\r\nput  an  end  to the confusion which at present  exists\r\n\r\nwhen  retrenchment pay is either refused  or  given  at\r\n\r\nvarying  rates  by different employers  when  staff  in\r\n\r\nthese  concerns are laid off. Under the new Bill, power\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken to enable the Ministry to make  special\r\n\r\nregulations  providing for the conditions of  work  and\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  domestic  servants.  The  scope  of   the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"domestic servant\" will be  limited  so\r\n\r\nthat  such  service  rendered in  or  about  a  private\r\n\r\ndwelling  house  will  reckon  as  domestic  service,\r\n\r\nwhereas  service  of  a  domestic  nature  rendered  in\r\n\r\nhotels,  boarding houses, restaurants, bars and private\r\n\r\nclubs  will reckon fully for all the benefits  provided\r\n\r\nfor an employee under the new labour law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions implementing the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nContract Labour Commission Report will also be included\r\n\r\nin  the  new Employment Bill. Contract labour  will  be\r\n\r\nprohibited  in  certain industries,  but  where  it  is\r\n\r\npermitted,  contractors  and sub-contractors  employing\r\n\r\nlabour  will  be  required to register and  to  provide\r\n\r\nsecurity in case of default in payment of wages.  There\r\n\r\nwill also be written into all labour contracts, whether\r\n\r\nof  a  principal contractor or a sub-contractor,  as  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  law,  a fair wages  clause.  Where  an\r\n\r\nemployer owns factory premises and the machinery in it,\r\n\r\nhe  will  be  required to employ those working  in  the\r\n\r\nfactory direct. Employment of labour under contract  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  the permanent labour force in a factory  to\r\n\r\ncope  with  an increased demand for goods  or  services\r\n\r\nwill also be prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Bill will be reintroduced with\r\n\r\namendments   to  enable  the  new  unification   policy\r\n\r\ncentered  around the 19 categories of trade unions  and\r\n\r\nthe dissolution of general and miscellaneous unions  to\r\n\r\nbe  fully  implemented. This Bill passed through  three\r\n\r\nReadings at the last session but was not assented to by\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  Amendments\r\n\r\nhave  been  proposed  for  the  consideration  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   will   require   all   existing   general    or\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous Unions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To amend their rules to confine their membership\r\n\r\nto employees in any one of the categories specified\r\n\r\nin the First Schedule to the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To terminate the membership of any of their\r\n\r\nmembers who do not belong to the category specified\r\n\r\nin the rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To submit a return to the Registrar of Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  showing that they have complied with  these\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Singapore Trades Union Congress has been asked  to\r\n\r\nconsider   a   further  proposal  that  a  general   or\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous   union   should   comply   with    these\r\n\r\nrequirements  before it is permitted to  federate  with\r\n\r\nother  unions in the same category.

The Court will be housed in the former\r\n\r\nEstate Duties Office in the Supreme Court Building  and\r\n\r\nplans have already been approved for the conversion  of\r\n\r\nthis office into a suitable Court Room. In addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court Room, accommodation will be provided for the\r\n\r\nPresident and members of the Court and there will  also\r\n\r\nbe  meeting  rooms  for  the employers'  side  and  the\r\n\r\nemployees' side. There is also to be a Central Registry\r\n\r\nand  for  the  purpose  of  setting  up  the  machinery\r\n\r\nrequired for the implementation of this Ordinance,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of the South Australian Court of Arbitration\r\n\r\nis  now  here  under  the Colombo Plan  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nMinistry. Many collective agreements have already  been\r\n\r\nconcluded between employers and unions of employees and\r\n\r\nthese  agreements will be registered with  the  Central\r\n\r\nRegistry  of the Court as soon as it is set  up.  These\r\n\r\nagreements will be published in the Government  Gazette\r\n\r\nafter they are registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee will be set up with representatives from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Trades Union Congress to advise  on  the\r\n\r\ndesigning and detailed planning for a Trade Union House\r\n\r\nto  be  built  for  the  use of the  S.T.U.C. and  its\r\n\r\naffiliates. A very central site in the city has already\r\n\r\nbeen  earmarked  for  this  purpose  within  convenient\r\n\r\ndistance of the major bus routes serving the city. This\r\n\r\nbuilding will provide all the amenities which  a  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  House  requires in the way of  a  large  meeting\r\n\r\nroom,  union offices, an office for the Secretariat,  a\r\n\r\nlibrary and a fully equipped research unit. The grounds\r\n\r\nwill   also  be  spacious  enough  for  outdoor  sports\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Work Brigade will be considerably\r\n\r\nexpanded  and  15 sites have already been selected  for\r\n\r\nwork  camps.  One  camp has already been  completed  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Ris and work is now progressing on the  widening\r\n\r\nand  channelling of the Sungei Api Api from its  source\r\n\r\nto  the sea. This will improve the drainage of the area\r\n\r\nand  bring under cultivation a very large area of swamp\r\n\r\nland.  Work on the construction of camp sites at Jurong\r\n\r\nfor  the completion of a 2\u00bd mile link road between Chua\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  and Jurong, at Kaki Bukit and  at  the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  Airport for the improvement of the  drainage  in\r\n\r\nthe  Geylang Serai area and for extending the  existing\r\n\r\nresettlement scheme in this area and at Andrews Avenue,\r\n\r\nSembawang,  for  the  establishment  of  a  new   Malay\r\n\r\nSettlement in the area formerly occupied by  the  Bukit\r\n\r\nSembawang Hill Rubber Estate, is now progressing at top\r\n\r\nspeed. As these camps are completed and the development\r\n\r\nschemes  associated  with  these  work  camps  are   in\r\n\r\noperation, new work camps will be started. The  present\r\n\r\nplanning provides that by the end of the year, 15  work\r\n\r\ncamps will be built and 15 development schemes will  be\r\n\r\nin  full  operation. The strength of the  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nwill then have increased to 3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Special Planning Unit for the Work Brigade has been\r\n\r\nset  up.  This  will enable professional and  technical\r\n\r\nofficers  who are now seconded to the Brigade from  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department to return to their own  duties\r\n\r\nso that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans  of  other Ministries  will  not  be\r\n\r\nimpeded.  The administrative side of the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade has been taken over by the permanent staff\r\n\r\nat  the former headquarters of the Civil Defence  Corps\r\n\r\nand   when   the  work  of  re-organisation  at   these\r\n\r\nheadquarters is completed, there will be more  Chinese-speaking  officers at these headquarters to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  administrative matters affecting  the  Brigade.  A\r\n\r\nspecial Transport Unit for the Brigade will also be set\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work on which the Brigade is engaged is very\r\n\r\nvaried  and those working in it will be able  to  learn\r\n\r\nuseful  trades in the course of their service. In  road\r\n\r\nmaking  schemes  they  learn  to  construct  road  side\r\n\r\ndrains, lay down water pipes, metal roads and construct\r\n\r\nroad side pavements. In drainage schemes they learn  to\r\n\r\nconstruct bridges and weirs across streams and  in  re-settlement schemes, they learn farming and the building\r\n\r\nof  houses  and  camps. A directive  has  already  been\r\n\r\nissued  from  the  Ministry of  Finance  to  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  quasi-Government  bodies  instructing\r\n\r\nthem to give the first preference to all vacancies  for\r\n\r\ntradesmen and skilled workers in Government service and\r\n\r\nin  these  quasi-Government bodies to  those  who  have\r\n\r\npassed  through the Work Brigade. Boys from the  Gimson\r\n\r\nSchool have already been absorbed into the Work Brigade\r\n\r\nand  those  from Pulau Senang who make the  grade  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  given  an opportunity to serve  in  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  before they regain their place in society.  As\r\n\r\nour    industrial   expansion   programme   progresses,\r\n\r\nemployers  will  see the advantage of recruiting  their\r\n\r\nlabour  force more and more from members  of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the new Trade Union Ordinance is\r\n\r\nintroduced, a Labour Advisory Council will be set up on\r\n\r\nwhich  there  will be representatives of industry,  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and Government. The work of  the  Council\r\n\r\nwill be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to advise Government in relation to employment,\r\n\r\nindustrial relations, employee welfare and\r\n\r\nrelated industrial and economic matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to advise the Ministry of Labour and Law in\r\n\r\nrelation to matters on the labour side of the\r\n\r\nMinistry's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the function of this Council to keep itself\r\n\r\nfully  informed of the developments in both the  public\r\n\r\nand private sectors of investment and arrangements will\r\n\r\nbe  made for meetings of the Council to be addressed by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance and members of the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. It is in this Council that organised\r\n\r\nlabour  with representatives from the Singapore  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress will be fully consulted and  associated\r\n\r\nin    the    task   of   implementing   our   Five-Year\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme. The  views  of  organised\r\n\r\nlabour in the matter of the maintenance of good working\r\n\r\nconditions  for our workers while our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  progresses will be brought to the notice  of\r\n\r\nboth employers and the Government in this Council.  The\r\n\r\nCouncil will provide a forum in which organised labour,\r\n\r\ncapital  and  Government will be able to formulate  and\r\n\r\nwork  out  plans for the promotion of industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice  as our industrialisation programme  gets\r\n\r\nunder way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social welfare side of the Ministry, medium and\r\n\r\nsmall  community centres will continue to be  built  in\r\n\r\nall   areas  which  are  thickly  populated  and  small\r\n\r\ncommunity halls costing not more than $5,000 each  will\r\n\r\nbe  built  in attap areas both in the urban  and  rural\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  State.  We  have  already  built  seven\r\n\r\ncommunity centres since we assumed power and from  next\r\n\r\nmonth,  three  community centres will  be  opened  each\r\n\r\nmonth  and four in December. We have planned a  network\r\n\r\nof  these community centres and community halls through\r\n\r\nwhich  the People's Association which has already  been\r\n\r\nset  up  by  legislation will be able to  organise  the\r\n\r\nleisure activities of our growing young population. The\r\n\r\ninaugural meeting of the People's Association  will  be\r\n\r\nheld  this month at the National Recreation Centre  and\r\n\r\nit is through this People's Association that we hope to\r\n\r\nintegrate the activities of the various associations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are members of the People's Association  in  the\r\n\r\ngreater purpose of organising the leisure activities of\r\n\r\nour  young  population in these community  centres  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  halls. The community centres and halls  will\r\n\r\nin future afford a point of contact between the work of\r\n\r\nthese  associations  and  the  masses  and  instead  of\r\n\r\nfunctioning   as   they   do  now   in   more   limited\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  these associations will  in  future  be\r\n\r\nable  by this contact to find a larger base upon  which\r\n\r\nthey will be able to expand their own activities. As an\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Boy Scouts Association has already  been\r\n\r\napproached  to  form scouting groups in  our  community\r\n\r\ncentres and well known coaches like Wong Peng Soon  are\r\n\r\nnow  moving front community centre to community  centre\r\n\r\nto  coach our young people in the art of playing a good\r\n\r\ngame of badminton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter which lapsed after reference to\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  owing  to  the  prorogation  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly will be re-introduced.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  have regard to the proposals for amendment  which\r\n\r\nwere  made to the Select Committee of the last session.\r\n\r\nDeficiencies in the Bill which were noticed when it was\r\n\r\nunder reference to Select Committee will be removed and\r\n\r\npoints   of  detail  which  were  overlooked  will   be\r\n\r\nintroduced. The basic feature of this Bill which puts a\r\n\r\nstop to polygamous marriages, except for those who  are\r\n\r\nMuslims,  as  from  the 2nd March  of  this  year  will\r\n\r\nhowever remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the law side of the work in the Ministry, it is\r\n\r\nproposed to expand the service of the Legal Aid  Bureau\r\n\r\nin  civil  cases.  Instead of free legal  aid  being  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility of Government alone, the local Bar  will\r\n\r\nbe  associated  and a scheme devised on  the  lines  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the legal aid system is operated in England.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme provision will be made for contributory\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  so that a larger section of the  population\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to benefit from the scheme.  An  officer\r\n\r\nwill  be  sent to study the legal aid scheme in England\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to  introducing a  modification  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish system here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will be introduced to enable graduates in\r\n\r\nlaw  of the University of Malaya to be admitted to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  Bar  after a short period of pupilage and  after\r\n\r\npassing  an  examination  of  a  practical  nature.  In\r\n\r\nassociation  with the Government of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, a joint Examinations Board on the model of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Legal Education in England will be set up to\r\n\r\nexamine  candidates  at the local  University  who  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  take  this  practical  examination  after\r\n\r\ncompleting  their  period  of  pupilage  as   well   as\r\n\r\ncandidates  who  have  completed  their  legal  studies\r\n\r\noverseas.  It  is  hoped that in  time  there  will  be\r\n\r\nreciprocal arrangements between the Governments of  the\r\n\r\ntwo territories to enable a candidate called to the Bar\r\n\r\nin  one  territory  to practise  at  the  Bar  in  both\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will also be introduced to protect honest\r\n\r\ntraders  from  the  fraud  of insolvent  and  dishonest\r\n\r\npersons  who set up spurious business concerns for  the\r\n\r\nsole  purpose  of defrauding honest traders  with  whom\r\n\r\nthey  pretend  to  do business. As  our  State  is  the\r\n\r\nlargest commercial emporium in South-East Asia,  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  that  our  honest traders  should  be  fully\r\n\r\nprotected against such frauds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New court houses will be built at Kallang on the\r\n\r\nvacant  site next to the National Recreation Centre  to\r\n\r\nhouse  two district courts, one criminal and one civil,\r\n\r\nand  two magistrates courts. A magistrate's court  will\r\n\r\nalso  be built at Sepoy Lines and a court to deal  with\r\n\r\njuvenile and maintenance cases will be set up  at  Fort\r\n\r\nCanning.  These  new  court  houses  will  relieve  the\r\n\r\ncongestion in our subordinate courts and will bring our\r\n\r\ncourts nearer to the homes of our own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive legislation for the regulation of Muslim\r\n\r\nmarriage  and divorce and Muslim religious  affairs  on\r\n\r\nthe  lines of legislation enforced in the states of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya will be introduced  during  this\r\n\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may revert once again to the labour side of my\r\n\r\nMinistry. The year ahead is one of construction and  as\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty  forming the Government we are committed  to  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  our policy of full employment  through\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  within  our  term  of  office.   Any\r\n\r\nsetback  in the year ahead will make it impossible  for\r\n\r\nus  to  realise  the  target  we  have  set  ourselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough we as a Government have done many good  things\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit  of  our people during  our  term  of\r\n\r\noffice, none of these good things will be of any  avail\r\n\r\nif   we  fail  to  find  a  solution  for  our  growing\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. The solution of that  problem  is\r\n\r\nour main concern, all other things being subsidiary. In\r\n\r\nfinding  a solution to this problem, however,  we  will\r\n\r\nnever  be  unmindful of our duty to  ensure  that  with\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and the expansion  of  our  national\r\n\r\nincome,  our  workers will continue to get  fairer  and\r\n\r\nbetter rewards for the fruits of their labour. We  feel\r\n\r\nthat  as  a Government, solidly behind our workers,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  possible for us to obtain their goodwill  and\r\n\r\ncooperation  in  achieving the task that  we  have  set\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, in conclusion, answer some of the matters\r\n\r\nraised by the Opposition. We make no apology for having\r\n\r\nimposed the pay cuts. The first point about it is  that\r\n\r\nwe  imposed  the  cuts  on ourselves  first  before  we\r\n\r\nimposed  them  on others. These pay cuts  were  in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  very necessary. When  the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  invited the Head of the Indian Civil Service,\r\n\r\none  Mr Bapat, to Singapore a few years ago, to advise\r\n\r\nhim  on  how to reorganise the civil service  on  Asian\r\n\r\nlines,  I  remember  that  when  speaking  to  him   he\r\n\r\nexpressed  very  great  surprise that  a  comparatively\r\n\r\njunior  Assistant Secretary in our civil service,  with\r\n\r\nthree  years' service, received the same salary  as  he\r\n\r\nwas receiving. As Head of the Indian Civil Service,  he\r\n\r\nwas  then receiving 2,000 Rupees a month, or $1,240 per\r\n\r\nmonth in our money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make it clear to all concerned that\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  lower income groups and  in  the  lower\r\n\r\nbracket  of  the  middle income groups  have  not  been\r\n\r\naffected  by the pay cuts at all. My former  colleagues\r\n\r\nin the civil service, who are in the higher brackets of\r\n\r\nthe middle income group and in the higher income group,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  that with Malayanisation great opportunities  for\r\n\r\npromotion   have  come  their  way,  which  more   than\r\n\r\ncompensate  them  for  the  pay  cuts  of  which   they\r\n\r\ncomplain. Barely five years ago, the highest  posts  to\r\n\r\nwhich a person starting as a clerk in the service could\r\n\r\nhope  to  rise  to  were a handful of prize  posts  for\r\n\r\nOffice  Assistants. Today, those with ability can  make\r\n\r\ntheir  way  to  higher appointments via an  echelon  of\r\n\r\nhigher  posts  which are available to them.  There  are\r\n\r\ntoday  opportunities for promotion from clerical  posts\r\n\r\nto  higher  clerical  posts, Executive  Officer  posts,\r\n\r\nHigher   Executive  Officer  posts,  Senior   Executive\r\n\r\nOfficer  posts,  timescale posts in the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService,  and from there on to the Superscale posts  in\r\n\r\nthe  Administrative Service. It is true  today  to  say\r\n\r\nthat there is no impediment in the way of an officer of\r\n\r\nability  enabling him to rise in the service  from  the\r\n\r\npost  of  a  junior  clerical  officer  to  that  of  a\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary in a Ministry. The same rapidity of\r\n\r\npromotion is also available to junior officers  in  the\r\n\r\ntime-scale  administrative and  timescale  professional\r\n\r\nand  technical  posts.  With the disappearance  of  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate hierarchy in the Superscale posts  of  these\r\n\r\nservices, many of them have already very early in their\r\n\r\ncareer  obtained promotion to these posts  which  would\r\n\r\nnever have been within their reach, were it not for the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  policy.  My former  colleagues  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  also know that the pay  scales  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service have never remained static in the  post-war  years. They are very familiar with the work of the\r\n\r\nvarious   Commissions   and   Committees   which   have\r\n\r\nconstantly reviewed the pay scales of civil servants to\r\n\r\nbring them to what these scales are today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants must realise that with the large\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem  which  faces  us  today,  it  is\r\n\r\nessential that there should be economies if we  are  to\r\n\r\nfind  the  money  to  finance the Industrial  Expansion\r\n\r\nProgramme which we have planned. As I have said earlier\r\n\r\non, it is only with industrialisation and the expansion\r\n\r\nof  our national income that we can hope to assure  all\r\n\r\nour workers, including those in the civil service, that\r\n\r\nthey will continue to enjoy their present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  standard  of living. It is important,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  the civil service, especially those in the higher\r\n\r\nbrackets  of the middle income group and in the  higher\r\n\r\nincome  group  should not lose sight of  these  weighty\r\n\r\nconsiderations. They would certainly be the losers  if,\r\n\r\nfor  any  reason, we as a Government failed to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  target which we have set out to achieve within our\r\n\r\nterm of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been taken to task by the Opposition for not\r\n\r\nhaving  given  more attention to the need for  tracking\r\n\r\ndown  the  kidnappers. It is strange indeed  that  this\r\n\r\ncharge should come from the lips of the Opposition.  In\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year  when  we introduced  the  Offences\r\n\r\nRelating  to Vehicles Bill to provide heavier penalties\r\n\r\nfor those who were convicted of stealing motor cars and\r\n\r\nbicycles, this is what the Member for Farrer  Park  had\r\n\r\nto  say [Hansard, of 14th January, 1960, Vol. 12,  col.\r\n\r\n103]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What this Bill proposes to do, Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nto  increase the punishment in the hope that  increased\r\n\r\npunishment would reduce the crimes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I still quote him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...may I with respect again say that the difficulty is\r\n\r\nnot  that  our  laws  do not provide the  remedies-they\r\n\r\ndo-but  that  the  Police are not able  to  arrest  the\r\n\r\nthieves, however much the punishment might be:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He goes on to say this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To suggest that it is necessary to bring in this Bill\r\n\r\nbecause the theft of vehicles is so prevalent, is not a\r\n\r\nproposition which I can accept. I would suggest to  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  enforce the law that it is  not  increased\r\n\r\npunishments  that will stop the theft of vehicles,  but\r\n\r\nthe catching of the thieves that is going to stop it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On  that  occasion, Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park, I said [col. 104]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If we allow the situation to drift, then one day the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park will come here and say,  `Does\r\n\r\nthe  Government not know that the situation is  getting\r\n\r\nfrom  bad to worse? What is the Government doing  about\r\n\r\nit?   I  have  also  lost  my  motorcar!  What  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment going to do about it?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I assured the Member for Farrer Park then that when the\r\n\r\nBill  was  passed, he would have the  security  of  his\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicle for so long as the Offences Relating  to\r\n\r\nVehicles  Ordinance remained in our Statute  Book.  His\r\n\r\nreply was that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  only  owned a bicycle. I mention this. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nto  show  that  we  did not get any  support  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  then, when we were trying hard  to  do  the\r\n\r\nright thing for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich businessmen have been in to see me complaining of\r\n\r\nthe  prevalence of kidnapping, and amongst other things\r\n\r\nthey  mentioned that many of the businessmen themselves\r\n\r\nwere  partly  to blame for the present sorry  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.  They  told  me  they  knew  that  many   more\r\n\r\nkidnappings had taken place than were reported  in  the\r\n\r\nPress.  They said that the victims of these kidnappings\r\n\r\nhad  resolutely refused to make any complaints  to  the\r\n\r\npolice, and that this remained their attitude in  spite\r\n\r\nof   the  fact  that  they  had  been  urged  by  other\r\n\r\nbusinessmen to lodge formal complaints with the police.\r\n\r\nIt  must be apparent to Members of the Opposition  that\r\n\r\nthe  police force works under a very real handicap when\r\n\r\nthose who complain that the police have not done enough\r\n\r\nto  bring the kidnappers to book, themselves refuse  to\r\n\r\ncooperate with the police. Furthermore, we have had  it\r\n\r\nfrom   the  lips  of  the  Members  of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nthemselves  that  laws  enhancing  the  penalties   for\r\n\r\ncertain  crimes  will  not  in  themselves  reduce  the\r\n\r\nincidence  of  these crimes. We believe  that  if  more\r\n\r\ncooperation is extended to the police by those who  now\r\n\r\ncomplain that the police have not done enough to  track\r\n\r\ndown  the  evil-doers, then more  can  be  achieved  in\r\n\r\nbringing these miscreants to justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the re-employment of those who have\r\n\r\nleft  the  civil service, I can assure the  House  that\r\n\r\nsince we have been in Government, to my knowledge not a\r\n\r\nsingle  officer has been required to leave the  service\r\n\r\notherwise   than  through  the  disciplinary  procedure\r\n\r\ngoverning  dismissals in the service. No civil  servant\r\n\r\nhas,  to my knowledge, been arbitrarily dismissed  from\r\n\r\nhis   post.  There  have  been  resignations  from  the\r\n\r\nservice,  but such resignations are beyond our control.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  Government General Orders, any officer  who\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  resigns  from  the  service  forfeits  his\r\n\r\ngratuity or his pension and is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  eligible  to be considered for further  employment\r\n\r\nshould  be   change his mind later and wish  to  be  re-employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions, however, have been different in certain\r\n\r\ndepartments  of the former City Council,  where  it  is\r\n\r\nknown  that officers of long service with good  records\r\n\r\nhave  left  their employment prematurely  for  fear  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination and other reasons. As the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas   already  told  the  House,  those  amongst  these\r\n\r\nofficers  who  have sought re-employment have  all  been\r\n\r\nreabsorbed  or offered re-employment in the service  of\r\n\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now proceed to deal with some\r\n\r\nof  the  submissions made by Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nYou  will remember, Sir, that yesterday the Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten,  who  is  dozing off  now,  said  that  no\r\n\r\ncapital  could  be  attracted into Singapore  since  we\r\n\r\nbecame  the  Government. She claimed that there  was  a\r\n\r\ngreat loss of confidence. Mr Speaker, Sir, it was  the\r\n\r\nlot  of the Member for Mountbatten to have been a  good\r\n\r\nschool  marm before she became a Legislative  Assembly-woman.  My  lot has been in other spheres. I  had  been\r\n\r\nholding  a  very  senior appointment  in  an  essential\r\n\r\nplanning Ministry of the Lim Yew Hock Government, and I\r\n\r\nhave  known  of the various schemes of investment  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  trying to attract to Singapore.  There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  lot  of talk about the Central Wholesale  Fish\r\n\r\nMarket  scheme. And there was a lot of argument  as  to\r\n\r\nwhere  that market was to be sited - was it to be at  the\r\n\r\nOld Kallang Airport or was it to be at the mouth of the\r\n\r\nRochore  River? There were lots of argument,  but  till\r\n\r\ntoday there is no wholesale fish market. There was talk\r\n\r\nof setting up a Japanese fish cannery, and Mr Cresson,\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Development Officer, was sent to  Japan\r\n\r\nto  work  out with the Japanese concerns there a  joint\r\n\r\nenterprise.  Where is that Japanese fish cannery?  Then\r\n\r\nwe  were told that large overseas tobacco manufacturing\r\n\r\nconcerns were going to set up new tobacco businesses in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Where are those concerns? The Minister  whom\r\n\r\nI  then  served  took a trip to America to  attend  the\r\n\r\nP.A.T.A. Conference.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst other visits, he spent  his  time  in\r\n\r\ninvestigating the possibility of his personally setting\r\n\r\nup  a tobacco industry in Singapore. But he changed his\r\n\r\nmind   and   thought  that  toothpaste  was  a   better\r\n\r\nproposition, and he has since started a big  toothpaste\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have not  been  blessed\r\n\r\nwith very good teeth, and I still prefer to keep to the\r\n\r\ngood  old  brands. Mr Speaker, Sir, we were then  told\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  a  magnate from Hongkong,  one  David\r\n\r\nSoong,  who was very interested in setting up  a  flour\r\n\r\nindustry  in Singapore costing $2 million.  He  was  to\r\n\r\nvisit  Singapore and go into the possibilities, and  if\r\n\r\nthey  were  good, to set up a factory. Where  is  David\r\n\r\nSoong?  Where  is the factory? Then we were  told  that\r\n\r\nthere was going to be a big sugar refinery. Millions of\r\n\r\ndollars were going to be invested. Where is that  sugar\r\n\r\nrefinery?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was my duty then to popularise\r\n\r\nthese  ideas - ideas which everybody knew were just pipe-dreams.  But we had to put them forward and say,  \"Yes,\r\n\r\neverybody  is very interested. There are conditions  of\r\n\r\ngreat  stability  under the Lim  Yew  Hock  Government.\r\n\r\nEverybody is excited about investing.\" They soon forgot\r\n\r\nabout  these  schemes and proceeded with the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution Exposition instead to distract  attention.\r\n\r\nJust  before  the elections, they had to  think  of  an\r\n\r\nindustrialisation scheme. What did they think out? They\r\n\r\ntalked of the Singapore River development scheme.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  scheme considered by the World Bank  when  the\r\n\r\nDirectors  of  the  World Bank were in  Singapore  some\r\n\r\nyears before. They published it. That scheme was in the\r\n\r\nform of a book which was pigeon-holed. They resurrected\r\n\r\nit  just before the elections to make you believe  that\r\n\r\nthey had planned the scheme for industrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, they wanted to build low-cost\r\n\r\nfactories,  and there was a lot of talk about  low-cost\r\n\r\nfactories  for  small businessmen and so  on.  All  the\r\n\r\narguments were against it. The only thing they achieved\r\n\r\nwas  the  Leng Kee Road Project. But that was a project\r\n\r\nfinanced and planned by the Malaya Development Society.\r\n\r\nThat is the sum total of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial development there was under the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the same hysterical remark\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  made since the P.A.P. Government  came\r\n\r\ninto  power - that there is a state of general chaos  and\r\n\r\nthat  no capital will be attracted. What are the facts?\r\n\r\nDr  Goh Keng Swee, before he left here, gave me a list\r\n\r\nof   the  various  concerns  which  are  investing   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  have got it here. The Marusen  Toyo  Oil\r\n\r\nCompany  with a subscribed capital of $25 million;  the\r\n\r\nMalayan   Flour   Mill  (Singapore)  Limited   with   a\r\n\r\nsubscribed  capital of $4 million. Now where  is  David\r\n\r\nSoong? We have the Malayan Flour Mill with a subscribed\r\n\r\ncapital   of  $4  million.  The  Sheng  Huo  Enterprise\r\n\r\nLimited,    $1,011,000;   Cold    Storage    Creameries\r\n\r\nLimited - expansion, $200,000; Friesland  (Malaya)  Ltd.,\r\n\r\n$3   million;   Metal  Tubes  and  Chemical   Products,\r\n\r\n$270,000;   H.  Dember,  $500,000;  British   Aluminium\r\n\r\nCompany   Limited,  $10  million;  Chin  Leong  Company\r\n\r\nLimited,  $2  million;  Mizrahie  Pharmaceutical  Works\r\n\r\nLimited,  $100,000;  Hong  Tye  Tea  Merchant  Limited,\r\n\r\n$500,000;  Kong Guan Flour Mills Limited,  $1  million;\r\n\r\nShell   Oil   Refinery,  $54  million;   a   total   of\r\n\r\n$101,581,000 subscribed capital and with an  authorised\r\n\r\ntotal capital of $112,700,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have not publicised all this. We have never made a fuss about it. It is only when we are\r\n\r\nchallenged,  when it is said that we are doing  nothing\r\n\r\nabout investment, and they get hysterical about it that\r\n\r\nwe   must  come  out  and  tell  them  that  all  these\r\n\r\ninvestments have been attracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a very personal note, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Mountbatten complained - I think she was very excited\r\n\r\nat  the  time - that it is very unfair that she  was  not\r\n\r\ninvited  to open the Mountbatten Community Centre  last\r\n\r\nSaturday. Then she accused us. She said, \"Look  at  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  do  they  do?  They get defeated  candidates  and\r\n\r\nothers  whom they want to build up politically to  open\r\n\r\nour  community centres.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact,  no\r\n\r\ndefeated candidate was invited to open that community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncentre.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   unless   the   Member  for  Mountbatten   could\r\n\r\naccommodate  herself  socially  with  that   gathering,\r\n\r\nbearing  in mind that there are some gentlemen opposite\r\n\r\nwho  would  be frightened to be seen in this  House  if\r\n\r\nthey  were dressed as we are, how can we ever ask  them\r\n\r\nto open our community centres?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, then we were charged with using\r\n\r\nGovernment funds for party purposes. This is a building\r\n\r\nthat  was  put up. I think, by the late Tan Thoon  Lip,\r\n\r\nand  the money provided for this building came from Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kong  Chian. The people who put this  building  up\r\n\r\nstill owe Mr Lee Kong Chian money. This building up to\r\n\r\nrecently was in the occupation of the Katong Boys' Club\r\n\r\nAssociation.  They ran activities here.  Of  their  own\r\n\r\naccord they have handed over this building to us.  They\r\n\r\nsay  that if they hand it over to us, they will be sure\r\n\r\nthat  all  the activities will be better organised  and\r\n\r\nthat the building  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be an asset to the poor people who are living\r\n\r\naround.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it was Mr Lee  Kong  Chian\r\n\r\nwho  paid  for the renovations. They cost  round  about\r\n\r\n$15,000  to $20,000. Where, have Government funds  been\r\n\r\nused for political purposes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have been charged with leaving the\r\n\r\nGeylang/Katong  Community Association  severely  alone.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  Association  in  which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  moves about very gracefully.  The  members\r\n\r\nall dress, Mr Speaker, Sir, as she does; not the types\r\n\r\nthat  live in the old airport estate. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  made inquiries. We wanted to know how they  get  on\r\n\r\ntogether, but we find that there are a lot of factional\r\n\r\nfights  going on in that Association. We want to  serve\r\n\r\nthe  people and work with them. We do not want  to  get\r\n\r\ninvolved in little factional fights. So we have decided\r\n\r\nto  leave this Association alone and keep away from it.\r\n\r\nIs there anything wrong in that, Mr Speaker?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to my ex-colleague, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim. During this debate yesterday  and\r\n\r\ntoday,  the Member for Hong Lim appeared in this  House\r\n\r\nwith  many heavy tomes. I have never in my life  before\r\n\r\nseen him carry so many books. All that he was doing was\r\n\r\nto  look  up  all  of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nspeeches. Mr Speaker, Sir, he is very angry  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has refused to go on repeating  himself\r\n\r\nlike a worn-out gramophone record. I mean, if he has no\r\n\r\npolicies,  then  all that he can say is,  \"I  am  anti-colonial. I am anti-colonial.\" That is all. \"I  put  up\r\n\r\nstandpipes because I am anti-colonial.\" That is all  he\r\n\r\ncan  do. He has said that the Party leadership is  also\r\n\r\nnow pro-colonial. He says that he has not even troubled\r\n\r\nto look at the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. He says\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  quite  convinced  now  that  this  is   a\r\n\r\ncompletely  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government's  statement  of\r\n\r\npolicy. It is a pro-colonial statement of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have mentioned some things such\r\n\r\nas  our  intention  to improve the  conditions  of  our\r\n\r\nfarmers.  We  have  said that we  intend  to  introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation to give farmers better security of  tenure,\r\n\r\nand that a Bill will be introduced  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly during this session.  We  have\r\n\r\ntalked  about  the need for improving  the  strains  of\r\n\r\nchickens. I remember the Member for Hong Lim  going  on\r\n\r\nthe radio and praising himself for the good work he was\r\n\r\ndoing  among the farmers and so on.

But  he\r\n\r\nsays  that the same thing which appears in the policy\r\n\r\nstatement  is  pro-colonial.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nmatter appears in the policy statement of this year - our\r\n\r\nundertaking that we will introduce legislation to  give\r\n\r\nfarmers  better security of tenure.

This legislation, which would  radically\r\n\r\nchange  the present relationship between the  landlords\r\n\r\nand  the tenants, and in a way change the present  land\r\n\r\nsystem, was drafted and completed by the able Attorney-General  in the Ministry of Labour and Law.

Mr Speaker, Sir, before you can set up any\r\n\r\nbit of legislation, it is necessary for you to tell the\r\n\r\ndraftsmen  what you want. But, Mr Speaker, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nwere  no ideas, no contributions from his Ministry.  We\r\n\r\nhad  to  look up the Legislation in England. We had  to\r\n\r\nput   up   all  the  proposals  with  regard  to   this\r\n\r\nlegislation. Nothing was forthcoming from the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof National Development. All that we were handed was  a\r\n\r\nbunch of empty files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one aspect of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim's speech that we all know does not accord\r\n\r\nwith  the  facts. He says that we are pro-colonialists,\r\n\r\nthat  this  policy  statement is a pro-colonial  policy\r\n\r\nstatement. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is of no use to  us  to\r\n\r\nhark  back  to  1954, 1955, 1956. The purpose  of  this\r\n\r\npolicy  speech is to review what the Party has done  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  year and to forecast the trends in  the  new\r\n\r\nSession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nto  interrupt me and try to seek clarification for  the\r\n\r\nthings  which I shall say from now on. I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  him whether he did not, in fact, subscribe to  the\r\n\r\nParty's  manifesto which was put to the electorate  and\r\n\r\nadopted  in  our  publication \"The  Tasks  Ahead\".  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I should like to ask him whether he  did  not\r\n\r\nhimself read out one of those policy speeches at one of\r\n\r\nthe mass meetings. We know that all persons who are  in\r\n\r\nthe present Government read those policy statements  at\r\n\r\nour  mass  rallies.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  he  could  have\r\n\r\ncriticised  us as pro-colonialists. If he thought  that\r\n\r\nwhat we have said in our Party manifesto, the manifesto\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have put to the people of Singapore  at  the\r\n\r\nlast election, was a pro-colonial policy statement, why\r\n\r\ndid he not tell the people at the mass rallies, \"Do not\r\n\r\nsupport that manifesto.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, ask him to interrupt me at any time  for\r\n\r\nclarification of what I am saying? Did he  not  himself\r\n\r\nsuggest  the  creation  of  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment? Did he not try to get within  his  control\r\n\r\nnearly   every  important  institution  of  government,\r\n\r\nincluding the City Council? Ask him if that is not so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before we became the Government, we put this policy statement to the people. We had it accepted\r\n\r\nby  the people and it was our duty as the Government to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the  policy which has  been  supported  and\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the people. What steps did the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  take  to integrate City Council  departments\r\n\r\nwith Government departments? What steps did he take  to\r\n\r\nset  up the Housing and Development Board? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I say to this Assembly, he took no steps at  all.\r\n\r\nHe  had no intention of implementing that policy at any\r\n\r\nstage.  It was the Cabinet, collectively, which ensured\r\n\r\nthat  he  did so. Mr Speaker, Sir, he showed his  hand\r\n\r\nhere  in this Assembly yesterday. He said that  he  had\r\n\r\nonly two enemies amongst us - the Prime Minister and  Dr\r\n\r\nGoh Keng Swee.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if I were  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  this House that the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment had discharged his duties faithfully,  then\r\n\r\nI have to ask myself why is it that the S.I.T. had only\r\n\r\nput  up 124 housing units when the previous Government,\r\n\r\nwhom  we have all maligned, was able in its first  year\r\n\r\nof office to put up more than 6,000? Why has there been\r\n\r\nan  improvement only when we took steps to set  up  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim said that\r\n\r\nall  who sat opposite him were his friends. True,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  were  his  friends.  We  were   his\r\n\r\ncolleagues.  But  we all wanted him to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nParty  policy which he refused to do. That is why,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, he sits where he is and we remain as we are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he said very kind things about me\r\n\r\nyesterday. He suggested that he was afraid that I would\r\n\r\nbe  made a scapegoat. He was the first scapegoat and  I\r\n\r\nwould  be  the second scapegoat. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  he\r\n\r\nreferred to a statement in the speech where it is  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  were hasty in our desire to get  things  done\r\n\r\nquickly  last year. That we should have consulted  more\r\n\r\nwith  the  affected interests, and that we should  have\r\n\r\ntaken  a  little  more time to explain our  policy.  He\r\n\r\nsuggested to the House that that was put in the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  to  discredit me personally as Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law. Mr Speaker, Sir, I say to this  House\r\n\r\nthat  that  is completely and entirely untrue,  and  he\r\n\r\nknows  that  to be untrue.

There  was  a  full\r\n\r\ndiscussion  at  all meetings. He was asked  whether  he\r\n\r\nagreed  or disagreed with the policy. He said  that  he\r\n\r\nagreed.  He went outside and said no, that he  did  not\r\n\r\nagree,  and  that  decisions  had  been  taken  in  his\r\n\r\nabsence.  He  was  a  member of the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.

The Member for Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  the  Executive  Committee  were  never\r\n\r\nconsulted and that there was displeasure. All of us  in\r\n\r\nthe   Executive  Committee  cared  less.  We  were  not\r\n\r\naspiring  for  higher office. We  were  returned  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment. We had no such pipe dreams of wanting to be\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, Sir, the only  person\r\n\r\namongst   us  who  could  validly  have  a  claim   for\r\n\r\nconsideration is Dr Toh Chin Chye. He has always  been\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the Party and he is respected by all of\r\n\r\nus. He has never on any occasion shown that he was ever\r\n\r\ninterested in this appointment. He is a colleague  and\r\n\r\na friend, and all of us respect him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a lot of talk about what\r\n\r\ndirty  dogs we were, and how we have gone back  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Malayanisation policy. Sir, we  all  believe  in\r\n\r\nMalayanisation,  but what we .can never  stand  for  is\r\n\r\n\"Batu Pahatisation\". The Member for Hong Lim got rid of\r\n\r\nlocal  officers and replaced them with his friends.  Do\r\n\r\nyou consider that to be a policy of Malayanisation?  He\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned the case of Mr Owen. We all  know  that\r\n\r\nMr  Owen is an Indian born in the Federation, and that\r\n\r\nhe  went to Australia with the Member for Hong  Lim  to\r\n\r\nstudy  accountancy. He married an Australian  girl.  He\r\n\r\ncame  back to Singapore. He sought a job and  when  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim was the Mayor, he fitted him into a\r\n\r\njob.He  got  rid of senior local officers and  put  Mr\r\n\r\nOwen  in. Things were running down very rapidly.  Quite\r\n\r\nobviously  you cannot put a young accountant in  charge\r\n\r\nof about $120 million worth of funds. So when the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister stepped in, immediately Mr Owen owned  up  to\r\n\r\nit  himself. He said that he was put into that job  and\r\n\r\nnot that he wanted it. He knew his shortcomings. And he\r\n\r\nwas quite prepared to leave the service and go back and\r\n\r\nsettle  in  Australia. If those  were  the  facts  with\r\n\r\nregard to persons whom the Member for Hong Lim did  not\r\n\r\napprove  of, then he would criticise these  people.  He\r\n\r\nwould say, \"You can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  hold  up  these people as Malayans - people  who  go\r\n\r\nabroad,  get  married, return and  work  in  their  own\r\n\r\ncountry,  then leave and settle abroad.\" He would  call\r\n\r\nthem  mere  expatriates,  but  because  they  are   his\r\n\r\nfriends, they are considered to be worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he also dislikes Mr George Thomson.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether he is afraid -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon.

Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that Mr  Thomson\r\n\r\nwas   an  Information  Officer  employed  by  the  last\r\n\r\nGovernment. It is also true that he is a good lecturer.\r\n\r\nHe  was  employed  as a lecturer in the  University  of\r\n\r\nLeeds even before he came out here. The policies of the\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre are controlled by members of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and he lectures within the scope  of  that\r\n\r\nauthority. He cannot get out of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Meadows, Mr Speaker, Sir, he and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Hong Lim were once very good  friends.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Hong Lim had a job  in  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands and he thought that Mr Meadows was the man  to\r\n\r\ndo that job. When the Prime Minister thought that there\r\n\r\nwas  need for the services of Mr Meadows elsewhere,  I\r\n\r\nam  told that one of the Parliamentary Secretaries  was\r\n\r\ninstructed  by  the  Member for Hong  Lim  to  make  an\r\n\r\nofficial protest, because he needed the services of Mr\r\n\r\nMeadows  for  his development schemes in  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when  did  that  intense\r\n\r\ndislike  of  Mr Meadows begin? It was when  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  appointed  Mr  Meadows  to  carry  out   the\r\n\r\nintegration  of the City Council departments  into  the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments. From that time, the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim hated Mr Meadows, because he wanted to build\r\n\r\nup his City Council empire and he was not allowed to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has a great personal dislike\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister for Finance, because the latter  had\r\n\r\nthe  courage to put his foot down when he wanted to use\r\n\r\nCity Council funds improperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said quite enough this\r\n\r\nafternoon to bring out the points that we have  had  to\r\n\r\nmake  with regard to the charges that have been brought\r\n\r\nagainst us by the Member for Hong Lim. We have not done\r\n\r\nall  this with a view to humiliating him. We have  done\r\n\r\nthis  to  defend  ourselves  against  the  unwarranted,\r\n\r\nunfair and unjust charges which he has brought against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus.

We believe  in  collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility and we have never let him down  on  this\r\n\r\nside of the House. In spite of all that, he took unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  us.  He knew that his Ministry  was  not\r\n\r\nworking  as it should have been working, and he  wanted\r\n\r\nto  disclaim all responsibility for it.

Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, just over a year ago, one of our  Members\r\n\r\non  this side of the House did suggest that if on  some\r\n\r\nfuture  occasion the Opposition needed  assistance  and\r\n\r\nhelp,  we might be able to provide such assistance  and\r\n\r\nhelp;  and  on this second occasion, when debating  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech, their  strength  has\r\n\r\nbeen  augmented by three Members from this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse. You will notice, Sir, that the Opposition do not\r\n\r\nlook  as  cheerful  as they should, but  perhaps  after\r\n\r\nhearing  the  long story today and yesterday  they  may\r\n\r\nhave occasion to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his monumental history of the Russian revolution,\r\n\r\nLeon  Trotsky,  who  was  one of  the  authors  of  the\r\n\r\nRevolution,  notes  how during revolutionary  times  an\r\n\r\nintellectually and spiritually bankrupt social class is\r\n\r\nunable to discern the significant from the trivial. For\r\n\r\nexample,  he relates in his book that during the  fatal\r\n\r\nmonth  that  preceded  the  revolutionary  storm.  Tsar\r\n\r\nNicholas, who kept a regular diary, made no mention  of\r\n\r\nthe  great  momentous events that preceded the  Russian\r\n\r\nrevolution. As the\r\n\r\ntension  and  pressure grew, he noted such  revelations\r\n\r\nas.  \"Got dressed. Rode a bicycle to the bathing  beach\r\n\r\nand  bathed  enjoyably  in the sea.\"  Or,  on  the  day\r\n\r\nfollowing  a  serious mutiny by his  own  soldiers,  he\r\n\r\nrecorded the following for posterity, \"Walked long, and\r\n\r\nkilled two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrows.  Drank  tea  by daylight.\" I  cannot  help,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  but  feel that the speeches of some  of  -the\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  opposite  throw  as  much  intellectual\r\n\r\nillumination on the great problems facing this  country\r\n\r\nas  did  Tsar  Nicholas' diary entries on  the  Russian\r\n\r\nrevolution. Those who have spoken had a chance to trace\r\n\r\nfor us the grand design of great events. But all we got\r\n\r\nwas  something not above the level of \"Walked long, and\r\n\r\nkilled two crows. Drank tea by daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in his opening address, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ntried  to  stimulate, or at least tried to elevate  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  to  an  adult level by  trying  to  draw  a\r\n\r\npattern  of  the dark and powerful currents  of  social\r\n\r\nchange  that moved beneath the tranquil surface of  our\r\n\r\ncontemporary  political scene.  Here  were  forces,  he\r\n\r\noutlined yesterday, which could ultimately reshape  the\r\n\r\nlives of every one of us in this Assembly, outside this\r\n\r\nAssembly, for good or for better. I had hoped that hon.\r\n\r\nMembers opposite would have risen to the occasion.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Mountbatten did rise, but unfortunately  not\r\n\r\nto the occasion but only to her feet. What she did say,\r\n\r\nand  she  had a great deal to say, merely confirms  the\r\n\r\ntruth  of  Trotsky's statement about  the  intellectual\r\n\r\nblack-out  of  social classes in  the  last  stages  of\r\n\r\ndecay. The hon. Member was full of complaints about how\r\n\r\nlife  had  become intolerable under the P.A.P. regime.\r\n\r\nThe  civil  servants,  she  said,  were  seething  with\r\n\r\ndiscontent.  Unemployment,  she  said,  had  become   a\r\n\r\nnightmare.  She also reminded us that the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin was cowering under P.A.P. intimidation.  I\r\n\r\nthought  the  Member  for  Tanglin  never  looked  more\r\n\r\ncheerful than he did in the last one year under  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrule.  Capital, she said, was flying away. Lawlessness\r\n\r\nwas  widespread. In short, the country had gone to  the\r\n\r\ndogs.  Now, I will not insult the intelligence  of  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Mountbatten by saying that she  really\r\n\r\nbelieved all this, any more than she believed  her  own\r\n\r\nelection propaganda - that if the P.A.P. came into power,\r\n\r\nall  well-to-do  ladies  would  be  deprived  of  their\r\n\r\njewellery  and trinkets. The hon. Member's  jewellery\r\n\r\nnot  only  scintillates, but has  increased  in  lustre\r\n\r\nduring the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast  one  year. The unadorned truth is that the  Party\r\n\r\nthat the hon. Member represents has nothing to offer by\r\n\r\nway  of  political insight, political  profundity,  and\r\n\r\npolitical  guidance to those of us who  wan-t  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  this  is  all  about. So they fall  back  0n  the\r\n\r\nfantasies which they purveyed during the last elections\r\n\r\nand which, for lack of a proper Publicity Officer, they\r\n\r\nhave  had to revive again today in connection with  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara's address - to  revive  the  old\r\n\r\nbogies,  imaginary  chaos, imaginary terror,  imaginary\r\n\r\noppression, and so on. If I may quote Trotsky  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  time,  he says that an invariable  symptom  of  a\r\n\r\ndying  social class is that it deliberately turns  away\r\n\r\nfrom  realities and surrounds itself with what  he  des\r\n\r\ncribes as infantile fantasies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the S.P.A. have had very little to say,\r\n\r\nvery  little  observations to make, on the analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe  trends and forces outlined for the P.A.P. by  the Prime Minister.

What  we  say,\r\n\r\nwhat we do or what we do not do, can mean happiness  or\r\n\r\ntragedy  for  the one and a half million  people  whose\r\n\r\nfuture  is in our hands. This is not a boast, it  is  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of fact. After the first year, the  play  of\r\n\r\nsocial forces has reached a stage where we cannot treat\r\n\r\nthem  as  matters  for  academic  discussion,  but   as\r\n\r\noffering  serious  problems  and  calling  for  serious\r\n\r\ndecisions on which the whole future of a million and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  people would depend. So, I hope that  when  other\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition get up to speak, they  would\r\n\r\nnot, by way of intellectual illumination, offer us horror  comics  and fantasies as was offered by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten.

A  year\r\n\r\nlater, this problem still constitutes their main theme.\r\n\r\nNo  doubt  this  old  bone will be disinterred  like  a\r\n\r\nsacred  relic,  to  be passed around  with  appropriate\r\n\r\nwailing and gnashing of teeth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech  is  debated\r\n\r\nnext  year.  Why  has  the political  thinking  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  not  evolved to a  more  adult  stage?  The\r\n\r\nreason  is that they have not caught up with  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the English-educated civil servants, to whom this\r\n\r\nfossilized bone of pay cuts is offered as a bait,  have\r\n\r\nalso  undergone  a change of outlook  during  the  past\r\n\r\nyear. I quite well understand that the English-educated\r\n\r\ncivil   servants  once  provided  the  base  for   such\r\n\r\npolitical  movements  as  the  Progressive  Party,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front and the S.P.A. During the past few years,\r\n\r\nthey and their Right-wing friends tried to retain their\r\n\r\nhold   over   the  English-educated  by  conjuring   up\r\n\r\nfantasies  that the PAP, was out to cut their  throats,\r\n\r\nand  that  dire consequences would follow if they  were\r\n\r\nunder  P.A.P. rule. It is true that the P.A.P. did  not\r\n\r\nsoft-soap  the English-educated with promises  of  good\r\n\r\nlife  and lolly all round. Blunt truths had to be  told\r\n\r\nand  some of the truths were not pleasant, and  it  was\r\n\r\neasy  to  distort all this frank speaking as a campaign\r\n\r\nagainst  the  English-educated, and in  particular  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated civil servants. But  during  the  past\r\n\r\nyear, as a result of the Government's action by way  of\r\n\r\nlectures  at  the  Political Study  Centre,  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  has grasped the fact that far from  trying  to\r\n\r\ndestroy the English-educated, what we have been  trying\r\n\r\nto  put across to them has been a hard but hopeful  way\r\n\r\nof  ensuring a just, honourable and permanent place for\r\n\r\nthem in the social revolution unfolding before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressives and their successors under different\r\n\r\nguises  tried  to  win  over  the  English-educated  by\r\n\r\ndangling  prospects of good jobs, of  speedy  promotion\r\n\r\nwhen  the  expatriated were replaced, and they possibly\r\n\r\nheld  out  visions  for  every  English-educated  civil\r\n\r\nservant  of  an M.G. in the front porch and a  swimming\r\n\r\npool  in  the back garden. But they hid from  them  the\r\n\r\nhard  political  realities, thus dangerously  isolating\r\n\r\nthe English-educated groups from the main stream of the\r\n\r\nsocial  revolution. Now these hard realities have  been\r\n\r\nmade  clear  to them, and far from cowering before  the\r\n\r\napproach of P.A.P. Assemblymen, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated  civil servants are resentful  because\r\n\r\nthese  issues  have not been made clearer  to  them  by\r\n\r\nthose  who espoused their cause in the past.  They  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  pro-P.A.P., and we are not interested  whether\r\n\r\nthe English-educated civil servants or any other member\r\n\r\nof  that group is pro-P.A.P. or not. What we want  them\r\n\r\nto  realise  is  that, in the broad issue  of  national\r\n\r\ninterest,  the  English-educated, like everybody  else,\r\n\r\nshould  be  prepared  to do their  duty  intelligently,\r\n\r\nbravely  and  passionately. And once these issues  have\r\n\r\nbeen  put forward clearly to the English-educated civil\r\n\r\nservants, they have shown a willingness to take up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  that confronts them. That is why the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nnow  dangles  this bone of pay cuts  in  an  effort  to\r\n\r\nretain the spectators who are now drifting away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Tanglin can grasp\r\n\r\nwhat I am going to say to him, but I will try. The  pay\r\n\r\ncut  issue  will not alter the course of  history,  nor\r\n\r\nwill  it resolve our major problems. The iron-mine  age\r\n\r\nof Singapore politics is over. The civil servants, even\r\n\r\nif  the  pay cuts are unpopular, will not be so foolish\r\n\r\nas  to  save themselves by jumping into something which\r\n\r\nis  already sinking. Sir, I will not take too much time\r\n\r\nby  dealing with what pre-publicity in the Press led us\r\n\r\nto  believe was to be an earth-shaking amendment by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Joo  Chiat. I was more  impressed  by  his\r\n\r\nyear's   silence,   which  at  least   hinted   at   an\r\n\r\nunfathomable  and  mysterious  profundity,  a   silence\r\n\r\npregnant with unutterable but inspired truths.  Now  he\r\n\r\nhas  spoilt  it  all,  spoilt this silent  intimidating\r\n\r\nvision,  with an amendment which could have  been  more\r\n\r\nappropriately dealt with during Question Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H.

I understand, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthis afternoon, for some obscure reason, I was given  a\r\n\r\nbouquet by the Member for Hong Lim who thought  that  I\r\n\r\nwas really a good man fallen among angels. So let me in\r\n\r\na  very  polite and courteous manner preface my remarks\r\n\r\nby  saying that it is not an easy or pleasant thing  to\r\n\r\ndefrock   publicly  a  former  Party   and   Government\r\n\r\ncolleague,  especially also as he is one  with  whom  I\r\n\r\nhave had good personal relations. But knowing very well\r\n\r\nthe political tactics of the Member for Hong Lim, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that he will quite succeed in dividing  and\r\n\r\nruling  this  side of the House. The fact  that  I  was\r\n\r\ngiven  a  bouquet,  and the fact that  I  came  in  for\r\n\r\nspecial honour-able mention, together with the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs, will not stop me from saying what  I\r\n\r\nhave to say, not about the individual Ong Eng Guan, but\r\n\r\nabout the Member for Hong Lim, because he has chosen to\r\n\r\nplay  a political role which, whatever the consequences\r\n\r\nfor  him, will, I am convinced, mean disaster  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty is that I know that when one, as\r\n\r\nI  have said, defrocks a colleague publicly in front of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition,, it will be relished to some extent  by\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Members opposite; but if that is so,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthey  will  realise that the Member  for  Hong  Lim  is\r\n\r\nhimself  a pawn in the game played by adventurers  more\r\n\r\nskilled,  more clever and more agile than  he  is.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim is also well  aware  what  these\r\n\r\npolitical  adventurers, who manipulate  him,  know  his\r\n\r\nweaknesses, and therefore, play on them - he  knows  what\r\n\r\nthese adventurers think of him, and that once the  pawn\r\n\r\nhas  outlived its usefulness, it will be sacrificed  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  other more decisive moves.  However,\r\n\r\nSir, I am not interested in the fate of the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim as such, but only in such of his actions  and\r\n\r\nremarks  which,  I feel, would affect the  welfare  and\r\n\r\nfuture  of  this country, because it is not he  who  is\r\n\r\ndetermining events but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who are playing on his weaknesses. In  order  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the role-that the Member for  Hong  Lim  is\r\n\r\nplaying,  it is necessary to bear in mind the  analysis\r\n\r\nof the alignment of social forces which was made by the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister yesterday. Only then will the pieces and\r\n\r\nthe pawns fall into their proper places, and the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim is one such pawn tossed about by forces he\r\n\r\ndoes not quite understand, but which he thinks that  he\r\n\r\nis using.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what conscious role his two associates\r\n\r\nare  playing, but I do not think they matter very much.\r\n\r\nIn  his speech yesterday, the Member for Hong Lim  said\r\n\r\nthat  what  he described as the 16 Hong Lim resolutions\r\n\r\nis the charm that will ward off evil from this country.\r\n\r\nBoth the Party and the Government are interested in any\r\n\r\nschemes and policies which they believe will strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  position  of the Government and help  resolve  the\r\n\r\nmany difficult problems that confront this country.  No\r\n\r\nparty  or government would reject measures which  could\r\n\r\nbe  proved  to be for the benefit of the Government  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  of  the  country, particularly  so  when  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions come from a member of the Government who is\r\n\r\none of our colleagues. But during the one year that the\r\n\r\nMember  was  in the Government, he did not put  forward\r\n\r\nthese  magic  formulae for discussion and consideration\r\n\r\nby  his  colleagues. As far as I know, these appear  to\r\n\r\nhave been jealously guarded secrets, something like the\r\n\r\nnature  of the atomic bomb formula, which he apparently\r\n\r\nfelt could not be safely entrusted in the hands of  the\r\n\r\nParty  and his Government colleagues. For the last  one\r\n\r\nyear we never heard of 16,600 or 6,000 resolutions.  We\r\n\r\nnever  even had intimation that these resolutions  were\r\n\r\ncoming to birth in the mind of the Member for Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first time we heard of this magic\r\n\r\nformula - these  convenient  16  resolutions - was  at  the\r\n\r\nParty conference last June. But they were presented  in\r\n\r\nsuch a manner as to suggest that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  not  so much resolutions to solve problems  as  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  indict and condemn the Party  leadership\r\n\r\nand  the  Government. Sir, I need not go into the  long\r\n\r\nhistory  of his manoeuvres inside the Party to  justify\r\n\r\nmy  contention that the 16 resolutions were part  of  a\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre   to  reinstate  and  recoup  his   declining\r\n\r\npolitical  fortunes within the Party. These  manoeuvres\r\n\r\nhave already been exposed in the statement by the Party\r\n\r\nannouncing  his  expulsion. So I will  not  touch  upon\r\n\r\nthat.  But what is relevant is the efficacy of  the  16\r\n\r\nresolutions which the Party aptly described \"as a  balm\r\n\r\nor  ointment  which, if applied in  the  right  places,\r\n\r\nwould  cure our country of all aches, pains and winds.\"\r\n\r\nWe  have since then studied the 16 resolutions, because\r\n\r\nthe  political medicine man claims there  is  magic  in\r\n\r\nthese  16 resolutions which will save us from disaster.\r\n\r\nEven  though  he  never bothered to take  us  into  his\r\n\r\nconfidence,  we  have, nevertheless, studied  these  16\r\n\r\nresolutions  at  great length. We have  searched  every\r\n\r\nword in the wrapper, as it were, which covers these  16\r\n\r\nresolutions to discover any sense and guidance. But the\r\n\r\nmagic  formula of the 16 resolutions has turned out  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  vacuum enveloped in meaningless phrases. The  16\r\n\r\nresolutions, on further examination, are discovered  to\r\n\r\nbe  designed not so much to save the country as to save\r\n\r\nthe political fortunes of the gentleman whose political\r\n\r\ncharms  have  faded. The 16 resolutions,  Sir,  if  you\r\n\r\nexamine  them carefully, are nicely calculated  to  win\r\n\r\nthe  favour  of all sections of the population  who  he\r\n\r\nthinks will be useful to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution one, for example, calls on us to reaffirm\r\n\r\nour  faith  in the 1954 revolutionary P.A.P. Manifesto.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously a bid to win back following from within\r\n\r\nthe  Party or followers who have left the Party for one\r\n\r\nreason  or another. Incidentally, the Manifesto  itself\r\n\r\nwas  drafted by people who are still in the Party,  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  them  have turned down the 16 resolutions  as\r\n\r\njust   pure   ointment.  The  resolutions  also   offer\r\n\r\nsomething to anti-colonialists, to those who  want  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  changed, to those  who  want  merger,  to\r\n\r\nthose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho   do   not   like   taxes,  to   taxi-drivers,   to\r\n\r\nmanufacturers of cigarettes, to moralists  who  do  not\r\n\r\nlike  yellow  culture  or who think  that  we  are  not\r\n\r\nproceeding strongly enough against yellow culture,  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  those members of the Party who  are  smarting\r\n\r\nbecause  they think they have not risen higher  in  the\r\n\r\nParty hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now closely examine the validity of some of his\r\n\r\nresolutions which are supposed to be able  to  cure  us\r\n\r\nall  of  all ills. In his speech yesterday, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim tried to confuse matters by saying that he\r\n\r\nwas  evicted  from  the Government side  by  force  and\r\n\r\nunconstitutionally by the Prime Minister. It  is  clear\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Member's speech in the Assembly and  outside\r\n\r\nthat  he  disagrees completely with the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nParty  and  Government. So what is unconstitutional  in\r\n\r\nasking  the Member and his colleagues to move elsewhere\r\n\r\nif they cannot quite agree with the Government's or the\r\n\r\nParty's  policies? Secondly, Sir, he cannot expect  the\r\n\r\nParty members from this side of the House to move  over\r\n\r\nto  the other side and let the three of them remain  on\r\n\r\nthis  side. One thing about the Member for Hong Lim  is\r\n\r\nthat,  either wittingly or unwittingly, he  uses  words\r\n\r\nthe  meaning  of  which  he does  not  understand.  For\r\n\r\nexample, he said yesterday that force was used. He also\r\n\r\nremarked elsewhere that force was used to throw him out\r\n\r\nof  the  Party. On another occasion he said there  were\r\n\r\nsecret  police  armed with guns. He has  these  visions\r\n\r\nthat  things  are being done when they  are  not  being\r\n\r\ndone. Yesterday he said that he was forced by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Evicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, evicted by force. I am sure, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that is the last thing you would ever allow in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. But I think the Member for Hong Lim  is\r\n\r\nnot  interested  in  what goes  on  in  this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  can win no regard or esteem here.  But  he\r\n\r\nhopes that publication of this debate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  newspapers when read by people  who  have  not\r\n\r\nactually seen and known what is going on would win  him\r\n\r\nesteem  and  regard. Rumours would now be  spread  that\r\n\r\nthis solitary anti-colonial government in Singapore was\r\n\r\nforcibly  evicted  from one side of the  House  to  the\r\n\r\nother  by the Prime Minister. This business of  picking\r\n\r\nout individuals for his political attack and to present\r\n\r\nthese  big  political issues as issues between  himself\r\n\r\nand  the Prime Minister is an old propaganda device and\r\n\r\none  which has been elaborated in great detail  by  the\r\n\r\nlate  Adolph Hitler in his Mein Kampf Hitler says  that\r\n\r\nthe  masses whom he despised cannot understand abstract\r\n\r\npolitical  issues,  and  so  mass  leaders  must   make\r\n\r\npolitical   agitations  centred   around   individuals.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Prime Minister is presented as the  evil\r\n\r\ngenius  who  really  expelled the former  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational   Development   from   the   Government.   The\r\n\r\nimpression the Member wants to create is that the  rest\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. assembly are on his  side.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, he said yesterday, was now in control of  the\r\n\r\npolice and the whole machinery of State; otherwise  the\r\n\r\nposition would have been different. I am not quite sure\r\n\r\nwhat  exactly  he  means  by  saying,  \"otherwise   the\r\n\r\nposition  would have been different\", whether he  would\r\n\r\nhave  been holding and controlling the police  and  the\r\n\r\nwhole  machinery of State, or whether he  suffers  from\r\n\r\nthe  delusion  that he would be sitting here  as  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  But let me say that the position  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  been different, because all on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse are convinced that the 16 resolutions are a phony\r\n\r\nmiracle  ointment whose claims no one on this  side  of\r\n\r\nthe House believes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of the former Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  was  not the act of one  man  but  of  the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  on this side of the House, and  he  is  at\r\n\r\nliberty now to challenge anyone of them whether this is\r\n\r\nnot  so.  But again, as I said, it is an old propaganda\r\n\r\ntrick. He is not interested in what impact he makes  in\r\n\r\nthis House, but he is interested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  what  appears in the papers so that the reader  who\r\n\r\nmight  read these things would get the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister is holding back 39 rebellious  and\r\n\r\ncowed Assemblymen who really want to join the ranks  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim. He alleged yesterday that the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement  was, to quote  him,  \"not  a  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  of the real P.A.P. Government\".
