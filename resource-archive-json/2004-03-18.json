LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In Malay)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, yesterday, I explained to Mdm Halimah that the Ministry of Education has carried out a number of measures to ensure that students who are taught the standardised pronunciation be given the appropriate guidance.&nbsp; And I have also explained why it is important for the small Malay community to have a similar policy on standardisation and pronunciation of the Malay language&nbsp;for the society as well as schools.&nbsp; I would like to elaborate on my answer.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have said that for the small Malay community in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it is better for us to have a standardised language policy that is similar for schools and the general public that could guide on the use of the Malay language headed by the Malay Language Council of Singapore. If MOE drops the use of standardised pronunciation in schools, there will be no uniformity between the spoken language used in schools and in public at formal occasions.&nbsp; This will not be in line with the objective of the Malay Language Council of Singapore which is supported by the Ministry of Education.&nbsp; The aim of the MLCS in implementing the standardised pronunciation is for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to share its identity in its cultural and language context with the neighbouring<p align=left>Column: 2344<p> countries in the region that are using the Malay language.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The implementation of the standardised pronunciation is not to replace the existing Johore-Riau pronunciation.&nbsp; Historically, due to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s proximity to Johore and Riau, the Malays in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> have been using the Johore-Riau pronunciation in their formal and informal communication.&nbsp; Although the bazaar-form of&nbsp;Malay Johore-Riau pronunciation is still being used widely in everyday interaction and in informal situation, the use of standardised pronunciation is encouraged in formal occasions, such as in education, teaching and learning in classrooms, in speeches, at seminars, forums, formal meetings, interviews, competitions such as debates, and so on.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One major difference between <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and its neighbouring countries in the use of standardised pronunciation is the existence of a number of dialects in these countries.&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for instance, there are more than 250 dialects which at certain levels can result in linguistic interference which impedes a student from acquiring the standardised pronunciation needed.&nbsp; Standardised pronunciation in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> is much influenced by dialects and the Javanese vocabulary.&nbsp; Due to this, we did not choose <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> as our guide, although <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> has been using its form of standardised pronunciation since 1928.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Brunei Darussalam, standardised pronunciation has been used within their society which applies the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Brunei</st1:place></st1:country-region> dialect and vocabulary.&nbsp; However, their students are able to speak in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> effectively in formal occasions, such as in the <I>Titian Minda</I> debate which involves <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Brunei</st1:place></st1:country-region> pre-university students.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Malaysia, <I>sebutan baku</I> was implemented since 1988.&nbsp; According <p align=left>Column: 2345<p>to the&nbsp;Education Department of Malaysia,&nbsp;<I>sebutan baku</I> is still being used in Malaysian schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, its usage has been confined&nbsp;to the teaching and learning of Malay language.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the other communities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, there are now more Malay families who speak English at home.&nbsp; The percentage has increased from 6.1% of households in 1990 to 7.9% in the year 2000.&nbsp; This trend is expected to grow in the future.&nbsp; The use of <I>sebutan baku&nbsp;</I> that has a&nbsp;consistent association between script and sound will facilitate the learning of the language for our students who are less exposed to the Malay language at home, including non-Malays who offer Malay language in schools.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is clear that&nbsp;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sebutan</i>&nbsp;<I>baku</I> &nbsp;is more systematic and logical than the Johore-Riau pronunciation.&nbsp; It is also easier for the students&nbsp;to learn the Malay language using <I>sebutan</I> <I>baku</I>.&nbsp; The Ministry will continue to teach in and encourage the use of <I>sebutan</I> <I>baku</I> in schools.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, single session&nbsp;for primary schools has many spinoffs.&nbsp; One of them is that we can actually change the starting hour to later than it is now.&nbsp; Because of the two sessions that are currently still going on in many schools, primary schools here start at a very unhealthy hour of <st1:time Hour=\"7\" Minute=\"30\">7.30 am</st1:time>.&nbsp; I understand that some schools even start their assemblies at <st1:time Hour=\"7\" Minute=\"15\">7.15 am</st1:time>.&nbsp; On a normal school day, tens of thousands of students wake up before <st1:time Hour=\"6\" Minute=\"0\">6.00 am</st1:time> to make it to school.&nbsp; I am sure they do not really enjoy this type of morning routine.&nbsp; For many a family, actually the whole family wakes up before <st1:time Hour=\"6\" Minute=\"0\">6.00 am</st1:time> and then they have to rush to prepare the kids for school.&nbsp; This routine repeats itself in the evening.&nbsp; Thereafter, the parents are expected to have the energy and the time to spend with their children and, maybe, even make more babies for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>!&nbsp; I think we can do something about it.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I urge the Ministry to change the starting hour of our school sessions, maybe to <st1:time Hour=\"8\" Minute=\"30\">8.30 am</st1:time>.&nbsp; This is surely doable, with more schools becoming single session.&nbsp; I know of a Singaporean, Mr Rajindran Ramasamy,&nbsp;who is a professional working with <I>Reuters</I> in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp;

Similarly, the kids have time to recover from a day full of activities and spend quality time with their families.&nbsp; This is a pro-family practice that we can adopt easily while not affecting the quality of education received by our children.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then I was suggesting incremental steps, and was very heartened last year when the<p align=left>Column: 2348<p> announcement was made to introduce smaller class sizes, at least at the P1 and P2 levels.&nbsp; But the catch was that it is going to be left to individual schools to decide, based on their own resource constraints.&nbsp; In other words, they would have to adjust their scheduling, maybe have P1 and P2 in the afternoon session, and then P3 to P6 in the morning, and have no change therefore in the overall resource allocation but juggling it within what they already have.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few questions that I would like the Minister to respond to.&nbsp; The first is: how many schools have actually adopted smaller class sizes for P1 and P2?&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this has been made available as a policy statement, I would like to know what is the experience on the ground.&nbsp; The reason I ask this in particular is because, for the more popular primary schools, there is the tension that, without additional resources, they cannot maintain their enrolment and still have smaller class sizes.&nbsp; There is a tradeoff between the two.&nbsp; So, if they adopt smaller class sizes, they may end up actually denying their old boys, old girls, alumni school community, additional places at P1 for registration purposes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know what is the adoption rate and what the feedback has been, in terms of any problems and pedadogic-related issues, and whether the Ministry has specific plans to enhance the resources available so that the adoption of these smaller class sizes, at least at the initial stage at P1 and P2 levels, can be more widespread.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A recent survey found that new graduate teachers from NIE maintain their poll position as top earners among 4,000 graduates from NTU, beating even the engineering, accountancy and business graduates.&nbsp; The Ministry's recent announcement to allow teachers to go on attachment with businesses, community organisations and even overseas schools shows MOE's commitment to help teachers gain valuable experience outside the classroom which they can share with their students.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the intention of this scheme is commendable, one wonders how many teachers can really benefit from this scheme, as feedback is that teacher workload remains heavy.&nbsp; Teachers with children, for instance, may not be willing to give up spending whatever time they have during the holidays with their children to go on industrial attachment.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, teaching used to be synonymous with a family-friendly career, as teachers used to work half a day and can spend the rest of the day with their family.&nbsp; However, over the years, in our quest for high quality education, which is a good thing by itself, teacher workload appears to have increased inordinately.&nbsp; I understand that a secondary school teacher, besides teaching from <st1:time Hour=\"7\" Minute=\"30\">7.30 am</st1:time> to 2.00 pm, carries a host of other duties, such as CCA, student contact time, counselling sessions, remedial classes, committee meetings, marking, setting tests and examinations, and other administrative work after school.&nbsp; Further, there are also the compulsory training hours that teachers have to clock.&nbsp; Hence, teachers nowadays work very long hours, shouldering both teaching as well as other loads.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

They are so caught up in their own little box, any opportunity to help them get out of this state is good.&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to urge the Ministry to undertake a thorough review of teacher workload to determine if the teachers can cope, and also if their workload can be reduced by devolving as much non-teaching duties as possible, such as CCA, counselling responsibilities, etc, from the teachers.&nbsp; This is to ensure that good teachers are retained and their quality of teaching does not suffer from stress due to work overload.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the past, our focus was simply on literacy and employment.&nbsp; Teaching in schools was at the basic level, so that our people are able to read, write well and find a good job.&nbsp; It is a lot different now, especially with the slew of further changes announced <p align=left>Column: 2351<p>yesterday.&nbsp; While the focus still&nbsp;remains on literacy and employment continues to be important, there are also so many other things that have become equally critical, eg, the nurturing of creativity, the importance of National Education, the focus on multi-disciplinary learning, the drive for arts and sports, the dynamics of entrepreneurism, and the need for diversified programmes.&nbsp; Such are the demands of this global environment in which Singapore participates.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do all these changes translate into where teachers are concerned?&nbsp; It means that we need to have a very different batch of teachers than those of earlier years.&nbsp; Our teachers are now expected to have a global perspective while retaining a local flavour.&nbsp; Our teachers not only teach the students but, increasingly, have to deal with parents as customers of the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers must complete the syllabus on time and on budget as set by the Ministry, and also imbue in the ear experiential learning and creative delivery.&nbsp; Our teachers must build relationships with those that they teach and also build passion for the school in which they teach in.&nbsp; All these sound extremely exciting, but they add on to the stress and burden of our teachers, which could affect the attractiveness of this very noble profession.&nbsp; I understand that some have difficulties catching up with the changes that are taking place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how are we developing our teachers for this exciting and yet exhausting future.&nbsp; In what ways has NIE improved its basic orientation training programme, the one-year beginner teacher course, to prepare our teachers?&nbsp; How has the programme included the new important aspects of a teacher's life over and above just teaching well in class?&nbsp; Has the school helped in the continuous development of our teachers after they have been posted to<p align=left>Column: 2352<p> the school?&nbsp; How are our teachers learning to do new things like customer relationships?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The new MOE scheme would allow teachers to go outside the classroom and into the business sector, community organisations and even schools overseas to gain experience outside the classrooms, so that they can return with skills to share.&nbsp; However, the feedback that I have received is that while there is a policy in terms of implementation, there is not much progress, as principals, who&nbsp;will ultimately have to decide whether or not to release a teacher, are concerned with completing the syllabus in time and fear disruption to the classes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The article in the <I>Straits Times</I> in February 2004, headlined \"World Cup: How Norway did it\",&nbsp;the President of the Norwegian Football Association was reported to have said:&nbsp; \"We have to get the basics right first to give the Norwegian children opportunities to play football.&nbsp;

I spent my time playing sports almost every day of the year, sometimes two sports in a day, and often until it was too dark to see the ball.&nbsp; You learn to take<p align=left>Column: 2355<p>knocks, to go in for the tackle, to live with your scars.&nbsp; You rely on your team mates.&nbsp; You lead, you win and lose as a team.&nbsp; There was great camaraderie.\"&nbsp; His thoughts on 2nd September 2003 at the opening of the CCA conference were:&nbsp; \"CCA has been changed from ECA in 1991 to give emphasis that&nbsp;co-curricular activities are an integral part of education, not an add-on or option.&nbsp; If CCA has been important in the past, it will be more important in the future.&nbsp; This is because some of the key traits that our young need to succeed in a more complex and frequently changing future will be cultivated most effectively by engaging them in CCA, in teams, as well as in individual pursuits.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these quotes, clearly, CCA is important and it is an integral part of our education system.&nbsp; May I then ask the Minister: if CCA is important and should be emphasised in our schools, why do our principals keep telling the students and parents that there are insufficient resources for the children to take part in CCA?&nbsp; How many schools allow their students to participate in CCA without any selection process, and why is there a need for a selection process just for play or learn to play?&nbsp; Is the Ministry not putting in enough resources on the ground?&nbsp; And most of the students are directed to be librarians, with least of the resources needed?&nbsp; The guidelines and awards given to schools for&nbsp;CCA excellence&nbsp;are in contradiction to the policies of CCA for mass participation and allowing as many children the joy of learning as a team in CCA and sports.&nbsp;

In addition to that, some schools actually view sports through coloured lenses by associating some types of sports with certain character traits, for example, dropping football or soccer as a choice, with the reason that it may bring negative influence.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;very sad and should not be happening in our schools.&nbsp; I must declare my interest at this juncture as the Vice-Chairman of the Football Association of Singapore, as I know that several schools have scrapped soccer in their CCAs for one reason or another.&nbsp; Soccer is one of the few sports that has a very wide following and is a very good vehicle for bonding, promoting team spirit and for character development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the school is one place where the children can acquire not only knowledge but also the opportunity to develop their potential to the fullest, and to mould their individual character and know their strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; Apart from classroom lessons, interest groups, clubs, uniformed groups, the sports field and the other places like the gymnasium, the tennis, badminton or squash courts as well as the swimming pools are places where they also learn and develop their character.&nbsp; This is a very important part of education.&nbsp; We must have both because, at the end of the school years, we want to give our children a holistic education.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2357<p>Nevertheless, there must be a balance in CCA and classroom work.&nbsp; Parents are also worried that some schools put so much emphasis on CCAs that their children hardly have time for their studies.&nbsp; In this respect, may I ask the Minister what are the guidelines for schools on CCAs?&nbsp; What is the balance recommended between studies and CCA hours?&nbsp; Do principals alone decide what sports are to be included or excluded from CCAs?&nbsp; How does MOE monitor the CCA curriculum at the schools?&nbsp; Can MOE assist in making some of the sports facilities more accessible to the community so that more opportunities are open to the young living near the schools?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>11.30 am</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, the current scheme of activities open to school children does fall into the predictable list, to name a few, eg, football, rugby, hockey, softball, or the co-curricular activities such as drama, public speaking, uniformed units, librarianship, IT clubs.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>be it in the areas of stamp collecting, movie discussion groups, book clubs, saving the endangered species of animal groups, etc, we also need to create the environment around them. Children do care about the many things that happen around them and in the world, but we, as parents and teachers, sometimes give them a prescribed list of activities, be they ballet, piano or&nbsp;art classes, thus robbing them sometimes of their own interests. I feel that such interests can be further nurtured, harnessed, honed or&nbsp;dropped, if the child's interest wanes. We do not need to stay with an activity in a predictable<p align=left>Column: 2358<p> manner from one year to another. As such, when we give schools autonomy, it is my hope that teachers can expand the range of activities around the pupils, become facilitators in this process, and also negotiate for these activities to be recognised under the CCA scheme. Schools and the Ministry need to be more flexible on the descriptors currently used for CCAs.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me share some of the activities that students in the United World College here enjoy, eg, tenpin bowling, freebies, books on tape, rainforest club, card games club,&nbsp;stage lighting club, stage design club, jewellery and accessory creation club, cartoons club, jazz club, recreational hockey, etc. It is exciting. A look at nurturing an interest in a child means a lifetime interest into adulthood and retirement. A look at the magazine rack at any bookshop in UK or the States reveals an amazing maze of activities. There is almost a magazine for every hobby, some as obscure as train-spotting, that one has to flip through to know what the obsession is.&nbsp; The point I am making here is that we all need great passion and interest to take us through into our old age. It is my hope that, as school is a place of learning, a place for imagination, the scope for CCAs will be broadened and we will find the facilitators using Edusave money to conduct and facilitate such activities.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Character Building</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B>&nbsp; Sir, as we endeavour to build a strong society, we must start by building a strong character in each individual. What better place to start than in the schools?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that the Ministry of Education has included character building as one of its core focuses and one of the factors in school ranking. However, recent incidents in schools are of concern to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2359<p>They involved students committing suicide because of results, and the most recent case is one that involved a student that committed suicide when his affair with a schoolmate was discovered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These events prompt us to ask whether we have been doing the right thing and, if so, why do some of our students yield so easily under pressure and stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a few suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I think we should review the method adopted by our schools in teaching character building. We should evaluate whether they have been effective, whether there are better ways to deal with character building.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, teachers should be trained and equipped to deliver lessons on character building effectively. This is not an easy subject to teach as it has no textbooks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we should introduce a monitoring system to determine whether we are making progress in strengthening the character of our children. This is not an examination subject, and the risk is that schools may pay less attention to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is critical that we strengthen the character of our next generation. Singapore will most definitely face greater challenges in time to come. I do not worry about future challenges, as we have been through many. But I am more worried that our young people do not have the determination and the resolve to deal with these challenges when they come. I am worried that, instead of staying to fight, they may flee at the first sign of trouble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our education system must not only impart to our children the necessary knowledge and skills but also strengthen their character and prepare them for the <p align=left>Column: 2360<p>challenges ahead, so that they will not buckle under pressure but, instead, they will rise to the occasion.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> <I>Streaming in Schools</I><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several Members have spoken on the subject of streaming in primary and secondary schools. Let me first address the more general observations that Members have made before informing the House of specific refinements that MOE will be making in primary school streaming and in the Normal course in secondary schools.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streaming has done us well, and it remains an educationally sound policy.&nbsp; It recognises that different students have different abilities, different types of intelligence and different ways of learning.&nbsp; It seeks to provide them with the curriculum and teaching methods that help them develop and sustain an interest in their studies.&nbsp; It helps every student to go as far as he can.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members - Dr Lily Neo, Mdm Cynthia Phua and some others - have said that streaming results in stress and a loss of confidence.&nbsp; It is not an irrelevant concern.&nbsp; I do not doubt that there is some loss of confidence when a student is differentiated from his peers and advised to take a less challenging or more extended course of study.&nbsp; No one likes being told that.&nbsp; It is a human reaction.&nbsp; But the issue is less simple than that.&nbsp; Is the student more stressed by being channelled into an academically slower course or by staying on in a course that he is unable to cope with, taking exercises home that he is unable to complete, having questions asked in class that he is unable to answer and, finally, being unable to pass his examinations?&nbsp; I think we know the answer.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2361<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that confidence or self-esteem is much more a question of how well students do and how far they eventually go, than on whether they get to do the same thing as everyone else at the same time.&nbsp; Outcomes matter.&nbsp; And we are determined to help every student achieve the best outcomes he can - in school, when he leaves school and goes on to a post-secondary institution, or when he joins a workplace and has to count on his skills to earn a living.&nbsp; That&nbsp; is our best chance of giving every Singaporean a confident start in life.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is fully aware that many other systems do not stream students or stream them later than we do.&nbsp; It comes at great cost, ie, high drop-out rates,&nbsp;sometimes disguised by compulsory education up to the junior secondary years.&nbsp; And the academically faster students being held back,&nbsp;unchallenged and bored with their studies.&nbsp; Dr Tan Boon Wan just mentioned the issue of standards having fallen in British universities as a result of a rapid expansion.&nbsp; It is not just because of the rapid expansion in the university intake.&nbsp; It is also because of many years of experimentation with egalitarian policies in schools, leading to a lowering of standards so that as many students as possible can pass and obtain the same qualification.&nbsp; So much so that universities are now requiring first-year students to take remedial classes, including students who have \"A\" grades in the UK 'A' levels.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British recently released a report by Mike Tomlinson, former Chief Inspector of Schools, which proposes an overhaul of the British GCSE and 'A' level systems.&nbsp; As he put it, too many young people leave learning or fail to progress.&nbsp; And too many are left unchallenged and constrained by the curriculum they are offered. It is not a very different picture, as Members would know, from what we had in Singapore before streaming was introduced.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2362<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let us stick to a system that is focused on achieving strong outcomes for all.&nbsp; The most unambiguous result of streaming is that we have helped our weaker students go much further.&nbsp; We are doing our EM3 students well. About 90% of primary&nbsp;6 EM3 students proceed to a secondary education.&nbsp; 70% of them complete a secondary education.&nbsp; More than 50% of each EM3 cohort proceeds on to a post-secondary education at the ITE.&nbsp; I know of no other system which has had as much success in ensuring that students at the weakest end of the academic spectrum stay on in education, go on to a post-secondary institution and acquire real skills which they take into the workforce.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As several Members have asked - Dr Wang, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Dr Ong Seh Ong - are we streaming too early in primary schools?&nbsp; I ask principals and teachers that from time to time.&nbsp; They are kind-hearted souls by nature, like most MPs.&nbsp; They do not like to conclude that the student is unable to cope with his studies and needs a different course. So I can tell the House that I believe teachers when they tell me that we would be doing most of our EM3 students a disservice if we keep them in the regular curriculum in Primary 5 and Primary 6.&nbsp; These are students who lag significantly behind the rest of the cohort, despite remedial teaching.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If each of us thinks back to our own primary school days, we would have known pupils who were with us who were very weak in class.&nbsp; In our time, there was no streaming.&nbsp; My own best friend in my early primary years repeated a year twice.&nbsp; He finally dropped out before reaching the PSLE.&nbsp; We did not have a slower course of study then, so those who could not understand their lessons and tests would repeat a year and, if they still could not cope, they dropped out.&nbsp; It was a bad solution to the <p align=left>Column: 2363<p>problem then, and will be a bad solution now.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add that the EM3 cohort is not a large group. 12% of students are recommended by the schools to enter EM3 after Primary 4. Because many of their parents choose to put them in EM2, the final number in EM3 is 7%.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students are by and large happy in EM3.&nbsp; They feel they are able to follow their studies, and have something to show.&nbsp; But parents often do not like the fact that the school has recommended&nbsp;their child to be in EM3, and that is the bigger part of the problem to be overcome.&nbsp; However, parents do come round when they see how their child benefits.&nbsp; I asked for feedback from parents of EM3 students.&nbsp; A sampling may give Members a sense of what EM3 really does.&nbsp; One parent said he was disappointed when he was told that his daughter had to go to EM3.&nbsp; He said he \"lost face\".&nbsp; But he recognised that his daughter was weak, and said he could tell that she was happier, because the work was simpler and she was coping well.&nbsp; A second parent said all his relatives had been advising him to put his son in EM2 instead of accepting the school's recommendation.&nbsp; But now that the boy is struggling to pass his EM3 subjects, he feels that his son is much better off in the stream.&nbsp; A third parent said that although her daughter had managed to clear her Primary 5 examinations in EM2&nbsp;and could remain in EM2, she had opted for her child to go to EM3, because the child was too stressed with having to cope with EM2 subjects.&nbsp; In EM3 this year, she is happier. She has done very well in her Continual Assessment 1 (CA1), and has gained confidence.&nbsp; These are not unique accounts, and&nbsp;they are telling accounts.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What our schools try to do is to encourage intermingling of students&nbsp;from <p align=left>Column: 2364<p>different streams, so that they build friendships outside classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; CCAs provide avenues for this.&nbsp; Students in the same CCA support each other in common endeavours, they learn to work with each other and appreciate each other's strengths in different areas.&nbsp; This is something our schools will continue to encourage.&nbsp; And they will seek out more opportunities for interaction between students in different streams, by looking into different ways of organising school activities or PE, as Mr Inderjit Singh suggested yesterday.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also ensure that the system is flexible enough, so that students can go as far as they can in their specific areas of strength.&nbsp; Where a student shows good progress overall and is able to transfer to a faster stream, we will let him do so.&nbsp; We do so each year, especially after Secondary 1.&nbsp; Where a student is capable of taking&nbsp;one or two subjects at a higher level, we will let him do so.&nbsp; This applies to EM3 students as well as our Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students, which I will elaborate on briefly in a short while.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the primary level, as part of the easing of rules governing Mother Tongue learning, MOE had announced earlier this year that we will allow EM3 students to offer MTL, instead of Basic Mother Tongue, which is the norm for EM3 students, if they obtain Band 2 or better in the subject in their Primary 4 examinations.&nbsp; We will consider whether there are educational merits to extending this to any other subject, for example, to let an EM3 student take Mathematics at the EM2 level, if he has strength in the subject.&nbsp; This is what was suggested by Mr Inderjit Singh and a couple of other MPs. It would complicate timetabling arrangements, but we will be quite open to letting any school pilot this, if it sees EM3 students with these abilities and is able to make practical arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2365<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">11.45 am</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Merging EM1 and EM2</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor and Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested mixing EM1 and EM2 classes, since EM1 students only offer one subject, HMTL, that is different.&nbsp; MOE has been reviewing this, following the recent easing of requirements for students to take HMTL.&nbsp; There is an overlap in abilities of students taking EM1 and EM2.&nbsp; 20% of our Primary 5 students are in EM1.&nbsp; But almost half of the 20% are students who were first recommended by schools to take EM2, but whose parents chose EM1.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>With the enhanced flexibility for students to take Higher Mother Tongue, there will now be an increasing overlap in abilities between EM1 and EM2 students.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has, therefore, decided to remove the distinction between EM1 and EM2 in primary schools.&nbsp; Schools will decide on how to band their pupils, in ways that add the most educational value. They will be given the flexibility to organise the students in this broader programme according to their own criteria.&nbsp; I expect many schools may retain the present system of organising students according to their overall Primary 4 results. Some schools may decide to band students according to their language strengths - English Language and Mother Tongue respectively - for special attention. The arrangements will vary depending on the type of students in a school and how widely their abilities vary. How the students should be banded should be best left to the schools.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are able to combine EM1 and EM2 because they follow essentially the same course of study, leading to the PSLE, within the same span of time.&nbsp; There will be no change at the primary level to the Gifted Education Programme, which provides a different curriculum and teaching methods for exceptionally bright<p align=left>Column: 2366<p> students&nbsp; -&nbsp; an enriched curriculum.&nbsp; EM3 will also remain a distinct course, focusing on foundational knowledge, for all the reasons I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Our weakest students benefit from being taught separately, using a different curriculum, different classroom management techniques and different teaching approach.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Flexibility in Primary 4 Examinations</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also reviewed the current arrangements for the Primary 4 examinations, which currently serve as a streaming examination. With the merging of EM1 and EM2, we will give schools greater discretion in how they assess their pupils in P4.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools currently recommend a student's stream in Primary 5 based on a student's semestral assessments and an end-of-year examination at Primary 4.&nbsp; Schools select questions from a national item bank that is maintained by MOE, but they are responsible for marking and grading their own students. It is, in essence, already a school-based examination, but operating within a common MOE framework.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the removal of the distinction between the EM1 and EM2 streams, we will give schools the flexibility to use their own assessments of students' performance in the course of semestral examinations, the end-of-year examinations or other assessments, to identify students who are capable of studying Higher Mother Tongue in Primary 5.&nbsp; They would do likewise in identifying students who should be recommended to take the EM3 course. The Primary 4 examinations would therefore be like any other end-of-year school examinations at any other level.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Schools can develop their own assessment items, or choose to select questions from the national item bank that MOE will maintain.&nbsp; They can also<p align=left>Column: 2367<p> schedule their examinations later in the year, instead of in October currently, along with the school-based examinations for other levels.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools will be given the flexibility to develop their own end-of-year Primary 4 examinations from this year.&nbsp; MOE will work with primary schools to ensure smooth implementation of these changes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Normal Course&nbsp;</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the secondary level, we are also introducing greater flexibility across courses. As announced in 2002, from this year, Normal (Academic) students have been allowed to offer one or two 'O' level subjects at Secondary 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about the progress of this initiative.&nbsp; For a start, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics have been offered, as Normal (Academic) students are more likely to have done well in these subjects.&nbsp; Initial estimates from schools indicate that over 2,000 Normal (Academic) students have been assessed by the schools to have the ability and commitment to offer one or two 'O' levels, and are currently preparing to take the 'O' levels in Seccondary 4 this year.&nbsp; This is about 15% of the Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) cohort, not a small number.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema had suggested yesterday a 3-year&nbsp; Normal (Academic) course.&nbsp; The Normal (Academic) course currently leads up to the 'N' level examinations at the end of four years. Students who are able to take the 'O' levels then spend an additional year, a total of five years. This '4+1' system has worked well.&nbsp; 25% of our Normal (Academic) students do not progress to Secondary 5.&nbsp; The 4-year course provides them a sound foundation for post-secondary education. Further, even amongst the 75% of Secondary 4N students who do progress to Secondary 5, a significant proportion needs the full <p align=left>Column: 2368<p>four years initially to cover the <st1:place>Normal</st1:place> curriculum. They will not be well served by a shorter Normal (Academic) course.&nbsp; Many of those who make it to Secondary 5, in fact, find the 'O' levels to be a major challenge, and do not do well enough in their 'O' levels to go on to pre-university or polytechnic. They are well-served by having gone through a 4-year&nbsp; Normal (Academic) course, which allows them to graduate with a useful 'N' level certificate that recognises what they achieved.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor spoke about enhancing the&nbsp;Normal (Technical) course yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has been reviewing the Normal (Technical) course, which is now in its 11th year. &nbsp;&nbsp; It has worked well. The core subjects in the Normal (Technical) curriculum, comprising English, Basic Mother Tongue, Mathematics and CPA, provide a broad-based foundation that prepares students well for both technical and service-oriented courses at the post-secondary level.&nbsp; We are studying how to build on these fundamentals, and further customise the Normal (Technical) curriculum to meet the needs of students with a practical intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will require a reorientation of the syllabuses and teaching methods to focus more on practice-oriented learning. We are also studying how to introduce alternative assessment modes, such as individual and team coursework, instead of pen-and-paper tests alone.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a major curriculum review, and we will not rush to implement the changes to the Normal (Technical) syllabus. MOE will announce details of this review later.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will, however, introduce some flexibility in the Normal (Technical) course to allow students to offer one or two Normal (Academic) subjects, if they have the ability to do so.&nbsp; This is similar to Normal (Academic) students being allowed to take one or two 'O' level subjects, similar to the Express classes, <p align=left>Column: 2369<p>within four years.&nbsp; Schools will extend this flexibility to the Normal (Technical) students in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will give the schools the time they need to prepare for the change, to make the necessary adjustments in the use of facilities and teachers and in scheduling.&nbsp; Schools that are ready to do so next year will however be able to proceed first.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Primary Education</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Iswaran asked for an update on two major initiatives that we announced last year,&nbsp;in fact, at the Committee of Supply debate,&nbsp; at the primary school level - smaller class sizes at Primary 1 and Primary 2, and enabling Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils to study in a single session environment.&nbsp; We have enough teachers to implement the smaller class sizes at P1 and P2, starting with the P1 cohort in 2005.&nbsp; All schools will be given additional teacher resources to support the smaller class initiative.&nbsp; In parallel, MOE is promoting more varied teaching methodologies to improve the learning experiences of Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils and take the most advantage of smaller classes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-four schools are currently involved in a project we call GAIN (Grade-Appropriate Instruction and Assessment), a project to help schools think through how they can strengthen pupils' learning in their foundation years.&nbsp; The schools are identifying localised issues, classroom issues, that need to be tackled and are coming up with strategies to better support early learning, particularly in the context of smaller classes that are going to come on stream.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Progress is also being made in implementing single session for Primary 3 to Primary 6, and we expect full roll-out within 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong had spoken of the possible benefits of single session and asked if we could&nbsp; implement it faster.&nbsp; With partial single session and <p align=left>Column: 2370<p>smaller P1 and P2 classes, schools will have a smaller capacity. Schools that currently operate close to full capacity will therefore have to adjust their Primary 1 intakes, to gradually bring their total enrolment down to single session levels.&nbsp; Where physical capacity and the demand for school places allow, schools will transit to partial single session as soon as possible.&nbsp; The Ministry estimates that more than 100 schools -&nbsp; in other words 60% of primary schools - can implement partial single session by year 2007. There are 12 Government-aided schools which are already operating full single session, from Primary 1 to Primary 6.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members also raised broader questions of class size.&nbsp; Dr Ong had asked if we could extend small class sizes across the board.&nbsp; Ideally, we should have small classes across the board, every one of which taught by good teachers.&nbsp; But there is a real trade-off between quality and quantity of teachers when we try to implement smaller class sizes across the entire system.&nbsp; We can double the size of the teaching force so as to halve class sizes, but we can only do so by lowering the standards we require of our teachers. The choice is between, quite simply, having 40 students taught by a good teacher, and two classes of 20, one of which will be taught by a teacher who may not be fit to teach by today's standards.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is to recruit as many teachers as we can who meet our standards.&nbsp; We have not limited the numbers that we can recruit.&nbsp; Through EduPac, we have made a career in teaching more attractive and rewarding.&nbsp; We have been able to build up the size of our teaching force gradually over the last five years, from 23,500 in 1999 to 26,500 in 2003.&nbsp; However, it is unlikely that we can have a dramatic increase in the size of our teaching force without a significant lowering of quality.&nbsp; This will be particularly the case with the recovery<p align=left>Column: 2371<p> in the economy and the availability of more options for jobs for graduates from our universities in future.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given these constraints, our position on deploying our teacher resources is to do so where the additional teachers can contribute most towards the learning of students.&nbsp; This is why we have focused our teacher resources to reduce class sizes at P1 and P2 in the first instance. That is where most research shows there is greatest benefit in having smaller classes.&nbsp; Another good example is the Learning Support Programme (LSP) where Primary 1 and 2 pupils with difficulties in basic literacy skills are taught in small group sizes of 8-12 pupils.&nbsp; It is a very teacher-intensive programme but we think it is necessary and it pays off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using teacher resources in this targeted fashion is more effective than trying to reduce class sizes across the board.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Amy Khor expressed concern about the administrative workload and pressures faced by teachers.&nbsp; Our teachers work hard and have a strong sense of responsibility for their students. &nbsp; As with any profession in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, there is a certain intensity on the job and, occasionally, a degree of stress involved.&nbsp; We are addressing this.&nbsp; At the macro level, we will continue to recruit more teachers so that each officer's teaching responsibilities will be manageable.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also continue to ensure that, more fundamentally, our teachers have the skills and experiences they need to do their job well and to do their job confidently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked what improvements we were making to develop our teachers.&nbsp; Our teachers enjoy opportunities for professional development throughout their careers. In fact, I dare say we have one of the strongest and <p align=left>Column: 2372<p>most comprehensive training and development opportunities for teachers anywhere in the world.&nbsp; The National Institute of Education has undergone a complete revamp in the last five years and has restructured its courses to ensure they remain relevant to the needs of MOE and the schools.&nbsp; NIE offers good quality teacher training that strikes the right balance of emphasis on values education, pedagogical approaches and content training.&nbsp; NIE lecturers manage their classes to allow for discussion and participation, so that trainee teachers can transfer these same practices that encourage creative and critical thinking to the classroom.&nbsp; NIE is constantly looking forward, identifying new challenges and seeing how it can prepare our teachers, current and future, for the new challenges.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NIE is undertaking a comprehensive review of its initial teacher training programmes.&nbsp; It intends to broaden the range of learning and development opportunities in these programmes. The curriculum will incorporate more experiential learning and more space for teachers to reflect on ideas, and experiment.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">12.00 noon&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>at NIE, MOE provides various other development options for our Education Officers.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about private sector attachments for our teachers.&nbsp; MOE started the Teacher Work Attachment programme during the November/December holidays last year.&nbsp; It is part of the broader range of options that we are providing under the Professional Development Leave Scheme.&nbsp; Instead of using the Professional Development Leave solely to pursue academic development, they can also use the Professional Development Leave Scheme for industrial attachments or for <p align=left>Column: 2373<p>working with the community.&nbsp; They may also work on projects which help to enrich the classroom experience.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Teacher Work Attachment programme gives teachers the opportunity to step out of the school environment, broaden their experiences and gain fresh perspectives on education.&nbsp; And the teachers are keen on it.&nbsp; They are a forward-looking lot and keen on any exposure which helps them to develop.&nbsp; We started it small because we wanted to make sure that the first phase was a successful one, that their attachment was of a high quality and the teachers who came back would be able to share their experiences, and we would know how best to scale it up as we go along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pioneer group of 72 teachers in November and December last year were attached to 28 organisations for between one&nbsp;and four weeks.&nbsp; They included both the public and private sectors, for example, in banking and finance, e-learning, IT, law, media and communications, social enterprise, even the telecommunications industry, and tourism and hospitality industries.&nbsp; And the teachers who have gone on the Teacher Work Attachment programme&nbsp;have found the experience useful.&nbsp; Some have shared their lessons with their peers, not only in school but also at the cluster level.&nbsp; MOE is looking into how we can facilitate more of such attachments by building up linkages with the business chambers, with industries, and we have school alumni groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much has also been done to help teachers at the school level.&nbsp; Schools have the flexibility and autonomy to buy support services to assist teachers in their administrative duties by tapping on their manpower grants and the school operating fund.&nbsp; Schools can also use the school operating fund to engage people with specialised skills, such as music instructors, to help with CCAs.&nbsp; Our <p align=left>Column: 2374<p>principals can decide on the resources and services that best meet the needs of their schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Principals themselves play a key role in supporting teachers in their work.&nbsp; Teachers are more likely to sustain their dedication and enthusiasm for the job&nbsp;if school leaders lend their hand, show appreciation and give them a voice in things that affect them directly.&nbsp; This is why the Ministry takes a development of school leaders very seriously.&nbsp; We run a six-month course for principals that is regarded as one of the best in the world.&nbsp; We take the principals through not just the education side of things but how to manage people and how to run an organisation for change.&nbsp; We attach them to companies in the private sector, we take them to visit schools overseas.&nbsp; They go back to their schools with a very different approach and attitude.&nbsp; We also provide opportunities for further professional development through the Academy of Principals and sabbaticals for principals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang asked how MOE dealt with unethical teachers.&nbsp; The Ministry takes a very serious view on such issues.&nbsp; Teachers are entrusted with a special place in the lives of pupils who come under their care.&nbsp; They provide not just guidance in their students' studies but also serve as role models on how they should lead their lives.&nbsp; We will dismiss any teacher we find unsuitable for the profession.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to congratulate the Minister for&nbsp;the very bold action&nbsp;taken on&nbsp;streaming.&nbsp; May I ask, what is the effective date of this removal of streaming?&nbsp; Is it effective today?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> On the first issue of labelling, which is less important than the content structure of the courses and the way the classes are organised, it is something that we can look at.&nbsp; Like Mr Khaw Boon Wan, I did not do an MBBS.&nbsp; So this is not necessarily my strength.&nbsp; But we will consider whether there is a need to invent new names.&nbsp; But the name is&nbsp;really not an essential character of the stream.&nbsp; The EM3 stream, in particular, is a course of study that is very carefully customised to the abilities of our students.&nbsp; It was called the EM3 originally, because M3 referred to basic mother tongue and they started off taking English and Mathematics at the normal EM2 level.&nbsp; So EM was at the usual level and the mother tongue was at the third level.&nbsp; But we found soon after the scheme started that they were unable to cope in English and Mathematics as well and lowered the standard.&nbsp; So, effectively, EM3 has been a bit of a misnomer.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure how important it is for us to change the label.&nbsp; But we will be quite happy to get views on it and, if need be, find a new name.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the EM3 course is a course in foundational knowledge for students in primary schools, leading&nbsp;on to&nbsp;the Normal (Technical) course which reinforces this and provides for further knowledge and skills leading on to the ITE.&nbsp; So this<p align=left>Column: 2376<p> foundational programme is a very important one in our system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second question, I may not have clarified it clearly enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is effective immediately - the merging of the EM1 and EM2 streams.&nbsp; But I do not expect schools to immediately rush to reorganise their classes.&nbsp; They are aware of the change.&nbsp; They have been briefed, and&nbsp;they have been consulted.&nbsp; Certainly, from next year, schools will be thinking hard about how best they want to band their pupils according to their abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are some schools that want to go ahead and make rearrangements this term, or next term, it is up to them.&nbsp; The students are already organised in classes.&nbsp; There might be some flexibility to reorganise them, but it is not something I am pushing for.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would rather let schools decide.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

It is a tiny percentage of the teaching force.&nbsp; There is an overwhelming ethos in the teaching profession, which is an ethos of uprightness and&nbsp;leadership in more than just studies for our students.&nbsp; It is an ethos which is still healthy and strong in <p align=left>Column: 2377<p>our schools.&nbsp; So I am not fundamentally worried by this.&nbsp; In any profession - accountants, lawyers, doctors -&nbsp;you will find a small number that have character faults and, sometimes, engage in completely unethical practices.&nbsp; In teaching, we take this&nbsp;more seriously than in most professions because&nbsp;teachers are in a position of leadership with the young people.&nbsp; So we take action quickly and firmly.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Young people seem to have difficulty getting sufficient help to enable them to cope with the pressures of society or growing up with their studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in February this year, there was a case of a 15-year-old female student who was alleged to have stolen a handphone and shortly after she was questioned by the school, she fell from a block of flats.&nbsp; Over a week ago, another 15-year old boy jumped to his death after he was found by his teacher to have been dating another student.&nbsp; According to the press report, his form teacher phoned the parents requesting them to come to school for discussion on the matter.&nbsp; The boy had begged the teacher not to tell the parents, but this was refused and within a short while, the boy had jumped down from a block of flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the MOS has informed us that schools have systems to facilitate early identification and support for students who need help and to refer them for counselling.&nbsp; However, with these two cases that I have just mentioned, I feel that something must have gone amiss.&nbsp; I am not here to say what the causes were because I am sure these would be the subject of police investigations.&nbsp; But it does highlight the point that in difficult situations, there could be a system failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the majority of teachers are good first-line care givers for their students.&nbsp; But given the work stress that they themselves are faced with, some of them might not be in the best position to provide the type of help that is needed and a counselling session they conduct might just go awry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2379<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Health Sciences Authority in a study on unnatural death in children aged 12 years and below points out that this problem also exists with young children below the age of 12. Between 1997 and 2001, there were 23 cases of suicides of young people in this age group.&nbsp; And it says that this is a cause for concern as this is a phenomenon not seen 15 years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, home support, particularly from parents, is essential in providing that essential psychological and emotional ballast for students in coping with life and the accompanying skills.&nbsp; But in modern <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> where parents have heavy work and career commitments, and where students spend the bulk of their time in their schools, close and warm interaction between teachers and students can be of great help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is not a problem that will just go away by saying that there are many causes and we do not know how to deal with it.&nbsp; We raised this issue last year.&nbsp; I think we need to handle this again.&nbsp; By now, the Ministry must come to certain conclusions about, at least, the more recent cases.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry would now do a serious study and try to take a proactive approach in dealing with this issue.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, I have a couple of issues to raise about the SAP schools, and both are directly related to the promotion of racial bonding, and one is also related to the limited choices non-Chinese students have, ie, those&nbsp;who do well in their PSLE examinations but have difficulty&nbsp;getting into good schools, because many of our good schools these days are the SAP schools.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that SAP schools, as a default, will reject any application for entry into Secondary 1, when such applications are made by a non-Chinese student, despite that student having met all the aggregate requirements to enter the school.&nbsp; This seems a&nbsp;little unfair, since non-Chinese students have very little choices of highly sought after secondary schools to choose from, especially since we now have an extensive network of SAP schools.&nbsp; When we had a few SAP schools, I guess it was all right.&nbsp; But now there are so many SAP schools in Singapore and they have all the <p align=left>Column: 2382<p>resources and they have turned out to be among the best schools in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not think the number of non-Chinese students who will apply for SAP schools will be large, because they may not choose to go into a school that focuses largely on the Chinese culture.&nbsp; Therefore, I do not see a few of non-Chinese students getting into such schools changing the character of the SAP schools.&nbsp; The positive result will be a wider choice of schools for the non-Chinese students to choose from.&nbsp; The added advantage is that the Chinese students studying in the SAP schools will have a greater opportunity to interact with non-Chinese students, something greatly lacking today.&nbsp; The learning of each other's culture and way of life and acceptance of greater diversity will go a long way for students in the SAP schools and for Singapore's future in promoting greater racial bonding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this respect, I had also talked about the possibility of twinning the SAP schools with our neighbourhood schools, not just for interaction once in a while, but very regular interaction, particularly in activities in the co-curricular areas.&nbsp; So, I would like to ask the Minister what has been done in this respect or is there anything else being done to expose the children studying in SAP schools to children of other races, so that we could again promote greater racial bonding?&nbsp; I am appalled to hear many cases of Chinese children who stereotyped the non-Chinese children of their age groups.&nbsp; Recently, I came across a case in National Service, where a boy doing National Service told me that the Chinese platoon members do not want to mix around with a particular racial group for reasons of their perception of who they are, and I think this has to&nbsp;be eliminated as early as possible as this can happen in schools.&nbsp; Because by&nbsp;the time they go for their National Service, it is too late and it<p align=left>Column: 2383<p> becomes a lot more difficult to change their minds at that age.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think I was one of those who also had raised concerns about streaming.&nbsp; And it is indeed most enlightening and one of the best news that we have received that, at least in terms of between EM1 and EM2, there will now be no distinction, and that other changes would also be made.&nbsp; This is the kind of&nbsp;changes that we would like to see.&nbsp; After putting up representations for many years, I really applaud that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to support Mr Inderjit Singh on the points that he had made.&nbsp; I would like to pick up on the point on social cohesion that he had mentioned and racial integration.&nbsp; To me, social cohesion is important for Singapore, a multi-cultural and multi-religious society, and a multi-pronged approach is really needed to instill this.&nbsp; So, whilst schools cannot and do not have the sole claim on promoting social cohesion, nevertheless, they play an important role in promoting racial integration, as our young spend a considerable period of their formative years in school, and their character and outlook towards society&nbsp;are moulded by their experiences in school.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most of our schools, the opportunities for mixing between students of other races are there, but there have been concerns expressed over the lack of opportunities for such mixing when it comes to the SAP schools.&nbsp; So, I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister on the kind of initiatives that are in place to promote mixing SAP and non-SAP schools.&nbsp; What kind of joint activities or programmes are put in place so that students in SAP schools are able to<p align=left>Column: 2384<p> benefit from a better understanding and appreciation of other cultures and practices and, therefore, mirror much more closely the experiences that they will face when they enter the workforce and our society.&nbsp; Because I fear that without those opportunities, they will be somewhat cocooned in an artificial environment that they are operating in when they are in school.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In recent years, there has been an average of about&nbsp;2,000 teenage pregnancies a year.&nbsp; I am sure the majority of our students are less adventurous and more cautious, concentrating on their studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we need to face the reality that the world our young occupy today is vastly different from ours, with chatrooms, SMSs and phones with multimedia capabilities.&nbsp; The dynamics of their social interaction have changed dramatically.&nbsp; Coupled with this is the phenomenon of our dual income family where, at times, the primary care giving is relegated to other members, like foreign domestic workers or organisations like the student care services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, looking at the sexuality education of the Ministry, I must say that the content of the Growing Years series is a little removed from this reality.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Ministry to review the content of the Growing Years series and also to review perhaps the training programme that the teachers have undergone.&nbsp; I hear that the training programme is a good and&nbsp;comprehensive one but, at times, to keep up with the reality of the world that our young are in, this training needs to be further enhanced, and I hope the Ministry will look at that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2385<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second call that I would like to make in this particular aspect is&nbsp;whether the Ministry would consider introducing a compulsory course in the lower primary classes, with perhaps the help of a VWO like the Singapore Children's Society, so that our young will learn where they cannot be touched.&nbsp; There is a rise in the number of child abuse cases.&nbsp; I think that kind of awareness will go a long way in protecting our children.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

These days, our young have easy and ready access to Internet chatrooms, illegal videos, CDs, and sometimes even pornographic websites.&nbsp; We are also seeing some emerging changing sexual mores and norms over, for example, homosexual matters, oral and premarital sex, to name a few.&nbsp; The <I>Straits Times</I> report of 16th March, \"Teen Sex in the (Lion) City\" that my colleague mentioned earlier is a case in point.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To deal with what appears to be an increasingly \"sexualised world\" for the young, I would like to ask the Minister whether it would actually be reviewing its human sexuality programme and its present approach in conducting it in schools, and also how it involves parents in the process.&nbsp; Also, what are the Ministry's plans to help students understand through its human sexuality curriculum and other related curriculum, the national procreation issues facing the long-term future of our country, as we have been hearing and debating in this House in this session.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Regarding the role of parents, it is well <p align=left>Column: 2386<p>and good to say that they should bear primary responsibility in educating their children about human sexuality.&nbsp; We can go on exhorting this line to parents until the cows come home.&nbsp; But the reality is that most parents are not and are unprepared to do so.&nbsp; As such, the role has to fall on the schools and the community.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry, on its part, will be able to rise up to the challenge to help our nation in this regard.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</B> Sir, I will address the issues&nbsp;on CCAs as well as character building.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor, Mdm Cynthia Phua as well as Mr Zainudin have all spoken very passionately on the importance of CCAs, in particular sports, in a broad-based education.&nbsp; I agree with all&nbsp;their sentiments.&nbsp; I agree that we should do more to provide our students with richer learning experiences in the non-academic domain, so that they develop a resilient and robust outlook in life and become well-rounded and confident individuals.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rugged activities, eg,&nbsp;sports, adventure camps, expeditions, uniformed groups and so on,&nbsp;are naturally well-suited to develop qualities like perseverance, self-reliance, a sense of adventure, self-confidence and a \"can-do\", gung-ho spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of them are&nbsp;important in the challenges that we are going to face in life.&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is exploring ways to provide students, particularly those who are not involved in competitive sports, with more opportunities to participate in&nbsp;rugged activities.&nbsp; For example, we encourage schools to provide every secondary school student with two residential camp experiences.&nbsp; The Adventure Centres run by MOE and other organisations can provide at least one of these camp experiences.&nbsp; The other could be a \"camp on campus\" within the grounds of the school.&nbsp; Towards this end, MOE is developing two new campsites.&nbsp; Both will be operational by June 2005.&nbsp; MOE is<p align=left>Column: 2387<p> also open-minded if the&nbsp;schools want to work&nbsp;with grassroots&nbsp;organisations, such as constituency sports clubs,&nbsp;to organise more&nbsp;activities for the&nbsp;students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will allow Student-initiated Activities (SiA) to be pursued as official Co-curricular Activities (CCAs).&nbsp; Ms Braema spoke on the need to nurture interest among students. &nbsp; Student-initiated activities are one way of giving students greater scope to pursue their passions and interests, and will foster a greater sense of initiative and ownership in non-academic pursuits amongst them.&nbsp; So, let us see what ideas the students&nbsp;come up with.&nbsp; The existing CCA grading schemes - LEAPS and PEARLS - will also be adjusted to recognise student-initiated activities as well as&nbsp;to encourage broader student participation in rugged activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Dr Amy Khor also expressed concern that some schools do not cater adequately to the sporting and CCA interests of their students.&nbsp; Let me say that MOE encourages schools to provide a wide range of CCAs to cater to the diverse interests and needs of the pupils.&nbsp; Every pupil should have the opportunity to pursue the CCA of his interest and choice.&nbsp; But this will have to be done within the school's manpower and physical resource constraints.&nbsp; These are not excuses, as resource constraints are&nbsp;real things.&nbsp; Our schools will do their best to balance between developing students&nbsp;who have demonstrated ability in particular CCAs and providing CCAs at a recreational level.&nbsp; A school's tradition and its niche areas usually influence its choices of CCAs and&nbsp;sports activities that it could cater and offer in its CCA programme as core sports.&nbsp;

The House System in schools, which was re-introduced in 2000, is a useful platform to encourage broad participation of students in recreational sports, for example, through games carnivals as well as sports meets.&nbsp; To facilitate schools' efforts to further leverage on the House System, MOE will be launching two new courses, namely, the Students Sports Coach course and the Students Sports Official course. At the end of these courses, the students' sports coaches should be able to teach basic sports skills to beginners or students who are not in any sports CCA. They will become a valuable pool of leaders in the House System and who knows, some of them may become important leaders in our sports arena next time as they grow up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further provide opportunities for interested students to pursue activities of their choice, MOE has set up Sports Development Committees through the zone schools sports councils to promote sports development programmes for students who do not represent their schools in sports.&nbsp; We are exploring with external partners, such as the Singapore Sports Council, various National Sports Associations, National Arts Council and the Uniformed Group Councils to see what else can be done, at both primary as well as secondary levels.&nbsp; Indeed, schools are already tapping on the Singapore Sports Council's \"Sports U\" programme. This used to be called \"Learn to Play\" programme. This is aimed at allowing more pupils to take part in recreational sports. This programme started in 2002,<p align=left>Column: 2389<p> with 38 primary and secondary schools. This year, the number of participating schools has increased to 75.&nbsp; We look forward to further increases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEAPS, which was introduced at secondary level in January 2003, award points for five categories - Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service.&nbsp; LEAPS recognises both participation as well as achievement and, therefore, there&nbsp;are a lot of opportunities for students to just participate and score some points.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On character development, active participation in CCAs certainly can play a large role in character building as it is often through trials and experiences that students build strength of character, gain confidence as well as learn to function as gracious members of the society.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong spoke on the need to strengthen the character building component of our education system, and asked how we can measure the effectiveness of the character building programmes. We agree with him and we will try our best.&nbsp; To complement our CCAs, we have implemented a Character Development Programme to formalise the enrichment activities of schools.&nbsp; Schools actively undertake National Education and Community Involvement Programmes.&nbsp; In the formal curriculum, Civics and Moral Education aims to develop our students to be people of integrity who act responsibly with the interests of others and the nation in mind. Character building is, in fact, central to our Desired Outcomes of Education.&nbsp; It is not something that the school can do alone.&nbsp; It is also not something that can be measured easily. It is again not something that we have a monopoly of ideas.&nbsp; In fact, we will welcome ideas from all quarters on how else we can do to improve on our character building efforts.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</B> Sir, I will reply to issues concerning social cohesion, <p align=left>Column: 2390<p>students' well-being, discipline and sexuality education.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Inderjit Singh raised a common concern on how our SAP schools ensure that their students are well-integrated socially, and understand the aspirations and well-being of students from other races.&nbsp; I would like to reaffirm all Members that SAP schools, like all the other schools, are aware of their responsibility to educate students who are steeped in our national values in a multi-racial Singapore.&nbsp; All students in SAP schools have to go through the national curriculum, including learning about racial harmony through Civics and Moral Education classes and the National Education programme.&nbsp; In addition, all SAP schools are clustered together with other non-SAP schools.&nbsp; This facilitates activities across schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the national curriculum, the SAP schools are well aware of the limitations faced and have been collaborating with other schools and external organisations, to create more opportunities for their students to mingle with other races and to understand their cultures and religions.&nbsp; For example, Nan Hua Secondary School has been organising the National Green Camp and National Bilingual Speech contest for primary schools since 2003, as part of their on-going efforts to facilitate greater interaction between students of these schools.&nbsp; Other SAP schools leverage on the Community Involvement Programme (CIP) to provide opportunities for their students to be engaged with other communities, to work among and for them.&nbsp; Holy Innocent's Primary School, for instance, has collaborated with Pertapis Children's Home this year to organise a carnival, work on the Brownies-initiated activities, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Innovation Club activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the individual school level, SAP schools actively celebrate the different <p align=left>Column: 2391<p>ethnic festivals and leverage on these occasions to deepen their students' understanding of other races.&nbsp; Students are also given the opportunity to clarify common misconceptions of other races and cultures through talks and dialogues on ethnic cultures and issues.&nbsp; For example, the Chinese High School invites MUIS, the Islamic Religious Council in Singapore, to give talks to their students on Malay-Muslim culture.&nbsp; Non-Chinese teachers who have been deployed to SAP schools also provide the opportunities for multi-racial interaction to SAP students on a daily basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On racial stereotype raised by Mr Inderjit, I do not think we can possibly eradicate racial stereotype among individuals and the society in general forever.&nbsp; However, I would like to reiterate the point that in schools, our students are given the greatest opportunity to first mingle with each other, understand each other's cultural backgrounds so that they can form friendships.&nbsp; Teachers will always discourage racial stereotyping but we cannot really stop individuals from stereotyping other communities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me talk about student suicides.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin and Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised the issue of suicides among our young and asked how schools help detect and manage such cases.&nbsp; Mr Tan cited the recent case where&nbsp;a 15-year-old student from Loyang Secondary jumped from a block near his school.&nbsp; The principal and teacher of the school did a good job in managing the case.&nbsp; There are some gaps in the information as reported in the media. I think it is not for us to speculate the reasons behind the suicide. In general, I would say that it is most unfair and unhelpful to put the blame on teachers for every case of student suicides.&nbsp; Teachers are already trying to help our students by counselling them, and especially those who have problems.&nbsp; Therefore, it is very unfair and unhelpful if we put the blame on teachers for every <p align=left>Column: 2392<p>case of suicide that we experience here.&nbsp; I would like to reiterate that suicide is a symptom of a complex problem for which there is no one single cause.&nbsp; Studies have shown that factors such as relationship problems, failure to meet self and parental expectations, as well as dysfunctional family patterns are significant and recurring features among student suicides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo asked yesterday on efforts by schools and teachers to identify students who are stressed.&nbsp; MOE adopts a comprehensive approach that focuses on suicide prevention and intervention support.&nbsp; Counselling support is provided in schools for students from Primary 1 through JC2 and Pre-U3.&nbsp; Every school has a counselling referral system to facilitate early identification and extension of help to students with problems, such as stress and other family-related problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers are trained in basic counselling skills so that they may provide immediate basic counselling to students in need.&nbsp; And I am talking about every teacher is given the basic counselling skill.&nbsp; Suicide awareness briefing sessions have also been conducted for all teachers to alert them to observable signs of suicidal tendencies and refer these pupils for counselling support.&nbsp; Students with more difficult problems are referred to Teacher Counsellors, who are trained in more advanced counselling skills and crisis intervention.&nbsp; There are two Teacher Counsellors allocated to each school and they are off loaded, so they&nbsp;can spend more time on counselling students who are in need of assistance.&nbsp; If students face very serious problems, they are referred to MOE-appointed school counsellors, guidance specialists, or external professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further augment the counselling resources of schools and school clusters, the Ministry introduced the School Counsellors Scheme in 2001, where suitable education officers who have <p align=left>Column: 2393<p>retired or resigned, are trained and deployed to schools.&nbsp; These are people with years of teaching experience who know the students' behaviour quite well.&nbsp; By July this year, a total of 73 school counsellors would have been trained and deployed to 58 primary schools, 46 secondary schools, and three junior colleges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me talk about social work services.&nbsp; Depending on the profile of the schools' students, the extent and nature of problems may vary across schools.&nbsp; In recognition of this variation, MOE has given schools the autonomy to decide on the need for social work services and to engage these services from community service providers.&nbsp; Schools are also provided with information on the types of services offered by external agencies, like MCDS, voluntary welfare organisations and self-help groups, as well as referral procedures and follow-up actions to be taken.&nbsp; This approach of giving schools the flexibility to decide on engaging the type of social services required best meets the specific needs of students in each school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools have also put in place preventive education programmes.&nbsp; For instance, there is a pastoral care system in all schools, and it includes the teaching of life-skills which covers topics on personal and inter-personal effectiveness, and problem-solving skills.&nbsp; This helps students learn how to manage stress, negative emotions such as anger, as well as how to appreciate and get along with others.&nbsp; In addition, pamphlets advising students on ways to cope with stressful events are disseminated, and posters with information on crisis hotline numbers are displayed at prominent locations in school.&nbsp; These provide avenues for students to seek help for their problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should MOE review the current policy for schools to engage services from community service organisations? I would say, yes. Systemically, we will continue to monitor and review the provision of <p align=left>Column: 2394<p>counselling and other social services for students, to ensure that the needs of students are adequately met.&nbsp; However, it is also important to realise that while schools provide support for students, parents have a shared responsibility to help their children manage stress and other personal problems.&nbsp; For example, parents can help their children to set realistic expectations for themselves and develop strength of character which will enable them to cope with life's challenges.&nbsp; Even if parents are busy, the responsibility of parenting cannot be transferred to anybody else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On school discipline, Mr Gan Kim Yong asked what our policy on expelling delinquent students is, and whether schools can be more helpful to students who have disciplinary problems instead of dismissing them.&nbsp; I wish to assure Members that schools adopt a positive and proactive approach to discipline. These proactive measures include pastoral care, as well as life-skills and career guidance programmes which are aimed at helping students build self-esteem, take responsibility for their own actions and develop purposefulness in life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To counsel and assist students with disciplinary problems, schools also have in place a formal structure involving school personnel and external agencies such as self-help groups and family service centres.&nbsp; Schools focus on counselling them and work in partnership with their parents so that they can provide the necessary home support to complement the efforts of the school.&nbsp; Schools also work closely with social workers from community welfare organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expulsion from school occurs if a student commits a very serious offence, such as assault, and if allowing the student to remain would threaten the safety of other students or undermine school discipline.&nbsp; A student can also be expelled on the grounds of wilful absenteeism if he has persistently played <p align=left>Column: 2395<p>truant and resisted all efforts to get him back to school.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, I must emphasise that expulsion is always a last resort and only when all other measures, such as counselling, suspension and caning, have no effect on improving the students' conduct.&nbsp; Each case is unique and the principal is in the best position to judge when a student should be removed from school, to maintain good order for the safety and welfare of all other students in the school.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It is premised on the importance of the family and respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities and sexuality issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema asked about the syllabi and resources used in schools for sexuality education.&nbsp; The programme addresses the subject of human sexuality from a holistic perspective involving the intellectual, emotional, social, physical and ethical aspects.&nbsp; These are summarised into four main themes&nbsp; -&nbsp; human development, inter-personal relationships, sexual health and behaviour, and society and culture.&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme is also developmental in nature to meet the needs of students at the various stages of maturity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The topic on sexuality education covered in the formal curriculum is conducted through regular lessons.&nbsp; The co-curricular component of the \"Growing Years\" series is also conducted through regular lessons in some schools, and as a <p align=left>Column: 2396<p>special seminar for students in other schools.&nbsp; Teachers are specially selected and trained by counsellors, psychologists and medical and legal professionals to deliver the programme.&nbsp; Topics covered in the programme include pubertal changes, human reproduction, qualities of healthy relationships and successful marriages, Internet relay chats, online relationships as well as sexual offences and the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Prof. Ngiam's suggestion to put in a procreation content in the programme, we can consider it in future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, students are taught how to build healthy relationships, resist negative peer pressure and obtain help when they have been sexually victimised and cope with break-ups in relationships.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema and Prof. Ngiam also asked whether MOE is reviewing its human sexuality programme in view of the changing attitudes and an increase in diversity of views towards sexual norms.&nbsp; They also enquired how parents are involved in the process.&nbsp; MOE reviews the sexuality education curriculum regularly to ensure that teaching and learning are relevant and up to date.&nbsp; The \"Growing Years\" series, which was first implemented in the year 2000, is the result of such regular reviews.&nbsp; We will continue with the review from time to time and consider changes in the social norms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Prof. Ngiam on the importance of parental involvement in sexuality education for our young during the conceptualisation and development phases of the \"Growing Years\" sexuality education series.&nbsp; Feedback was sought from a representative cross section of parents from the various races, religions and different social backgrounds.&nbsp; Parents were also invited to be trained with teachers on how to deliver the programme.&nbsp; Thus far, parents make up 6% of total personnel trained.&nbsp; So we do <p align=left>Column: 2397<p>involve parents in delivering the content of the programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ultimately, schools alone cannot address all causes of emerging social problems in society.&nbsp; What we can do through sexuality education is to inculcate the right values in our students, raise their awareness of the options and consequences and equip them with the skills to make informed choices.&nbsp; The family and community must also play their part to support the students.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has not answered my question on allowing non-Chinese students to enter into SAP schools.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is the right approach and I have no argument about this.&nbsp; On the other hand, as the enrolment of the universities increases over the years, the proportion of the budget devoted to university education has crept up to reach 25% of the total education budget.&nbsp; In terms of resources, this is a disproportionately higher amount compared to the other 75%, if we just judge on the number of beneficiaries alone.&nbsp; Yet, on the other hand, the attention devoted by the Ministry on the assessment and the evaluation of universities does not seem to be equally high.&nbsp; From the GPC perspective, our Members have not visited the universities for many years now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we encourage greater autonomy for the universities, the balance of governance is indeed shifting more<p align=left>Column: 2399<p> towards the universities.&nbsp; In the process of granting greater autonomy, not everything has been smooth or will be smooth.&nbsp; However, the feedback and monitoring process seems to be a black box.&nbsp; Many of us, observing from the outside, wonder who is holding the reins, how are the universities assessed and what are the performance measures.&nbsp; In theory, the various councils are empowered to ensure proper governance of the universities.&nbsp; In practice, as in the corporate world, much depends on the Chairman, the CEO and the tradition of the councils.&nbsp; The recent episodes in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> corporate world highlighted the danger of an imperial CEO.&nbsp; The question is whether MOE has a proper oversight in place to ensure proper governance of our universities.&nbsp; Are there checks and balances in place to prevent the emergence of an all-powerful CEO?&nbsp; So far, everything seems to be, by and large, in good order as we have good men and women at the helm.&nbsp; What is there to assure that things will remain the same in the future?&nbsp; This is assuming greater importance as we contemplate changing the way the three state universities are funded.&nbsp; At the current funding level of 75% state funding, at least the university administrations feel obliged to caress the hand that hands out the money.&nbsp; What would happen if there are other equally important hands to take care of in the future?&nbsp; Would the Minister give an update on the governance of the three local universities and whether the governance of the universities could be improved, as they are given greater autonomy in the near future?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>University Admission</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the removal of SAT as an admission criterion is indeed welcome as its weightage has already dropped to a mere 5%.&nbsp; This shows the willingness of the Acting Minister to bite the bullet, and <p align=left>Column: 2400<p>his willingness to make drastic changes.&nbsp; What he announced yesterday and today is a very refreshing move. Still, the experimentation of SAT was costly, both in terms of expenses and the time and effort of everyone in the JC system during this period.&nbsp; We should learn from this that the university admission criteria should be handled with a view towards the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the announcement that the mother tongue language is no longer compulsory also caused great changes in the mood of the MTL teachers as well as the students who are preparing for the university entrance examinations.&nbsp; As university education is the ultimate goal of everyone in the school system, whatever we set as the selection criteria has great impact on the cohort all the way back down to Primary 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are basically two possible models of university admissions&nbsp; -&nbsp; a central university examination or a university-specific selection examination.&nbsp; Both are being used in the world and each has its merits.&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we have basically the central system. However, as each of the universities aims to differentiate themselves into different centres of excellence, there is a trend towards customising the admission criteria to its needs.&nbsp; Of course, even before this, specific faculties have their own tailored admission criteria.&nbsp; Furthermore, with the establishment of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Sports</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Arts</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, are we also going to see some adjustment in the admission criteria to accommodate the talents of students from these Schools?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister has painted a more competitive landscape for university education in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> down the road.&nbsp; One or two private universities will be coming on stream very soon, and they have their own admission criteria.&nbsp; Further, as we shift our emphasis towards<p align=left>Column: 2401<p> greater thinking skills, university admission to the state-funded university will become more judgmental.&nbsp; What used to be a very simple network is becoming a more complicated maze.&nbsp; I think the students will find it quite a task to navigate.&nbsp; The question to the Minister is:&nbsp; how do we continue to ensure that the process is fair, equitable and transparent?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, the introduction of a flexible and differentiated approach for admission to our local universities bodes well for both the universities and the students. This is especially timely for the local universities in the face of increasing competition, both internally with the setting up of private universities, and externally as Singaporeans become more mobile.&nbsp; Without more flexibility in admission criteria, they could lose many bright students to competitors.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the MOE for its swift decision and biting the bullet, as it were, to drop SAT 1 as a compulsory admission criterion, despite having incorporated this requirement only a year ago.&nbsp; The impending changes to SAT 1 and the implementation of the new 'A' level curriculum will result in a substantial overlap between the two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS, NTU and SMU seem to be racing against each other to introduce the most progressive criteria to draw the brightest and the best, as they move away from joint admission exercises.&nbsp; This competition is healthy, and will only benefit students and spur performance to higher and higher peaks of excellence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, amidst all the excitement that this has brought, there are two concerns that I hope the Minister can address.&nbsp; Firstly, I wonder about the efficacy of the formula by which students are allocated to courses, in relation to the number of places offered for each course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2402<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure many Members would have heard of graduates in particular fields who have never ever started in their chosen field of learning.&nbsp; By itself, this is acceptable since a university education is, above all, a training of habits of mind that will enable a graduate to think independently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific skills, with some exceptions like engineering, law and medicine, can sometimes be learnt on the job.&nbsp; But, as university education becomes increasingly expensive, the cost to society and public finances of practising something other than what one has learnt gets higher and higher.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if, in the rush to give the universities more autonomy to respond to changing market conditions and opportunities, the universities have the necessary expertise and support, say, from MOM and other Government agencies, and are also adequately cognisant of the marketplace to anticipate future trends and manpower requirements.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, having heard the speech by Minister of State&nbsp; Chan Soo Sen yesterday, I can only sigh with emotion that history has played a cruel joke on the Chinese community in Singapore.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese community has all along loved and showed concern for its mother tongue.&nbsp; In 1950, Mr Tan Lark Sye just made one appeal and the people were in one heart and one mind which led to the establishment of&nbsp; the Nanyang University&nbsp;(Nantah).&nbsp; All these years, no matter how difficult the environment has been, they are still supporting Chinese education.&nbsp; And now, both the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the post-Nantah which claimed to be linked to the former Nantah by flesh and blood, announced that the grade of the mother tongue will not be counted in their admission criteria. Some people are not happy. But Mr Chan said that the Chinese community should not be emotional. They should step out of the umbrella of Government policies, as there is no need to make use of policy to force people to learn Chinese.&nbsp; He also urged the Chinese community to make great efforts to create more space for the use of the Chinese language.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By saying so, he means that the problem of the Chinese education arises because the Chinese community has not put in enough efforts to create enough space for the use of Chinese, and as a result of the Government's implementation of bilingual policy which forces the students to learn the mother tongue. Applying his logic, I would ask then, why did the Government decide to use English as a medium of instruction for all the subjects in the 70s, thereby forcing all the students to learn English in order to make the grade for further studies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should ask why is it that this community which had the power and the ability to establish a university before the PAP became the Government and, yet, <p align=left>Column: 2404<p>now after 45 years of rule by the PAP, we need a PAP man to remind them on how to deal with their language and culture problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the constituency which supports the mother tongue education is losing its political influence, and the opposing camp's voice is getting louder and louder, the Government made&nbsp;some&nbsp;calculation&nbsp;to it and now decides to change its course mid-stream. The PAP's so-called bilingual policy, which it claims to be the foundation of our education, is none other than its political tool. Surely, the PAP is not prepared to pay a political cost to defend the Chinese education under the present circumstances and pay a political price.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the relaxation of the policy, the relevant authority said that admission of students to the university should be based on their strong subjects. Being poor in the mother tongue does not necessarily mean that the student cannot do well in the other subjects. The new admission criteria allow those who are poor in the mother tongue but nevertheless talented otherwise to be admitted to the university and faculty of their choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reader wrote to the&nbsp; <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> rebutting such an argument. Let me quote from his article, \"If the objective of the university is to develop the strong points of the students, then more weightage should be given to the major subjects. As for the two language subjects, mother tongue and English, they should be treated as equal. You either take both the languages, or none at all.&nbsp; Not many students can master both English and the mother tongue, some do not have the chemistry with English, while others may not click with Chinese. If only one of the languages is not counted, then it is unfair.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is indeed&nbsp;true.&nbsp; But I am afraid this reader has forgotten that English is a <p align=left>Column: 2405<p>sacred cow, one scared cow which is untouchable. Faced with such a deity, what fairness can you talk about?&nbsp; Notwithstanding the Government's verbal emphasis that the policy adjustment does not represent that the mother tongue is no longer important, what would be the interpretation and reaction of the students who have been immersed in this utilitarian society all these years?&nbsp; It is not difficult to guess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the students, the removal of compulsory inclusion of grades of the mother tongue in the admission criteria can only be interpreted that the mother tongue is no longer important. Pragmatic as they are, why should they want to spend so much time to improve the standard of their mother tongue?&nbsp; Even if they realise that Chinese is fast becoming an important language because of the emergence of China, to the students, their immediate concern is how to squeeze through this narrow gate to get admitted to the university.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Sir, my comments pertain to the whole approach towards the setting and modification of admission criteria for universities.&nbsp; It is quite clear that, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>,&nbsp;a university degree is a coveted attainment and it is seen as a pinnacle of educational achievement and a foundation for a successful career and future by most Singaporean families.&nbsp; That combined with the fact that an overseas education option is very expensive,&nbsp;many young people and their parents are trying very hard to adjust themselves to the needs on the prerequisites to attain admission to the universities.&nbsp; That being the case, any changes to the admission criteria, especially changes that increase the requirements or impose an additional burden on the qualification on students, must be done with care.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp;a case in point is this whole exercise with the SATs.&nbsp; When it was introduced a couple of years ago, we had quite an extensive debate in this House.&nbsp; At that point, it was raised repeatedly by many Members that, first, whether the SATs were appropriate and, second, that even the SAT system itself was under review at that point in time when we were choosing to adopt it for our own university admission system.&nbsp; That being the case, when we went into this adoption of the SATs, the question was: were we prepared to commit to it for the medium to long term?&nbsp; I am not suggesting that we get locked into some kind of a permanent arrangement, and we should be flexible.&nbsp; And I applaud the<p align=left>Column: 2407<p> Ministry, like other speakers, for having decided now to do away with the SATs, given the changed circumstances.&nbsp; But I would urge that,&nbsp;if future adjustments of this nature, if any, are being contemplated, we should do so with a great deal of care and ensure that if we are going to make such a change, it is done with a view to maintaining it for the medium to long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is on the sole issue of whether we should, in fact, decentralise the admission criteria, a point that Dr Wang has raised.&nbsp; My own view is that we ought to consider increasingly decentralising these criteria.&nbsp; The Ministry has already taken several steps in this respect, and I welcome that.&nbsp; But we could do more, for example, individual faculties, like the medical faculty should be more flexible in the way they admit students, and not go purely on academic criteria.&nbsp; The reason is because we get a lot of feedback from people in the profession saying that younger doctors seem to come in and treat it more as a career rather than as a vocation, as a calling, which means that, maybe, some X factors are lacking in the way we choose people to go into the medical profession, as an example.&nbsp;&nbsp; And similar arguments can be made across the line for different faculties.&nbsp; Also, there is an obligation on the Ministry because public funds are being used for universities to set a certain minimum standards.&nbsp; So, surely, the model could be one where the Ministry defines certain minimum academic standards and the principle of meritocracy, and then allow the universities, the tertiary institutions, to set their criteria at the university level and for individual faculties, in fact, to have greater flexibility in the way they choose students to be admitted to their courses.&nbsp; I would like to ask for greater elaboration from the Minister on the Ministry's<p align=left>Column: 2408<p> thinking on this whole policy towards university admission.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The universities will have more flexibility and freedom to manage their funding just as they do to recruit their academic staff and the enrolment of students.&nbsp; The changing criteria wil affect the make-up of the institute and the quality of graduates.&nbsp; I also agree that admission requirements must change with time and the different objectives of our education system.&nbsp; My concern is that the Ministry of Education should keep a close watch on the student enrolment to ensure that in their zeal to balance the financial books, universities do not take the wrong path and lower enrolment standards in exchange for funding.&nbsp; This would erode the value of our institutions of higher learning which we have taken years to build up its reputation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in this respect, I have the following questions for the Minister:&nbsp; What will be the minimum standards that universities have to observe with regard to the admission of students?&nbsp; How will the Ministry monitor to ensure that there will be no abuses?&nbsp; I would also like to know will the changes to the admission criteria be implemented for other institutions, like the polytechnics.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, almost all universities around the world practise a policy of minimum non-graduate qualification acceptable for admission into their institutions, including <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; We have the university joint admission exercise which determines the<p align=left>Column: 2409<p> acceptance, rejection of student applications.&nbsp; However, with a new university admission system, universities are now allowed to set independent admission criteria.&nbsp; This means that undergraduates may or may not be admitted into universities or the course of their choice based on the current criteria which everybody knows its basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is whether the new system of allowing university to set independent admission criteria will affect public confidence in our education system in which promotion to a higher level of education is based on merit and academic results.&nbsp; The concern is, with the prospect of lower funding for universities and the need for universities to master resources in order to compete, whether this new system of allowing universities to set their own admission critieria will become a back-door for admitting children of the rich and the influential, as these people do have the resources to contribute to the development of a university community.&nbsp; As it is now, before universities are allowed to set independent admission criteria, it is not too uncommon to hear some borderline students often wondering why some of their peers who obtained similar grades managed to qualify for a particular course, whereas they failed to do so.&nbsp; Therefore, I am of the view that it is crucial that the admission exercise, whether it is based on a common set of criteria or&nbsp;specially tailored criteria set by individual university, has to be transparent; assessment process and judgement made are convincing and beyond doubt.&nbsp; It is also equally important that university authorities should make known to the students the specific reasons for rejection into university courses and the rationale behind the decision.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What students and parents dread to hear is that fees will increase.&nbsp; The argument is that, in these days of belt tightening, it is harder to support heavily subsidised university education compared to primary and secondary education.&nbsp; The latter two benefit society more than the former which, it is argued, accrues more to the individual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not fully agree with this.&nbsp; The rationale for investing in education has always been that as human capital is our only resource, we should seek to maximise the potential of every individual.&nbsp; That is the thinking behind, say, the GEP programme and, indeed, the basis of the flexibility that has recently been introduced into our education system. Implicit in this rationale is that the eventual benefits will accrue not just to the individuals.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, as a whole, would gain from the presence of a highly educated, skilled and thinking workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That aside, I read in a recent issue of the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Economist</i> of the mini-political crisis the UK government faced, when it tried to raise university fees across the board to reverse previous decades of excessive public subsidies for college education.&nbsp; That story contrasts the rich and powerful American university system that attracts Nobel prize winners, with the dismal <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> university system where academic mediocrity is widespread, college buildings crumble from neglect, and students disinterested in their studies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that letting the universities and university students bear a bigger share of the cost of their college education will inculcate greater public sector discipline and personal responsibility.&nbsp; But having said that, I urge the Government to stage any fee increases they plan to implement over a longer period of time to give ample warning so as not to squeeze the lower and even middle income families further.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2411<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM has promised that no one deserving to attend university will be denied a place.&nbsp; But the truth is, with the exception of Government or corporate scholarships that pave the way for the recipients, less endowed students will need to apply for bursaries and study loans.&nbsp; These are debts that they need to repay after graduation.&nbsp; This can be quite onerous and adds to the already heavy financial burden that young graduates carry in buying a flat, giving allowances to their parents and in-laws and paying for everyday expenses, not to mention starting a family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere, especially in the US, generous out-of-state fee waivers, teaching assistance programmes and student employment opportunities plus corporate endowments provide a more conducive environment for students to work part-time to pay for their fees.&nbsp; Here, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the choice is largely either/or, because of a lack of employment opportunities and a much smaller corporate sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, more generous tax deductions should be granted to encourage corporate as well as individual giving.&nbsp; Finally, I would also like to ask the Minister if the fee increases apply to polytechnics as well.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The ultimate prize is winning a place in the local university for a basic degree.&nbsp; Now that the universities are planning to expand their intake from the current 21% to 25% of each cohort by 2010, it is something to be happy about.&nbsp; There is no need for the Government to worry and<p align=left>Column: 2412<p> plan ahead to reduce its subsidy per student to below that of 75%.&nbsp; I believe the Government can well afford to finance this increased intake.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are talking about a small increase in each cohort up to a projected 4% maximum by 2010.&nbsp; Assuming a replacement cohort of 50,000 students, the 4% projected increase is only an increase of 2,000 students to about 12,500.&nbsp; How much damage will this increase of&nbsp;2,000&nbsp;in our local student intake do to our billion-dollar budget?&nbsp; Not much, I believe.&nbsp; It is only around an additional $25 million, which the Government can well afford to absorb into its budget.&nbsp; But for a student who is not working, who relies on income from the family, who has all the other additional expenses, such as hostel fees, books, transport fees, etc, to bear with, any small increase in the tuition burden is an additional burden too much for them to bear.&nbsp; It causes big damage to their already tight budget, planning and pockets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not get the students into the bad habit of taking more and bigger loans.&nbsp; When their time comes in the future, say, 2010, for an increased budget allocation to MOE to subsidise the additional number of students to get into the university, I believe no one in the House will then be willing to complain and scream about the greater subsidy that we are giving our children and future leaders to pursue a university education.&nbsp; This is because we have all benefited from the system in the past and know the benefits that it brings to us individually and to society as a whole when more people are educated through the university.&nbsp; I believe our society can well absorb this small increase in subsidy for university students in the future, to groom the next generation of leaders.&nbsp; So, I hope the Ministry will not look to burden our students further with a bigger burden.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2413<p><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Will this lessen the sense of civic responsibility amongst university and polytechnic graduates in future if they are seen as less deserving of the quantum of subsidies, and will the universities be really able to make up for this shortfall through other means without affecting quality?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Secondly, we have local campuses and local degrees of well-known reputable international universities and so we have to watch the comparison of fees, plus overseas universities' fees.&nbsp; If we peg our fees too high, we will lose the numbers.&nbsp; We really cannot peg them that high.&nbsp; So, how will the shortfall of fees be made up, if the quantum of Government subsidies is reduced?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One is on university fees, and the other on the university admission criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I join my other parliamentary colleagues in voicing my concern over the increase in university fees.&nbsp; This issue is of special significance to me, because I strongly believe that education is the greatest leveller in our society.&nbsp; Through education, we give hope to everyone, regardless of their family background, so<p align=left>Column: 2414<p> that not only those who were born with a silver spoon has a place in our society and continue to benefit from our progress, but the children of every family can aspire to a better life if they have the will and the tenacity to strive and succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a short period of almost 40 years, we are able to leapfrog from a poor undeveloped country to one that, despite our size, is recognised and respected as a practical model of development for many developing countries.&nbsp; I attribute this primarily to our heavy investment in education at all levels, including university education.&nbsp; I am concerned that many families will find it a terrible strain to send their children to university if the fees are increased.&nbsp; I would like to point out that the median wage for Singaporeans today is less than $2,000 per month and, therefore, university fees, averaging between $5,000 and $6,000 a year at the current level of subsidy, are already quite steep for many families.&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to urge the Minister to monitor this situation closely.&nbsp; I would hate to see a situation where certain courses are only accessible to the upper income as the fees are so high that that becomes a natural cut-off point for students, instead of their qualifications or capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second point of university admission criteria, I want to applaud both the MOE and the universities for the greater flexibility that they are now practising in university admission.&nbsp; The change in NTU's admission criteria is particularly bold and refreshing.&nbsp; It is consistent with the general review that is taking place with more focus being given to the values of passion, creativity and leadership.&nbsp; The changes to the NUS admission criteria, however, appear to be less significant.&nbsp; The criteria for giving 10% flexibility have not been spelt out, considering that a place in the university is something that is very much sought <p align=left>Column: 2415<p>after in Singapore.&nbsp; I think it is important that our universities are transparent and make known their criteria for admitting students, so that it is clear in everyone's mind that the principles of meritocracy will continue to be maintained.&nbsp; I am, however, disappointed,&nbsp;that neither the NTU nor NUS talked about admitting mature students, who may not have fantastic qualifications but are nevertheless competent and able because of the vast working and life experiences that they have.&nbsp; I hope to get a clarification from the Minister on this, as I see the university as an important part in the whole process of lifelong learning in Singapore, and I believe that mature students will add colour and very different perspectives to the classroom, which will be beneficial to all students.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> Sir, DPM Lee, in his Budget Speech, mentioned that the Ministry of Education is going to review the subsidy structure for tertiary education.&nbsp; The intention&nbsp;is to reduce the level of Government subsidy and let students bear a greater share of the burden.&nbsp; The rationale was that university education benefits individuals more than the society and the nation.&nbsp; Therefore, he argued that we should focus our limited resources in supporting primary and secondary education that benefit more people.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to differ.&nbsp; I would argue that we should not reduce the subsidy for tertiary education for a number of reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, people are our only resource, our only asset, and we must spare no effort in developing their potential to the fullest.&nbsp; Education is the key to upgrading the quality of our people.&nbsp; Unlike in the past, tertiary education today is no longer a luxury, but a common aspiration of Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is, therefore, necessary <p align=left>Column: 2416<p>for us to ensure that tertiary education is affordable.&nbsp; By that, it means that people do not need to borrow money to have access to tertiary education.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the fact that only 25% of each cohort proceeds to tertiary education should not be the reason for reducing the subsidy.&nbsp; In fact, I would argue that this is the top end of our talent and we should do all we can to help them realise their potential.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the argument that tertiary education eventually benefits individuals more than the society is also flawed.&nbsp; I would argue that, because these are the cream of the crop, many of them are potential leaders in business, politics and society in future.&nbsp; The multiplier effect can be enormous.&nbsp; The society and the economy will eventually benefit from their contribution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe there is still room for reducing the running cost of tertiary education institutions.&nbsp; Before the Ministry decides to reduce Government subsidy, I would urge the Ministry to first launch a cut waste campaign in these institutions to further trim their operational costs.&nbsp; Eventually, we could even consider cutting back some of the less critical Government expenditures.&nbsp; But to reduce the subsidy for tertiary education should be the last resort.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I agree with the stand taken by the Government regarding the need to spread the education dollar to benefit the most number of students, rather than focusing these resources on the tertiary education sector.&nbsp; Whilst agreeing with the budget allocation, it is also imperative as a nation that we find other means of funding the centres of academic excellence in Singapore that will excel in both teaching <p align=left>Column: 2417<p>and research.&nbsp; We need to draw top talents who are involved not only in knowledge dissemination but, more importantly, in knowledge creation, towards Singapore.&nbsp; Top universities compete for talents on a global basis.&nbsp; If we are aiming to create world-class institutions, then our universities will have to pay top dollars to recruit these talents.&nbsp; Should our universities be out there in the international talent market and bid for these top talents?&nbsp; Most definitely.&nbsp; We need to provide both competitive salaries and world-class research funding facilities to gravitate them towards Singapore.&nbsp; Both are very expensive propositions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is: how do we fund these?&nbsp; The answer lies in our ability to balance the needs and contributions of the different stakeholders, so that we can move towards covering the costs of running top-grade universities where the research budget and staffing cost will surpass the existing capitation limits.&nbsp; The Singapore model of funding for universities follows the UK model, where the bulk of the costs of higher education is expected to be borne by the&nbsp;state.&nbsp; Is it conceivable that university fees can double or be more in the future?&nbsp; Most probably yes.&nbsp; Of course, in our society, no needy but qualified students should be denied a university place.&nbsp; There need to be bursaries, scholarships, grants, student loans that would be put in place to provide for these needy students.&nbsp; But my position is that parents and students must bear part of the cost of the expensive education.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, endowments are a big factor in US education funding, particularly for top-rate universities.&nbsp; Even in the state universities, state funding covers only between 15% and 25% of the cost of operating the universities, and the rest are covered by fees and endowments.&nbsp; In Singapore, the development of philanthropic market for higher education is still in its infancy.&nbsp; There is intense<p align=left>Column: 2418<p> competition&nbsp;for the philanthropic dollar.&nbsp; Local universities need to plan and implement programmes for fund raising.&nbsp; As a society, we need to provide more recognition for donations to university endowments.&nbsp; With the comparatively reduced role of the state in tertiary education funding in the future, we need to encourage our top corporate honchos to give to the development and promotion of tertiary education, to ensure Singapore's place in the league of academic excellence and nation building.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For universities especially, the playing field is no longer just <p align=left>Column: 2420<p>Singapore or the region. They have to attain standards of excellence that place them in the first league internationally.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have certain advantages. Our universities are able to build on the high standards of Science and Mathematics education in our schools, which exceed those in most other countries. It gives our universities a starting advantage in science and engineering-related education and research especially.&nbsp; We have seen increased collaboration between world-class universities and our local universities in these fields, in the form of research and academic exchange programmes, as well as the establishment of joint programmes for students.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Towards Greater Autonomy and Accountability for Universities</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the&nbsp;next leap in quality, our universities need to be dynamic and forward-looking institutions.&nbsp; They have to attract and retain first-rate faculty. They have to review their teaching and assessment methods so as to groom graduates with&nbsp;a willingness to think originally.&nbsp; And besides producing graduates of the right quality, the universities have to play a growing role in building Singapore's research capabilities, as Dr Gan See Khem has just spoken on.&nbsp; Our universities will be key players in generating the ferment and advances in research and innovation that will take Singapore up the value chain, and establish us as a leading hub in the knowledge-based world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting these two objectives -&nbsp;of producing thinking and enterprising graduates and developing a vibrant and self-sustaining tradition of research -&nbsp;will be the major challenges for our universities in the decade ahead.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The university landscape itself will become more competitive, as we allow private universities in and as we restructure our publicly-funded universities.&nbsp; Globally, our universities also face <p align=left>Column: 2421<p>more competition, including more competition for the Singapore students.&nbsp; Competition will provide the spur for them to achieve the quality they need in the next phase of development.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, competition will have a positive impact only if our universities have the institutional autonomy to respond to the new opportunities and challenges. They must have both the room and the appetite to differentiate themselves,&nbsp;play on their respective strengths, and respond to changes in the demands of the marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next few years, we will re-examine the relationship between Government and the universities to see how we can provide the universities with greater institutional autonomy in future.&nbsp; It will be a broad-ranging review.&nbsp; The issues we have to consider include the scope of autonomy and the universities' sourcing and use of funds, how they charge fees, how they select students, how they compete for research funds on a competitive basis, and how they remain accountable as publicly-funded universities.&nbsp; These areas will build on changes already in place following a review four years ago of university governance and funding which led to NUS and NTU being given a greater degree of autonomy in various operational areas.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater autonomy must also mean greater accountability on the part of the&nbsp;universities, as Dr Wang and Dr Amy Khor have rightly pointed out.&nbsp; As Dr Khor also highlighted, the universities must deliver the best value-for-money from the substantial public funds given to them.&nbsp; Without clear processes for accountability, increased autonomy is unlikely to yield positive results.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why MOE initiated a Quality Assurance Framework for Universities (QAFU) to provide for continuous assessment of the quality of the<p align=left>Column: 2422<p> institutions and their leadership.&nbsp; As part of this framework, we appointed an external review panel last year, chaired by Dr Jennifer Lee. This panel will conduct an independent, external validation of each university's self-assessment once in three years.&nbsp; It will report its findings and recommendations to the Minister.&nbsp;Amongst other things, the panel will identify and highlight the strengths and areas for improvements of the universities. The first validation exercise will be conducted in NUS in the second half of this year.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will monitor the universities' follow-up on the panel's recommendations.&nbsp; It is also in the interest of the universities themselves to take this external quality assurance process seriously, so as to improve quality and ensure they retain their credibility and public confidence as they move towards autonomy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS and NTU have also adjusted their internal governance structures to strengthen their processes of accountability internally, as they give faculties more room and more operating flexibility. Both universities have made comprehensive changes to the structure of their respective Councils, to better allow the Councils to shoulder a greater role in providing strategic directions and guiding the development of their respective universities. For example, both NUS and NTU have put in place a dedicated Audit Committee and an Establishment Committee at the Council level, to ensure proper financial practices and rigorous academic appointment processes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater autonomy will also mean greater responsibilities for the university councils and leadership themselves.&nbsp; We have taken great care in identifying and selecting university Council members.&nbsp; We have been very fortunate to have passionate and capable Council chairmen and members serving on our three<p align=left>Column: 2423<p> university Councils. These are individuals who carry heavy responsibilities&nbsp;in their own business lives, but have been willing to give valuable time and energy to the running of the universities.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Dr Wang for his suggestion that GPC Members should visit our universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the universities themselves will welcome this, as it allows the GPC to familiarise itself with the challenges they face as well as their achievements to-date. We will work with the universities to organise this.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>University Admission</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned yesterday, the Government has accepted the recommendations of the University Admissions Committee (UAC), chaired by Prof. Chong Chi Tat, to allow greater flexibility for the universities and their faculties to decide on admission criteria for their students.&nbsp; The UAC's recommendations represent the first major step in the direction of autonomy in admissions.&nbsp; I thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Dr Lily Neo, Mrs Fang Ai Lian and several others, including Mdm Halimah, who have supported the changes in admission requirements.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flexibility given to the universities to admit 10% of their respective intakes on&nbsp;independent criteria, and the introduction of faculty scores in addition to the common university scores, are important changes for both the universities and the education system as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;They represent&nbsp;a shift from a \"one-size-fits-all\" measure of aptitude and suitability for university education, towards broader and more flexible measures on merit.&nbsp; I spoke yesterday of the rationale for the similar enhancements that we are making in the school system. The changes in admission practices also mark, as I just mentioned, an important<p align=left>Column: 2424<p> step in the longer term process of creating greater autonomy, greater room for universities to do what is best to develop excellence.&nbsp; For NUS and NTU to go forward in a more competitive university environment locally, regionally and globally, it is essential that they be able to select the best students.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran is quite right that the decision-making on university admissions has to be decentralised.&nbsp; This is, in fact, what the UAC's recommendations have allowed for.&nbsp; He mentioned medicine.&nbsp; In fact, the medical faculty is a good example of a faculty that is making the most of the extra room that is now provided for faculty decision-making in the new admission process.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way we are moving is the way in which the best universities internationally select their students. And it would mean moving away from&nbsp;a single definition of merit towards more variegated definitions of merit.&nbsp; It would lead to an initial uneasiness because not everyone is going to know on exactly&nbsp;what basis they are getting into the university, but it is a move that we have to take and which students will realise&nbsp;is in their best interest.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you an example of why a move away from a single definition of merit towards more variegated definitions is not a move away from merit, but&nbsp;a move towards merit.&nbsp; It is not a move that lessens the meritocratic nature of the system, but a move that reinforces the meritocratic nature of the system.&nbsp; I will give you the example of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, which has a very strong reputation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Brown, the Provost of MIT, was explaining their admission system to me. They get 12,000 applications each year - all very good students.&nbsp; Their first step is to shortlist from 12,000 down to 6,000.&nbsp;So they look at school examination results, because they do not have national<p align=left>Column: 2425<p> examinations in the States.&nbsp; They look at their school&nbsp;test scores,&nbsp;they look at their advance placement tests, they look at the SAT I tests, and sometimes SAT II.&nbsp; They look at all the observable grades, the sort of thing that&nbsp;we have been doing. That brings it down from 12,000 to 6,000.&nbsp; Then they have to take it from 6,000 down to 1,500.&nbsp; They do not look at the grades anymore. They look at the whole range of other achievements of a student, not just non-academic achievements, but even intellectual achievements, in other words not just&nbsp;climbing a mountain or canoeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;They read carefully the testimonials of the principals. They find out what the student has done that is more than regular.&nbsp; What research and&nbsp;special projects he has done.&nbsp; Whether he shows&nbsp;the intellectual spark that they want in the school.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rigorous process, not precise but rigorous; not single-definition, but meritocratic.&nbsp; That is how one university does it and there are many others that follow an essentially similar&nbsp;process.&nbsp;I asked Bob Brown why they did not look at the differentiation in SAT scores, for instance, to bring&nbsp;the numbers down from 6,000&nbsp;to 1,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave me a simple answer.&nbsp; He said that&nbsp;the difference between a SAT score of 1,500 and&nbsp;1,600 is only two wrong answers.&nbsp; That is why they do not use SAT score to bring it down from 6,000 to 1,500 students.&nbsp; Because two wrong answers is not the way in which we identify the best student.&nbsp;I agree that as we&nbsp;liberalise,&nbsp;it will be a more complex environment for students to navigate, but it is an environment for the better.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to assure all Members who have spoken on this topic that meritocracy will remain a key principle for the selection of students in our publicly-funded universities.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese are moving the same way incidentally.&nbsp; The top Chinese <p align=left>Column: 2426<p>universities have, in fact, earlier than us, opened up to 5% of their students being taken in on independent criteria.&nbsp;The Chinese have a thoroughly meritocratic system, with national examinations at all levels,&nbsp;transparent and meritocratic.&nbsp; But they decided earlier than us that their top universities have to start taking students who are more than regular.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universities will be accountable to the Ministry in ensuring that meritocracy is preserved in their respective admission processes.&nbsp; However, I would not preclude MOE&nbsp;initiating occasional independent audits of the universities' admission systems.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had explained at some length yesterday the reasons why the Government accepted the recommendations of the University Admissions Committee to modify the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) requirements in the universities, essentially to do away with mandating that every student has to count his mother tongue score as part of his university admission score.&nbsp; I have also explained that students continue to have a choice of submitting their mother tongue score.&nbsp; If they&nbsp;have done well in mother tongue as an AO level subject,&nbsp;they can include it so as to boost&nbsp;their scores.&nbsp; If they have done well in Mother Tongue or Higher Mother Tongue as a full \"A\" level subject,&nbsp;they can also include it as one&nbsp;of their three \"A\" level subjects in their&nbsp;scores.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">1.45 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang raised some broader issues, some of which I have touched on yesterday, and I&nbsp;do not want to go over the same&nbsp;ground again.&nbsp; I have explained how we need a balance of strategies for mother tongue learning,&nbsp;and&nbsp;this balance has to be different for the school system compared to the tertiary system.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2427<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not repeat those points.&nbsp; But it is entirely for the universities or faculties within the universities to decide if they think the mother tongue is important. The autonomy has been provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculties' own scores are there.&nbsp; If there is any faculty that wants a particular department to assign importance to mother tongue, they will and, indeed, some faculties are going to do so,&nbsp;eg,&nbsp;Communication Studies at NTU; obviously, Chinese Studies.&nbsp; It has to be based on sound education precepts and on wanting to make sure you are taking in the best students for that course.&nbsp; That process is also in place within the 10% autonomy that we provide the university, as a whole, to select its own students.&nbsp; It is for them to decide whether to take&nbsp;into consideration&nbsp;a student who is outstanding in mother tongue.&nbsp; That is the direction we have to move in.&nbsp; We have fundamentally decided not to mandate that NUS and NTU include the mother tongue as part of a fixed criteria, but to provide them the choice to do so where it is relevant.&nbsp; And we have ensured that students who have done well in mother tongue will not lose out because they can continue to count it in their scores.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low also raised a broader issue of whether the Government is doing this for political reasons, as he put it, because we do not want to pay the political cost of defending Chinese education.&nbsp; I am sorry if I misheard some of the words, but that is the way I got it.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had explained yesterday that we have to do what is best for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and ensure that what we do in education is based on sound educational precepts.&nbsp; We are not going to start deciding on educational policies&nbsp; -&nbsp; mother tongue or anything else -&nbsp; on the basis of weighing one political constituency and another.&nbsp; We only have to look at what is happening in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region> to know how <p align=left>Column: 2428<p>dangerous that road is, and how dangerous it is to even get into this debate.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, they have now decided that English cannot be taught in kindergarten.&nbsp; Of course, the parents want it.&nbsp; But it is a political decision&nbsp;- no English any more in the kindergarten.&nbsp; And you know the debate that is taking place on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">minan hua.</i>&nbsp; Let us not get into&nbsp;having to defend and take positions based on expediency.&nbsp; Let us be honest about our problems, honest about the challenges the universities face, honest about what the majority of Singaporeans need if they move into the tertiary level and face choices within <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and globally&nbsp;of which university to go to.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low also asked why General Paper (GP) should remain a requirement for university admission.&nbsp; General Paper&nbsp;is not an English language paper as such&nbsp; -&nbsp; I should clarify that for a start.&nbsp; It seeks to develop students' logical reasoning and analytical skills.&nbsp; It requires students to read more widely and take an active interest in current affairs.&nbsp; These remain important attributes for university education.&nbsp; And it is for NUS and NTU, or the other universities, to decide if GP would remain relevant in future.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">University Funding</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have raised concerns and views over the question of university fees, particularly the potential increase in university fees over the long term. This issue was discussed during the debate on the Government Budget last week.&nbsp; Let me explain from the perspective of the Education budget why we have to address this issue, and not duck it.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, universities are having to raise tuition fees to meet rising costs and declining availability of state and federal government funding. Even after&nbsp;the<p align=left>Column: 2429<p> debate recently in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>, some of their top universities are already saying that the increase in fees, that was finally allowed for in Parliament, is not going to be sufficient for them to continue status quo with regard to which students they take in.&nbsp; &nbsp; <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Oxford</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> has announced that it is going to take in more foreign students now, and less <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> students, because it loses too much money educating each British student.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> has just cut its university budget by 10%, again because they face a tightly constrained&nbsp; government budget situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, we are not in dire fiscal straits in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; MOE does not expect to have its budget to be reduced by MOF over the medium or long term.&nbsp; And we do not expect to cut what we spend on the universities today in absolute terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the status quo formula for MOE subsidies&nbsp;for university education will mean that university spending will continue to increase rapidly in coming years, as more Singaporeans are admitted into our universities, and as the quality of university education goes up.&nbsp; From 1998 to 2002, total expenditure on the universities grew by 41%, mainly because of larger student enrolments.&nbsp; By 2010, when our university cohort participation rate reaches 25%, the university enrolment would have increased by more than 15,000 students.&nbsp; This would require $350 million more in recurrent funding alone&nbsp; -&nbsp; not including the development cost&nbsp; - &nbsp; an increase of 42%,&nbsp; and not $25 million as suggested by Mr Steve Chia.&nbsp; We must not forget that for every one student that the university admits, the Government would have to subsidise him for&nbsp;three to four&nbsp;years, not just one year.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE receives a budget of 4% of GDP.&nbsp; Just as Mr Khaw Boon Wan says for Health, I will fight for every additional cent for Education.&nbsp; But I cannot assume<p align=left>Column: 2430<p> that the Government will have additional money to be dispensed.&nbsp; The basic issue that MOE faces therefore is how to allocate a budget of 4% of GDP at a time when we are opening up university places for more students.&nbsp; Do we accept a continued increase in the share of the education budget going to university education, and a corresponding cut in the share of spending elsewhere - in our schools, ITEs and polytechnics?&nbsp; It is neither feasible nor desirable to allow this to happen.&nbsp; Spending on these other sectors in basic, secondary and post-secondary education cannot be reduced in the coming years, as we strive for improvements in the quality of education across the entire spectrum of our student population.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current co-funding formula is for undergraduates to pay 25% of the operating cost of their university education while the Government pays the remaining 75%.&nbsp; Only 25% of recurrent cost is borne by the undergraduates.&nbsp; University students enjoy a much higher dollar subsidy from Government than other students.&nbsp; Last year, the average subsidy per year which a university undergraduate received was double that of a polytechnic or ITE student; 3\u00bd times that of a secondary school student, and five times that of a primary school student.&nbsp; Add to this is the fact that a university student is subsidised for more years of education, from the time he enters Primary 1, compared to students in our polytechnics and ITEs.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the cost of providing students with post-secondary education from after the secondary stage.&nbsp; So, for a university student, it is JC plus university education.&nbsp; For an ITE student, it is two years of ITE education.&nbsp; For a polytechnic student, it is three years of polytechnic education. The Government, on present subsidy rates, subsidises a university student over six years of post-secondary education, five times more than an ITE student who receives two years of an ITE subsidy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2431<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should therefore review if undergraduates should pay a higher share of the cost of university education, as Dr Gan See Khem has argued.&nbsp; They are subsidised much more heavily than other students in the education system.&nbsp; They also stand to benefit the most by commanding a higher salary when they join the workforce, and that remains true, even accepting Mr Gan Kim Yong's point that they add value to the economy.&nbsp; But if we compare what a university student earns over his lifetime compared to what a polytechnic or ITE student earns, and if we compare what subsidies we are providing them, we have to come away with the feeling that there is some disjunct.&nbsp; We have to review this.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we open our universities for more Singaporeans to go through university education, the total share of the education budget will go up, crowding out our spending on other students in the system.&nbsp; MOE will therefore review the cost sharing formula in the universities, and study carefully the proportion to be borne by the undergraduates.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also see how the universities can best distinguish between the costs of teaching and research programmes.&nbsp; We should decide on a fair share of the teaching costs that should be borne by students.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for example, universities' activities in teaching and research attract different streams of funding.&nbsp; Teaching is funded primarily by tuition fees and government grants.&nbsp; Research costs, such as infrastructure including depreciation charges, direct and indirect costs, are recovered on a project basis from research sponsors.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested raising taxes to subsidise university education.&nbsp; This is a MOF matter.&nbsp; But I am not sure that doing so will be equitable, because not all taxpayers are graduates, and there<p align=left>Column: 2432<p> is no reason why all taxpayers should subsidise graduates.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Financial Assistance</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will ensure that no deserving student is denied a university education on grounds of financial difficulties.&nbsp; Admission will be needs-blind.&nbsp; If a student can get in on his merits, we will want to make sure he is not deterred from accepting the place for financial reasons.&nbsp; We are well aware of the median salary in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; We are well aware of the needs of poor students, and we want to make sure that they get financial assistance in the form of bursaries and also other means.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also aware of the needs of the middle class, and we want to ensure that the middle class does not feel squeezed out of a university education.&nbsp; So, we will study all possible financial schemes to ensure that access to university education is open to all.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to consider seriously the matter of loans.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a loan to pay for an undergraduate education is a common phenomenon in countries like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, almost half of their full-time undergraduates take up loans to pay for part or all of university education.&nbsp; We will not want loan schemes to be onerous on young graduates.&nbsp; They will not be a burden.&nbsp; They will not deter graduates who marry from wanting to procreate.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also study the \"graduate tax\" idea, which was mentioned by Mr Iswaran during the Budget debate, and I believe by Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp; There are many variants of this internationally.&nbsp; There are some schemes in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for instance, which are essentially loan schemes which are&nbsp;operating through the tax system.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will study all the possibilities carefully.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Khor has rightly pointed out, part-time work is another way students <p align=left>Column: 2433<p>can help pay for at least part of their education.&nbsp; All three universities have established schemes for students to work in the schools or offices on campus to earn money to meet their expenses in the university.&nbsp; For example, NTU has a scheme where students are recruited as student assistants, and paid to carry out routine duties, while SMU has a work-study grant scheme.&nbsp; But we can do more in this area.&nbsp; Part-time work is far more common amongst university students abroad, both within and outside the campuses, than in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; In fact, I myself earned a handsome stipend washing dishes in a restaurant when I was doing my undergraduate education in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Endowments and Donations</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philanthropy is another source of income for the universities.&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, donations from individuals and private organisations have helped many universities build up substantial endowments as a major funding source.&nbsp; Dr Khor pointed out that it would be more difficult to raise funds here, and Dr Gan See Khem also addressed this issue.&nbsp; There is a point there.&nbsp; The culture of philanthropy in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is not as developed as in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; But it is not negligible.&nbsp; Just last month, NTU received a benefaction of $5 million from Mr Ng Bok <st1:country-region><st1:place>Eng.</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp; Our universities are seeking to develop this tradition.&nbsp; They will have to do more to engage private donors, as Dr Gan See Khem has pointed out, especially the alumni who have benefited from their university education and have become successful in life.&nbsp; The Government,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Dr Khor asked how do we ensure the universities correctly anticipate manpower<p align=left>Column: 2434<p> requirements.&nbsp; Our universities are guided each year by a national manpower-planning framework on the number of graduates required in various broad categories.&nbsp; This framework, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Manpower, draws inputs from various Ministries and industries.&nbsp; At the same time, the universities themselves have developed their own links with industry partners, for instance, through the faculty advisory committees.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, the universities, and indeed students themselves, will need to be alert to developments and long-term trends in industries, so as to decide on the breadth and depth of skills that will be in demand.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> I am sorry if I did not answer the question on transparency adequately.&nbsp; Let me first say that it will be quite essential for NUS and NTU to ensure transparency in the criteria that they will employ, both for the universities as a whole as well as individual faculties.&nbsp; These criteria&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be made quite transparent.&nbsp; The processes which they will take to select students will&nbsp;also be processes that have to be subjected to internal accountability and occasional external audit.&nbsp; That is what we will do.&nbsp; They will not be transparent on the question of why student A got in and student B did not get in.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system cannot tell our&nbsp;students exactly why they did or did not get in.&nbsp; The best universities in the world tell their applicants, \"You give me all the information about yourself and I will decide.\"&nbsp; And they have been able to maintain public confidence and credibility because they have made good decisions over time.&nbsp; So, transparency in criteria and processes will be there.&nbsp; But we have to get used to the fact that if we move away from a single definition merit system towards a broader&nbsp;definition merit system, students will sometimes have to ask themselves, \"Well, I am not quite sure why I got in, or why I didn't get in.\"&nbsp; That is the norm in all good universities internationally.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On GP in Chinese, this is an educational issue.&nbsp; I would not view it as a political issue.&nbsp; The universities will have<p align=left>Column: 2437<p> to decide for themselves whether they think that is a valuable subject and whether, in fact, selecting students on that basis will be relevant to certain faculties or departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can imagine that there will be some departments that might be interested in it.&nbsp; But we have to make sure that there is demand for such a subject.&nbsp; Are there students who are keen to take GP in Chinese, and will the universities, based on their assessment of the type of graduates they want to produce, say that&nbsp;this is a useful subject that they want to take into account?&nbsp; So, I will keep this as an issue, amongst many others, that we have to keep looking at from time to time.&nbsp; I mentioned yesterday, for instance, the possibility of a new elective in the JC curriculum on <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> studies.&nbsp; That will&nbsp;also be something we have to study carefully.&nbsp; We have to make sure that there is a demand for that subject and the universities will have to decide whether they recognise it.&nbsp; My sense is that they probably will, for all the reasons that the Members have talked about.&nbsp; Knowledge of contemporary <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is going to be a very useful piece of the package.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Compared to the strength in the other units, it seems to suggest that MOE does not place much emphasis on pre-school education.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have about 80,000 pre-schoolers in all our pre-school institutions.&nbsp; The Ministry should monitor more closely all our pre-school programmes and provide more professional support for pre-school education, ie, the three years our children spend in nursery, kindergarten 1 and 2.&nbsp; Now, almost all their parents are placing their children in pre-school institutions when their children reach four years old.&nbsp; The pre-school education is as criticial as any other stage of the formal education.&nbsp; It will be quite a waste if our education system does not place greater emphasis at this stage to maximise the child's learning capability and potential, especially in terms of learning of English and mother tongue.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of the pre-school curriculum should also be the teaching of English and the mother tongue.&nbsp; I observe that many pre-schools appear to duplicate the assessment method and what is being taught at Primary 1.&nbsp; This is unnecessary.&nbsp; Ideally, the child should&nbsp;not be forced to focus his learning on technical aspects of the language, such as grammar and spelling.&nbsp; The learning objectives should focus on basic listening, speaking and reading skills.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While this was once the privilege of a few who could afford it, today, it is made accessible to almost everyone.&nbsp; While the <p align=left>Column: 2439<p>debate on the best teaching methods of pre-school continues, I am sure we unanimously agree that education in the initial years are indeed vital.&nbsp; This then begs the question:&nbsp;what should be the role of the Ministry of Education?&nbsp; What are its immediate plans for pre-school education?<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, I feel that the Ministry could do a lot more to ensure that the schools do carry out their responsibilities expected of them and deliver quality pre-school education.&nbsp; The students are very young and they go through this cycle of their life but only once.&nbsp; If they are not given the correct education and imbued with right values, they will grow up taking a very different road from the rest.&nbsp; I feel that the Ministry of Education should pay more attention to the running of these pre-schools and audit them regularly to ensure that the best practices are adopted by them.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What is MOE's vision for pre-schools?&nbsp; And lastly, because of their importance, will MOE play a more important and direct role in the pre-school education arena instead of leaving it to the private sector?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2440<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Ministry if they would consider extending this LSP scheme to children who have missed pre-school.&nbsp; These children can be identified in&nbsp;July of the previous year when they come in for Primary 1 registration.&nbsp;

The Ministry's recent effort to step up training of teachers to teach these autistic children is also commendable.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2441<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the opening of the new special school for autistic children is welcome, there still remains a significant waiting list of children and the number of autistic children is also increasing due to greater awareness of the problem.&nbsp; Another concern is that whilst our mainstream primary and secondary schools have been undergoing upgrading and rebuilding programmes to the extent that some have been criticised to be too posh, most of&nbsp;the special schools are housed in buildings which are at least 20 years old, such as Chao Yang, Jervois and <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Katong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Special</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Schools</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most of these buildings are really functionally obsolete, especially when they are to cater to children with disabilities, such as the hearing and visually-impaired since they were not built in the first place to cater to the needs of these children.&nbsp; This, together with the fact that special schools are run by VWOs and not directly under the purview of MOE, gives the impression that the needs of such special needs children rank very low on MOE's list of priorities.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are currently only 20 SPED schools run by VWOs, with none in the north and northeast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

With fewer teachers to do more work, they will burn out, unless their ranks swell significantly and quickly.&nbsp; Would the Minister comment on his Ministry's efforts to curb this trend?&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE needs to take the lead in addressing the attrition of teachers from special schools.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Sir, I share the concerns of the speakers before me.&nbsp; The Special Education Schools (SPED) are in a state of need where teachers are concerned.&nbsp; Here are some of their problems.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear that there are about 100 vacancies in the 20 SPED schools currently.&nbsp; The teacher-to-pupil ratio, as already mentioned by hon. Member&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Ong Seh Hong, is between 1:10 and 1:12.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The attrition rate is roughly around 10%.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; It is difficult to recruit new teachers, and upgrading takes time as most of them are already so stretched and the courses are on a part-time basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; The Ministry's support of giving 2.5 times more in financial support is stretched universally across all disabilities.&nbsp; Certain children are multiple disabled.&nbsp; Teachers need greater training to deal with such children.&nbsp; Yet, it is&nbsp;2.5-times the cost&nbsp;factor across all SPED schools for whoever the teacher, whatever the child's capabilities.&nbsp; It is my hope that the<p align=left>Column: 2444<p> Ministry of Education - and I know this is not new, we have spoken about this a few times here in Parliament - would take under its wings the SPED schools, the teachers especially, ie, the pedagogical aspect, looking after the training, curriculum, career prospects, salaries, so that our children will have better attention.&nbsp; The current situation of VWOs employing untrained personnel to look after the pupils is, I think, totally unacceptable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Compulsory Education</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of the most vulnerable groups among persons with disabilities are our children.&nbsp; They are more vulnerable and they rely on adults for the enforcement of their human rights mechanisms.&nbsp; The Convention for the Rights of the Child (CRC) is the most complete statement of children's rights, and it is the first to give these rights the force of international law.&nbsp; It is an international treaty which recognises the rights of disabled children.&nbsp; The most important article for the protection of disabled children is in Article 23(1) which states that:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"States, parties, recognise that the mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life in conditions which ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate the child's active participation in the community.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have passed the Compulsory Education Act and we have also left out children with special needs.&nbsp; This is not acceptable.&nbsp; It is my hope that the Ministry will review this policy, as it reviews all other policies, to make sure that our children with special needs come on board.&nbsp; In case that is still in the pipeline, I would then like to appeal strongly to the Ministry of Education to ensure that all special education schools are co-located with mainstream schools.&nbsp; This gives rise to a lot of economies of scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2445<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, sharing of resources, as the LSP pool of teachers can also double up in the special education schools and vice-versa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, common curriculum, such as PE and art and craft classes, can be shared across the board, depending on the kind of flexibility needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it is cheaper to build schools together so that they can share common facilities, such as school fields, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, and the most important, emotional bonding, recognition of each other, that our society grows knowing that we live with people with disabilities and giving them due recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If hospitals - we are learning a lot from the Ministry of Health here - can be co-located with step-down facilities, I do not see a problem in mainstream schools being co-located with SPED schools, ie, that all schools are co-located.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I think it is about time that we gave our children with special needs the due recognition that they deserve.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I hope that there will come one day when our students will find going to school a joy rather than a dreadful chore. &nbsp; Just now, it was said that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) had set the limit that a worker can work in a day, maybe eight hours a day. Perhaps, we should also look at whether we could set a limit on how many hours should we subject our students to the classroom.&nbsp; Our school children should have the \"right to play\"!&nbsp;</p><p style=\"TEXT-INDENT: 36pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we talk about pro-family or pro-children education, we have to take a holistic approach to include moral education, knowledge, physical education, social ethics, and aesthetics.&nbsp; I think the&nbsp;Sports School&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Arts School&nbsp;are good things to have.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I would like to talk about family education and life education.&nbsp; Just now, the Minister for Education spoke about sexuality education.&nbsp; I think the sexuality education should be taught from the pathology,&nbsp;physiology and&nbsp;psychology aspects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also teach our students on how to respect their parents and also to love others. We want to cultivate not only&nbsp; professional teachers, lawyers or doctors, but only good and useful citizens of&nbsp; Singapore.&nbsp; Our students should be taught how to behave themselves at home, in society, and even when they are overseas.&nbsp; Emphasis must be given to the inculcation of the right values and moral standards. When the children are young, we caution them against falling in love too early, lest it affects their studies. When they are more mature, we worry about their love affairs and whether they could get the right life partner. Then, we worry about their marriage, their children and so on. There is no end to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me speak about the working environment of our teachers.&nbsp; Most of our <p align=left>Column: 2447<p>school teachers are ladies. Have we looked into how we can create an environment for them to start their families? &nbsp; Yesterday, two Members lost their voices and could not speak out in Parliament. I think many teachers also lose their voices because they have to talk a lot in class. &nbsp; Do we have some latest technology to help them overcome this problem, so that&nbsp;teaching could be a joy?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</B> Sir,&nbsp;a few Members have rightly pointed out the importance of the pre-school education sector.&nbsp; I appreciate in particular Mr Zainudin Nordin's and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's reminders that as we undertake changes at various levels of the education system, we must not forget the pre-school education sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that the pre-school years are a valuable opportunity to facilitate the development of a child socially, morally, cognitively, emotionally and physically.&nbsp; MOE has developed a pre-school curriculum framework,&nbsp;launched in January 2003, that emphasises a holistic approach and an enhanced quality of interaction.&nbsp; This framework outlines principles that will guide educators in designing their pre-school programmes.&nbsp; It is broad enough to accommodate the range of philosophies found in different pre-school programmes, yet it provides concrete examples of how these principles can be put into practice.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curriculum framework also describes the Desired Outcomes of Pre-School Education, which were first articulated in 2000.&nbsp; In a nutshell, this refers to the holistic development of every child.&nbsp; While literacy and numeracy skills are important and should not be overlooked, school-readiness must surely also include a love for learning and discovery, curiosity about how the world works, and the ability to communicate and interact well with others.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2448<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that we give our pre-school educators space to tailor their programmes, whether it is the content or the balance between open-ended play and more structured learning. &nbsp;Preserving the range of programmes offered by various community and private organisations is therefore appropriate, as there is just no single model for developing children at an early age.&nbsp; The strength of our pre-school curriculum thus lies in the diversity and breadth that parents can&nbsp;choose from.&nbsp; For this reason, MOE will not take over the pre-school sector.&nbsp; The provision of pre-school education will remain firmly with the various private sector and&nbsp;community organisations.&nbsp; MOE will concentrate on high leverage areas, such as defining outcomes, designing a curriculum framework, improving teacher quality, and conducting research.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's suggestion on how to do additional professional support is also an area that we can look into.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curriculum framework that I described earlier was launched in January 2003. &nbsp; Since its launch, MOE has facilitated by offering training workshops to all interested pre-school teachers of registered kindergartens.&nbsp; MOE has been able to meet all requests for training so far, through a total of 62 workshops.&nbsp; These workshops cover various topics in the curriculum</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>framework, such as how to plan an integrated and holistic curriculum and suggested teaching strategies.&nbsp; Through briefings and sharing sessions, MOE has also worked to empower pre-school leaders to guide their teachers in designing and monitoring their own progress.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">2.30 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help kindergartens monitor their continuous self-improvement, MOE has developed a self-appraisal instrument <p align=left>Column: 2449<p>called Pursuing Excellence at Kindergartens (PEAK).&nbsp; This tool guides kindergartens in evaluating their curriculum plans, resource management and learning environment.&nbsp; Since its launch in October 2003, about half of our kindergartens,&nbsp;241 of them, have found this tool to be useful.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin asked about resources for pre-school education.&nbsp; A key leverage in raising the quality of pre-school education is teacher training.&nbsp; This is where MOE dedicates continuous efforts to help prepare the pre-school teachers with the skills and knowledge to effectively deliver the pre-school curriculum.&nbsp; Our provisions today, we believe, are adequate and well-placed.&nbsp; MOE has articulated also academic and professional qualifications that pre-school teachers must have. Kindergartens are making good progress in this area.&nbsp; By the end of this year, about 84 of pre-school teachers in MOE-registered kindergartens would have received their certificate or diploma in pre-school training.&nbsp; By 2008, we expect one in four teachers should have obtained their Diploma, in Pre-school Education (Teaching). &nbsp;MOE does provide grants to eligible non-profit kindergartens that meet the professional requirements set by MOE.&nbsp; In addition, all these training courses are supported by Skills Development Fund up to 80%.&nbsp; As of February 2004, the pre-school teacher accreditation committee, set up by MOE and MCDS has also accredited 86 pre-school teacher training courses for 24 agencies, and this includes NIE as well as Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on research.&nbsp; To guide MOE in policy planning and to help determine where and how our resources are best invested in&nbsp;the pre-school sector, MOE has undertaken a pilot research project to understand the impact of the new curriculum on pupils learning and development.&nbsp; Findings from the first phase&nbsp;of the study indicated that the new curriculum, with its focus on interactivity,<p align=left>Column: 2450<p> experimentation and discovery, provided richer learning environment that particularly benefited pupils from low social education status and non English-speaking backgrounds.&nbsp; MOE expects to complete the second phase of this study by the end of 2006.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema asked about&nbsp;pre-school class size,&nbsp;the need to identify children with no pre-primary education and how to help them in Primary 1.&nbsp; To address the question of pre-school class size, the kindergarten manual, that MOE distributed to all registered kindergartens, recommends one teacher and one teacher aid to 15 pupils at the nursery level, one teacher to 20/25 pupils at K1 and K2 level respectively.&nbsp; On identifying children with no pre-primary education and help them at Primary 1, it is to be expected that our children enter Primary 1 at differing levels of development. Such differences are the result of many factors, including differing attitudes and abilities, as well as varying home backgrounds.&nbsp; Rather than using pre-school education as a criterion, our schools screen all incoming Primary 1 children to identify those who are weak in language and literacy skills. These children are provided additional support&nbsp;in Primary 1 and 2 through the Learning Support Programme (LSP) for English.&nbsp; Often, these are students who start P1 with limited reading skills, equivalent to children of less than five years of age.&nbsp; According to the needs of the school, MOE provides schools with one or two additional dedicated posts for learning support coordinators.&nbsp; In other words, these are additional posts to run the programme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students in LSP are pulled out of class for half an hour each day and learn in small groups of 8-10.&nbsp; They rejoin regular classes when they have made adequate progress.&nbsp; Each year, 12-14% of Primary 1 and 2 children enter the LSP.&nbsp; At the end of P1, about 60% have made enough progress to rejoin regular classes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor has asked about the level of resources and facilities that MOE <p align=left>Column: 2451<p>provides to Special Schools, or SPED schools.&nbsp; This is where the \"Many Helping Hands\" approach, a key recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Disabled in 1988, remains sound and relevant.&nbsp; Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) have a strong sense of mission, and are able to respond quickly to new needs and demands. They also have their networks to seek community support.&nbsp; The passion and commitment shown by parents, volunteers and VWOs are also strengths that should be preserved.&nbsp; If the Ministry were to take over everything, all these will be lost.&nbsp; To address Dr Ong's suggestion on who should take the lead in special education, the tripartite partnership of Government, family and community remains complementary and effective in meeting the needs of our special needs children.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the National Council of Social Services (NCSS), MOE assists VWOs in setting up SPED schools.&nbsp; Today, there are 20 SPED schools, which provide education for about 4,400 pupils with special needs, more than a two-fold increase from 11 in 1989.&nbsp; The newest SPED School, which is Pathlight School, opened in January 2004, and this caters to the wait list of children with severe autism.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE assists VWOs in acquiring suitable sites for development.&nbsp; To address Ms Braema's point on co-location of SPED schools with normal schools, it is the VWOs that ultimately decide on the location of their schools based on factors such as accessibility by public transport and the geographical distribution of their students.&nbsp; If they are really interested in co-relocating with some of our normal schools, we can look into their request if they&nbsp;were to put it forward.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is also working towards housing all our SPED schools in permanent<p align=left>Column: 2452<p> purpose-built buildings.&nbsp; We have completed the redevelopment of five of our 20 SPED schools, and have plans to redevelop 13 more. MOE covers 90% of the construction cost of purpose-built SPED school buildings, as well as five-year refurbishment and repair works for existing buildings.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through MOE and NCSS, SPED schools receive up to four times, not 2.5 times, the funding of a pupil in a mainstream primary school, with MOE funding the per capita cost of mainstream primary education plus 50% of the additional cost up to a cap of 2.5 times for primary education.&nbsp; The other 1.5 times comes from NCSS.&nbsp; This followed from a 1997 revision to the equal cost-sharing principle between MOE and NCSS.&nbsp; SPED pupils also receive a yearly Edusave contribution of $160, like their counterparts in primary school.&nbsp; Each SPED school receives an annual Edusave grant for enrichment programmes and purchase of equipment and resource materials. Granted that some Members might feel that this is not enough, but compared to 10 years ago, we have already given much more.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on teacher resources. Ms Braema&nbsp;has commented that there is a high teacher attrition rate at SPED schools, and asked what MOE is doing to increase retention.&nbsp; First of all, these staff come under the purview of NCSS, not MOE.&nbsp; MOE assists by providing opportunities for SPED school teachers to acquire skills, knowledge, and networking that will give them a sense of confidence as educators of children with special needs.&nbsp; NIE provides both Certificate and Diploma level training to teachers at SPED schools.&nbsp; SPED schools are also invited to participate in MOE's Annual Posting Exercise should they require MOE seconded teachers.&nbsp; There are currently 18 MOE seconded teachers teaching in SPED schools.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2453<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a question on the possibility of integrating special schools with mainstream schools.&nbsp; On this issue, I think our starting point must be to see how we can work together to ensure that our children with special needs have access to the opportunities they need to participate fully in the economy and the society.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pupils with learning or physical disabilities, and who are able to follow the mainstream curriculum, are provided places in mainstream schools. In certain designated schools, special facilities and additional resources are provided to these pupils to facilitate their learning.&nbsp; Advances in assistive technologies have made it possible, for example, for more of visual impaired students to access Braille notebooks, talking dictionaries and specialised software. Currently, there are 460 pupils with hearing impairment and 52 with visual impairment in our mainstream schools.&nbsp; If possible, we will see how we can increase that further.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children with disabilities who do not attend mainstream schools are better served in our 20 SPED schools, with specially trained teachers supported by para-medical personnel. At all these SPED schools, these children can learn at their own pace through a curriculum and environment specially tailored to their needs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema also pointed out that children at SPED schools are not included under compulsory education.&nbsp; Compulsory education currently is defined as education in our national schools.&nbsp; In reaching this conclusion, the Compulsory Education Committee&nbsp; recognised that if compulsory education were to include education in SPED schools, the enforcement of compulsory education may be unduly harsh on some of the parents of such children.&nbsp; The Committee identified that the central issue here was whether children with special needs are<p align=left>Column: 2454<p> being adequately supported with education opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Committee examined the existing measures to support special education, many of which I have just described earlier, and found these to be satisfactory and robust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, students in mainstream schools also do have opportunities to interact with students from SPED schools through their Community Involvement Programmes. Through these experiences, mainstream students become more aware of the issues facing students in SPED schools.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about what MOE is doing to help all learners across the spectrum of ability, for example, in upgrading the facilities of SPED schools as well as ITEs.&nbsp; I have just described what MOE does, in regard to SPED schools.&nbsp; So I will just say a few words about ITEs.&nbsp; I think MPs have visited our ITEs and they have been impressed by the infrastructure investment that we have put in.&nbsp; MOE is spending about $800 million to develop the new ITE regional campuses.&nbsp; This is no less than what we have invested in our JCs, which cater to students of the same age group.&nbsp; ITE students also enjoy subsidies that are, in fact, slightly higher than that of a junior college student. ITE subsidy, at the moment, is about $8,574 per student; JC is $8,513 per student. So, we do place equal emphasis on investing in ITE students.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon asked a few questions about, for example, the right to play.&nbsp; I am not aware of any educational system in the world that prescribes right to play, but we do emphasise a lot on character development as well as moral education.&nbsp; As for sexuality education, this is a subject that has been discussed&nbsp;on many occasions.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to invite Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon to put forward her proposals on what to include in sexuality <p align=left>Column: 2455<p>education.&nbsp; MOE&nbsp;will be very happy to listen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>She also talked about making our environment more pro-family and, hopefully, many of our staff who are single lady teachers would have the opportunities.&nbsp; We will certainly see what we can do about that, but bear in mind that we still have the important&nbsp;objective of ensuring our educational programmes are properly delivered.

Come July every year, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> parents with Primary 1 school-going children will start <p align=left>Column: 2459<p>registering their child for Primary 1 education at the school of their choice.&nbsp; As parents become more aware of the competition faced by their children, most start their search for the choice school a year in advance, or even two years, when a child is four.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the present regulations, should the number of applications for children who are <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> citizens, or <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> permanent residents in Category 1, exceed the number of vacancies in any phase,&nbsp;

and</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Children living outside&nbsp;two kilometres of the school of choice.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, such a policy, with emphasis on the distance between a child's home and the school, has an adverse social impact.&nbsp; We will see an increasing trend of parents moving house to stay within&nbsp;a kilometre of their favourite schools.&nbsp; It is common to see property advertisements indicating the location of a new housing development within a kilometre of a top primary school.&nbsp; This has resulted in a backlash of excessive man-made clutter in the environment.&nbsp; Many urban areas near to popular primary schools are now congested, and residential developments are being developed in&nbsp;small parcels of land tightly packed in between two existing buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A preferential scheme based on distance causes tension on urban planning and compromises the townscape.&nbsp; We all have a duty to consider how these flaws in the urban fabric might be repaired.&nbsp; Such schemes may sometimes create <p align=left>Column: 2460<p>artificially high demand for places in schools that are within the congested built-up areas, as students are forced to apply to the nearest school,&nbsp;which may or may not have sufficient space for all the students living there.&nbsp; In such instances, parents become highly stressed, as they are not sure whether their child will be assured of a place in the nearest school of their choice.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools may not have a good mix of students from other neighbourhoods,&nbsp;if&nbsp;only students staying within&nbsp;one kilometre are encouraged to study there.&nbsp; A good cultural and social mix may not be achieved if students from the east are not mixing with students from the west of Singapore.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparison, parents in <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> may make three choices of schools in or outside the school net in which they reside.&nbsp; Under the system, <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> is divided into 47 school nets.&nbsp; Parents select primary schools available in their school net in order of their preference, and a computer programme will process the school choices.&nbsp; The order of priority in allocating places will be determined by random numbers generated by the computer for individual applications.&nbsp; This is to ensure fairness to all applicants.&nbsp; I ask the Minister to review the priority scheme for Primary 1 registration based on distance between the home and the school.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On standard and non-standard items, Sir, I would like to make comments on what we consider standard and non-<p align=left>Column: 2461<p>standard items where new school buildings are concerned.&nbsp; I was very pleased to note earlier, through the discussion from Minister of State, that more Special Education schools are slated to be rebuilt.&nbsp; That is good news.&nbsp; However, I would also like to ask the Ministry whether it is timely to review the guidelines on what constitute standard and non-standard items.&nbsp; In particular, I make some reference to some of these items, like a multi-purpose-hall-cum-canteen.&nbsp; In a SPED school, having them separate&nbsp;is classified as a non-standard item.&nbsp; Whenever it is a non-standard item, one has to go back into the community to raise funds.&nbsp; In a mainstream school, I think a multi-purpose hall is already a standard item.&nbsp; But when it comes to a&nbsp;SPED school, this is a non-standard item, like art and craft room and ECA, etc.&nbsp; Because the children already need special facilities, I wonder whether it is fair to the <st1:place>SPED school</st1:place> that the standard and non-standard items are classified in this manner, and whether there should not be a review to make it fairer.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point is that, currently, Government aided schools pay about 5% of the building cost, while the Ministry kindly foots 95% of the bill.&nbsp; But when it comes to Special Education schools, it is&nbsp;90% from the Ministry of Education and 10% from these schools,&nbsp;and they also have this problem with facilities that need to be more tailor-made for their children.&nbsp; I would like to appeal to the Ministry to review these two areas, ie,&nbsp;the percentage ratio as well as what constitutes standard and non-standard items.&nbsp; This would reduce the burden on the VWOs and let our special children have the amenities that they should at least get easily.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, I have come across instances where community organisations and members of the public, when they want to use sports facilities in the schools, such information is not readily available.&nbsp; Each time, somebody wants to use these sports facilities, they have to call the individual schools separately and get information whether or not such facilities are available.&nbsp; In some instances, principals are cooperative and very helpful, and I have come across many cases where it has been allowed.&nbsp; But there are also instances where some principals are uncooperative or would like to hoard such facilities.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The argument of&nbsp;principals is that it is for the safety of children in the schools.&nbsp; However, the principals of these schools have forgotten that, because of the locked gates, these students have to make their way around cars parked at least two rows abreast alongside the road, and sometimes having to cross from the opposite side of the <p align=left>Column: 2463<p>road, not forgetting that school buses move in and out along the public road for alighting children.&nbsp; The problem of congestion is now at the public roads and HDB car parks around the schools.&nbsp; The Traffic Police and HDB summon parents for stopping their cars for alighting and boarding on these roads and car parks, as they are not designed for this kind of traffic, blocking residents who, in turn, have to send their children to their children's schools at the same time.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can the Minister inform the House&nbsp;whether there is a standard requirement for the schools to have the alighting and boarding points within the school compound under PRIME?&nbsp; This is a basic facility that is needed in all schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;well-designed and planned for, it should be able to segregate the children in the school&nbsp;from the vehicular traffic.&nbsp;

Sir, the primary purpose of school uniform is to provide uniformity among students.&nbsp; I understand that the Ministry has given full mandate to the school principals to design and determine the prices of school uniforms.&nbsp; Recently, I observe that many <p align=left>Column: 2464<p>schools are having very fanciful school uniform designs.&nbsp; Most schools also require students to purchase different sets of school attires for different purposes.&nbsp; Some of these school uniforms have multiple colours, different materials, different cuttings, lots of pleats and buttons.&nbsp; Although these designs do provide a sense of identity for the school, I do not think that schools should rely on the design of school uniform for branding.&nbsp; Instead, they should focus on the quality of students who graduate from the schools to build their reputation.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the wide variety of designs in school uniform has posed some problems for parents.&nbsp; First, it has increased the cost of school uniforms&nbsp; which now cost between $8 and about $20 per set.&nbsp; The complex school uniform design also increases the number of hours required to iron these school uniforms.&nbsp; It also consumes more electricity to iron these school uniforms.&nbsp; This practice is not very environmentally friendly.&nbsp; The different school designs have also reduced the possibility of reuse of school uniforms among siblings, if they are studying in different schools.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to propose to the Ministry to consider designing a simple and yet practical set of school uniform for all students in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It should preferably be a collar T-shirt which can be used for all occasions.&nbsp; This will lower the cost of school uniform due to the simplicity in design and economies of scale.&nbsp; Many countries like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region> have national school uniforms for their students. This will provide a national identity for all our students.&nbsp; In addition, I hope the Ministry can exercise flexibility to allow students to wear sports shoes instead of the traditional white school shoes.&nbsp;

The Economic Development Board has been&nbsp;tasked to grow Singapore as an Education Hub, and MOE plays a supportive, facilitative role in developing Singapore in this direction.&nbsp; We do not take the lead because our decisions on which institutions to open, particularly for schools and the university sector, will have to be driven by educational objectives, not a desire to grow the industry as such.&nbsp; Our opening up of the education sector to new types of schools, new institutions and to foreign students is aimed at grooming our local students for a more global environment, and aimed at bringing in foreign students who will add to the vibrancy of our<p align=left>Column: 2467<p> institutions, create friendships and bonds with our local students and perhaps, eventually, assimilate within Singapore society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few years, top international universities have established a presence in Singapore to offer postgraduate education.&nbsp; These include INSEAD, Chicago Graduate School of Business, MIT, Technical University of Munich, Stanford and, most recently, Duke.&nbsp; At the undergraduate level, MOE is open to having one or two high quality private universities in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also allow two or three privately-funded secondary schools or junior colleges to be set up in Singapore.&nbsp; These schools will add diversity and choice to our education landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be allowed to enrol up to 50% foreign students.&nbsp; MOE is currently reviewing the applications that we received at the end of last year, and we will make an announcement&nbsp;on the first set of schools by April.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, MOE attracts bright foreign students to our mainstream schools through scholarship schemes, such as the ASEAN Scholarship.&nbsp; We also take in many more foreign students who come on their own means.&nbsp; As Mr Gan has said, these students add diversity to our national schools in a way that benefits all our students.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Primary One Registration</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While there are sufficient vacancies for all, MOE cannot accommodate all<p align=left>Column: 2468<p> requests for any particular school, as vacancies for&nbsp;each school are limited.&nbsp; Under the current Primary 1 registration system, there is a well-accepted,&nbsp;carefully calibrated system of priority allocation of school places.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no&nbsp;system that can satisfy all the considerations that we would like to see in Primary 1 admission.&nbsp; The current system attempts to strike a balance between various important considerations, from recognising the importance of placing siblings together in the same school, to distance from home, to the parents'&nbsp;relationship with the school.&nbsp; Unless there is a clearly superior&nbsp;model for&nbsp;Primary 1 registration, I would prefer that we not change the&nbsp;current Primary 1 registration guidelines.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</B> Sir, let me reply on school buildings and facilities, and other issues.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema&nbsp;asked about the definition of standard and non-standard items for our school buildings.&nbsp; Standard facilities in a school are items listed in the Ministry of Education's&nbsp;school building specifications.&nbsp; These facilities are necessary for the efficient delivery of the core educational curriculum and are grouped into teaching, technical, administration, ancillary, and external facilities.&nbsp; The standard teaching facilities include classrooms, music rooms and computer rooms.&nbsp; Ancillary areas include libraries, halls and canteens.&nbsp; When schools are developed or undergo upgrading, these facilities are funded by MOE.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilities that are&nbsp;outside&nbsp;the school building specifications list are defined as non-standard items.&nbsp; Some examples of non-standard items are auditoriums, dance studios and rock climbing walls.&nbsp; These items are requested by schools to help them add to their educational functions and develop their own niche strengths.&nbsp; They are funded by the school, through either the School Advisory Committee&nbsp;for Government schools or the School <p align=left>Column: 2469<p>Management Committee for Government-aided schools.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema also asked about SPED school specifications for standard and non-standard items.&nbsp; Facilities for SPED schools are provided in response to changing needs of different disability groups.&nbsp; In allowing such provisions, MOE takes into account the school's willingness to undertake the programme or function associated with the facility, as well as the school's ability to operate and maintain it.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE regularly reviews the provision of standard items for mainstream as well as SPED schools to ensure that they are relevant and up to date for the schools' needs.&nbsp; For example, as a result of our review of SPED school specifications, we have increased the area for social life skills training, and merged the gross motor skill training with the physiotherapy room.&nbsp; So, there have been changes, and we will review the SPED schools'&nbsp;needs in&nbsp;future, if necessary.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some Members, and the most recent was Mr Ravindran, have&nbsp;asked whether school sports facilities could be opened up for use by others in the community.&nbsp; Similar requests have been brought up by some hon.&nbsp;Members during the debate on MCDS' budget. &nbsp;Many of our schools are already opening up some of their facilities for use by organised groups from the community.&nbsp; Schools have generally adopted a balanced approach by supporting a range of community requests to use school facilities, as long as there is no compromise on student needs and school requirements, which must always take precedence.&nbsp; Currently, 154 schools have their field fenced off for possible use by the community groups, and 38 of the schools have entered into agreements with the community groups, such as the Citizens' Consultative Committees or Residents' Committees.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2470<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are&nbsp;a good number of schools which are still&nbsp;available for use by the community.&nbsp; Any registered organisation and community organisation can approach schools on the use of school facilities.&nbsp; Individuals who wish to use the facilities may also apply through these organisations.&nbsp; On a case-by-case basis, our schools can also consider requests by groups and&nbsp;individuals who do not belong to any registered organisation, and I believe Mr Ravindran belongs to a group of parents who can be classified under this category.&nbsp; Our schools, in letting the public use their facilities, must be assured that the users are responsible and accountable for any damage and abuse of school property.&nbsp; So, it is a very important principle; otherwise, it is going to be very costly on the schools and MOE to administer.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has also started a pilot scheme with the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) at several schools, such as Bedok North Secondary School, Bedok View Secondary School, Dunearn Secondary School, Sembawang Secondary School, Seng Kang Secondary School, Serangoon Secondary School and Meridian Junior College.&nbsp; The pilot involves the SSC taking charge of the schools' sports fields after school hours, and allowing the public to book these school fields for recreational use through the SSC.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will consider extending this scheme to more schools if the pilot project goes well.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema questioned the merit of merging schools to form \"Mega Schools\" and asked how merged schools deal with the resources. &nbsp;She said that she is quite pleased with the explanation given&nbsp;earlier.&nbsp; But let me reiterate some&nbsp;points.&nbsp; We agree that schools need to be of a certain minimum size to operate efficiently.&nbsp; This has enabled MOE to reap the benefits of scale in various aspects, such as CCA participation, cost-effective building and maintenance costs.&nbsp; On the other hand, schools cannot be too large, as they<p align=left>Column: 2471<p> would be difficult to manage.&nbsp; In particular, children in primary and secondary schools require closer supervision and attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;A school building vacated after a merger will be returned to Singapore Land Authority (SLA), unless MOE requires the school for another school for holding purposes or long-term use.&nbsp; Excess teachers in the merged school will be re-assigned to other schools where they are needed.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>School Uniforms</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me next turn to&nbsp;the school uniform issue. &nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked if MOE would consider designing a National School Uniform to help save costs for parents, and whether we would allow students to wear sports shoes instead of the present school shoes.&nbsp; Schools currently have the autonomy to design their own uniforms, just as they have composed and designed their own school songs, mottos and badges.&nbsp; The key purpose is to strengthen students' sense of belonging to the school, develop a distinct school identity and, in some cases, for teachers and students to showcase their creativity by taking part in the process of designing the school uniform.&nbsp; So it has its merit.&nbsp; Cost is a key consideration when schools choose their uniforms.&nbsp; Students who have financial difficulties in purchasing school uniforms can apply for financial assistance available in all schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, schools already have the autonomy to decide on the appropriate footwear, including wearing sports shoes, to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&nbsp;is being&nbsp;practised in schools.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Traffic Management</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on traffic management, Mdm Cynthia Phua raised the issue of traffic management in schools, and was specifically concerned with the lack of safe pick up and alighting points for <p align=left>Column: 2472<p>students.&nbsp; Dedicated bus bays within the school compound are provided for all new schools, as well as schools which have been rebuilt and upgraded under PRIME (Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools).&nbsp; So far, 118 out of the total stock of 351 schools have bus bays with designated boarding and alighting areas.&nbsp; Of these 118 schools, 94 are primary schools and the rest are secondary schools.&nbsp; This allows school buses to enter the school compound and park at bus lots.&nbsp; School children then board their buses from covered linkways, which are usually located next to the bus lots.&nbsp; The other schools will get their bus bays when they are upgraded through PRIME.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Our schools also look into the safety of their students in the area immediately outside the school premises during the period when school starts and when school is dismissed.&nbsp; These measures would include:</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, deploying their staff or guards to man the main entrance at peak periods to assist pupils.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, restricting the entry of vehicles into the school compound during peak hours, especially for primary schools, and designating specific areas for children to board and alight the school buses safely.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three, identifying safe spots, where space permits, for motorists to 'park and wait' for their children.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, demarcating areas within the school premises for pedestrian to use only and, in some primary schools, cordoning parts of the ground for the exclusive use of the pupils.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our schools also work with other agencies, for example, the LTA and the Police, to improve traffic safety outside <p align=left>Column: 2473<p>the school compound.&nbsp; The measures undertaken include the provision of pedestrian crossings, traffic lights and speed limits along roads in the vicinity of the schools.&nbsp; Schools also work with LTA and the Traffic Police on the Safe Drive Zone (SDZ) scheme, which involves the deployment of volunteers, for example, school staff, parents and students as trained Traffic Wardens, at designated stretches of roads or areas where there is heavy traffic or pedestrian flow.&nbsp; Other issues addressed include insufficient waiting areas when parents pick up their children.&nbsp; River Valley Primary School, for example, worked with LTA to allow parents to park along an adjacent road outside the school during the school's peak hours because of the lack of parking lots.&nbsp; It may cause a bit of inconvenience to other road users, but I use the road quite frequently and I think it has not really obstructed traffic flow.&nbsp; Schools do work with Government agencies, like LTA and the Traffic Police to facilitate alighting and picking up of children.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to work with the relevant agencies, such as the Traffic Police and LTA, as well as the community, to improve road and traffic safety inside and in the areas outside the schools, to ensure the safety of our students.&nbsp; In particular, we will work with LTA to look into the need to erect safety railings outside school compounds to prevent students, especially those from primary schools, from rushing out into the public roads.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>EZ-Link Smart Cards for Students</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia questioned the value of EZ-Link Smart card payment systems in various schools, and how this would benefit students.&nbsp; Sir, at present, schools brief their students and notify parents about the system, to help them understand the benefits and rationale for using the system. Schools which have adopted the smart card system have done<p align=left>Column: 2474<p> so holistically.&nbsp; There are a lot more benefits to the students and to the schools than describing the system as one that \"costs more and does less\".&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite some benefits of the system.&nbsp; It has helped to relieve teachers of some administrative tasks, such as attendance-taking, giving them more time to attend to professional teaching and learning matters.&nbsp; Parents can also monitor their children's attendance, food consumption and the type of food their children consume in school and expenditure on a daily basis.&nbsp; In addition, the system complements the learning process for students by exposing them to a different form of monetary transaction, other than cash transactions which they would come across frequently outside school.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we do not need to help them learn to count money in school, when they can do that all the time outside school and at home. We are giving these children additional experience in dealing with a different form of money.&nbsp; Schools have also worked with canteen vendors to provide for cash to be accepted, should it be used for payment, for example, when students forget to bring their cards.&nbsp; So, schools do not ban the use of cash.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to emphasise that the schools were guided by the values of prudence and best value for money in their plans to embark on the system.&nbsp; They had considered the merits of the system and the&nbsp;benefits this would bring to their students and the school.&nbsp; Feedback from students and parents on the system has been positive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ravindran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ravindran:</B> While I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply and the fact that many schools are made available to the public, the problem that exists at the moment is that there is a lack of information in the public domain as to which school facilities are available to the public.&nbsp; My queries specifically to the Minister is:&nbsp; how do we make such <p align=left>Column: 2475<p>information available to the public so that we know that such facilities are available and we can access the relevant schools for such facilities?&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</B> Most of the users of the school fields or school facilities are likely to be local people, ie, the local community, who know the schools very well.

Therefore, it is clear that our students should be grounded in functional Chinese, at the very least, to prepare for the future.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But are our 2.6% Chinese B takers ready for the future? They may be a minority, but I will feel better to know that they have sufficient competency to handle future working environments.&nbsp; Is Chinese B teaching then enough to handle practical day-to-day transactions?&nbsp; We should expect similar base standards of Chinese B as we did for our EL2 students in the past. I&nbsp;am from a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school myself, with Chinese being my first language. Even with that, I find my command of the Chinese Language deficient in handling business matters with the Chinese in China. Thus, I worry even more for our Chinese Language B students.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, one of the distinctive features of Chinese B is the greater emphasis on listening and speaking skills.&nbsp; As we know, listening, speaking, reading and writing, in Chinese, \"<I>ting xie duo ting</I>\" are the four wheels of a vehicle.&nbsp; Neglecting any one of these abilities would be tantamount to driving with a punctured wheel.&nbsp; The four components are synergistic in action.&nbsp; Thus, I would like to remind the Ministry not to ignore totally the writing component of Chinese B.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like to praise our educators' flexibility in allowing Chinese B candidates to bring dictionaries into the examination halls with them since last year. This is a step in the right direction.&nbsp; It helps them to still try&nbsp;to express what they want to say when they have forgotten how to write.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to urge the Ministry again to have more measures to ensure the confidence and the ability of these Chinese B students to handle and to improve on the language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2478<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng.&nbsp; You have two cuts.

In order to improve my English, I created space for learning it, such as reading English newspapers and using the dictionary.&nbsp; I fully understand that the purpose of Chinese B is to help children from English-educated background by using different teaching&nbsp; methods to make it simple and easy to understand, so as to kindle their interest in learning.&nbsp; Students who opt for Chinese B account for only 2-3%. I would urge them not to fear Chinese and not to lose heart when facing difficulties, and not to give up easily.&nbsp; Apart from devoting more attention in class, they should make attempts to &nbsp; read the Chinese newspapers, such as the <I>Lianhe Zaobao, Wanbao</I> and <I>Shin Min</I>.&nbsp; They should also tune in to the Chinese TV channels like&nbsp;<i>Channel 8</i> and <i>Channel U</i> more often.&nbsp; They could listen to radio <i>FM95.8</i> and <i>100.3.</i> They can also learn to sing Chinese songs&nbsp;at karaoke sessions. They can practise writing notes in Chinese to communicate with their boyfriends or girlfriends.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are diversified channels for learning and creating more space. In this way, they can improve their Chinese.&nbsp; I am sure that in the near future, they will no longer stay with Chinese B but will instead upgrade to the regular Chinese course.&nbsp; By then, MOE may even consider doing away with Chinese B in stages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on teaching methods.&nbsp; In K1 and K2, our children learn the Chinese characters.&nbsp; About 95% of them attend the PCF kindergarten classes (K1 and K2).&nbsp; During this stage, they learn how to read and write in Chinese characters.&nbsp; But in Primary 1, they are switched to <i>hanyu pinyin</i>. For example, they use <i>hanyu pinyin</i> for dictation. Will this add to the<p align=left>Column: 2479<p> burden of the learning process and lead to their rejection of Chinese? <i>Hanyu pinyin</i> is only a supplementary tool to pronounce the Chinese words.&nbsp; It is not to replace the Chinese characters themselves.&nbsp; The method of using <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">hanyu pinyin</i> instead of the proper Chinese characters to teach Chinese needs to be reviewed and improved.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Education for Autistic Students</I><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to hear the announcement by the Minister for Community Development and Sports that a new policy will be formulated to help the handicapped in Singapore so that they could be better looked after.&nbsp; At present, there are 24,000 autistic people and every year, 200 children are diagnosed as autistic.

The Ministry should also allocate adequate funds to subsidise the fees in these schools in order to lighten the burden of the parents.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2480<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>4.00 pm</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Early Childhood Education</i><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to talk about setting up a national early childhood institution and funding for pre-school curriculum development.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to be a truly educational hub to provide for the whole spectrum of education for the young through adulthood, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> needs to establish a national early childhood institute (NECI).&nbsp; The form of the NECI could take shape as a stand-alone body or, possibly, it could be a faculty within one of our local universities.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has initiated several areas to help improve the quality of pre-school education in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The time has come to act on our collective wisdom about what children and family need to bring about a hopeful picture for all.&nbsp; As such, a national early childhood institution which focuses on early childhood development and learning would be timely.&nbsp; It will be the recognised voice of early child education and care in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It could be the authority and advocate of the high quality childcare, early child education, kindergarten and parenting programmes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to talk about pre-school curriculum development.&nbsp; The early years of a child's life is a critical phase of growth.&nbsp; The Government has also devoted some effort to develop a pre-school curriculum framework under its pilot studies spearheaded by MOE.&nbsp; However, the Government has left the pre-school years essentially to private providers.

If there is enough interest, there is no reason why CLB students should not go beyond what is taught.&nbsp; The whole idea of having CLB is to allow them to learn at a level that they can manage so that they would not lose interest in the Chinese language totally.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew mentioned 2.6% taking CLB.&nbsp; I would like to say that this particular percentage is based on the old criteria, before the recent revision.&nbsp; We do not have&nbsp;a target on how many per cent should study CLB.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon talked about the setting up of a national early childhood institute as well as giving more help to early childhood curriculum development.&nbsp; I think we have also covered this very extensively earlier when we were discussing this subject under the $100 cut.&nbsp; I shall not go through it again.&nbsp; We, basically, feel that the current framework, whereby MOE&nbsp;defines the requirements&nbsp;and let the private and the community sector run the pre-school programme, to be a satisfactory one.&nbsp; Therefore, we do not feel that there is a need for us to enter into it and to set up that particular institute.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mr Zainudin is here, I think I owe him one clarification.&nbsp; Just now, he <p align=left>Column: 2482<p>asked what we were doing to cater for students who benefit from vocational training.&nbsp; The two vocational institutes that he mentioned&nbsp;- Assumption Vocational Institute and the Geylang Serai Vocational Institute&nbsp;-&nbsp;are both under the ITE umbrella.&nbsp;

<B>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah)</B>: Sir, I have spoken on this subject at the Budget debate.&nbsp; So I do not intend to repeat all those points.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very briefly, I would like to recap the main points.&nbsp; I am calling for a review of 'A\" level examination.&nbsp; Do we need 'A' level examination?&nbsp; Why not 'O' level students go straight to the polytechnics?&nbsp; 'A' level examination is to prepare students for university education.&nbsp; Most of them must achieve that goal.&nbsp; However, I have checked with the school offering 3-year 'A' level course.&nbsp; In 2002, 20% got into the university, 40% passed but could not get into the university, 40% failed to pass 'A' level.&nbsp; So if 'A' level is for the university education, then the 3-year 'A' level has failed miserably.&nbsp; Worse still, those 'A' level students who failed to enter the university find the job market not favourable to them.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a jobless survey, from a <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Straits Time</i> report, 'A' level jobless rate was 1.5, polytechnic was 1.1, university was 1.2.&nbsp; Obviously, employers prefer polytechnic students.&nbsp; Thus, I would like to know how many 'A' level students do not make it to the university.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My single example should not make me want to call for this change.&nbsp; But putting that aside, I feel that this change should be considered for two reasons:</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2483<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp; While we want to educate 'A' level students to enter university, we must also help those who cannot enter university to be better equipped with skills that the workplace wants.&nbsp; This will cut down education wastage.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; A polytechnic education will prepare our students better for the new global economy as their approach to teaching by way of hands-on experience and industry exposure appeals to the employers of the job market.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this proposed change, the universities will have to make certain admission changes.&nbsp; For example, exempt the first year university course for the better polytechnic graduates or grant credits to subjects they did in the polytechnic.&nbsp; Some university courses would have to be shortened.&nbsp; Polytechnic education can be refined or restructured to have more choices, more options, more discipline.&nbsp; They must not only have technical disciplines but academic ones too, so that the students would have more choices to choose when they opt for university education.&nbsp; For those who do not make it to the university, at least a polytechnic diploma graduate is better equipped for the workforce.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, this is on the 3-year 'A' level course which we conduct in our centralised institutes.&nbsp; This is the group of students who fall between two stools.&nbsp; They cannot get into our polytechnics because the courses they want to get into are very competitive, particularly Business Studies and the like.&nbsp; They cannot get into our junior colleges because we have got entry requirements to ensure that if you go for a 2-year 'A' level course, you got to have a good chance of succeeding within that period and going on to a university.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2484<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years ago, we thought quite hard about whether we should phase out the centralised institutes.&nbsp; We did not think it was advisable.&nbsp; It is better that we consolidate the centralised institutes and try to achieve as high a quality as possible for this group of pupils.&nbsp; So we have decided to merge the two centralised institutes.&nbsp; They will be getting a new facility.&nbsp; They have got good principals and teachers and we will provide them a JC education over three years.&nbsp; It is realistic and we think we can improve their pass rates and enable a fair number of them to go on to further education.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not want to channel more students into our polytechnics at the expense of our junior colleges.&nbsp; We take 25% of cohort into our junior colleges, and I think that is about right.&nbsp; We have to preserve differentiated pathways to tertiary education to cater to the different aptitudes, different learning styles, different interests of our students.&nbsp; Those who are more academically inclined will prefer going through the JC route.&nbsp; The JCs offer a rigorous academic programme that equips students well for university education.&nbsp; They develop core skills like thinking and communication skills.&nbsp; And increasingly, especially with the new JC curriculum that will come in in the year 2006, we will place more focus on thinking skills and a multi-disciplinary curriculum framework that will prepare our students well for university education in the future.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who prefer a more practice oriented tertiary education can go to the polytechnics.&nbsp; But I do not see a compelling reason to reduce options for 'O' level students, to reduce the JC option or the 'A' level option and to increase the polytechnic option.&nbsp; Let us maintain a diversity of pathways.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polytechnics are essentially world-class.&nbsp; They are best in class for that kind of education.&nbsp; They offer a very broad<p align=left>Column: 2485<p> range of disciplines&nbsp; -&nbsp; 118 disciplines in all&nbsp; -&nbsp; engineering, IT, sciences, business, built environment and so on.&nbsp; We, basically, did right to retain and build up the polytechnics instead of converting them to universities.&nbsp; Every time I meet senior British or Australian academics, they tell me privately what damage has been wrought by the conversion of polytechnics into universities or quasi-universities in their countries.&nbsp; And they lost a valuable tradition&nbsp; -&nbsp; the technical and practice oriented tertiary tradition.&nbsp; So we have done well to retain it.&nbsp; I think Dr Tan has quite eloquently described the benefits of that tradition.&nbsp; We will continue to ensure that the polytechnic sector remains strong, vibrant and relevant to the needs of industry, and relevant to the needs of that group of students.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

First, the latest students' satisfaction survey showed that students are generally satisfied with their lecturers and tutors in both universities, ie, NUS and NTU.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least four in every five students had indicated that they were satisfied with the quality of teaching and learning.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, training for university lecturers.&nbsp; The university lecturers are not required to undergo pedagogical training before they take on their roles or&nbsp;before they are engaged by the universities.&nbsp; But they do receive training continuously to upgrade and keep abreast of best practices and advances in teaching methods.&nbsp; These training programmes are organised by the universities throughout the year.&nbsp; They include training for staff who recently join, such as how to manage tutorials, how to manage lectures, as well as continuous training for all their staff who want to hone their content and teaching skills.&nbsp; I asked for some data.&nbsp; Over half of the academic staff at each of the universities goes through training each year.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the question of foreign lecturers.&nbsp; I would say it is not a question of foreign lecturers, but lecturers in general.&nbsp; Whether foreign or local, lecturers who are not performing need guidance, and help, and if they are unable to improve, we have to do something about them.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the mechanism in place to monitor and ensure the quality of instruction. &nbsp; Besides the students' survey which I just mentioned, peer reviews are <p align=left>Column: 2488<p>also used to evaluate teaching.&nbsp; In addition, our universities have performance systems in place to appraise and reward academic staff, and this is, of course, still evolving.&nbsp; Faculty members with below average performance are closely monitored.&nbsp; The Deans and Heads of Department will work out appropriate programmes to help the staff improve.&nbsp; The Dean will sit in and observe the lectures, provide feedback and some form of professional counselling.&nbsp; It is a one to one exercise - Dean or Head of Department with the faculty member concerned&nbsp;- and is tailored to meet the needs of the staff in question.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the broader level, teaching is one of the areas that we are going to cover under the Quality Assurance Framework for universities that I spoke about earlier this morning.&nbsp; The university teaching quality will be evaluated through a process of institutional self-assessment followed by external validation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Each time when we have to take painful measures to restructure our economy, we have pulled through without a major social upheaval.&nbsp; Each partner in this tripartite partnership realises that it is far better to work together, to cooperate than to confront, to pursue win-win outcomes and to work towards the long-term interest of each party.&nbsp; This model of partnership has worked in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> because each of the social partners has learned to look beyond its own interests.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><b>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</b></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">4.20 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The estimates from the Ministry of Manpower showed that, as at December 2003, unemployment among residents was about 5.5% or 96,400.&nbsp; Unless jobs are found in big enough numbers, the resident unemployment may increase every year as more people complete their education in our schools and tertiary institutions and join the workforce.&nbsp; In a paper titled \"Employment of Foreigners and Employment for Singaporeans\" presented at the \"Singapore Perspectives\" conference organised by the&nbsp;Institute of Policy Studies&nbsp;in January 2004, it was pointed out that the unemployment we now have is serious and, in some ways, unprecendented.&nbsp; It said:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; There is a distinct deterioration of employability of older workers over the last three decades.&nbsp; Although older workers, 40 to 59 years, increase their share among those employed, joblessness among them increases disproportionately, especially during the economic downturn in 1986 to 1988 and post-1997.&nbsp; This means that seniority is now a burden rather than an advantage;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The profile of the unemployed by educational status is now more skewed towards the better educated.&nbsp; In 1974, only 7.4% of the unemployed have post-secondary and higher education.&nbsp; In 2002, this could rise to 35% of the unemployed.&nbsp; Correspondingly, the share of managers, professionals and technicians, among the unemployed, rose from 7.2% in 1974 to 30.3% in 2002; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Long-term unemployment, that is, being without a job for at least 25 weeks has also shown a distinctive trend towards having older and higher educated workers.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2493<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I understand from DPM Lee's argument is that the new 'S' Pass will benefit Singaporeans as it would encourage foreign companies to come here if they knew they have the flexibility of having their preferred employees and skilled workers.&nbsp; However, there is also a need for the Government to take action to protect Singaporeans' livelihood for many reasons.&nbsp; For instance, unemployment can trigger off financial crisis for families, resulting in a need to depend on welfare assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have less to contribute towards domestic consumption which is bad for our economy.&nbsp; Even if we cannot train or retrain suitable Singaporeans immediately to do the jobs held by foreigners at the middle level before granting 'S' Pass, should the companies be made at least to show that they have plans to increase employment of Singaporeans in the medium term?&nbsp; Since we now have a higher proportion of our unemployed having post-secondary education or higher, these persons appear to be possible candidates to fill jobs at the middle level.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the MOM's website, the 'S' Pass will be issued to foreigners for two years initially and renewable by another three years.&nbsp; Thus, these jobs are effectively blocked off from Singaporeans for a number of years once 'S' Pass is issued.&nbsp; This effect could be seriously weighed against whether Singaporeans can be trained, retrained in a shorter time to fill these vacancies and how 'S' Pass renewal should be considered.&nbsp; We also do not have any assurance that the 5% cap of the 'S' Pass will not be increased in future.&nbsp; Indeed, a warning sign is already seen in DPM Lee's Budget wrap-up speech.&nbsp; He welcomed the suggestion to have flexibility for different sectors which means some sectors would have a much higher percentage of 'S' Pass holders in due course.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Government cannot run away from its responsibility to make the <p align=left>Column: 2494<p>Singapore economy conducive for Singaporeans to find work or business opportunities.&nbsp; If Singaporeans cannot find a reasonable livelihood here, there is no right to label Singaporeans as stayers and quitters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Many are also concerned about outsourcing and the proliferation of contract work.&nbsp; There is a certain sense of instability and vulnerability.&nbsp; The most affected are older workers and those who are less skilled.&nbsp;

Madam, even if we are able to create many high value-added jobs, we know <p align=left>Column: 2495<p>that, for quite a significant number of Singaporeans, structural unemployment will remain a reality.&nbsp; Today, all Singaporeans are competing in a global labour market, and the better-skilled stand a better chance compared to the unskilled.&nbsp; In order to remain competitive and employable, our workers have accepted many adjustments, some of which are painful.&nbsp; But to the credit of our unions and workers, there was no loss of&nbsp;a single man-hour or man-day last year due to strike or industrial stoppage, which is something which no country in the world is able to achieve.&nbsp; A Towers Perrin survey last year of 10 Asian countries in the manufacturing sector, for instance, shows that the pay of manufacturing workers in Singapore has gone up by only 1% over the last two years, compared to an average of 20% for the rest of Asia.&nbsp; So, workers have done their part, and they hope to see the results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he can give us an update on the job situation, how serious is the structural unemployment problem in Singapore, and whether, in his view, the current programmes are sufficient to address them.&nbsp; What are the overall manpower projections to ensure that demand meets supply, and what more can be done to ensure that workers can be channelled in a systematic way to the sectors where jobs are available?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How:</B> Madam, yesterday's release of strong February export figures adds&nbsp;confidence that the Singapore economy is en route to recovery.&nbsp; This is certainly to be welcomed, and I am sure that many Singaporeans, especially the unemployed ones, will look forward to this recovery and hope that the threat of retrenchment will recede while the prospect of employment will improve.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2496<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to sound a note of caution here.&nbsp; We cannot assume that economic recovery, even when it is really sustained, will automatically solve all employment challenges for Singaporeans.&nbsp; According to statistics available on the MOM's website, the resident long-term unemployment rate, defined as a proportion of the labour force who have been unemployed for at least 25 weeks, has climbed steadily from 0.4% or about 5,700 in 1997, to 1.4% or 25,100 persons in 2003.&nbsp; Yes, part of this increase in the long-term unemployed can be accounted for by cyclical reasons, namely, the difficult demand conditions faced by the economy over the past five years.&nbsp; But I think there are also structural reasons behind the increase.&nbsp; Fast changing technology, the consequent demand for better-skilled manpower and the overall transformation of the economy towards knowledge-based and higher-value work have come together to render re-employment for some displaced workers very difficult.&nbsp; The threat of growing structural unemployment is therefore real, and will not go away simply because our economy is picking up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that the percentages of workers in temporary employment and part-time work have risen from 1.7% and 3.3% respectively in 1997 to 4% and 5.7% respectively in 2003.&nbsp; Although these figures are still low compared to those in some advanced economies, it still reflects an underlying trend and structural shift in the make-up of our workforce, as companies move towards maintaining a smaller core of employees, and pursuing flexibility through outsourcing and employing supplementary manpower on a needs basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This trend implies that even as hiring picks up with the economic recovery, the kinds of jobs that Singaporeans seeking work will find will be different from the ones that have been restructured away.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2497<p> The terms and conditions of such work will also be different from the traditional full-time permanent jobs.&nbsp; There will be implications on how then to help Singaporeans holding such jobs meet their long-term basic needs in retirement, training and healthcare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third observation that I would like to make is that, according to the Labour Market Report 2003:&nbsp; \"For the second consecutive year, professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) ...\" among them, 16.7 were retrenched per 1,000 of such personnel employed, and this group \"... overtook production and related workers ...&nbsp;to post the highest incidence of retrenchment.&nbsp; The PMETs accounted for the largest group of locals retrenched in 2003 compared to all other groups.\"&nbsp; Beyond cyclical resons, I believe this result points to the underlying trend of delayering.&nbsp; Again, I do not think that this trend will disappear or be reversed when the economy picks up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in the light of these structural shifts, I believe that even as the economy recovers and the need for suitably-skilled manpower grows,&nbsp;we may yet encounter sticky unemployment of perhaps 3% or 4% of the workforce.&nbsp; Getting back to the 2% level of unemployment that Singaporeans have become accustomed to in the years prior to 1997 will be a challenge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister what plans would his Ministry have to maximise the employment and re-employment opportunities for Singaporeans in this recovering economy.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister how his Ministry intends to tackle the structural shifts that I noted earlier, and thereby secure more good jobs for Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

MOM estimates that unemployment could fall to around 4% to 4.5% by the end of the year.&nbsp; The industries where jobs are likely to grow in the near term are in education, healthcare and social services.&nbsp; The retail and wholesale sectors are also expected to add jobs.&nbsp; For manufacturing, direct job creation will increase, but at a much slower rate compared to the service industries.&nbsp; But there will be jobs created in the electronics, biomedical and chemical sectors, transport engineering and general manufacturing engineering industries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Long-term Challenges&nbsp; Persist</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, while it appears that we have turned the corner, I think it would be useful now, especially now, to take stock and look at the overall picture.&nbsp; We certainly do not want to be complacent and relaxed, but instead press on.&nbsp; And I agree with Members that we need to address long-term structural issues.&nbsp; On&nbsp;manpower issues,&nbsp;DPM Lee said that the last five or six years were wrenching, and had&nbsp;more changes than even the preceding 20-odd years.&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1997 to 2002, the impact of the Asian financial crisis, September 11, SARS and the&nbsp;Bali<p align=left>Column: 2501<p> bombing may have abated, but long-term structural changes for jobs for Singaporeans will persist for the next decade, and many Members have alluded to that -&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Heng Chee How.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have some breathing space and nerves are not so frayed, let me address these issues pointedly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>\"Protection\" versus Flexibility</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the manpower issues that surfaced in the last few months and the last two years that my cohort of Members of Parliament came into this House and were faced with, the one that had the most significant impact on how we protect jobs and livelihoods for Singaporeans was a fundamentally important question.&nbsp; And during those turbulent times, some form of protection or other had been asked in a variety of ways, whether it was in legislation to promote hiring or making it more difficult to retrench Singaporeans, special rights for anti-discrimination of the elderly, minorities, parents, part-time workers - like some of you have mentioned today.&nbsp; Others have asked for more predictable and assured terms in wages and benefits or working hours, so that workers' remuneration was better protected.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, we have the perennial requests,&nbsp;as we have this afternoon, to restrict access to foreign workers, so that Singaporeans are favoured for these jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the House, we are not alone in asking for these seeming forms of protection.&nbsp; Indeed, all over the world, this is an issue which countries are grappling with.&nbsp; US presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry, wants to get tough on companies which outsource operations outside the US.&nbsp; The Dutch government recently decided that local employers must make sure that no Dutch person is available for a job before attempting to recruit workers from the 10 new Central and Eastern European countries joining the<p align=left>Column: 2502<p> European Union.&nbsp; In the meantime, of course, businesses are concerned with competition and costs.&nbsp; They are deciding if they can survive and stay, or uproot, or change industries.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>4.45 pm<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we help Singaporeans get jobs and earn a livelihood? Mr Low Thia Khiang said this is the Government's responsibility, otherwise, we have no moral right to start the stayers-and-quitters debate.&nbsp; I agree fully with him.&nbsp; I accept that it is the Government's responsibility to do this.&nbsp; And if by introducing laws that make it harder for companies to right-size, keep wages up, and keep foreign workers out can ensure jobs for Singaporeans, then the solutions would be obvious and, in fact, easier to do.&nbsp; We pass the laws,&nbsp;Singaporeans are pleased, and they will find their jobs secure and livelihoods preserved.&nbsp; But will they?&nbsp; Other countries&nbsp;have gone&nbsp;that way and have not succeeded.&nbsp; Indeed, it has worsened unemployment.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to show Members&nbsp;some charts, and&nbsp;I have asked the Clerk to circulate them. This is the first chart that I will show.&nbsp; On average, over the period 1997-2001 -&nbsp;and I have particularly chosen the last few years which were difficult years for us - continental European countries, such as France, Germany and Spain, had employment rates of above 10%.&nbsp; I would like to remind Members that they did not suffer SARS, they did not have the Bali bombing, and there was no Asian financial crisis that afflicted them.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was compared to 4.5% for the US, 5.9% for the UK and 3.0% for Singapore.&nbsp; Why this sharp difference?&nbsp; One answer is the extent to which these countries regulate their labour market.&nbsp; The Anglo-Saxon model of the UK and US, in particular, believes in flexible labour markets.&nbsp; They regulate, as all countries do, on safety and health matters.&nbsp; But <p align=left>Column: 2503<p>they allow firms flexibility in right sizing,&nbsp;in hiring and firing.&nbsp; Compared to other countries, they&nbsp;are not overly generous in their statutory leave and benefit provisions, or have overly restrictive working hours.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These flexibilities allow US companies to respond quickly to external changes, to seize new business opportunities and to move out of unprofitable areas.&nbsp; A <i>Business Week</i> article, contributed by a US professor of economics, Russell Roberts, highlights and examines what happened to the manufacturing sector in the US, because US manufacturing only accounts for about 12% of jobs. They have had to go through wrenching times as well.&nbsp; He said that the sector had to shed jobs due to productivity gains or plant relocations.&nbsp; But it freed up workers so that they could move into new industries and new jobs, eg, in telecommunications, software and biotech.&nbsp; New goods and services became available to consumers.&nbsp; The improvements in productivity kept wages, raised the standard of living for all.&nbsp; So despite the churn with retrenchments and re-hiring, unemployment rates, wages and standard of living held and were better than others with rigid labour markets. In other words, this market flexibility which at face value appears harsh, in fact accords more job and income security not only for the more employable but indeed for all.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have asked about the impact of outsourcing.&nbsp; McKinsey,&nbsp;the global consultancy firm, estimates that&nbsp;every US$1 spent in the US on offshore services generates a total benefit of about US$1.45.&nbsp; What about jobs?&nbsp; Again, the report says that even if two million jobs are outsourced, moved out of the US, this frees up 22 million jobs that the US Bureau of Labour Statistics estimates will be created over the next 10 years.&nbsp; How <p align=left>Column: 2504<p>certain these forecasts are, only time will tell.&nbsp; The academics are convinced, including the Presidential advisor, that these spurts of technological discontinuity we see now have had the same effect in the past, and the outcome will be repeated.&nbsp; But I presume, in an election year in the US, workers are doubtful and, even if politicians believe the academics, they would be reluctant to say so.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what about the supposedly more secure environments in continental European countries which seek to protect workers' jobs with more rigid labour,&nbsp;wage and other benefits?&nbsp; It is spurious protection, as their companies are less able to change in an increasing volatile environment.&nbsp; The result?&nbsp;&nbsp;Job growth slows, and descriptions like \"Eurosclerosis\" or \"arthritic economies\" emerge.&nbsp; For years, economists and business leaders have lamented that Germany's restrictive labour laws&nbsp;did little to stem their high unemployment rate of 10%.&nbsp; On average, unemployed people in Germany remain out of work longer than in other countries.&nbsp; The process of job placement is lengthy and complicated. And&nbsp;the unemployment and social security benefits in the systems are expensive solutions that literally tax the system.&nbsp; So, Chancellor Schroder plans to implement a series of reforms to modernise the labour market and to create jobs.&nbsp; All these reforms are part of the Agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms to boost the economy. They plan to limit the jobless benefits to one year instead of 32 months to free up regulations to enable firms to hire and fire temporary or permanent workers.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denmark too liberalised the labour market in the early 1990s.&nbsp; They experienced an employment boom and improved their unemployment rate to 6%.&nbsp; Denmark's economy has averaged&nbsp;2.6% annual growth since 1994.&nbsp; They cut entitlements, including social security transfers, and raised indirect taxes.&nbsp; That <p align=left>Column: 2505<p>gave them the ability to shift resources into higher education and research and development. &nbsp; Denmark is the third largest exporter of pharmaceuticals per capita and among the world leaders in biotechnology patents.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in USA, this simple fact that more protection does not necessarily afford more job security is being borne out.&nbsp; The California State under the Democrat Governor enacted or expanded half-a-dozen laws dealing with labour market regulations.&nbsp; Especially onerous on businesses were the three laws on: (1) paid six weeks family-leave act;&nbsp;(2) a mandated increase in workers' compensation amounting to more than twice the US national average; and,&nbsp;(3) increasing overtime pay which was mandated for anyone who works more than eight hours a day. This makes it expensive for businesses that operated four 10-hour days or those call centres which operated 12-hour days.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies in California responded and since 2001, the state has lost about 300,000 jobs.&nbsp; Even in developing economies, the leaders have realised the same point. In the post-Raj era of India, it was very difficult to hire and fire. &nbsp; In fact, it needed a bureaucracy to administer all those rigidities that were there by fear.&nbsp; But in the early 90s, the Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh began the process of liberalising the system and allowing&nbsp;businesses to respond without the onerous stipulations imposed by government.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of that enlightened move, all countries including Singapore are experiencing this extraordinary rise in the productivity growth of Indian industries. Yes, India was lucky and took advantage of the IT boom and bust.&nbsp; But we should recognise that while India had the educated masses, previously rigid conditions stifled their productivity.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2506<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have gone into&nbsp;some length on this issue because this is a fundamental point which under-girds the principles upon which we craft our labour policies. All these examples show that excess rigidity, instead of protecting workers, leads to economic stagnation and loss of jobs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us come back to Singapore. In the area of outsourcing, some Members have asked what the impact is.&nbsp; We could lose some jobs overseas because others can do it better or at a lower cost.&nbsp; This is a global phenomenon and&nbsp;there is not much that we can do about it.&nbsp; But we can also benefit from offshoring.&nbsp; In fact, our manufacturing sector first started as MNCs offshored production, design, support and headquarter functions.&nbsp; We were among the first beneficiaries of outsourcing. As more higher valued and higher technology content manufacturing investments came, labour intensive manufacturing then shifted to cheaper locations.&nbsp; That freed up local manpower to go into the growing services sector.&nbsp; If we had blocked that then in 1970s and 1980s, the consequences today would have been devastating, as more workers would lose their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Meeting competition head-on:&nbsp; the way to growth and jobs</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How then do we protect ourselves and jobs for Singaporeans?&nbsp; I come back to the key question - not by shutting out competition, but meeting it head-on.&nbsp; MTI Minister, BG George Yeo mentioned this in his speech.&nbsp; Let me reiterate.&nbsp; We can compete on four aspects:&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, value plus.&nbsp; We can never be cheap but we can moderate the costs to do business here by keeping statutory burdens low and adding value -&nbsp;whether it is CPF, taxes, utilities, land and wages.&nbsp; We need to give companies the flexibility to respond and the wage restructuring efforts that we have been talking about recently should be seen in this light.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2507<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, systems OK:&nbsp; Excellent systems and infrastructure - whether it is transport, utilities, judicial, banking, education.&nbsp; Words like \"dependable\", \"predictable\", \"transparent\" and \"efficient\" epitomise the Singapore system.&nbsp; What we now need, of course, is another layer with descriptions like \"unexpected\", \"quirky\", \"innovative\", \"creative\", \"entertaining\", \"reversed\" and, yes, \"Surprising\" Singapore.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, a best workforce - an effective and&nbsp;efficient labour market,&nbsp;highly trained local workers and, I would say, access to foreign workers -&nbsp;not deprivation -&nbsp;is a critical element both to allow diversity in skill base and help businesses average their costs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, many Members have alluded to this - Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Heng Chee How - a harmonious labour- management environment through tripartite consensus.&nbsp; I fully agree with Mdm Halimah -&nbsp;not a single day lost last year -&nbsp;which was a wrenching year. It is a fourth pillar.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this strategy, we have created growth in the past and we will continue to do so. Singaporeans need not lose heart.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to show a second chart which helps us focus on jobs as a larger factor.&nbsp; I have said that our policies have created more jobs than there are Singaporeans even within the last five difficult years.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;busy slide but I want you to focus on the top line above the orange bar, which says \"Total Jobs\". This is the line that our economy creates - the number of jobs that it creates.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will note that it is larger than the line over the blue bar, which is our local workforce. This is as many workers that we have.&nbsp; The number of jobs our economy created is always larger than our local resident workforce.&nbsp; The excess of jobs will continue in the <p align=left>Column: 2508<p>long-term.&nbsp; From 2003 backwards - those are facts.&nbsp; From 2003 onwards, they are projections. Some of us might be asking&nbsp;whether our projections are accurate.&nbsp; We have adjusted for the reduced number of jobs that growth brings compared to the past.&nbsp; In other words, when we projected this, each&nbsp;percentage of growth, we factor in less jobs that it brings in because of the higher value add.&nbsp; Yes, globalisation, outsourcing, technological changes can have consequences, but this picture should be representative for the near term - five years.&nbsp; Beyond that, it is hard to say. But for five years, it will serve as a reliable model to plan our strategic efforts.&nbsp; This is, if you like, the battle plan to answer many of the questions -&nbsp;what can Government do?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an efficient and responsive labour market, and competitive workforce, we are well placed to achieve the medium term growth forecast of 3-5% projected by MTI.&nbsp; And, as the economy grows, new jobs will be created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking forward, this gap between how many jobs the economy creates and the number of workers in our workforce will persist.&nbsp; Our workforce grew annually by about 1.8% over the past five years from 1998.&nbsp; From this year onwards, it is expected to grow by 2.5%.&nbsp; There is a reason for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us remember 1988. I remember well because my dragon daughter was born then.&nbsp; But let me tell you that in terms of demographics, everything else from then went downhill.&nbsp; That was the biggest peak - 50,000 births and the number of births per year after that went down.&nbsp; I think Members remember well the charts.&nbsp; This is a demographic echo.&nbsp; From 1988, in 2013, they will be 25 years old.&nbsp; If we note, our workforce will shrink in terms of rate of growth.&nbsp; It shrinks down to almost half, 1.2% per annum.&nbsp; In other words, beyond 2010, due to lower fertility and our ageing population, our local resident workforce will start shrinking.&nbsp; Today, the gap is largely filled by foreign workers, coming in <p align=left>Column: 2509<p>at all levels.&nbsp; We will continue to need them to help our economy meet its manpower needs in future.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Changed Job Landscape</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Ahmad Khalis have&nbsp;asked whether we can paint for them the job landscape.&nbsp; While we are confident that the economy will grow and jobs will be created, there is one thing that this Government cannot promise,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>and that is, to provide only jobs of the type that are appealing and attractive to Singaporeans. No government can promise this. What types of jobs exist in our economy cannot be mandated by the wishes and wants of Singaporeans or the Government, but by market place realities.&nbsp; As Members have understood and expressed, the job market has fundamentally changed.&nbsp; And even though we have more jobs than Singaporeans, groups of workers are at risk due to&nbsp;structural unemployment.&nbsp; I will talk about this later.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">5.00 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even despite growth, unemployment will hover at around 3% to 4%.&nbsp; There is a mismatch of job seekers against the jobs that exist in expectations and skills.&nbsp; If this is not addressed, unemployment will go higher.

We will work with NTUC, our social partners, the Mayors of CDCs and Members of this House to overcome this challenge.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">What type of Jobs?</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Members have asked for more information of the job market.&nbsp; Please refer to Chart 3.&nbsp; This Chart, using educational qualifications as a proxy - it is not a perfect proxy - but it will do for purposes of this illustration.&nbsp; Put<p align=left>Column: 2510<p> succinctly, as our industries move up the value chain, we will need more specialised skills. The blue bars recognise what&nbsp;are present in our workforce.&nbsp; The orange bars represent the gap between what we have and the number of workers we need with those skills that our economy will need.&nbsp; So, if we take education as a proxy for skills,&nbsp;Members will note that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is going to need more workers with post-secondary qualifications and above&nbsp; -&nbsp; NITEC, polytechnic diplomas, degrees and PhDs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the Members mentioned that we have 500,000 <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> workers with less than secondary education. He is right.&nbsp; We have another 500,000 workers with secondary education and below.&nbsp; In other words, we have about a million Singaporeans with secondary and below education.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if we look at the number of jobs projected for this group, there is still an excess, but many Singaporeans do not like these jobs either because the pay is too low or the jobs are unappetising.&nbsp; We will try to redesign the jobs.&nbsp; I will address this later.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we move up, combining the post-secondary, diploma, degree and post-graduate together, our projections show a job shortage of about 350,000 positions until 2009.&nbsp; The greatest shortage is in the post-secondary, those with diplomas. If you ask the businesses why, they will tell you that Singaporeans have great aspirations.&nbsp; They come out of ITE or the polytechnics, you can hold them two to three years, but they want to go and have degrees, and they do not stay long.&nbsp; So, the greatest shortage is in these positions.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers with secondary or less qualifications face the greatest challenge.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked, during the Budget debate, why this gap exists for skilled workers, even when we have been increasing the intakes in our polytechnics and universities. There are two reasons<p align=left>Column: 2511<p> why modern <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has a workforce with 500,000 workers with less than secondary education and another 500,000 with secondary education.&nbsp; I know we have just finished the education debate, but this is my educational pitch.&nbsp; I was listening to Members who were harkening to the good old days of how the system was less stressful and how everybody succeeded&nbsp; -&nbsp; an evaluation seen through rose tinted glasses.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have&nbsp;the structure today because many left the education system in the 1970s and 80s&nbsp; -&nbsp; some out of economic necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us face it, many could not succeed in a less efficient and more wasteful education system. The second reason why we have this structure is complacency.&nbsp; We had 8% to 10% of GDP growth from 1987 to 1997.&nbsp; Workers found jobs easily because the labour market was tight and did not upgrade then.&nbsp; They did not see the need to.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we help our workers upgrade, we must allow companies now to have the skilled workers they need.

DPM Lee showed this Chart during the Budget debate.&nbsp; It bears reiterating.&nbsp; In the last 10 years, 500,000 jobs were created.&nbsp; The net number of jobs in manufacturing was nil.&nbsp; It was almost predominantly in the services sector.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The services sector will be the main driver of employment, but that does mean<p align=left>Column: 2512<p> that we do not need manufacturing, because they generate a lot of indirect impact.&nbsp; Jobs will increase in areas such as hotels and restaurants, in education, healthcare, transport and logistics, communications and media.&nbsp; There are jobs available at all levels.&nbsp; Over the past few years, when you look at our figures, some of the fastest growing occupations in the sector were university lecturers and other education professionals, management consultants and financial analysts on the one hand, and bell boys, cleaners, and security services on the other.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Service skills required</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have asked what this new job landscape means for workers. Will they have the right skills? The shift from manufacturing to services will have implications on our competitive edge. Very few doubt the technical capability of our workforce. Our workers have consistently ranked well globally in terms of productivity and efficiency, according to the BERI reports. They are efficient, diligent and rational to problem solving, and these have served us well. But my point is, in terms of employment, when we are a service driven economy, we will do less well.&nbsp; What is the reason?&nbsp; One of the reasons is that unlike manufacturing where your supply chain is your production line, your products move past you.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the services sector, you have to get used to talking to your production line, because the quality of service lies primarily with the person delivering it, as one interacts with the customers and responds to their needs, be it in the retail, finance, consultancy or healthcare sectors. A large component of value-add is from intangibles, such as service edge, performance, ideas and concepts, which is why I think our changes in the education system are correct.&nbsp; This is for pre-employment training.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2513<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we do for adults?&nbsp; That is the key question. &nbsp; I want to correct the misimpression that services jobs mean lower skills or lower pay. If I can give a simple example, an engineer who is a CEO in the financial industry is considered to be in the services sector.&nbsp; &nbsp; \"Service skills\" are best seen as an additional layer on top of technical skills.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our challenge, therefore, is to maintain the premium for our <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> workforce by adding skills and mindsets to achieve a thriving services sector. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> workers will have to provide customised solutions, handle simultaneous and varied requests. There will be less routine work, and characteristics such as inter-personal relationship, EQ, rapport-building and mentoring will be given emphasis. &nbsp;&nbsp; And this is part of the problem with our HR management systems and employers.&nbsp; Because employers, at the same time, will have to find new ways of measuring workers' productivity given the significant intangibles in the services sector.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge is to build a workforce that drives our reconfigured economy. &nbsp; How do we help workers acquire these new skills that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> needs? Which groups will fall through the gap and are vulnerable to be structurally unemployed, because our job landscape has changed? These were questions asked during the Economic Review Committee, and I will take some time later to explain what our strategy is.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 36.0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Structural Unemployment</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng Chee How asked what the structural unemployment will be like?&nbsp; Will it rise? From 1993 to 2003&nbsp; -&nbsp; he rightly pointed out the figure&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; the resident long-term unemployment rate rose from 0.4% to 1.2%.&nbsp; This is about 22,000 people.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, 60% of our local workforce have secondary or lower education.

The ERC recommended and the Government set up the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) last September, specifically to help unemployed Singaporeans gain employment, and to upgrade the skills of workers in employment. To do this, we will have to revamp our Adult Continuing Education and Training System. The old system cannot address our needs and help surmount our challenges. Which groups to focus on&nbsp; -&nbsp; some Members, like Dr Tan Boon Wan, have identified the older workers and the less skilled&nbsp; -&nbsp; and how to help them are crucial questions.&nbsp; But I would like to break here to allow Members to field further cuts and I will respond together with the issues on the Workforce Development Agency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Jennifer Lee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Upgrading of Workforce</I><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Madam, the Acting Minister, in painting the big picture on jobs and where our workforce is going, has actually covered some of the grounds that I was going to ask him to share with us.&nbsp; But, nevertheless,&nbsp;there is a particular focus which I would like to speak on.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our workforce in Singapore is supplemented by foreigners in three areas&nbsp; - a large number of low and unskilled foreign workers; increasing numbers of highly qualified, highly skilled foreign talent; and now&nbsp;S Pass has been introduced for foreign workers with mid-level skills.&nbsp; I am fully cognisant of the balancing act which the Acting Minister has to perform in allowing in enough foreign manpower to support our industries and companies' growth on the one hand and, on the other, managing local workers' concerns about being<p align=left>Column: 2515<p> displaced, as well as all the problems that too large a foreign workforce brings for any society. The top end skilled foreigners are the least problematic.&nbsp; Even Singaporeans who&nbsp;have expressed unhappiness and concern&nbsp;acknowledge the need to beef up our talent pool in this area.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The large numbers of unskilled foreign workers at the other end of the spectrum are another matter. They have been with us for so many years now, to the extent that we have become very dependent on them to do all the work that Singaporeans do not deign to do.&nbsp; But having easy access to cheap foreign labour retards the upgrading of skills and the investment and equipment in technology, which drives improvement in quality and productivity.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM has recognised the problem in the construction industry and has been using differential levies to encourage upskilling of construction workers.&nbsp; Has MOM any plans to push for increased productivity and quality in other sectors besides construction, to the extent that jobs in these sectors can justify better wages and so become real options for Singaporeans to fill, and we can break out of being locked into the cycle of low wage, low skilled, low productivity jobs?&nbsp; The easy availability of cheap foreign labour, particularly foreign domestic workers, also retards the development of some services which we are going to need and which are much better solutions for us in the long term.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know MOM is now working with various companies to establish home cleaning services.&nbsp; And another area that we are going to need a few years down the road will be home care and home help services for the elderly.&nbsp; With easy availability of foreign domestic workers, it becomes&nbsp;very difficult to have a viable commercial proposition to develop this <p align=left>Column: 2516<p>kind of services.&nbsp; So, could I ask the Acting Minister to share his strategy and plans with regard to the role of foreign labour in our workforce into the future, and how he will be addressing the challenge of supplying the labour that we currently need without retarding the upgrading that we must have to progress?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Madam, there is a concern facing a segment of Singaporean workers today, and I hope that the WDA, in its scope, will address&nbsp;and engage workers to retrain.&nbsp; Almost 30% of our 2.1 million strong workforce is educated at Secondary 2 and below, and the Minister has just talked about that a moment ago.&nbsp; Many of the workers are from the services sector, such as hospitality and transport, and also from the manufacturing sector.&nbsp; These are the most vulnerable groups.&nbsp; There are many Singaporeans with similar profiles who are now already unemployed and those in the manufacturing sector are actually buying time.&nbsp; And we know that the new jobs in the manufacturing sector are on the wane.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2517<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, these are the workers that we need to help most.&nbsp; They are the ones with children to provide for and old folks to care for.&nbsp; I acknowledge, however, that some of these workers do need a mindset change, but some simply cannot be retrained even if they are willing to for various reasons.&nbsp; Some not so hopeful people have remarked that for this group of people, perhaps it is no longer MOM's problem but MCDS' problem.&nbsp; It would be a sad day indeed if that is the case.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last point is with regard to the S Pass.&nbsp; With the S Pass ruling, foreign workers are expected to augment a segment of the jobs in Singapore, presumably, jobs for which Singaporeans are not trained enough for.&nbsp; I wonder whether the Minister could comment on what problems the WDA will&nbsp; face and that we cannot train sufficient Singaporean workers for these jobs.&nbsp; Is it just complacency that we talk about or is there some other reason?&nbsp; But with a better plan that we were shown just now, I hope that perhaps WDA could, with the aid of maybe an inter-agency or inter-Ministry coordination, focus on&nbsp; future ITE graduates and see how we can perhaps train them to augment and take up such slates.&nbsp; Perhaps the Manpower Employment Planning can take into consideration the potential productivity inputs of our future IT graduates and maybe, in time, the S Pass will be a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I end with a call to the WDA partners in the industry and learning networks to continue their collective and creative efforts as well as committed resources in helping Singaporeans.&nbsp; I also call on WDA to celebrate the little successes and inform Singaporeans of such successes every so often so that it raises its profile early in the agency's life and establish itself as the Singaporean worker's lifeline, and certainly another shining example of the tripartite relationship success.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2518<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The mandate of WDA is to champion and enhance workforce development in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; To this end, WDA intends to coordinate national continuing efforts and to manage the development of the workforce development infrastructure.&nbsp; I have three questions for the Minister.&nbsp; First, I would like to ask the Minister to update this House on the progress that WDA has made since its inception.&nbsp; Is there a coherent strategy to effectively and closely monitor the set of skills needed by the industry?&nbsp;&nbsp;And are the retraining and matching programmes on offer sufficiently responsive to both the needs of the industry as well as that of the job seekers?&nbsp; Second, how does WDA engage the industry players and job seekers in this respect?&nbsp; My question has to do with the duplication of some of the activities being undertaken by WDA and that of outside providers.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One observation that has been raised by some quarters is that WDA should confine itself to a minimum regulatory and facilitative function and allow private sector bodies to compete with one another in providing continuing education to job seekers and in matching the skills needed by industries to those of job seekers.&nbsp; Would the Minister kindly comment on this?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, it is noted that WDA has been on a recruitment drive, perhaps necessitated by their expansion plan and in the process creating jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Can the Minister verify whether the Ministry will be filling some of these positions with some retrenched executives on conversion programmes?&nbsp; To-date, does WDA have any retrenched<p align=left>Column: 2519<p> executive on its payroll?&nbsp; I feel that it is important for WDA to take a lead as a role model in engaging some of our retrenched professionals, executives and managers.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Gan See Khem--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

WDA has worked this role well in the past years by working with industries that are still able to provide jobs to Singaporeans.&nbsp; These include precision engineering, hospitality, domestic cleaning, healthcare, wafer fabrication and the social service sector.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The response from unemployed Singaporeans to these initiatives of both the place and train and, where necessary, train and place have been promising.&nbsp; However, as Singapore moves away from an economic recession and Singaporeans see that more job opportunities may come their way, will they still respond in the same way to these initiatives?&nbsp; Will Singaporeans become more choosy and how are we going to motivate Singaporeans to look at the long-term needs to upgrade their skills, so that they can fill the job vacancies that will arise as both foreign and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies start to invest again, given the better economic outlook?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of employers, are they willing to redesign jobs or even enlarge them so that these jobs become more appealing and challenging to Singaporeans?&nbsp; With the introduction of the S Pass, will companies find it more expedient to hire skilled foreign labor rather than invest time and effort to train and place Singaporeans?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA is a new agency and its use should bring it more vibrancy and responsiveness to the changes in the <p align=left>Column: 2520<p>socio-economic environment.&nbsp; Both labour and employers will be interested to hear from WDA and to further understand the new initiatives and strategies that this new agency has or will develop to further serve the needs for the upgrading of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Those who fail to keep up are beginning to face difficulties and they are falling very hard. &nbsp; In the past, during a downturn, a company would halt production, retrench some workers and run down its inventory.&nbsp; But now it is different.&nbsp; Now, the whole company may be uprooted and relocated to sites where the operation cost is cheaper.&nbsp; Overnight, thousands of jobs could be lost.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, now with all this international outsourcing and off-shore trend, it is estimated that two million jobs would be created in cheaper locations.&nbsp; Over the next five years, more than two million jobs would be moving to India and <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; So, we need to look at how we could seek some new growth areas and also help our workers in advance, so that they can upgrade themselves and take on such new jobs.&nbsp; This trend of globalisation, with further consolidation, liberalisation and technological advancement, there will be displacement of unskilled workers, while need for workers in the higher skilled and higher value-added industries will increase. Many jobs which we have been relying on for many years will disappear, and will never come back again.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for the displaced and unemployed, in addition to the provision of short-term financial assistance to tide over their difficult time, I think, most importantly, we have to look into how we could help them to upgrade their skills or to re-skill <p align=left>Column: 2521<p>them so that they can find new jobs.&nbsp; We can use the excuse that our workers are choosy. We should do our best to enhance their employability. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to remind all the employers that whenever there is any job vacancy, they &nbsp; should first of all consider the local workers who are looking for jobs.&nbsp; We are people of one nation.&nbsp; We should help our locals first before we bring in the foreigners. &nbsp; At this moment, we should help our local workers, particularly those who are elderly.&nbsp; As the popular Hokkien song goes, \"You have to fight, then you can win\", and that \"If you are feeling down now, it is all right because it is only for a short while.&nbsp; To be successful, 30% depends on luck and 70% depends on yourself.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;Work hard and do not be downhearted.&nbsp; Never lose the fighting spirit.&nbsp; With the Government behind them, our people should try their best, work hard, keep their jobs, so that their families could be looked after.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, many of our labour MPs decided to divide the various industries among themselves and we would be on a look out for job vacancies for the unemployed.&nbsp; I am looking after the textile industry.&nbsp; With the counselling that we give, we can more effectively match the unemployed to new places of work.&nbsp; I think we should double up our efforts in job guidance and counselling. I do not know whether WDA has any plan to help and prepare the workers &nbsp; to move to the&nbsp; new &nbsp; industries, which have vacancies at the moment.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM Lee mentioned that some 250,000 jobs had been created in the service industry over the past five years.

The older workers keep telling me that the employers are very direct in telling them, \"Look, you are above 45, I am sorry, but we just cannot consider you for this job.\"&nbsp; And this includes higher educated Singaporeans.&nbsp;

And we heard from DPM Lee Hsien Loong last week that the proportion has now gone up to 57%.&nbsp; This is encouraging.&nbsp; But I want to know what happens to the other 43% of the older workers.&nbsp; Did they get thrown back to the jobless pool to sink or swim by themselves?&nbsp; I think there should be a <p align=left>Column: 2523<p>deeper study now on why they did not stay on in the first place.&nbsp;

Going beyond just soft persuasion and the carrot of wage support, if things do not improve for older workers and we continue to see older workers having problems finding jobs, can I ask the Minister to consider seriously setting up an Equal Opportunities Commission, something&nbsp;I have suggested before but which was shot down because it was deemed to result in a rigid labour force?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just looking at the chart that the Minister showed just now.&nbsp;

They do not enjoy outplacement assistance programmes.&nbsp; I understand that the WSTP and the financial assistance provided by MOM in the past for companies have been effective and beneficial in building up the resilience of the professionals, managers and executives and have helped the job seekers and companies change their mindset with regard to the drastic changes and labour needs of the new economy, as well as in preparing the PMEs emotionally for the future, since many companies do not provide outplacement services.&nbsp;

NSRS requires companies to establish organisational procedures for performing work and a system for organisations and their people to benchmark work performance standards and skill acquisition industry-wide.&nbsp; This system helps the organisation to identify the competencies required for carrying out the work, and the training needed by workers to meet the required performance standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think NSRS is a timely initiative implemented by the WDA.&nbsp; It allows our companies to establish work performance standards, identify skills sets needed for the job and, more importantly, to train workers who enter the industry with the requisite skills.&nbsp; Training for workers to achieve work performance standards stipulated by the NSRS is provided by a network of approved training centres (ATC), which conduct approved training programmes.&nbsp; ATCs are located in companies and training institutions.&nbsp; These approved training centres operate through a pool of experienced trainers drawn from industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, however, requiring smaller-size industries or trade groups to set up training centres for skills set training can be quite a strain on their finance and resources.&nbsp; I think WDA should consider whether it would be more sensible for these smaller-size industries or trade groups to work together with the ITEs or polytechnics, especially in cases whereby ITE or polytechnics are already offering similar and relevant courses.&nbsp; I think it is a waste of resources in duplicating training programmes similar to ITE's or the polytechnics' just because WDA or SPRING wants NSRS to be of a different function and taking on&nbsp;a different identity.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Heng Chee How</B>:&nbsp; Madam, I am glad that the Government has decided to augment contributions to the Skills Development Fund (SDF) by raising the Skills Development Levy salary ceiling from $1,500 to $1,800 with effect from 1st January 2004.&nbsp; With the levy rates staying at 1% of the relevant payroll, this will increase the SDF's income by $22 million per year.&nbsp; With more money going into the SDF, more worker training can then be supported.&nbsp; Indeed, the need to raise the income of the SDF came about because of the increased claims on the SDF, which I believe reflects increased training activities on the part of companies making the claims, as well as greater willingness of workers to undergo retraining.&nbsp; This, to me, is actually&nbsp;a good problem to tackle, compared to what it would be if the opposite were to be the case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some companies may see the increased salary ceiling as an increased expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge such companies to instead think of it as an investment provision.&nbsp; Indeed, companies that know how to make full use of the SDF to support their training needs can actually claim more than&nbsp;they individually pay into the Fund.&nbsp; Traditionally, bigger companies have made more use of this source of funding than smaller ones.&nbsp; However, going ahead, I think it will become increasingly important for all companies, regardless of size, to embrace workers' skills training and upgrading fully and regularly.&nbsp; In my earlier cut on jobs for Singaporeans, I spoke of the structural shifts driven by changing technology and competition that compel companies to upgrade or perish.&nbsp; This pressure will only intensify and not recede.&nbsp; So, companies and industry bodies should adjust to the realities and be more proactive in training and retraining.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2528<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at developments during previous upturns from recession, we often hear companies complaining, rather early in those upturns, that they face critical shortages of skilled manpower.&nbsp; They argue that those shortages would then push up wage cost, and sometimes it happens, because companies compete with one another for the limited pool of skilled manpower and poach from one another, thus driving up wage costs.&nbsp; And the next move would be for those companies to raise concerns about cost competitiveness and call for a further&nbsp;relaxation of conditions, to allow them to bring in more foreign manpower.&nbsp; I think all that sounds familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;This sequence of events may yet repeat itself in this upturn.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;it is not as inevitable as it sounds.&nbsp; Because, if companies and industries can take a broader and longer-term view, and invest in the retraining and upgrading of workforce capability, they will enlarge the pool of local skilled manpower.&nbsp; This enlarged pool will then feed the growing needs for a longer period without exerting immediate wage cost pressure owing to a shortage arising.&nbsp; More Singaporean workers will, in the process, also improve their skills and employability, and more will be able to take on the upgraded jobs.&nbsp; This is surely the more sensible and responsible way to move.&nbsp; It is akin to going to a potluck party where each diner contributes a dish and gets to enjoy the full spread that results.&nbsp; It fails when companies think short-term, mistakenly believing that they can free-load on the training investments made by other companies.&nbsp; When every company thinks that way, then everyone stands to lose.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, what plans and programmes his Ministry has to step up the momentum of skills upgrading of workers in anticipation of growing needs in this recovering economy, and what steps will his Ministry be taking to forestall the negative consequences that free-rider tendencies among companies in this area would bring about.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2529<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is evident in the type of jobs available in the market.&nbsp; It is an established fact that there is a shortage of skilled workers.&nbsp; The Minister, earlier in his presentation, has indicated that there is a shortage of workers requiring post-secondary education and above.&nbsp; The shortage is about 360,000 jobs.&nbsp; This has resulted in our State having to depend highly on skilled foreign workers.&nbsp; At the same time, retrenched workers face great difficulties to fit into the jobs available due to the lack of skills required.&nbsp; Many speakers, who have spoken earlier on jobs for Singaporeans, have touched on this specific topic and I do not wish to further dwell on it.&nbsp; This state of affairs in the job market will become even more critical in the years ahead, as there would be greater mismatch of skills and jobs available.&nbsp; It is important to address this in a more comprehensive manner, so that more Singaporeans will be able to take up well-paying jobs.&nbsp; I have to emphasise here that to depend solely on employers alone for training is not helpful.&nbsp; Employers will provide training according to their companies' requirements.&nbsp; This would not result in our workers being multi-skilled.&nbsp; The trend of shorter tenure of employment makes it more important for the provision of training facilities that could enhance our workers' employability.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, many of the jobs available now require diplomas.&nbsp; Earlier on,&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock has mentioned that employers in fact, prefer, polytechnic graduates.&nbsp; That is very true, and&nbsp;we can realise it in the job market when we are trying to help our members.&nbsp; Now workers can go for diploma courses if it comes<p align=left>Column: 2530<p> under SRP, which is employer-driven and, normally, employers are not incentivised to send unless they see the necessity.&nbsp; Under the surrogate employer's scheme, workers can go for diploma programmes in a very limited way.&nbsp; Both the current arrangements for diploma programme are unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Here again, I have to state that many of our 'AO' level workers actually face the greatest difficulty because they do not have both skills and&nbsp;higher education.&nbsp; Will the Minister consider allowing workers to go for diploma programmes under the surrogate employer's scheme without any restrictions or limitations?&nbsp; To control wastage in training, some form of co-payment could be implemented.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">5.45 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I am aware that the cost of tertiary education is high and it will not be practical to tap into the funds of SDF wholly. At the same time, it is very costly for workers to go for tertiary education on their own. Those workers who are prepared to pay for their tertiary education may still need some assistance. Will the Minister consider reviewing the SDF scheme, whereby such workers could claim a small proportion, say, up to 10% of the course fee as a subsidy?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in conclusion, to address the various needs of individual training needs in an ever-changing employment structure, would the Minister seriously consider the introduction of a learning account which has been brought up in the past?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2531<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Madam, I must say that it was a sense of satisfaction when Members asked the right type of questions that come about from them&nbsp;appreciating with me as I expressed the difficulties in the job landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a very important starting point. We have moved from making motherhood statements about how we need to provide livelihoods and jobs, to grappling with real problems on the ground because we have understood what the structure of workforce is, the type of work that is coming.&nbsp; So, when Mr Arthur Fong said, let us&nbsp;play up&nbsp;some initial successes, I will try.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPs have asked how Government can help, and many of them agree, and I take&nbsp;it is&nbsp;unanimous that WDA's role is pivotal.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;Members said that it has got its work&nbsp;cut out for it.&nbsp; Indeed, I want to remind&nbsp;the House&nbsp;what was said about WDA when we moved the Bill last year.&nbsp; Yes, it&nbsp;has been&nbsp;only six months since the WDA&nbsp;was set up.&nbsp; We said that:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"We have spoken much during these past few months about the challenges of globalisation.&nbsp; We will meet these challenges head-on. We cannot rely on artificial barriers to protect our jobs. We must upgrade and give investors an incentive to locate and stay here because of a highly-trained workforce. The establishment of WDA signals Government's strong commitment to help Singaporeans stay employable and maintain our lead with a disciplined and technically competent workforce.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many would have remembered the words that WDA is pro-Singaporean.&nbsp; \"Jobs for Singaporeans\" is a mantra.&nbsp; Yes, we pledged that WDA will reach out to all workers, rank-and-file, as well as professionals and executives, employed or looking for jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this opportunity to give an update, even though it has only been six months.&nbsp; In terms of job placements,<p align=left>Column: 2532<p> since September 2003, together with our partners at CDCs and NTUC, we have placed about 12,000 Singaporeans, and these include Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) into jobs.&nbsp; But more important than just the numbers, the job placements achieved by our various job centres under the Distributed CareerLink Network have gone up by about 20%.&nbsp; In other words, more Singaporeans&nbsp;are taking up&nbsp;the jobs they were referred for.&nbsp;&nbsp;That reflects that there is a mindset change.&nbsp; And I also say more important, because it indicates that we have put in better capabilities in our job matching systems. What has been put in place specifically?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, since December 2003, we have put up a national job bank.&nbsp; In other words, the various job centres can share information about what jobs&nbsp;there are.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we have put in a national&nbsp;job seeker's bank.&nbsp; In other words, they can share information about the people that come to them for their profile and then the little notes that they put on the screen to indicate the peculiarities or the types of industries they want.&nbsp; That has helped.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also trained more career counsellors. We have trained officers at various job centres.&nbsp; We have worked with NTUC to train some 200 union leaders and Industrial Relations Officers as job counsellors to help retrenched workers transit to a new job, as well as with the CDCs, and some 100 grassroots leaders of the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC have been trained as job counsellors to help unemployed residents.&nbsp; We did that because, very early on, we realised that a job counsellor's job is not saying: \"You are&nbsp;retrenched, you need a job, here&nbsp;is the job\",&nbsp;the two should marry and bliss!&nbsp; It was never that simple, and we quickly recognised that there were specific skills that we required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2533<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have said that we should open up training.&nbsp; Yes, I agree that we should open up training.&nbsp; But I want to remind Members of the House that, as in all Ministries, there is a limited budget.&nbsp; So, we have also decided that we also need to be more targeted.&nbsp; We have put in place new Place-and-Train programmes -&nbsp; some&nbsp;Members have asked how effective that is - to re-skill job seekers in the domestic cleaning, precision engineering, wafer fabrication, textile and healthcare sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell&nbsp;Members why I decided we should do this.&nbsp; When I looked over the past few years of what our budget went in, where the workers were trained, there was no correlation between the numbers of people training in that sector against, what Dr Jennifer Lee said, an increase in productivity or more workers going into that sector.&nbsp; The cleaning sector is a typical example. We have thousands upon thousands being trained as cleaners.&nbsp; You and I know that our cleaning industry has not changed that much.&nbsp; So we decided that we better be targeted, which is Dr Jennifer Lee's point, raise the standard of the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be holistic, get the right people in, see which is the growth sector and then move.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also done Job Preparation Exercises (JPE) to help people get placed.&nbsp; In other words, instead of the usual job fairs, referrals and saying, \"This is&nbsp;a list,&nbsp;go find it\", we realised that was not enough.&nbsp; WDA decided to revise its approach and it started with the electronics sector.&nbsp; It started asking employees, \"What do you&nbsp;need?\" - a sensible question.&nbsp; And then, it developed Job Preparation Exercises to screen, select and match these candidates to these jobs.&nbsp; For instance, employers in the electronics sector said that they needed people with basic literacy skills and those who are not colour blind, because the components have colours.&nbsp; If they are colour blind, when the production lines <p align=left>Column: 2534<p>move, they will put things in the wrong place.&nbsp; I am not sure whether my officers are now doing the colour blind charts.&nbsp; I presume they are.&nbsp; I presume that they ask people whether they are colour blind.&nbsp; If they say they are, then they will find them other jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we put job seekers through mock-up exercises. This is a clean room at the job fairs. This is what they will be exposed to, video-taped, so that they are more prepared. The placement for electronics jobs has more than doubled as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these are positive aspects -&nbsp;initial successes, as Mr Arthur Fong said -&nbsp;WDA must and will go further than just placing Singaporeans in jobs. I recognise that this is an important initiative, but it is nonetheless reactive and does not fundamentally address the challenges that we all understand and need and say that we need to address.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help address this structural mismatch, WDA's efforts must be predominantly proactive, pre-emptive, forward-looking, and outcome-focused.&nbsp; In other words, we must also change industries.&nbsp; To accomplish this, as recommended by the Economic Review Committee, we said that our Adult Continuing Education and Training (CET) system must be revamped.&nbsp; The old system is not quite adequate.&nbsp; This is a monumental task.&nbsp; We spend 4% of GDP on pre-employment training.&nbsp; How much do I spend on adult employment training?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a limited budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we are seized by this.&nbsp; We will not, as Mr Arthur Fong said, see this as a MCDS problem. This is a MOM problem, but this is work-in-progress.&nbsp; Let me give a few examples to illustrate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, targeted sectors.&nbsp; We must develop sector-specific initiatives. First of <p align=left>Column: 2535<p>all, we need to go where the jobs are and make Singaporeans ready for them - all the jobs ready for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis asked earlier on how we are going to meet the shortages in nursing and shipping.&nbsp; Dr Jennifer Lee also mentioned nursing.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;let me illustrate by using these industries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On shipping,&nbsp;a NUS study indicated that there are presently about 3,400 vacancies in the maritime industry.&nbsp; I have 90,000 unemployed, whereas there are&nbsp;3,400 vacancies in the maritime industry.&nbsp; And yet, it is not popular. About 80% of these vacancies in the maritime industry are in the shipbuilding and repair sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA is currently working with the marine industries.&nbsp; We recognised that simply telling people, \"Look,&nbsp;there are jobs in the marine industry, please do\", was not enough.&nbsp; So, last year, many of you followed me when I recounted my experience when I went&nbsp;with the Mayors.&nbsp; One particular Mayor was dressed in a yellow dress - there is only one female Mayor anyway - hoisted up for all to behold, but very few takers after that.&nbsp; It was a glorious sight, but somehow did not work, ie, it did not entice people into the shipbuilding industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we decided to look at this problem and perhaps be less ambitious&nbsp;on the lower sector&nbsp;and look at the supervisory sector and to let us be realistic.&nbsp; If we try to get Singaporeans into this sector, it must be well-paying, let us look at the supervisory sector.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;we looked at the current level of supervisors.&nbsp; The supervisors&nbsp;they now have in the shipbuilding industry have worked in the industry for many years - many nationalities, but very few Singaporeans.&nbsp; They tell me that these supervisors are actually managers. What do they manage?&nbsp; They manage different foreign worker populations.&nbsp;They hire sub <p align=left>Column: 2536<p>supervisors, ie,&nbsp;for the PRC workers, there is a PRC supervisor, for the Bangladesh workers there is a Bangladesh supervisor, etc, and&nbsp;they just manage.&nbsp; We have to reclaim these industries for Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need highly trained and experienced supervisors, and it is not poor paying.&nbsp; A supervisor earns $2,500 per month. But I cannot get enough people to do this.&nbsp; We tried career fairs and&nbsp;recruitment drives&nbsp;with limited results. We changed tactics over what we have done.&nbsp; Mr Arthur Fong and Dr Jennifer Lee asked&nbsp;what are the significant initiatives that we have taken.&nbsp; Let me try to give one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now working&nbsp;with the Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI) on joint NexGen, an&nbsp;initiative&nbsp;with a longer timeline, but&nbsp;sensible.&nbsp; And we are working with MOE and MINDEF.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we have to change mindsets early, even while they are in school.&nbsp; The NexGen scheme will therefore target Normal (Technical) students to give them a better understanding of shipyard work, while they are still impressionable.&nbsp; We can bring them to the shipyards and show them what we have. We will select the NT students, let them go through a customised apprenticeship programme conducted by ITE and the various shipyards. We will also want to bring their parents,&nbsp;as we have to change the parents' mindsets, and familiarise them with the yards.&nbsp; Our generation grew up with the Spyros tragedy.&nbsp; For all I know, that is the mental image that is in the parents' mind.&nbsp; But the shipyards have changed tremendously.&nbsp; I need to change their mindsets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA is also exploring with MINDEF on the possibility of having these selected students serve their National Service with the Republic of Singapore Navy, so that they can pick up valuable hands-on experience in maintaining and repairing ships. Mr Heng Chiang Ngee, President of<p align=left>Column: 2537<p> ASMI, is confident that NexGen will succeed in addressing the needs of the marine industry. In other words, if I have lost one generation, I will reclaim the next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, WDA and MPA will work together with key players in the maritime industry, because there are also important sectors there, and&nbsp;it suits our purpose to be an international maritime centre, whether it is in ship owning, rig building, repair, maritime finance and insurance,&nbsp;or maritime law.&nbsp; We have been asking people to come into these courses, even at polytechnics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1987, we handled about 300 scholarships but yet we cannot.&nbsp; Let me explain to you that these are not unattractive scholarships.&nbsp; I asked for figures from my staff.&nbsp; We are so keen to have such workers, so much so that we are willing to fund them the moment they enter polytechnic.&nbsp; Together with MOT, we fund them, we fully pay for their courses in the maritime course and, on top of that, they get an allowance&nbsp;of $5,000 a year.&nbsp; They are bonded, but, in this climate, it is quite good to be bonded after they come out.&nbsp; Even then, I cannot get enough Singaporeans to fill up those scholarships.&nbsp; Only about 70% of local students are in these maritime-related programmes at the polytechnics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many&nbsp;Members mentioned nursing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for Health,&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Khaw Boon Wan, has said that they are short of nurses. They need about 1,400 nurses a year to cope with the demand. WDA and MOH will work with our partner agencies to close this mismatch.&nbsp; First, we ramped up the Pre-Employment Training. We have increased our intake from 700 in 2000 to 1,000, &nbsp;ie, 30% in four years.&nbsp;That is quite significant, but&nbsp;still not enough. So what should we do?&nbsp; We can get people to make&nbsp;mid-career changes for&nbsp;those<p align=left>Column: 2538<p> who need jobs to change to nursing, such as attracting former nurses back to nursing.&nbsp; Our efforts are working.&nbsp; In our recent healthcare fair, MOM received 6,000 applications for about 650 healthcare positions, many of them in non-nursing positions as well.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>Within a one-month application period this year, more than 500 Singaporeans applied for 100 places in nursing conversion programme - these are mid-career ones.&nbsp; The calibre of applicants is very high.&nbsp; I have met some of them - IT professionals, engineers and teachers.&nbsp; I spoke specifically to an architect.&nbsp; They are passion-driven.&nbsp; Nursing would be very interesting for the next few years.&nbsp; They are very perspective.&nbsp; They will go into a ward, and if he is an architect he will start telling you to redesign the hospitals because it is inefficient.&nbsp; But, despite such increases in local recruitment, we still face a considerable shortage.&nbsp; As healthcare services are required by our aging population and as we develop ourselves into a medical hub, we are chronically short of nurses.&nbsp; We cannot get enough.&nbsp; So these are sector-specific initiatives.&nbsp; I am pouring money there, and I am going to take a similar approach in aerospace, creative industry, electronics, hospitality, precision engineering and retail.&nbsp; These are growth sectors.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But I also agree we have to make access simpler and easier for Singaporeans, not only to acquire new skills, but relevant skills.&nbsp; I want to move away from just training.&nbsp; In other words, to convince workers to train, the skills must be worth acquiring.&nbsp; It must be worth something.&nbsp; There must be currency, either currency from the employee's point of view or from the employer's point of view, preferably both.&nbsp; How do we do this?&nbsp; To do this, the skills that one acquires must have uniform currency to cross sectors.&nbsp; WDA will work with industry partners and post-secondary education institutions to set up a National <p align=left>Column: 2539<p>Skills Framework.&nbsp; We need to ensure that there is consistency of skills sets so that Module A meets a certain standard across skills.&nbsp; We will start by asking employers:&nbsp; what do you need?&nbsp; We have 500,000 Singaporeans with less than secondary education.&nbsp; The approach is not to help them get \"O\" levels. &nbsp;I think that would be disastrous, and they do not need to have \"O\" levels.&nbsp; They need sector-specific skills.&nbsp; I have to ask employers what are their needs, and if I train someone with those skills, what is it worth to them?&nbsp; What is it worth to the employee?&nbsp; We do not need to re-invent the wheel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We can ride on the present National Skills Recognition System - broaden and deepen it into a National Skills Framework.&nbsp; Under this framework, individual workers will enjoy greater and easier access to training.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we are going to have modular and flexible programmes, and we want to take into account his prior working experience, what he has done over the last 15 years.&nbsp; It cannot be immaterial or irrelevant.&nbsp; From where his starting point is, how do we shift him to the next position?&nbsp; WDA is piloting this framework in a few sectors.&nbsp; We are starting with retail and healthcare.&nbsp; Both employers and unions have given us positive feedback.&nbsp; So, we will press on.&nbsp; But to do this, I need to raise trainers' standards.&nbsp; We have very good teachers who know how to teach the young ones but we do not have that many teachers who know how to teach adults.&nbsp; Of course, if we set ourselves the standards, then we will understand why we have the problem because sometimes our attention span, at least mine, is quite limited.&nbsp; We need to help trainers and training providers enhance their capabilities to ensure higher standards,<p align=left>Column: 2540<p> and I would provide funding to train better adult teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth aspect of the National Skills Framework is that we need to move from paper qualifications to directly usable skills, and for workers to acquire those skills in a shorter time.&nbsp; I do not think it makes sense to tell them, \"You do not have the educational qualifications, you will have to take a 2-year part-time course.&nbsp; I will set up the time for you\".&nbsp; Two years is a very long time.&nbsp; One such programme we are piloting is called Functional Literacy for Our Workers (FLOW) -&nbsp;I have a specific department in my Ministry that deals with creative acronyms.&nbsp; Before the development of FLOW by WDA, the lowest standard of literacy was Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST).&nbsp; BEST Module 1 was pegged at Primary 3 - very sensible - that was the lowest module.&nbsp; But, even there, you exclude a large group of workers whose literacy level was too low even to cope with BEST Module 1.&nbsp; What are you going to do?&nbsp; So under FLOW, we say, let us customise the contents so that it is directly relevant to the work place context.&nbsp; This is my understanding of it, not my staff.&nbsp; They can disclaim responsibility for me.&nbsp; I call it the \"SIA girl\" approach.&nbsp; You need to teach the SIA stewardess contextualised literacy, \"How are you, Sir?&nbsp; Can I help you?\"&nbsp; And, of course, as the joke goes, \"Study lor,&nbsp;cannot meh\".&nbsp; We need to teach the person contextualised skills for&nbsp;the work.&nbsp; By the end of the course, workers should be able to communicate effectively in their job in simple English.&nbsp; It is a good idea, but will it work?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA piloted its first class on FLOW at Baxter Healthcare.&nbsp; Baxter Healthcare has 18 production workers who have been with the company since it was set up 26 years ago.&nbsp; These 18 workers now are aged between 50-60 years.&nbsp; So they were about 25-35 years old when they started<p align=left>Column: 2541<p> work there.&nbsp; They have little or no formal education - very low literacy rates.&nbsp; They were working in the last manual production line of the company and needed to upgrade their skills to handle automated line, or risk being redeployed.&nbsp; Some of you may ask why Baxter took so long -&nbsp;never mind,&nbsp;they can answer that question.&nbsp; The upgrading training helps them to identify the name of parts, types of defects and so forth, but in English.&nbsp; WDA worked with Baxter to deliver the FLOW programme for these workers.&nbsp; They ran a module from 1st December last year to 12th March this year.&nbsp; The feedback has been quite positive.&nbsp; This is what the HR manager says, \"The FLOW programme has definitely come at the right time, as without basic English literacy it is very difficult for employees to upgrade their skills, eg, technical and IT skills.&nbsp; We believe that this programme is a critical stepping stone for many of our older workers to keep up with the competition in the new economy.\"&nbsp; We asked the participants:&nbsp; how was it?&nbsp; They were equally positive.&nbsp; They said their confidence was boosted.&nbsp; For once they said, \"We can upgrade\", because they were able to speak to each other in simple sentences.&nbsp; We are not sure what they said, but they were able to speak to each other and, therefore, they are more receptive to learning English.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fund all these initiatives I have decided to raise the contributions to the Skills Development Levy (SDL) as announced by DPM.&nbsp; And I thank&nbsp;the many Members&nbsp;for&nbsp;their support and&nbsp;agreed that we should do this.&nbsp; Why did I do this?&nbsp; Let me explain to you how the funding for training is obtained.&nbsp; There are two streams.&nbsp; The first stream is called the Life-Long Learning Fund (LLF).&nbsp; This is Government's commitment, and it put in $1.5 billion as an endowment.&nbsp; The other source is employers' commitment to train Singaporeans.&nbsp; We get it from employers because we believe that it is equally important for employers to be committed<p align=left>Column: 2542<p> to train their workers.&nbsp; So the levy is pegged at 1% of remuneration of all workers with a gross monthly salary of $1,500 or less, currently.&nbsp; At the current levy rate of 1%, at the salary ceiling of $1,500, SDF would have been depleted long ago.&nbsp; Therefore, Government further injected $500 million into that fund.&nbsp; I have raised the ceiling from $1,500 to $1,800 with effect from <st1:date Month=\"7\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2004\">1st July 2004</st1:date>.&nbsp; If economic recovery is sustained, we will think of raising it to $2,000 subsequently.&nbsp; This was announced a few years ago, but was held back.&nbsp; Raising the ceiling from $1,500 to $1,800 will cost $22 million per annum.&nbsp; It is not a big sum and it only represents 0.03% of the annual compensation of employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh made the point in the Budget Debate that this would tax SMEs.&nbsp; My rejoinder is that SMEs can also take from this fund.&nbsp; Because we pool this money, employers can apply for their trainees.&nbsp; And the smart ones have.&nbsp; Atlas Vending Pte Ltd is a company that operates and rents out vending machines and jukeboxes since 1980.&nbsp; The group employs about 100 employees.&nbsp; For the last three years, it received $18,000 SDF funding.&nbsp; They were smart.&nbsp; They did not complain.&nbsp; They just took.&nbsp; I urge other SMEs to follow this example.&nbsp; In fact, we have introduced a specific scheme for SMEs.&nbsp; It is called SME Upgrading for Performance (SUPER).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked whether more grants can be extended to more training providers and that WDA does not duplicate some of the functions of primary providers.&nbsp; Let me assure her that WDA has its hands full.&nbsp; We promise that we will do the minimum and, in fact, we will not be a training provider.&nbsp; We are not.&nbsp; We do not provide training programmes.&nbsp; We basically use, as Mr Low has correctly pointed out, any provider that meets the criteria and fulfils the goals of our programmes.&nbsp; But I want to see the programmes translated either to <p align=left>Column: 2543<p>employability or enhanced employability.&nbsp; Training is provided by our network of approved training centres and we will provide funding at $6-$10 per trainee hour.&nbsp; Employers can set up these in-house NSRS approved training centres and approved assessment centres.&nbsp; Mr Low asked whether the smaller companies can do it because it is hard for them.&nbsp; I understand their problems.&nbsp; We do not restrict ITE from working with them.&nbsp; If ITE feels that they can use them, I would encourage them to. But my sense, for practical reason, is that they should probably come together and approach ITE to have a specific programme.&nbsp; If we are satisfied that it translates to better jobs or longer in the job, we will fund the programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng Chee How asked about individual training.&nbsp; This was a point echoed by Mr Nithiah Nandan.&nbsp; Government does provide subsidies for individual training.&nbsp; He mentioned surrogate employer programme where we fund 90-100% of the course fees.&nbsp; This programme is administered by NTUC and the five self-help groups who act as surrogate employers for such workers.&nbsp; We have provided $19 million of SDF funding to about 28,000 training places last year.&nbsp; This concept has worked well and I agree with him the funding can be enhanced.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Nithiah Nandan asked&nbsp;whether we can also support polytechnics, ITE training, and even university - a small proportion.&nbsp; I was quite receptive until he used the words \"without restriction and limitation\".&nbsp; I took extra notice.&nbsp; Well, the first answer is yes, we will.&nbsp; $19 million in 2004 for about 20,000 training places&nbsp;- that will be the restriction and limitation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to specific groups that Members have asked about.&nbsp; Dr Tan<p align=left>Column: 2544<p> Boon Wan, Ms Irene Ng and Mdm Ho Geok Choo&nbsp;asked about&nbsp;lower skilled workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are quite right to highlight this group.&nbsp; The bulk of the resident workers of those without or below secondary education are between the ages of 35 and 54.&nbsp; In other words, they have another 10-15 years within the workforce.&nbsp; About four out of 10 of the resident long-term unemployed belong to this group.&nbsp; Members have asked what we can do to specifically help them.&nbsp; What we are doing is to look at the job market.&nbsp; Where are the skills that the jobs which require lower academic qualifications?&nbsp; We have identified these jobs in electronics, precision engineering and sewing operators.&nbsp; Because of our FTA, textile is coming back, as well as front-line jobs in hospitality sectors and cleaning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me focus on cleaning.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;Members are aware of it because&nbsp;they sit on Town Councils as councillors and advisors, and that many of the people cleaning our estates are foreign workers.&nbsp; This is another area we want to reclaim.&nbsp; I am trying to reclaim the shipyards.&nbsp; This is another area I want to reclaim as well.&nbsp; I want to thank Mr Ang Mong Seng, as he has been active in this.&nbsp; It is his passion.&nbsp; Mr Lim Swee Say, once a unionist, always a unionist, has great passion too and I appreciate his support, both in hawker centres, and now in Town Council jobs.&nbsp; We are working with NEA and&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng.&nbsp; \"Let us reclaim this territory.&nbsp; We have drawn the battle map.&nbsp; This ground we take\".&nbsp; So what do we need to do?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It worked well.&nbsp; What these projects would need is to restructure the contracts -&nbsp;to reward based on performance, higher mechanisation and help to train better <p align=left>Column: 2545<p>workers.&nbsp; We will announce the specifics of this scheme later.&nbsp; We think there are significant job opportunities -&nbsp;a few thousand jobs that are available for Singaporeans if we can get the cleaning industry to upgrade.&nbsp; And this is in direct reference to Dr&nbsp;Jennifer Lee's question.&nbsp; How do we change?&nbsp; And she is right.&nbsp; If you reach a tipping point, if you are competitive based on cost and low skills, you are on a slippery slope.&nbsp; We will reclaim it by upgrading industry and training workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also assist conceptualised industry programmes in other workplaces.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked specific programmes for older workers.&nbsp; I empathise with her.&nbsp; I see them as well.&nbsp; She said, \"What would I say?\"&nbsp;&nbsp; I also see many of them and, sometimes, I just listen because I understand their problems,&nbsp; although I must tell you that the situation has improved.&nbsp; In 2003, the redeployment rate within six months after retrenchment for all groups was about 62%.&nbsp; For those 50 and lower, it was about 56%, 6% less.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;not bad.&nbsp; More importantly, it has improved compared to 2001.&nbsp; In 2001, the re-employment rate for this group was 43%. There was a 13% jump.&nbsp; And it proves the point that growth stimulates jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the numbers also tell us that the People-for-Jobs-Traineeship programme has helped.&nbsp; I know you have heard the figures, but allow me to gloat a little.&nbsp; It is a good programme.&nbsp; We provide basically wage support to allow these workers to prove themselves for six to nine months.&nbsp; Yes, we benefited&nbsp;about 16,000 older workers, 57% stayed beyond the six months of wage support.&nbsp; I will study, as Mrs Irene Ng has suggested, what happened to the other 43%.&nbsp; This glass is a little more than half full, but I will also look at the other portion which is empty.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2546<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from this, we are looking again at sector specific industries that can&nbsp;give jobs for these workers, for example, the textile industry.&nbsp; 77% of the participants of the Place and Train programme are workers above 40 years old.&nbsp; After three weeks of training, which is not very long, they are employed as sewing operators.&nbsp; And I understand that the entire batch is still working on these jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our move away from the seniority based wage -&nbsp;our wage restructuring efforts - needs to be seen in this light, that it will help hire and re-employ many mature workers.&nbsp; We will also extend our job preparation exercises, as I have mentioned, in the electronics sector.&nbsp; About 30% of job seekers in the electronics sector were 40 years old.&nbsp; And I echo the sentiments of Members of this House who say that employers must change their mindsets.&nbsp; I also want to acknowledge that there are many enlightened employers. For example, in the healthcare sector,&nbsp;both clusters -&nbsp;the National Healthcare Group and SingHealth, this is the age of equal clustering -&nbsp;have been taking in mature workers to make career conversion programmes.&nbsp; Other employers should follow their lead and rid themselves of the unjustified prejudice against mature workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked why not set up an Equal Opportunities Commission.&nbsp; She says that the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a beacon of that process.&nbsp; We looked a bit closer at this beacon.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the&nbsp;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&nbsp; received 81,000&nbsp;complaints.&nbsp; 7% of these complaints showed that they had reasonable cause and, finally, after all the hudgy-pudgy, 0.4% or&nbsp;370 cases resulted in direct suits.&nbsp; The reality on the ground&nbsp;is that it is very hard,&nbsp;and she asked, can you fault the employers.&nbsp; If an employer does not want to hire someone, he can use many reasons.&nbsp; It is very difficult.&nbsp; So,<p align=left>Column: 2547<p> the point is not&nbsp;to start a commission.&nbsp; Because after doing all this work, it is just difficult.&nbsp; The key is to give our mature workers intrinsic, inherent, indigenous values.&nbsp; That is their premium&nbsp;and they can go to a number of sectors and get employed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Heng Chee How asked about professionals, managers, executivess and technicians (PMETs).&nbsp; They are quite right.&nbsp; The last three years saw an increase in the incidence of retrenchment in this group,&nbsp;mainly because of the reorganisation and&nbsp;restructuring in the financial and ICT industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked what programmes are there to cater specifically for them, as well as for people with higher degrees, as Mr Nithiah Nandan has asked. &nbsp;We have specific programmes,&nbsp;like the skilled manpower conversion programme.&nbsp; We launched it with healthcare.&nbsp; And today, we have 109 Singaporeans undergoing training to be nurses, 19 to be radiographers, another 100 are targeted to start nursing training in July this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also extended this to the hospitality sector.&nbsp; WDA and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> Tourism Board launched a number of executive development courses, targeted at local executives working in the hotel industry.&nbsp; A new work study programme is also in place to help attract executives into the hotel industry,&nbsp;and this is a diploma programme.&nbsp; We will consider similar programmes in other sectors.&nbsp; We will also help fill PMETs into job vacancies.&nbsp; We helped about 2,000&nbsp;in the last&nbsp;three months of this year.&nbsp; Yes, we will work with universities and&nbsp;polytechnics to give more information to companies so that they can understand the challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA also collaborates with Singapore Professionals' and Executives' Co-operative&nbsp;(SPEC) to establish a talent<p align=left>Column: 2548<p> centre.&nbsp; Under this programme, SPEC will outreach to various employers to secure both permanent and contract employment opportunities, specifically for PMETs.&nbsp; We will provide six months of wage support to companies who employ older PMETs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, some Members have asked about 'S' pass.&nbsp; I propose to defer that because there are further questions down the road.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is to prevent the abuse of the S Passes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, I would like to urge Singaporeans to have a big heart to welcome these workers. They are here not to take away our jobs but to create more jobs as companies will expand with the inflow of more skilled workers. We should welcome them to settle down here and become our citizens. We are a small country.

At the same time, there are Singaporeans who are looking for jobs but cannot find enough jobs which they are competent of handling.&nbsp; Thus, we need to introduce S Pass for foreign workers to take up the jobs that Singaporeans do not have the relevant skills. At the same time, the Workforce Development Authority needs to introduce more programmes to re-skill workers who cannot match the jobs available here.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, I still think that it is important for me to register the concern&nbsp;of Singaporeans, as many see this as opening yet another door to foreign talents, when so many doors are already open to them.&nbsp; The point I wish to stress is that Singaporeans are not averse to competing for jobs,&nbsp;so long as the basis is fair and takes into account our context and needs, but they feel that the competition from the S Passes would be unfair.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain why.&nbsp; Firstly, up to now, there is a limit on the sources from which we draw our foreign talents or foreign workers.&nbsp; They are usually confined to traditional or non-traditional sources. &nbsp;In the case of the non-traditional sources, there are still restrictions as they usually come from <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; There is greater flexibility for the \"P\" or professional passes, but they are usually senior level executives earning much higher pay.&nbsp; So it is not a major concern.&nbsp; With the S Passes, however, there will be no limit on resources that we are drawing from for the supply of workers, and they can come from Australia, New Zealand, or<p align=left>Column: 2551<p> the Eastern European countries, or anywhere else in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point to note as to why Singaporeans are concerned is that the minimum wage of the S Passes is pegged at only $1,800.&nbsp; With the levy of only $50, employers need only pay $1,850.&nbsp; Does this place this category of S Pass workers in direct competition with our universities and polytechnic graduates with two to three years of experience?&nbsp; Although there is a cap of 5%, experience shows that, over time, this gap is not sustainable,&nbsp;as employers will start pressuring for more S Passes as a convenient way out for them.&nbsp; We have seen this happening in the manufacturing and services sectors, both of which started with lower number of foreign workers but which, over time, gets pushed up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Singaporeans are also concerned because S Passes will be employed in sectors that provide high value-added jobs, such as the pharmaceutical sector,&nbsp;and sectors where we, Singaporeans, have been told that these are the jobs which are meant for us.&nbsp; The question I would like to ask the Minister is what assurance would be given to Singaporeans, particularly our university and polytechnic graduates, that they will not be displaced by cheaper<p align=left>Column: 2552<p> foreign workers in such jobs.&nbsp; Will these S Passes act as a disincentive for Singaporeans to upgrade themselves?&nbsp; What assurance is there that employers will not take the easy way out of employing S Pass workers instead of training their own workers to do these jobs?&nbsp; Is there a system in place in MOM to monitor and prevent abuses by employers?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
