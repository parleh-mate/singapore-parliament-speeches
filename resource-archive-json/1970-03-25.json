Normally,  all\r\n\r\ndispossessed  families  from  clearance  sites  are\r\n\r\nrehoused  in  Housing and Development  Board  flats\r\n\r\nwhere  they will settle down permanently. But there\r\n\r\nare  instances where, after having stayed in  these\r\n\r\nflats  for  some time, these people  have  to  face\r\n\r\nclearance  action for a second time  because  their\r\n\r\nflats  are  to  be demolished for redevelopment  as\r\n\r\nhigh-rise flats I will quote a few cases which have\r\n\r\ncome   to  my  knowledge.  This  is  what  I   have\r\n\r\nexperienced in recent months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four blocks of the former three-storey S.I.T.\r\n\r\nflats  along  Old  Airport Road in my  constituency\r\n\r\nwere  affected by the redevelopment scheme. In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  giving  assistance to  their  rehousing\r\n\r\nproblems, I discovered that a few families who  had\r\n\r\nbeen  displaced  once before had  to  face  another\r\n\r\nclearance  action  for  a  second  time.   In   one\r\n\r\ninstance, the displaced\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfamily had hardly resettled for a month  at\r\n\r\ntheir  present flat when they had to move.  Another\r\n\r\nresettler  was  very  bitter  about  having  to  be\r\n\r\nevicted  again within a short space of four months.\r\n\r\nThis  particular  resettler told  me  that  he  was\r\n\r\nrehoused  from  Beach Road where his  property  was\r\n\r\nacquired by the Government at a price far below the\r\n\r\nmarket  value.  In another case, a  tenant  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board was transferred only eight months ago\r\n\r\nfrom  his former flat which he had declined to  buy\r\n\r\nover.  There  were also two rehousing  cases  which\r\n\r\ntook place about a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the above cases you will be convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the  Housing and Development Board have  been\r\n\r\nvery   careless  and  irresponsible  in   rehousing\r\n\r\ndisplaced  families. It seems to me that they  have\r\n\r\ntotally  no regard or consideration for people  who\r\n\r\nhave  to suffer all the inconveniences, the  most\r\n\r\nserious of which is the problem of school transfers\r\n\r\nfor their children. Is there no proper coordination\r\n\r\namong  the various departments of the Housing Board\r\n\r\nover  the  matters of rehousing and redevelopment?\r\n\r\nSir,  you  will  agree with me  that  planning  for\r\n\r\nredevelopment takes some considerable  time  before\r\n\r\nit   can  be  implemented.  Of  course,  there   is\r\n\r\nsufficient time for the architects in the  Building\r\n\r\nDepartment  of the Board to keep the  Lettings  and\r\n\r\nResettlement Departments informed of the areas that\r\n\r\nwill  be  affected  by redevelopment  schemes.  The\r\n\r\nLettings  Department will not then  release  vacant\r\n\r\nflats  in  the area to the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\nfor  rehousing  purposes. If this  had  been  done,\r\n\r\nthere  would not have been the cases which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now.  In this  respect,  will  the\r\n\r\nMinister kindly seek an assurance from the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board that care will be taken  not\r\n\r\nto  rehouse dispossessed families in any area  that\r\n\r\nis  likely to be affected by redevelopment schemes?\r\n\r\nAlso,  can he ascertain from the Housing  Board  if\r\n\r\nthere   is  any  co-ordination  among  the  various\r\n\r\ndepartments  over  the  matters  of  rehousing  and\r\n\r\nredevelopment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay I be given permission to deal with the National\r\n\r\nDevelopment Division first and later on my Minister\r\n\r\nwill deal with the Law Division?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the point raised by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kampong Kapor, in which he suggested\r\n\r\na  further increase in the income qualification for\r\n\r\npeople  to  apply  for  or purchase  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nfiats, the present income ceiling is fixed at  $500\r\n\r\nper  month  for  the individual  or  $800  for  the\r\n\r\ncombined  family income. There is  already  a  long\r\n\r\nlist  of  applicants waiting to rent Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats,  and  any  further increase in  this  income\r\n\r\nceiling  will  only further aggravate  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation. The income ceiling of a family  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase of Housing and Development Board flat  has\r\n\r\nrecently  been  raised from $1,000  to  $1,200  per\r\n\r\nmonth. It is considered that this income ceiling is\r\n\r\nadequate at present and any further raising of  the\r\n\r\nincome ceiling cannot yet be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Delta who has made\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion  to pay a lump sum compensation  to\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  affected by the  clearance  scheme,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  inform the House that the present  policy\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  clearance  of  shops  is   being\r\n\r\nreviewed and the suggestion that shopkeepers should\r\n\r\nbe  given  a  lump  sum compensation  in  place  of\r\n\r\nalternate   shop  premises  will  be   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has complained that full\r\n\r\nconsideration was not given to the removal of stand-pipes.  There are certain procedures governing  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of stand-pipes. The present procedure  for\r\n\r\nthe  removal  of stand-pipes is as follows.  Before\r\n\r\naction is taken for the removal of a stand-pipe -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An ad hoc committee has to consider the\r\n\r\nfollowing points: the unnumbered houses in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity are given house numbers to enable  the\r\n\r\nhouse owners to make applications for individual\r\n\r\nconnections,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Water mains are laid, if none is available in\r\n\r\nthe vicinity of the houses, for the house owners to\r\n\r\nmake the connections.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A reasonable period of time is given to the\r\n\r\nhouse owners to make the connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also complained that\r\n\r\nthe  stand-pipe at Gek Poh Road near Lorong  Kabong\r\n\r\nwas  removed  without reason. Sir, that  stand-pipe\r\n\r\nwas  removed on 28th February, 1969, after  notices\r\n\r\nhad   been   given  to  the  Member  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  Citizens' Consultative  Committee,\r\n\r\nand the District Secretary on 25th March, 1968, and\r\n\r\n10th  February,  1969,  respectively.  However,   a\r\n\r\nrequest for its retention was made by the Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee on 20th March, 1969  but  by\r\n\r\nthen this stand-pipe had already been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of a second stand-pipe, the\r\n\r\nStand-pipe  Removal  Committee  did  not  agree  to\r\n\r\nreinstall it but agreed that a water wagon would be\r\n\r\nsent  during  the  drought period should  the  need\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water mains that have been laid at Lorong\r\n\r\nKabong cost $39,450, and an additional main will be\r\n\r\nlaid soon, costing $31,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a proposal to lay mains in the\r\n\r\ninterior part of Joo Koon Road. This proposal  will\r\n\r\nbe  submitted  to  the  Urban  and  Rural  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee for consideration at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the stand-pipe at the l3\u00bd m.s.\r\n\r\nJurong  Road, due notice to remove it was given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member of Parliament concerned, the  Secretary\r\n\r\nof  the  Citizens' Consultative Committee  of  that\r\n\r\nConstituency,  and  the District Secretary,  Jurong\r\n\r\nWest.   Although  a  petition  was   received   for\r\n\r\nunsealing the stand-pipe as it was serving  hawkers\r\n\r\nat the 13\u00bd m.s., the petitioners had been informed\r\n\r\non  the  very  day, through the District  Secretary\r\n\r\nthat  the  stand-pipe  was not  meant  for  washing\r\n\r\nmarket  and  hawker stalls, for which  purpose  the\r\n\r\nmarket  owner had to provide taps and pay  for  the\r\n\r\nwater consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n2.45   p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also complained that\r\n\r\nfarmers  encountered difficulty in applying  for  a\r\n\r\npermit to construct chicken sheds or pigsties. I do\r\n\r\nnot know the true nature of his complaint, but what\r\n\r\nI  know  is  that the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nhas since 1964 assisted the farming community free\r\n\r\nof   charge,  and  has  also  supplied  on  request\r\n\r\nstandard  plans  for  the construction  of  chicken\r\n\r\nsheds  or  laying  cages. The  measurements  for  a\r\n\r\nchicken  shed are 8 feet high by 24 feet wide,  and\r\n\r\nfor  a pigsty 8 feet high with a floor area of  100\r\n\r\nsquare feet per unit. However, the farmer will have\r\n\r\nto  obtain the landowner's permission to build, and\r\n\r\nalso  he  has  to indicate on the site  plan  the\r\n\r\nspecific spot he intends to construct. These  site\r\n\r\nplans  can be purchased from the Land Office at  $2\r\n\r\neach.  If  the  farmer  follows  the  procedure  of\r\n\r\napplying for a permit - and this is quite simple  - I  do not think he will encounter any difficulty at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also pointed out that\r\n\r\nalthough he is no longer a member of the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural  Services  Committee,  certain  officers   in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  projects continue to send him  letters\r\n\r\nfor  recommendation of certain  projects.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  if  he  can give me the  names  of  these\r\n\r\nofficers, I will wake them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the queries from the Member for  Mountbatten?  He cited a few cases of resettled  persons\r\n\r\nhaving to be resettled again. It is true that a few\r\n\r\ndispossessed   families  have  been  subjected   to\r\n\r\nclearance action for a second time. This is  indeed\r\n\r\nregrettable,   but,   unfortunately,   not   always\r\n\r\navoidable.  The Housing and Development Board  does\r\n\r\ntake  care not to rehouse dispossessed families  in\r\n\r\nan area likely to be affected by development. To do\r\n\r\notherwise  would  be foolish and only  add  to  the\r\n\r\nalready considerable resettlement problems  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard. The Member can rest assured that there is co\r\n\r\nordination between the various departments\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nof  the  Board over matters  pertaining  to\r\n\r\nrehousing  and redevelopment. But as  I  said  just\r\n\r\nnow,    sometimes   a   second   resettlement    is\r\n\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example. Before we separated from\r\n\r\nMalaysia, we rehoused certain farmers in  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang and Jurong. As a result of our separation  and\r\n\r\nthe build-up of our armed forces, more land has had\r\n\r\nto  be  acquired  for purposes of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence, e.g., S.A.F.T.I. As a net result,  farmers\r\n\r\nwhom we had settled years ago have had to shift and\r\n\r\nbe  resettled, much to their annoyance, of  course,\r\n\r\nas  it  causes a lot of inconvenience. This is  one\r\n\r\nexample  where such resettlement for a second  time\r\n\r\nwas unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may now go on to certain queries from\r\n\r\nthe Member for Delta regarding the Ministry of Law.\r\n\r\nI   understood   her  to  say  that   the   Chinese\r\n\r\ntranslation  Kuan - I  hope  I  have  pronounced  it\r\n\r\ncorrectly   -  of  the  English  word  \"Judge\"   or\r\n\r\n\"Magistrate\" has a colonial flavour.  Not  being  a\r\n\r\nChinese  scholar, I cannot agree or  disagree  with\r\n\r\nher.  But  I would like to point out to Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House that Judges and Magistrates do not come\r\n\r\nunder  the  jurisdiction of the  Ministry  of  Law.\r\n\r\nUnder our system of government, they are completely\r\n\r\nindependent of the Executive. Our laws are  printed\r\n\r\nin   English,  and  the  English  word  \"Judge\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Magistrate\"  is  still being used  in  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries - Malaysia, India, Ceylon. So  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it has a colonial flavour; at least not  the\r\n\r\nEnglish word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that more publicity\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  on T.V. and over  the  radio  to\r\n\r\ncertain  Bills  passed  in this  House,  e.g.,  the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill.  Somehow I feel this  query  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  directed to the Minister  for  Culture.\r\n\r\nBut, I, for one, feel that sufficient publicity  is\r\n\r\nalready being given in four languages on Television\r\n\r\nSingapore and over Radio Singapore. You get  it  in\r\n\r\nthe  news  bulletins, and there is a special  half-hour  where  all the proceedings in Parliament  are\r\n\r\nreported. What I fear is that if we have much  more\r\n\r\npublicity on T.V. and over the radio, resulting  in\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncutting  down  of entertainment time,  then  people\r\n\r\nwill  get fed up and turn to some other channel  or\r\n\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am satisfied with some but not  all\r\n\r\nof  the replies of the Parliamentary Secretary.  As\r\n\r\nregards the farmers' applications for permission to  build  chicken pens or pigsties, I did  not  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Primary  Production Department  did  not\r\n\r\nassist the farmers. I said that the Department  has\r\n\r\nsince given them a great deal of assistance. What I\r\n\r\ncomplained  about was that the various  departments\r\n\r\ndid not seem to co-ordinate well. For example, when\r\n\r\nan  application  to  build a  chicken  pen  with  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  height  of  8 feet went  to  the  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor's Department for approval, it was rejected\r\n\r\nbecause  the  height  was more  than  the  allowed\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  6  feet. So there is  a  lack  of  co-ordination among the various departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has\r\n\r\nalso asked me  to name  the officers who did not know that  I  am  no\r\n\r\nlonger  a  member of the Urban and  Rural  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I can tell him that these officers  are\r\n\r\nin   the   Electricity  Department  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the procedures in connection with\r\n\r\nthe  removal of stand-pipes, as far as I know,  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament concerned were not informed.\r\n\r\nIt   is  only  just  now  that  I  have  heard  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary inform the House  of  these\r\n\r\nprocedures.  The Parliamentary Secretary  dare  not\r\n\r\nadmit that the Ad Hoc Committee was in the wrong to\r\n\r\ndisconnect those stand-pipes which should not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  removed,  but since he has  promised  to  lay\r\n\r\nwater mains in the areas concerned, I beg leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1201 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of widening Paya Lebar Road, I\r\n\r\ndefined  my  attitude  to it  at  the  last  Budget\r\n\r\nsitting. It seems that this road-widening  project\r\n\r\nis  now  nearing completion. I am not  a  garrulous\r\n\r\nwoman  trying  to  harp on the  subject  again  and\r\n\r\nagain,  but  as the representative of  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nConstituency,  I am duty bound to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests   of  my  constituents.   I   cannot   be\r\n\r\nindifferent  to  their hardship,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nshophouses  and premises affected by this  project.\r\n\r\nMany  of them have been asked to move to some other\r\n\r\nplace. The most hard hit are the shophouses.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of this road widening, these people incurred\r\n\r\nlosses  in business, and some of them even  had  to\r\n\r\nwind   up  their  businesses.  The  loss  was  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial, whether in terms of human resources or\r\n\r\nmaterial  resources. It is true that  in  order  to\r\n\r\nwiden this road, the land abutting this road has to\r\n\r\nbe  utilised, and the premises on both sides of the\r\n\r\nroad  have  to give way. I have received complaints\r\n\r\nin  my  capacity as Member of Parliament from those\r\n\r\nof my constituents affected, and have tried my best\r\n\r\nto  explain to them why it is necessary  to  widen\r\n\r\nthis  road. Generally, they are not totally against\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  to widen this road. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the premises have already been shifted  a\r\n\r\nfew  yards back from the main road. If there is  no\r\n\r\nempty  space at the back of their original premises\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  make  do with smaller  and  cramped\r\n\r\npremises  and the shophouses have to be reduced  in\r\n\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the enlightened and understanding Minister\r\n\r\nwill  give  them  all the necessary assistance  and\r\n\r\nsympathy, and allow them to live and carry on  with\r\n\r\ntheir business in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to draw the\r\n\r\nMinister's  attention to is this. In my  discussion\r\n\r\nwith those residents who have been affected by  the\r\n\r\nroad-widening scheme, I have discovered that  there\r\n\r\nis  no proper liaison among the various departments\r\n\r\nconcerned. For example, the road was widened up  to\r\n\r\nthe  shop  premises, but the owners of these  shops\r\n\r\nwere not given alternative accommodation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nThey came to see me. As a result, I wrote  to\r\n\r\nthe   department  concerned  on  the  question   of\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation. While  the  matter  was\r\n\r\nunder  discussion,  another  department  issued   a\r\n\r\ndemolition notice to the people there. Sometimes it\r\n\r\nis the P.W.D. which issues such demolition notices.\r\n\r\nThese   people  do  not  understand   why   another\r\n\r\ndepartment  should  send them a further  notice  of\r\n\r\ndemolition   when  the  matter   is   still   under\r\n\r\ndiscussion.   They  do  not  understand   why   the\r\n\r\nofficials  in the various departments do  not  have\r\n\r\nproper liaison with one another. No one knows  what\r\n\r\nthe  other is doing especially in regard to such  a\r\n\r\nserious matter as the demolition of shophouses. The\r\n\r\nshopowners  are  bewildered  and  at  a   loss   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  what is going on. I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned   will  take  measures  to  prevent   the\r\n\r\nrecurrence of such incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to bring up is that\r\n\r\nof  the  officials  of  the departments  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Law   and   National   Development,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  Land Office inspectors  who  are\r\n\r\ncalled  Ti  Niu,  the Chinese meaning  of  which  is\r\n\r\n\"bulls\". Being \"bulls\", they are very hot tempered.\r\n\r\nI  do not want to deny that the people in the rural\r\n\r\narea are not as well educated as those in the urban\r\n\r\narea.  Nevertheless, they understand what is  going\r\n\r\non  in  this world. They can sense that these  Land\r\n\r\nOffice inspectors are trying to boss over them.  At\r\n\r\ntimes,  the Land Office inspectors are bureaucratic\r\n\r\nand  insolent in their dealings with the people  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas. I hope the Minister will take note\r\n\r\nof  this.  I have received many complaints  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  when members of the public  go  to  a\r\n\r\ndepartment to apply for something, the officials in\r\n\r\nthe  office  just  gesture  with  their  hands   to\r\n\r\ncommunicate with them. They do not talk with  them.\r\n\r\nThey  even glare at them. Such an attitude is  very\r\n\r\nbad.  Many country folks came and asked me  whether\r\n\r\nit was because they dressed shabbily that they were\r\n\r\nlooked down upon by the staff in the department. If\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  case,  will the  Minister  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  drastic measures against these officials\r\n\r\nwho judge\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\npersons  by  their  appearance and attire?

I think he admits that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  widen  the road and, as a result,  people\r\n\r\nmust  shift,  but we have not evicted  any  of  the\r\n\r\npersons occupying houses along the road without any\r\n\r\nnotice.  We  have given them ample  time  but  some\r\n\r\nsquatters  are still there. As a result,  the  road\r\n\r\nhas  been widened in parts but the widening has not\r\n\r\nbeen completed yet. If I may cite the figures,  298\r\n\r\nsquatters or occupiers were served with notices  of\r\n\r\neviction,  of  whom  only 144  have  been  cleared.\r\n\r\nAnother  154  units of houses still  remain  to  be\r\n\r\ncleared.

I have said time  and\r\n\r\nagain in Parliament that for Back-benchers to come\r\n\r\nhere  and make general allegations of rudeness does\r\n\r\nnot  get us anywhere. If the Member knows the facts\r\n\r\nof  a  certain case where a civil servant has  been\r\n\r\nrude  to  a member of the public, let us  have  the\r\n\r\nfull  particulars and the matter will  be  inquired\r\n\r\ninto, and that civil servant will be dealt with  if\r\n\r\nhe  is  wrong.  But to make general allegations  of\r\n\r\nrudeness  here  takes it no further.  We  do  issue\r\n\r\ndepartmental   circulars   insisting   that   civil\r\n\r\nservants  treat  members of the public  fairly  and\r\n\r\nurgently, certainly without rudeness, but I  cannot\r\n\r\ndo anything, neither can the Permanent Secretary do\r\n\r\nanything,  unless  specific allegations  with  full\r\n\r\nparticulars  like  date, place,  names  of  persons\r\n\r\ninvolved are brought to our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, may I refer to the statement\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Member for Punggol, who is  not  here\r\n\r\nnow, when during the debate on the Estimates of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance, he referred  to  a  case  of\r\n\r\nrudeness  in  the Public Utilities  Board.  I  have\r\n\r\nlooked into it. Apparently this happened more  than\r\n\r\ntwo years ago. There was a small incident which was\r\n\r\ndue   to  some  misunderstanding.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol turned up at the Public Utilities Board the\r\n\r\nnext   day.   The  matter  was  settled   to   the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of all parties, including  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol. I am surprised that the Member should\r\n\r\nhave  come  here two years later to complain  of  a\r\n\r\nlittle  incident that had happened  in  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board such a long time ago.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will remember that when the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party first came to  power,  civil\r\n\r\nservants were so afraid to move because of pressure\r\n\r\nput  on  them by politicians. But I put it  to  you\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Director  of Public  Works  and  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Manager of the Public Utilities Board  have\r\n\r\nto  deal  daily with complaints from 58 Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament, they will not be able to do  any  other\r\n\r\nwork. So I would suggest that if you gentlemen have\r\n\r\nany complaints, you address them either to me or to\r\n\r\nmy  Parliamentary  Secretary  (National  Deveopment\r\n\r\nDivision)   or  my  Parliamentary  Secretary   (Law\r\n\r\nDivision).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore  I  withdraw my amendment, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nraise another point. The Minister says that, as the\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament for Paya Lebar, it is my  duty\r\n\r\nto  persuade my constituents. I have done a lot  of\r\n\r\npersuasion.  The reason why some of them  have  not\r\n\r\nmoved   out  is  that  they  have not  been  given\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation. Some of them have  their\r\n\r\nbackyard   enclosed,  and   we   would   like   the\r\n\r\nauthorities to be more lenient with them and  allow\r\n\r\nthem time to find alternative accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that\r\n\r\nit  is  the  duty of the Member for Paya  Lebar  to\r\n\r\nevict these people. I asked for his assistance. The\r\n\r\ntrouble  with Paya Lebar Road is that most  of  the\r\n\r\nsquatters there do not want to move. All they  want\r\n\r\nto  do  is  to move backwards from the  road.  They\r\n\r\nstill  want to be on the road front. In many cases,\r\n\r\nwe  have  allowed  them  to demolish  part  of  the\r\n\r\npremises and reset their houses backwards. But,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  there are already houses behind  them\r\n\r\nwhose  owners will not move. So we reach a position\r\n\r\nwhere  the  squatters will not move.  But  wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  we  allow these people  to  reset  their\r\n\r\nhouses  backwards so that they are  still  on  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  Road. This also happened in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nwidening of Upper Serangoon Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his reply and the decision to allow\r\n\r\nthe residents at Paya Lebar Road to reset their\r\n\r\nhouses backwards.

Firstly, a few unpleasant developments have\r\n\r\ntaken  place  in the implementation  of  our  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  schemes. When the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\ntakes  action  to resettle people, there  are  some\r\n\r\nresidents who are not resettled. According  to  the\r\n\r\nusual practice, sub-contractors are asked to tender\r\n\r\nfor the demolition of shacks, and the clearance  of\r\n\r\nthe   area.   This   has   given   rise   to   some\r\n\r\nunpleasantness. Let me quote an example which  took\r\n\r\nplace  not  very long ago. The place at which  this\r\n\r\ntook place is a historical spot in Singapore called\r\n\r\nCovent  Gardens,  and it has a history  going  back\r\n\r\nmore  than  100 years. The Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  has  plans to develop this area. Many  attap\r\n\r\nhouses  in this area were demolished and the people\r\n\r\nhad to move out. But there are still a small number\r\n\r\nof  people  who for various reasons have not  moved\r\n\r\nout  as  yet. The Housing Board has already awarded\r\n\r\nthe  tender to sub-contractors to clear this  area.\r\n\r\nThe  sub-contractors have taken the good and usable\r\n\r\narticles  from the area and have burnt the unwanted\r\n\r\nhousehold   furniture  and  articles.  These   sub-contractors  are only concerned with  making  money\r\n\r\nand are not bothered with the lives and property of\r\n\r\nthe people. When these unwanted articles are burnt,\r\n\r\nthe  people who are still staying in this area  are\r\n\r\nin  danger  of losing their lives and  property  if\r\n\r\nthere is a fire. Sir, this is only one example from\r\n\r\nmy  constituency. I understand there  were  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  such  incidents caused  by  the  burning  of\r\n\r\nunwanted articles on the site. These\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfires endangered the lives of the people living  in\r\n\r\nthe  area. Although we may regard this as  a  small\r\n\r\nmatter, our citizens may consider it as a matter of\r\n\r\ngreat  importance. They are not so  much  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  sub-contractors as with the  Government.\r\n\r\nThey think that this is a deliberate attempt by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to set fire to the houses on  the  site\r\n\r\nwhich  is  required for urban renewal so  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can proceed with urban development.  So\r\n\r\nmany  fires of this nature have taken place  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  seen the Minister taking action  against\r\n\r\nthe  sub-contractors whose actions have  endangered\r\n\r\nthe lives and property of the people. This is not a\r\n\r\nsmall matter. It is a matter of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fire in my constituency, I saw certain\r\n\r\nofficials in the Resettlement Department  and  they\r\n\r\npromised to look into this matter. They have spoken\r\n\r\nto the sub-contractors and have warned them that if\r\n\r\nthey  persist  in  starting  fires,  they  will  be\r\n\r\npunished  and  fined. I would like to know  whether\r\n\r\nthe Ministry has made investigations, because there\r\n\r\nis  evidence that the fires were started  by  these\r\n\r\nsub-contractors. I hope the Minister  will  give  a\r\n\r\ndetailed  explanation so that I can  report  to  my\r\n\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I want to raise concerns\r\n\r\nrecreational grounds for people staying in  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  When  the People's Action Party  came  to\r\n\r\npower,  it  was one of the Party's aims to  provide\r\n\r\nthese facilities for the people in housing estates,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were then staying in  \"pigeon-holes\"\r\n\r\nand were restricted in their movements. This is not\r\n\r\nthe  best environment to build socialism and cannot\r\n\r\nbe  permitted by our Party which professes to be  a\r\n\r\nsocialist Party. Therefore, we resolved to do  away\r\n\r\nwith  the then Singapore Improvement Trust and  set\r\n\r\nup what is now known as the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard. The main function of the Board is to provide\r\n\r\nhouses for our people, and its housing achievements\r\n\r\nhave  brought honour and won praise for our country\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nmost  of the countries in South-east Asia. Many  of\r\n\r\nour  people  are now living in flats built  by  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, we had many empty spaces or grounds\r\n\r\nnear  housing  estates which could be utilised  for\r\n\r\nrecreational purposes. But in the last year or two,\r\n\r\nthese  grounds have been sold to oil companies  for\r\n\r\nthe  construction of petrol stations. The promises\r\n\r\nthat  our  Party  and our Government  made  to  the\r\n\r\npeople during the elections have been forgotten  or\r\n\r\nchanged. A number of my constituents came to see me\r\n\r\nlast  week,  saying that the only open space  which\r\n\r\ncan  be utilised as a recreational ground had  been\r\n\r\nsold by the Housing Board to an oil company for the\r\n\r\nconstruction of a petrol kiosk. After listening  to\r\n\r\nthis  complaint, I made investigations, and I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  such a small space should have been reserved\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  in the area for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children can walk and play around there because\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  other  better open  ground  in  that\r\n\r\nparticular  area for recreation. Since the  density\r\n\r\nof  the population there is high and there is a lot\r\n\r\nof traffic, that place is not suitable for a petrol\r\n\r\nkiosk. The Ministry of Law and National Development\r\n\r\nhas  sold the space to a petrol kiosk and, in doing\r\n\r\nso, it has taken away a small piece of ground which\r\n\r\nthe people could have used for recreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the people's\r\n\r\nfundamental right and the land should not have been\r\n\r\nsold  to  the  petrol kiosk. It  should  have  been\r\n\r\nreserved  for the use of our people. The Government\r\n\r\ndid not seek their views when it sold the piece  of\r\n\r\nland.   The  building  of  a  petrol  kiosk   there\r\n\r\nconstitutes  a danger to the lives of  the  people.\r\n\r\nThey  would  like to have that piece  of  land  for\r\n\r\ntheir  use.  They  have appealed to  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee to help them in this  matter\r\n\r\nand they have asked me to convey their views to the\r\n\r\nMinister. But\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nuntil today they have not received any reply.  They\r\n\r\ndo  not  know what the Ministry of Law and National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  is  going to do. I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill answer in great detail the two points which  I\r\n\r\nhave raised just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first deal\r\n\r\nwith the last point raised by the Member for Delta.\r\n\r\nI  have  not  been  able  to  follow  her  line  of\r\n\r\nargument.  She referred to one petrol station.  She\r\n\r\nsaid that it was built on land used by children  to\r\n\r\nplay on and, in the same breath, she said that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was breaking its promises to the people. One\r\n\r\npiece  of  land  and  Government  is  breaking  its\r\n\r\npromises!  I do not see the logic of the  argument.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  facts. The Member  for  Delta  and\r\n\r\ncertain  of  her  constituents did  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development not  to  allow  a\r\n\r\npetrol station to be built on a small site of land.\r\n\r\nThey  raised  two  objections.  First,  on  traffic\r\n\r\ngrounds.  Secondly,  they alleged  that  when  they\r\n\r\npurchased the houses, it was on condition that that\r\n\r\nland  would be reserved as a children's playground.\r\n\r\nInvestigation has shown that there were no  traffic\r\n\r\nproblems  and, second, there was ample other  space\r\n\r\nfor the children to play on, and that there was  no\r\n\r\npromise or undertaking that that piece of land  was\r\n\r\nto  be  reserved  for recreation.  The  appeal  was\r\n\r\nrejected  and I have already written to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Delta. I am surprised she has not received the\r\n\r\nletter. Probably it is on the way to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked why the Government did not consult the\r\n\r\npeople  when  it wanted to sell its own  land.  Why\r\n\r\nshould the Government consult the people when it is\r\n\r\nthe  owner? May I point out to the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nthat the money from the petrol station goes towards\r\n\r\nthe subsidy of Housing Board flats. It does not  go\r\n\r\ninto  the  pockets of members of  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. It is used to subsidise rents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also referred to Covent Gardens. I\r\n\r\nremember answering her\r\n\r\nquestion  in Parliament as to when the  Government\r\n\r\nwas going to develop Covent Gardens. We are now  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nprocess of developing Covent Gardens. Most  of  the\r\n\r\npeople have shifted. There was an unfortunate  case\r\n\r\nof  a fire there which took place during the rather\r\n\r\ndry spell Singapore had to undergo in February when\r\n\r\nwe  hardly had any rain for 32 days. It was a  fire\r\n\r\nfrom a rubbish pile. The evidence does not show who\r\n\r\nstarted  this  fire, whether it was  the  squatters\r\n\r\nremaining  there, or the contractor as  alleged  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Delta. But she  feared  that  the\r\n\r\npeople might think that it was the Government  that\r\n\r\nwas aiding and abetting the contractor to start the\r\n\r\nfire.  Surely the Member should know better.  These\r\n\r\nare  rumours circulated by our enemies. During Chap\r\n\r\nGoh  Meh  there were dozens of fires in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSurely  the Government did not start every  one  of\r\n\r\nthem!  But  I will look into the complaint  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Delta and try to ensure that  no  other\r\n\r\nfire takes place in Covent Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to clarify one point.  This  is\r\n\r\nabout  the plot of land which has been used  for  a\r\n\r\npetrol  kiosk.  The  Minister  has  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  make  use of  any  piece  of  land\r\n\r\nwhenever  it  wants to. Naturally it can.  When  it\r\n\r\nwants  to make use of a piece of land, it can  take\r\n\r\nit  at any time. But then it should not forget that\r\n\r\nwhen  it  came  to  power, one of  its  fundamental\r\n\r\npolicies  was to provide more recreational  grounds\r\n\r\nfor  our children. I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether,  if  a petrol kiosk is built there,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be a recreational ground for the many  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  now living there in high-rise  flats.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, no one will oppose the Government's  action\r\n\r\nto  make use of the land there. But what I want  to\r\n\r\nsay  is that land in that area is limited. Has  the\r\n\r\nMinister seen that piece of land? Our Party  Branch\r\n\r\nis  just across it and I am quite familiar with the\r\n\r\nlocality.  There are already four petrol kiosks  in\r\n\r\nthat area, all near together within a short stretch\r\n\r\nof  Havelock Road. The traffic along Havelock  Road\r\n\r\nis  congested.  Who can say that it is  not?  There\r\n\r\nhave already been four cases of\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nchildren who were run over by cars.

May I point out that most of the\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats in Singapore have been built in\r\n\r\nDelta Constituency. If she is looking for more\r\n\r\nplayground for the children, then she should apply\r\n\r\nto the Chairman of the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard.

Will the\r\n\r\nMinister enlighten this House on the performance of\r\n\r\nthe Jurong Fish Market and the Jurong Abattoir?\r\n\r\nWhat was the cause of the boycott by the pork\r\n\r\ndealers last year and how was it solved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non the 9th of this month the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Law and National\r\n\r\nDevelopment (National Development Division), in\r\n\r\nanswer to a question raised by me, said that by the\r\n\r\nend of last year there were 20,357 registered farms\r\n\r\nand the registered farmers numbered 53,291 people.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the members of their families, there\r\n\r\nwere altogether about 175,400 people engaged in\r\n\r\nagricultural activities or depending on\r\n\r\nagricultural activities for their livelihood. They\r\n\r\nraised about $245 million worth of agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce - an achievement that went unnoticed by\r\n\r\nother people. If they had not brought forth such a\r\n\r\nhuge amount of agricultural produce, we would have\r\n\r\nlost an equivalent sum in foreign exchange. They\r\n\r\nalso produced supplementary foodstuffs such as\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\npigs, chickens, eggs and others. Some of them  were\r\n\r\nexported, thus earning for Singapore quite a  large\r\n\r\nsum of money in foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can thus see that these farmers play a very\r\n\r\nimportant  role in our national economy. But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nmost  of them are very poor. They have to work very\r\n\r\nhard,  going out to the farms in the early  morning\r\n\r\nand working there until late in the evening. Almost\r\n\r\nevery  member of the family has to do his share  of\r\n\r\nwork. Even if he is a student, he has to help  when\r\n\r\nhe  comes  back from school. But the  prices  these\r\n\r\nfarmers  get  for  their agricultural  produce  are\r\n\r\nnormally  very cheap, and therefore  they  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to make ends meet. At times they  may  be\r\n\r\nable to sell their produce at higher prices and  so\r\n\r\nmake  more money, but they have to set aside  part\r\n\r\nof  their money to tide them over difficult  times,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  when prices are low or when a  misfortune\r\n\r\nbefalls them, as happened in last December's flood,\r\n\r\nand  in the recent drought when they incurred heavy\r\n\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the farmers' land is\r\n\r\naffected  by  clearance, then their lives  will  be\r\n\r\nmore  miserable. Normally, when a certain piece  of\r\n\r\nland  is  earmarked for development, it is acquired\r\n\r\nby  Government and then put under the control of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  organisation. Usually, on  a  change  of\r\n\r\nlandlord, their rent is increased and their  burden\r\n\r\nnaturally  becomes  heavier. Prior  to  the  actual\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the site, the farmers are  notified\r\n\r\nnot  to engage in agricultural activities any  more\r\n\r\nin  view of immediate resettlement. It is true that\r\n\r\nin  order to avoid unnecessary losses, the  farmers\r\n\r\ndare  not  engage  in agricultural  activities  any\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, sometimes the farmers have been\r\n\r\nwaiting for three or four years, and there is still\r\n\r\nno  sign  of  resettlement. So during this  waiting\r\n\r\nperiod,  they  have  no  income  from  agricultural\r\n\r\nactivities. They have to maintain their  livelihood\r\n\r\non their previous savings. It is envisaged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nthat  they  lead quite a hard life. When  the  time\r\n\r\ncomes  for their resettlement, their houses,  fruit\r\n\r\ntrees  and vegetable crops which are the result  of\r\n\r\ntheir   years   of  toil,  have  to  be   abandoned\r\n\r\novernight. They have to make use of the  small  sum\r\n\r\nof compensation and start everything all over again\r\n\r\nwhen  they  have been resettled in the resettlement\r\n\r\narea.  Moreover,  when they are  resettled  in  new\r\n\r\nsites,  the land allocated to each of them  is  not\r\n\r\nmore  than 14 acres. Since the land area is smaller\r\n\r\nthan  what  they had previously, their agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce  will be less. Their income is  accordingly\r\n\r\nless.  Also,  when they are resettled  at  the  new\r\n\r\nsite,  they have to spend some money on building  a\r\n\r\nhouse. This will have a higher assessment and  they\r\n\r\nhave  to pay increased property tax. They also have\r\n\r\nto pay other overhead charges. All this will impose\r\n\r\nan  additional burden on them. All along they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  suffering in silence. Because of our economic\r\n\r\npolicy,  they have to make some sacrifices for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of  the whole nation. This merits our praise.\r\n\r\nBut  the  cause  of the farmers'  suffering  is  an\r\n\r\nartificial  one,  i.e., the prices of  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce are subject to fluctuation, and so at times\r\n\r\nthey have to sell at a loss. How pitiful this is!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties of the farmers and the\r\n\r\nfluctuation of prices in agricultural produce have\r\n\r\nbeen  pointed out by me on many occasions, and  the\r\n\r\nreply  has  invariably been the same - that  prices\r\n\r\nare  governed by the law of supply and  demand.  So\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is not in a position to do  anything.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Government can at least do  something\r\n\r\nto  alleviate  the farmers' plight.  It  is  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  that since the inception of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department, it has rendered  assistance\r\n\r\nto the farmers in many fields, especially in making\r\n\r\nan  effective check on swine and chicken epidemics,\r\n\r\nintroducing  new scientific methods  of  production\r\n\r\nand  new  agricultural  medicines  to  farmers.  In\r\n\r\ngeneral, farmers appreciate such services. However,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  we  compare  the  livelihood  of  these\r\n\r\nfarmers  10 years ago with their livelihood  today,\r\n\r\nwe  can see that there is almost no improvement  at\r\n\r\nall. Since the Government is allocating\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na  large  sum  of money to the National Development\r\n\r\nDivision,  we should expect something  better  from\r\n\r\nthis  Department, and the Government should try  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the standard of living of the farmers.  As\r\n\r\nfar as I can see, the main cause of the fluctuation\r\n\r\nin   prices  of  agricultural  produce  is   random\r\n\r\nproduction.  For  instance,  whenever  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfestival, the farmers will try to produce  more  in\r\n\r\norder  to  sell  at a higher price. But  since  all\r\n\r\nfarmers  have the same idea, more will be produced\r\n\r\nand so prices will fall. In the end, all their toil\r\n\r\nand  sweat come to nothing. Instead they lose money\r\n\r\nwhen they sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, farmers are poor, so they\r\n\r\nhave  to  depend on loans not only in  the  initial\r\n\r\nstages  of  farming  but also  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nproduction.  They have to borrow at  high  interest\r\n\r\nrates  from  chit  fund  companies,  grocery   shop\r\n\r\nproprietors, landowners and others. The farmers may\r\n\r\nhave to repay their loans in kind. In the end,  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  have no control over or say in the  prices\r\n\r\nof  their produce. If they transport their  produce\r\n\r\nto  distant  markets, they cannot make much  money,\r\n\r\nbecause  their produce is limited and the  distance\r\n\r\nis  far. Moreover, farm work takes up a lot of time\r\n\r\nand  they  cannot assign a person to  a  particular\r\n\r\njob.  So, as usual, the farmers have to sell  their\r\n\r\nproduce  through a middleman who  can  sell  it  at\r\n\r\nprices  much  higher  than what  they  pay  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers. Some people may say that our market  is  a\r\n\r\nfree  one and if the farmers are not satisfied with\r\n\r\nthe  price  paid by one middleman, they can  go  to\r\n\r\nanother  middleman for a better price. But we  must\r\n\r\nknow  that since the farmers are tied down by their\r\n\r\nloans  and  by  the  other  factors  that  I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned, they are not able to do this. It behoves\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to lend them a helping  hand.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot shirk its responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers.  It has the bounden duty to improve  their\r\n\r\nlot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I urge the Government to set\r\n\r\nup   an  organisation  -  a  National  Agricultural\r\n\r\nPlanning and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nSales  Board  -  to  help  the  farmers,  with  the\r\n\r\nfollowing functions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to get specialists to collect information and\r\n\r\ndata and analyse what agricultural produce  is\r\n\r\nbest  for  cultivation, and in what  quantity,\r\n\r\nand  when and where to sell it. All this  will\r\n\r\ngive   the  farmers  some  sort  of  guidance,\r\n\r\ninstead   of  letting  them  go  about   their\r\n\r\nbusiness blindly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This board can set up a factory to process\r\n\r\nany  excess agricultural produce and  preserve\r\n\r\nit  in cold storage or for export. It can also\r\n\r\nbe canned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The board can give loans to farmers who need\r\n\r\nthem,  so  as to save them borrowing  at  high\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  from  moneylenders  and  from\r\n\r\nbeing exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) More important, the Government can help the\r\n\r\nfarmers by engaging in wholesale buying and selling\r\n\r\nof  agricultural  produce. The exploitation  by\r\n\r\nmiddlemen will therefore be done away with.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government will do all these things for\r\n\r\nthe farmers without making much profit, what little\r\n\r\nthere  is  can  be  spent on overhead  charges  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  so  that both farmers  and  consumers\r\n\r\nwill  benefit. In other words, all the people  will\r\n\r\nbenefit from the setting up of this board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate: if the Government is sincere in\r\n\r\ntaking care of agricultural development, now is the\r\n\r\ntime  for  it to consider seriously how to  improve\r\n\r\nthe lot of the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this\r\n\r\nsubhead,  I  would  also like  to  give  my  views.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, the farming population  is\r\n\r\n10  per cent of the total population. Most of  them\r\n\r\nstay  in the rural areas. As a Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  a  rural constituency, I would like  to  avail\r\n\r\nmyself  of  this  opportunity  to  praise  the  con\r\n\r\ntributions our farmers have made to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour country. Because of their efforts and hard\r\n\r\nwork, they are able to provide us with cheap\r\n\r\nagricultural produce to meet all our needs, so that\r\n\r\nwe have no need to import from abroad such\r\n\r\ncommodities as chickens, eggs, and pork. These\r\n\r\nitems are daily necessities. Although land is\r\n\r\nlimited, the farmers, because of their hard work,\r\n\r\nare able to raise $250 million worth of\r\n\r\nagricultural produce every year. This is not a\r\n\r\nsmall sum. Of course, I will not deny that in this\r\n\r\nrespect the Primary Production Department has done\r\n\r\na lot to help the farmers. For instance, this\r\n\r\nDepartment has taught them how to use scientific\r\n\r\nmethods of production, how to produce better\r\n\r\nstrains of livestock, how to prevent certain\r\n\r\nlivestock diseases, and how to vaccinate their\r\n\r\nlivestock. All these measures have helped the\r\n\r\nfarmers in their agricultural produce and animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received complaints from farmers\r\n\r\nin my constituency that recently the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has stopped its services of\r\n\r\nfree chicken vaccination. I feel that this free\r\n\r\nservice should not be stopped. The expenditure\r\n\r\ninvolved is not very much. Therefore, I would urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to continue with this service for the\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member for Jurong has mentioned the\r\n\r\nprices of farm produce. As far as I know, prices\r\n\r\nfluctuate all the time. In July or other periods of\r\n\r\nthe year, pork and chicken are sold at lower\r\n\r\nprices, whereas the prices of feed-stuffs for pigs\r\n\r\nand chickens are relatively dearer so that in the\r\n\r\nend the farmers will be selling at a loss. This\r\n\r\nwill force them to borrow money from other sources.\r\n\r\nI hope the Government can render some form of\r\n\r\nassistance to the farmers to tide them over their\r\n\r\ndifficulties. I would like to ask the Government\r\n\r\nwhether they are giving subsidies to the farmers.\r\n\r\nIn many countries farmers are subsidized. Whenever\r\n\r\nthe market price is low, the Government will\r\n\r\nsubsidise the farmers, or they will buy the farm\r\n\r\nproducts from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nfarmers  in  order to maintain market stability.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether our Government can do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe Government can help the farmers to organise co-operatives.  The  main  function  of  the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  is  to  help  the  farmers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  staff  of the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment should devote more time to help them.  I\r\n\r\nhave  also  heard that some of the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department do not know  how  to\r\n\r\nmake  use of their free time. I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nduring their free time they should go to the  farms\r\n\r\nand  discuss with the farmers the formation of  co-operative  societies  so  that  they  will  not  be\r\n\r\nexploited  by middlemen. In this way,  farmers  can\r\n\r\nbuy  what  they  need at a lower  price,  including\r\n\r\nanimal  feeding  stuff, and sell their  produce  at\r\n\r\nhigher prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, may I first deal with the\r\n\r\nqueries  from the Member for Havelock.  The  Jurong\r\n\r\nFishing  Port and Production Market began operation\r\n\r\nin  February 1969, a little more than a  year  ago.\r\n\r\nAll  the  65  licensed  fish  merchants  previously\r\n\r\noperating   in  Ellenborough  and  Clyde   Terrace\r\n\r\nMarkets had removed to Jurong. The Fisheries Office\r\n\r\nat  Telok Ayer Basin was also removed to Jurong  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  day.  I am happy to say  that  both  the\r\n\r\nFishing  Port  and  the  Auction  Market  are   now\r\n\r\noperating very smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the fish merchants have formed themselves\r\n\r\ninto  one  association. Meetings are held regularly\r\n\r\nbetween  the association and the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  ensure that any  problem  that  may\r\n\r\narise is given prompt attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the fishermen, the fish merchants and\r\n\r\nthe retailers have adapted themselves very well  to\r\n\r\nthe new environment. They have organised themselves\r\n\r\nin  groups  to travel daily to Jurong.  Each  night\r\n\r\nabout 3,000 to 4,000 of them congregate at the fish\r\n\r\nmarkets  from one o'clock in the morning  to  about\r\n\r\nsix  o'clock  the  same morning  to  conduct  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new car park will be opened next month to\r\n\r\nreduce the problem of traffic congestion. Since the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the  port, many foreign  vessels  have\r\n\r\nlanded fish for sale in Jurong and many more  joint\r\n\r\nfishing  ventures have been launched to catch  fish\r\n\r\nfor  sale.  Ice plants, cold storage and processing\r\n\r\nfacilities are being provided in an area  of  about\r\n\r\n40   acres  to  serve  the  fishermen  and  fishing\r\n\r\nvessels.  There  has  been a marginal  increase  in\r\n\r\nretail  prices of fish, but it is hoped  that  with\r\n\r\nthe  increased landings, the prices  of  fish  will\r\n\r\nreturn to normal and may even be lower than before,\r\n\r\nif an abundant supply of fish is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock also wants to know why\r\n\r\nwork stopped at the Jurong Abattoir on the 5th  and\r\n\r\n6th  of  August. This was due to a misunderstanding\r\n\r\nbetween   the  officer-in-charge  of   the   Jurong\r\n\r\nAbattoir  and some private butchers.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nprevent vandalism and mischief in the abattoir,  no\r\n\r\nprivate  butchers or workmen were allowed to  enter\r\n\r\nthe  grounds  until a few hours before slaughtering\r\n\r\nbegan.  Owing to a misunderstanding on  the  agreed\r\n\r\ntime  for entry, some private butchers and  workmen\r\n\r\nwho came earlier, were refused permission to enter,\r\n\r\nand  so  they  made a big fuss. As a result,  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues    decided    to    stop    work.    The\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding was subsequently settled  and  the\r\n\r\nabattoir resumed operation on the 7th August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the Members for Jurong and\r\n\r\nSembawang  who proceeded to tell us so  much  about\r\n\r\nfarming.  May I say at the outset that there  is  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  land in Singapore.  Land  is  getting\r\n\r\nscarcer  and  scarcer in spite of  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nreclaim  land, and it is for this reason that  when\r\n\r\nwe  resettle farmers it is not possible to allocate\r\n\r\nto  them more than two acres. Both the Members,  of\r\n\r\ncourse are rather concerned with the plight of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers. The Member for Jurong says that they  have\r\n\r\nsuffered in silence for ten years. I disagree.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang has pointed  out  that  they\r\n\r\nexport  annually  to the tune of $250  million.  If\r\n\r\nthat is true, they cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nbe  suffering. If they are, they are certainly not\r\n\r\nsuffering  in  silence,  because  they  have  good\r\n\r\nspokesmen, for example, the two Members here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members main grouse is the price. In answer\r\n\r\nto  their questions, I have said before and  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I  have to repeat myself if they  want  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  themselves here, that prices are regulated\r\n\r\nby  demand  and supply. If demand exceeds  supply,\r\n\r\nprices go up. If supply exceeds demand, prices  go\r\n\r\ndown.  You do not need to be an economist to  know\r\n\r\nthis.  But when the price of eggs goes up, I  have\r\n\r\nto answer questions in Parliament from Members who\r\n\r\nwant  to  protect the consumers. Consumers grumble\r\n\r\nthat the price of eggs has gone up. When the price\r\n\r\nof eggs goes down, I have to answer questions from\r\n\r\nMembers  who  represent the farmers. I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  much  the  Government  can  do  to\r\n\r\nregulate the price of farm products. We have tried\r\n\r\nco-operative  societies,  but  they  have  been  a\r\n\r\ndismal failure. Do farmers need subsidies?  If  so\r\n\r\nit  is  the Minister for Finance who will have  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether or not a subsidy should  be  given\r\n\r\nand,  if  so,  how  much  should  be  given.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment is not abandoning the farmer. As far as\r\n\r\npossible, we want to be self-sufficient in food. I\r\n\r\nsay   \"as   far  as  possible\",  and   we   render\r\n\r\nconsiderable  assistance  to  farmers.   I   think\r\n\r\nMembers   know   that   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment   is  concentrating  its   efforts   on\r\n\r\ndeveloping  intensive farming techniques  such  as\r\n\r\nhydroponics, mushroom culture, broiler production,\r\n\r\nintensive pig production and so on, because of the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  land. I understand that  many  farms\r\n\r\nhave  now increased their production without  much\r\n\r\nadditional  land. I can assure both  Members  that\r\n\r\nthe effort to encourage farming will continue, but\r\n\r\nI  would agree with them that there is still  room\r\n\r\nfor improvement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for chickens, half a cent per dose of vaccine\r\n\r\nwas charged for vaccination of chickens with\r\n\r\neffect from 1st January\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthis  year. In addition, a service fee of  half  a\r\n\r\ncent  per  chick will be charged for carrying  out\r\n\r\nthe  inoculation  at  the farmer's  premises  with\r\n\r\neffect from 1st April this year. The charging of a\r\n\r\nfee  for chick inoculation is not new. Since 196l,\r\n\r\na  charge  of  half  a  cent  has  been  made  for\r\n\r\nvaccinating  each day-old chick. This  charge  was\r\n\r\nmerely  extended  from a day-old  chick  to  adult\r\n\r\nbirds  from the 1st January this year. This  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall  charge which I think the farmers  can  well\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay.  The charge of half  a  cent  for\r\n\r\nvaccinating poultry at the premises of the  farmer\r\n\r\nis  really not an exercise to make money,  but  to\r\n\r\nencourage   the  farmers  to  do  the  inoculation\r\n\r\nthemselves  and not to rely on the Department.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  a short course has been conducted to  train\r\n\r\nall  farmers  who  wish to learn  the  inoculation\r\n\r\ntechnique,  but  some of them  perhaps  cannot  be\r\n\r\nbothered  about  the course and  hence  the  small\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   perhaps   due   to   the   difficulty    in\r\n\r\ncommunication between the Minister and me, he  has\r\n\r\nnot  given  any  reply to my questions.

As you  are  aware,\r\n\r\nSir,  recently the marking out of parking lots  has\r\n\r\nbeen extended to places away from the central area.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister inform us whether the policy  of\r\n\r\nmarking   out  parking  lots  is  to  ease  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion or to earn revenue without consideration\r\n\r\nfor the hardship caused to shopkeepers in the area?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi  asked for more parking places for taxis  in\r\n\r\nhotels. The Ministry of National Development is not\r\n\r\nin charge of hotel grounds. It is the proprietor of\r\n\r\nthe hotel that is in charge of the grounds. But  if\r\n\r\nthere  is space outside the hotel on the main road,\r\n\r\nthen we will provide spaces if available. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  the Member for Changi  has  specific\r\n\r\ninstances of any particular hotel in mind.  But  if\r\n\r\nparticulars  are  given  to  me,  I  will  ask  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Car Parks to look into the matter\r\n\r\nin order to provide more parking spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor wants to know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  policy of providing car parks  is  to\r\n\r\nmake money or to ease congestion. The answer is the\r\n\r\nlatter. To give you an example. We have to impose a\r\n\r\nvery   small  parking  fee  for  motor-cycles   and\r\n\r\nscooters.  This  is not to make money  but  because\r\n\r\nmotor-cycles and scooters were parked all over  the\r\n\r\ntown  in  a haphazard fashion, even along  passage-ways  and  under buildings. There were  not  enough\r\n\r\nparking spaces for scooters in the central area  of\r\n\r\nthe  city.  As a net result, we had to impose  fees\r\n\r\nfor  parking.  The object is to see that  they  are\r\n\r\nparked in an orderly way. Certainly the five or ten\r\n\r\ncents charge has not been put\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\non as a tax measure. But with the growth of traffic\r\n\r\nin  the  city  and the increase in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nvehicles, I am afraid we have to extend the  places\r\n\r\nwhere  we  allow cars to park. The underground  car\r\n\r\npark at Raffles Place is full every day, and so  is\r\n\r\nthe  multi-storey car park in Telok Ayer. We intend\r\n\r\nto  build  a  few more car parks and we are  hoping\r\n\r\nthat  private enterprise will also build some.  The\r\n\r\nwhole  object is to provide adequate parking spaces\r\n\r\nand   to  ease  traffic  congestion.  Some  of   my\r\n\r\nofficials think that we should keep cars out of the\r\n\r\ncity  and stop them perhaps somewhere near  Kallang\r\n\r\nPark and ask their occupants to come by buses.  But\r\n\r\nI  am  going into deeper problems and if I  do  not\r\n\r\nstop, I will go on to mass transit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMinister  did not get my point. Taxis  are  usually\r\n\r\nparked outside hotels.

Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  and Chief Building Surveyor's Department,\r\n\r\nwhen   approving  plans  for  hotels,  should  make\r\n\r\nprovision for parking spaces for taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Minister has not answered\r\n\r\nme  is  whether  he  will consider  increasing  the\r\n\r\nparking spaces for taxis at Raffles Place and other\r\n\r\nplaces where there are shopping centres so that  it\r\n\r\nwill be convenient for tourists to call for a taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, like the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications, I am not aware of this $40 a  month\r\n\r\nfee which has to be paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> That is why I am bringing up\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Is this fee paid to the hotel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> This amounts to extortion and\r\n\r\nblackmail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if it is blackmail and illegal,\r\n\r\nwhy appeal to me?

Sometimes, it is the other  way  round.\r\n\r\nSome  taxi drivers extort from passengers. This  is\r\n\r\none  case where the hotels are extorting from  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for parking lots, I think the Member is aware\r\n\r\nthat  taxis are not allowed in hourly parking lots.\r\n\r\nThis   is   prohibited  under  the  Motor  Vehicles\r\n\r\n(Parking   Places)  Rules,  1959.   However,   this\r\n\r\nprohibition   has   been   relaxed    in    certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances where taxis find it necessary to park\r\n\r\nwithin a parking place on payment for reasons other\r\n\r\nthan  the  purpose of plying for hire  during  such\r\n\r\nperiod.  For  instance, letting  down  tourists  in\r\n\r\nshopping  areas and having to wait  for  them.  But\r\n\r\nthen  when we allow them to do this, cases of abuse\r\n\r\narise  and,  from time to time, have been  reported\r\n\r\nand  action has been taken where taxi drivers  have\r\n\r\ntried to ply for hire from parking places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for providing more taxi stands, we will look\r\n\r\ninto  it.  But as I have said just now, it  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  a  question of parking spaces for  taxis  but\r\n\r\nparking  spaces  for the general public.  With  the\r\n\r\nincreasing number of vehicles on the road, we  need\r\n\r\nmore and more parking spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister to instruct the Superintendent\r\n\r\nof  Car  Parks that in the marking out  of  parking\r\n\r\nlots,   he   should   be  more   discriminate   and\r\n\r\nconsiderate to shopkeepers and have regard  to  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  business  and the loading  and  unloading\r\n\r\nactivities which they have to perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Car Parks\r\n\r\nDivision has provided some 50 loading and unloading\r\n\r\nbays   at   its   174  parking  places   comprising\r\n\r\nover 10,000  parking lots.

Sir, it is undeniable that since\r\n\r\n1959, when the P.A.P. came to power, the Government\r\n\r\nhas   been  looking  into  the  problem  of   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The  Government has  been  allocating\r\n\r\nlarge  sums of money every year to improve the  lot\r\n\r\nof  the people in the rural area. This deserves our\r\n\r\npraise.  However, the same position does not  apply\r\n\r\nto  my  constituency. It has now been designated  a\r\n\r\ndeveloped  area.  I  do not know  whether  this  is\r\n\r\nfortunate or unfortunate for us. As Jurong has been\r\n\r\ndesignated  a  developed area,  the  earning  of  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood here is more difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nthan in other constituencies. Applications for  any\r\n\r\nproject must go through many departments, and  must\r\n\r\npass through the hands of many kuans, that is,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Building Surveyor's Department, the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  also the Jurong Town  Corporation.\r\n\r\nAfter   an  application  has  gone  through   these\r\n\r\ndepartments, it will be sent to the Urban and Rural\r\n\r\nServices  Committee for approval.  After  this,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be sent to the Projects Committee. Only after\r\n\r\nit has been approved by this committee will work on\r\n\r\nthe  project commence. Just imagine! An application\r\n\r\nhas  to go through many departments. Naturally this\r\n\r\nis  a  great  waste of time. Usually it  will  take\r\n\r\nabout  one  or two years before work on  a  project\r\n\r\nwill   commence.  Roads  which  should  have   been\r\n\r\nrepaired  are  neglected. In the  course  of  time,\r\n\r\ntheir condition begins to deteriorate. In the  end,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has to incur more money  to  repair\r\n\r\nthe roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. If an application is sent\r\n\r\nto  a  certain  department for  approval,  it  will\r\n\r\nusually shirk its responsibility and will not  deal\r\n\r\nwith  it. This is what I was complaining about  the\r\n\r\nother  day - the roundabout way an application  has\r\n\r\nto  go  through. It may well be that after  two  or\r\n\r\nthree years there will be no definite reply whether\r\n\r\na  project  can be undertaken. The Urban and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices  Committee  may not  be  in  favour  of  a\r\n\r\ncertain project for various reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case where it is necessary to metal a\r\n\r\nroad. Of course. I myself will not agree to a rural\r\n\r\ntrack  being  metalled  if  the  place  is  to   be\r\n\r\ndeveloped very soon. However, even applications for\r\n\r\nminor repairs have been turned down. I would appeal\r\n\r\nto   the  Minister  to  consider  the  applications\r\n\r\nfavourably,  as  the rural people also  pay  taxes.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  as  taxpayers, they  have  a  right  to\r\n\r\nbetter  roads. Even if they are required to remove,\r\n\r\nthey  will have to tread along good roads. It  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  easy for them to remove. Since  they  are\r\n\r\nobliged  to  pay taxes, they should be  given  good\r\n\r\nroads.  What I mean to say is that if major repairs\r\n\r\ncannot be made to certain\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nroads,  then  minor  repairs  should  at  least  be\r\n\r\nundertaken.  This will alleviate the  suffering  of\r\n\r\nthe  evicted  people, because if they use  the  bad\r\n\r\nroads  when  removing,  they may  incur  additional\r\n\r\nexpenses.  Of course, I realise that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  difficulties in matters like this. However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider\r\n\r\nthese  points. If there are certain  holes  in  the\r\n\r\nroads,  they should be filled up so that the people\r\n\r\nwho are evicted can travel along them more easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Member for Jurong has been a member of the\r\n\r\nUrban  and Rural Services Committee for some  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he must have known very well the way the\r\n\r\nU.R.S.C. goes about these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of repairs to roads,\r\n\r\nthis will depend on certain factors.

In the circumstances, any request for a\r\n\r\nproject  to  be undertaken in that constituency  is\r\n\r\nhanded  over to certain departments, for  instance,\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Town Corporation, the Land Office  and\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Building Surveyor's Department.

These\r\n\r\nprojects  include the building of  roads,  bridges,\r\n\r\ncanals and other construction work. We cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthat  the  Public Works Department has made  a  big\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  development  of   Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are certain shortcomings  in  this\r\n\r\nDepartment which call for remedy. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nadvance the following three points. First, is there\r\n\r\nduplication of work when the P.W.D. is  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthe  construction of roads? For instance, in  order\r\n\r\nto  widen a road, the P.W.D. will do away with  the\r\n\r\npavements along that road. After several  days,  it\r\n\r\nwill  once more construct pavements along it. There\r\n\r\nmay be a divider\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nin  the  middle of a dual carriage-way. After  some\r\n\r\ntime, this divider will be removed. The road may be\r\n\r\nturned into a one-way traffic road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strange thing is that after two or three\r\n\r\nweeks  the divider is again put back in the  centre\r\n\r\nof  the road, and once more the road becomes a dual\r\n\r\ncarriage-way. This laying and dismantling and again\r\n\r\nre-laying  the  divider  is really  surprising  and\r\n\r\nincomprehensible. What does all this show? It shows\r\n\r\nthat the Public Works Department normally does  not\r\n\r\nplan   its   projects  in  advance,   and   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion is the result. In the end, public  funds\r\n\r\nare wasted. I hope the Minister will supervise this\r\n\r\nDepartment and stop duplication of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give another example of the same\r\n\r\nmanner  of work done by the P.W.D. at the  junction\r\n\r\nof  Rochore Canal Road. Work on the central  circus\r\n\r\nhas  been delayed for one or two years, because  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  changed  about  in  the  manner  I  have\r\n\r\ndescribed. I do not know if the Minister  is  aware\r\n\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another point. When roads in the\r\n\r\nurban  areas  have to be repaired, I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nrepair  work be done at night. The reason  is  that\r\n\r\ntraffic  is  normally  very busy  during  the  day,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the city area such as  South  Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad  and  Robinson Road. If road  excavations  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  in order to lay underground  cables,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be better to carry them out in the night.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are done in the day, they will cause  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion because school children have  to  go  to\r\n\r\nschool  and people to their shops or offices.  This\r\n\r\nheavy traffic will also cause accidents. So I would\r\n\r\nask   the   Minister  whether  he   will   consider\r\n\r\ninstructing the Department concerned to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  road repair work at night instead of in  the\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister is whether or not he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nhas   received  reports  of  malpractice  by   some\r\n\r\ncontractors. In my constituency I find that certain\r\n\r\nroads  have pot-holes or cave-ins about six  months\r\n\r\nafter   they  were  made.  This  shows   that   the\r\n\r\nfoundation is not well laid. Normally there  should\r\n\r\nbe a solid base before the road can be metalled. So\r\n\r\nif the base is not properly laid, the surface will,\r\n\r\nof  course, cave in. I ask the Minister  if  he  is\r\n\r\naware   of   reports  of  malpractice  by   certain\r\n\r\ncontractors. If there are, I would like him to take\r\n\r\nmeasures to deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  rainy days, especially when the  rain  is\r\n\r\nheavy,  you will see pools of rain water collecting\r\n\r\nat  various  bus shelters and at pedestrian  cement\r\n\r\npavements  along  MacPherson Road  and  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nRoad,  and  perhaps  in other parts  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the stagnant rain water at  these  bus\r\n\r\nshelters, people who want to board the bus have  to\r\n\r\nstep  into the rain water and so wet their  shoes,\r\n\r\nsocks and trousers before they can get into it. The\r\n\r\nonly  way  they can avoid getting wet is either  to\r\n\r\nremain  at the bus shelters and not board the  bus,\r\n\r\nor  to  take off their shoes and socks and roll  up\r\n\r\ntheir trousers before stepping into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I request the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development to instruct the  Director  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Works  Department to  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter  to see that the rain water flows  into  the\r\n\r\ndrain  and not collect and stagnate at bus shelters\r\n\r\nand  pedestrian  cement pavements along  MacPherson\r\n\r\nRoad  and  Mountbatten Road, or in other  parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first deal\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. He mentioned the\r\n\r\nconstituencies of MacPherson and Mountbatten. I  am\r\n\r\ninclined  to ask: What about Toa Payoh or Bukit  Ho\r\n\r\nSwee?  Apparently the problem is this. Most of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  bus shelters were constructed many  years\r\n\r\nago  at a time when traffic conditions were not  as\r\n\r\nbad as they are today. In those days\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nbuses  were able to stop on the metalled  carriage-way without seriously interfering with the flow  of\r\n\r\ntraffic. But now we have many more vehicles on  the\r\n\r\nroad,  and  buses cannot stop on the metalled  side\r\n\r\nwithout  blocking vehicles behind  them.  So  as  a\r\n\r\nresult they go onto the side of the road. This  has\r\n\r\ncaused  land adjoining the edge of the carriage-way\r\n\r\nto  be  damaged, resulting either in ruts or holes,\r\n\r\nso  that,  as the Member said, passengers  get  wet\r\n\r\nwhen  they  step into puddles. However, the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department is now constructing more and  more\r\n\r\nproper bus bays and also carrying out rather urgent\r\n\r\nminor  widening of certain parts of the  roads  for\r\n\r\nthese  bus bays. This will convert the land between\r\n\r\nthe  bus shelters and the edge of the road  into  a\r\n\r\nproper  carriage-way,  and  you  can  see  some  in\r\n\r\nQueenstown and Toa Payoh. We hope to increase  them\r\n\r\nand lessen the plight of passengers on rainy days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now deal with the Member for Sembawang.\r\n\r\nHe  grumbles about roads and asks whether there  is\r\n\r\nco-ordination within the P.W.D. about the  building\r\n\r\nor  digging of roads. He must not blame the  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nalone, because it is not the P.W.D. alone that digs\r\n\r\nthese  roads. The Public Utilities Board also  digs\r\n\r\nroads. They dig roads to lay water and gas pipes or\r\n\r\nelectric  cables. Another board that digs roads  is\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board. They are quite busy\r\n\r\nin  extending  telephone services in Singapore.  So\r\n\r\nbetween  the  P.W.D., the P.U.B., and  the  S.T.B.,\r\n\r\nthere was chaos at one time. The P.W.D. would build\r\n\r\na  road  and metal it. Then the following week  the\r\n\r\nP.U.B. would come along and dig it to lay a  water\r\n\r\npipe; they would then fill it up and metal it. Then\r\n\r\non  the following week the S.T.B. would come  along\r\n\r\nand dig it up again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand from my colleague, the previous Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development, that when he  took  over\r\n\r\nthe office of National Development, he had occasion\r\n\r\nto call a meeting of all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe road-diggers - if I may call them  \r\n\r\nsuch; and he gave them certain instruc  \r\n\r\ntions and asked them to co-ordinate.  \r\n\r\nApparently they did it with some \r\n\r\nsuccess, but not sufficient, as far as I \r\n\r\nwas concerned when I took over the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago I also had\r\n\r\noccasion to call a meeting of all the \r\n\r\nroad-diggers.   They   posed   certain\r\n\r\nquestions to me. I directed that once\r\n\r\na road was newly surfaced or built, no\r\n\r\none was to dig it without the permission \r\n\r\nof the Director of Public Works. Then\r\n\r\nthe queries came: \"What happens if a\r\n\r\nwater main bursts? What happens if an\r\n\r\nelectric  cable  short-circuits?  What\r\n\r\nhappens if there is a gas leak? We cannot wait for the permission of the\r\n\r\nDirector of Public Works to attend to\r\n\r\nthese matters.\" Anyway, we have\r\n\r\nsettled that, and I have directed that\r\n\r\nno department is to dig any newly-built road without the permission of\r\n\r\nthe Director of Public Works. Of course,\r\n\r\nif a gas main is leaking, or water is\r\n\r\nrunning out of a pipe, these can be\r\n\r\nrepaired immediately. This has led to\r\n\r\nsome measure of success. So if you see\r\n\r\na newly-built road or a newly-surfaced\r\n\r\nroad, and someone comes and digs it\r\n\r\nthe following week, please let me\r\n\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also\r\n\r\nwants road repairing to be done at night. This entails certain problems. It means\r\n\r\ndouble pay, and not all types of work\r\n\r\ncan be done at night without bright\r\n\r\nlights. But there have been certain cases\r\n\r\nwhere, to avoid traffic jams in congested parts of the city, work has been\r\n\r\ndone at night. This has been done at\r\n\r\nthe barest minimum. But if we can\r\n\r\nmeet the question of costs, I would agree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Sembawang that\r\n\r\nif all road work can be done at night\r\n\r\n- and I am told that not all road work\r\n\r\ncan be done at night - inconvenience\r\n\r\nto the public will be lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I withdraw my amendment,\r\n\r\nI have two supplementary questions to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraise. First, the Minister has said just\r\n\r\nnow that because there was no proper\r\n\r\nliaison between certain departments\r\n\r\ncertain projects could not be properly\r\n\r\nco-ordinated. This has led to undesirable\r\n\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, both\r\n\r\nthe P.U.B. and the Public Works Department are under the portfolio of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law and National Development. Therefore, the Ministry should\r\n\r\nhave long ago taken measures to co-ordinate these departments so that such\r\n\r\nincidents would not have happened. The\r\n\r\nMinister has said that no such incidents\r\n\r\nwere repeated recently, but I tell him\r\n\r\nthat the same things did happen. For\r\n\r\ninstance, according to what I understand, the construction work along Mac-Pherson Road has been carried on for\r\n\r\nhalf a year. So far it has not been\r\n\r\ncompleted yet. I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto investigate why work on it has been\r\n\r\nso slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point the Minister\r\n\r\nhas not answered me, and that is whether he has received any reports about\r\n\r\nmalpractices by certain contractors. If\r\n\r\nso, the number of cases reported last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no\r\n\r\ndoubt the Public Utilities Board and\r\n\r\nthe Public Works Department are under\r\n\r\nthe same Ministry, called the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Law and National Development. I\r\n\r\ncan assure the Member that these are\r\n\r\ntwo separate Ministries - the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board being under the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Law and the Public Works Department under the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. The only connection is\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that nothing was done.

It is also not an uncommon\r\n\r\nsight to see street lights left on into\r\n\r\nthe day. Sometimes even at 12 noon\r\n\r\nyou can still see the street lights are\r\n\r\non.

In such circumstances, street lamps  may\r\n\r\nbe  on  when they should be off or vice versa until\r\n\r\nthey  are reset. Hence the Member's query and mine.\r\n\r\nThere   are   apparently  20,000  such   time-clock\r\n\r\nswitches  in  service,  and  it  would  cost  about\r\n\r\n$100,000 to replace them with a more modern type of\r\n\r\ntime-clock switch which is not affected by  failure\r\n\r\nof electricity supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of switches are those controlled\r\n\r\nby  photo-electric  cells  which  are  switched  on\r\n\r\nautomatically  when night falls  and  switched  off\r\n\r\nwith  the  advent  of daylight.  Street  lights  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  which  are  controlled  by   photo-electric cells may come on and off depending on the\r\n\r\ndarkness or the brightness of the sky. As the times\r\n\r\nof sunset and sunrise vary during the course of the\r\n\r\nyear,  so  will  those  lights  come  on  and   off\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> This is not very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI  would  invite the Minister concerned to  take  a\r\n\r\ndrive  from  Newton Circle all  the  way  up  north\r\n\r\nbetween  6.30  p.m. and 6.45 p.m. It  is  quite  an\r\n\r\ninteresting  sight  to see that the  street  lights\r\n\r\nseem not to be following any fixed time schedule at\r\n\r\nall along the same stretch of road.

Very rigid application of the  law\r\n\r\nquite often stands in the way of house owners  and\r\n\r\nhut  owners  from  repairing or  renovating  their\r\n\r\nhouses whenever there is a leakage\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nafter  rain  or whenever there is dilapidation  or\r\n\r\nsomething like that. Perhaps directives  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to these inspectors not to be too harsh  on\r\n\r\nthese  residents.  I would have thought  that  the\r\n\r\nmain  purpose of the law is to prevent people from\r\n\r\nactually  building  new  structures  or  extending\r\n\r\ntheir  structures without getting  proper  permits\r\n\r\nfrom  the  owners  as well as the  Chief  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor's  Department. Quite often, house  owners\r\n\r\nare  pulled  up  by the Chief Building  Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment  on very small and venal  points.  Sir,\r\n\r\ncould something be done about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W.

But\r\n\r\nwhenever  a  house  is rebuilt  or  repaired,  one\r\n\r\nquestion  arises  and  this  sometimes  leads   to\r\n\r\ndifficulty  as  to whether or not the  landowner's\r\n\r\npermission  and signature should be obtained.  The\r\n\r\nlandowner  is  only too happy to get  rid  of  his\r\n\r\ntenant or occupier and, in most cases, he will not\r\n\r\nsign.  So  we  have not applied the  rule  rigidly\r\n\r\nhere.  Members  can tell their constituents  that,\r\n\r\nfor  minor  repairs to temporary dwelling  houses,\r\n\r\nthese  can  be  approved without  the  landowner's\r\n\r\nsignature.    In   addition,   applications    for\r\n\r\nreconstruction  of  temporary  houses  which   are\r\n\r\ndilapidated  -  in  other  words,  demolish   and\r\n\r\nrebuild  -  can also be made and approved  without\r\n\r\nthe  landowner's  permission.  But  there  is  one\r\n\r\ndanger to this. In many cases, they say that  they\r\n\r\nare rebuilding the same house, but they do not and\r\n\r\nthen  they  are in trouble. They do not  need  the\r\n\r\nlandowner's permission provided they rebuild the\r\n\r\nsame house on the site. If the room is 10 feet  by\r\n\r\n10  feet make it 10 feet by 10 feet. In that case,\r\n\r\nyou do not need the landowner's permission.

Presumably,  the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens has an important role to play  in\r\n\r\nthis campaign. Yet when one looks at the staff list\r\n\r\nof the Botanic Gardens, one is surprised to see the\r\n\r\ndearth  of trained horticulturists in such a  staff\r\n\r\nlist.  According to the 1968 Botanic Gardens Annual\r\n\r\nReport,  one of the curators whose field, I  think,\r\n\r\nis  horticulture was transferred to the  Trees  and\r\n\r\nParks Division. This brings me to the point that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  more  efficient, in  my  view,  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  Singapore's development  as  a  garden\r\n\r\ncity,  that the Botanic Gardens and the  Trees  and\r\n\r\nParks Division should come under one management, so\r\n\r\nto  speak.  We  certainly  hope  to  see  continued\r\n\r\nsuccess   in  the  Government's  efforts  to   turn\r\n\r\nSingapore into a garden city.

In  other  words,   the   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees should  get  together  and\r\n\r\nchoose  places  for planting, and when  the  plants\r\n\r\nhave been grown, the maintenance will be completely\r\n\r\ndone  by members of the constituency in which  case\r\n\r\nthey  will  not only maintain the plants  but  also\r\n\r\nprotect  them.

I  believe  that  to  phone   for   the\r\n\r\nambulance  and get it is quite an experience  now.\r\n\r\nThe  telephone call is received all right, but all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  questions are asked; for instance,  who\r\n\r\nthe  patient is and what he is suffering from. All\r\n\r\nkinds  of irrelevant questions are asked and quite\r\n\r\noften the person calling for the ambulance is  not\r\n\r\nable  to  answer  them. Is this really  necessary?\r\n\r\nBecause  if  the person asking for  the  ambulance\r\n\r\nknows what the patient is suffering from, then, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he  may not have called the ambulance  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  instance. It can be quite embarrassing\r\n\r\nand  it is also causing a fair amount of confusion\r\n\r\nin the minds of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish to raise two minor points in respect\r\n\r\nof   two   hospitals  in  my  constituency  namely\r\n\r\nMiddleton  Hospital  and Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital.\r\n\r\nWhen  one  passes  by  these two  hospitals  along\r\n\r\nMoulmein   Road,  one  gets  a  very  gloomy   and\r\n\r\nunhealthy feeling when one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsees  the  drab  frontage of  Middleton  Hospital.\r\n\r\nThere is lalang growing beside the iron bars. I am\r\n\r\njust wondering whether some face-lifting cannot he\r\n\r\ndone  to the frontage of Middleton Hospital.  With\r\n\r\nour  present policy of making Singapore  a  garden\r\n\r\ncity, perhaps that portion of the hospital can  be\r\n\r\nimproved by planting flowering plants so  that  it\r\n\r\ncan look more graceful and also take away the drab\r\n\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago a Member of this House mentioned\r\n\r\nhis  very  unpleasant experience in a hospital  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the rude conduct of  a  nurse.  There\r\n\r\ncould  have  been  many reasons for  that  nurse's\r\n\r\nbehaviour. At this juncture, I do not know exactly\r\n\r\nthe  reason which prompted her to behave  in  that\r\n\r\nmanner.   But  perhaps  her  behaviour  could   be\r\n\r\nattributed  to  the fact that she was  overworked.\r\n\r\nSomeone has drawn my attention to the fact that in\r\n\r\nthe   third-class  ward  where  there   are   many\r\n\r\npatients,  there are insufficient nurses  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  them. They are, in fact, overworked. I  had\r\n\r\none  occasion to visit one of the hospitals myself\r\n\r\nand  I  observed the conditions there. But  unlike\r\n\r\nthe  Member  who was unfortunate to experience the\r\n\r\nrudeness of a nurse, I found that our nurses  were\r\n\r\nin fact very diligent and dedicated. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwas  very surprised to hear the complaint  of  the\r\n\r\nMember.  I  have also found that the work  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital  is too heavy for the present  number  of\r\n\r\nnurses to cope with, I would like to say the other\r\n\r\nway  round  about them. If at all we want  to  say\r\n\r\nanything about their work, it is that they are  in\r\n\r\nfact working very hard and they deserve our praise\r\n\r\ninstead of criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason which has prompted me to have a\r\n\r\nvery  high  regard  for  our  nurses  is  this.  I\r\n\r\nremember  one occasion when I turned on the  radio\r\n\r\nand  there  was  a programme called Nurses'  Week.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the programmes that are put on  the\r\n\r\nair  every week. It is a week which the nurses set\r\n\r\naside  as  a dedication to their noble profession.\r\n\r\nThis  programme shows a number of activities which\r\n\r\nfocus attention on the nurses' dedication to their\r\n\r\nwork and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nnobility  of their profession. Coming back  to  our\r\n\r\nown  nurses,  generally speaking,  they  are  quite\r\n\r\naware  of their responsibility and the nobility  of\r\n\r\ntheir  profession. My observation is  that  - and  I\r\n\r\nthink  many people have also expressed this opinion\r\n\r\n-  the  nurses have made valuable contributions  to\r\n\r\nthe  well-being of the people, and from their  work\r\n\r\nin  the  hospitals, we can say that they  have,  in\r\n\r\nfact, tried their very best. I would like to pay  a\r\n\r\ntribute  to  them. Perhaps the Minister  for  Health\r\n\r\nwould  like to show some appreciation of  the  hard\r\n\r\nwork  that  they  are putting in by employing  more\r\n\r\nnurses to lighten their load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like to deal with the\r\n\r\nmatter  raised by the Member for Bukit Panjang.  He\r\n\r\nsays  that  whenever  a  telephone  call  for   the\r\n\r\nambulance  service is made, a number  of  questions\r\n\r\nare asked by the person in charge of ambulances. He\r\n\r\nsays  that these questions are irrelevant. At first\r\n\r\nsight, they may appear to be irrelevant, but  there\r\n\r\nis  a  reason  for  asking  the  questions.  It  is\r\n\r\nessential  to  have  certain  information  when  an\r\n\r\nambulance  is called. First, we must establish  the\r\n\r\nidentity  of  the  person who is  calling  for  the\r\n\r\nambulance in order to determine the genuineness  of\r\n\r\nthe call. There have previously been numerous false\r\n\r\nambulance  calls and the asking of these  questions\r\n\r\nhas reduced them to some extent. The reason why  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to know where the patient is and what\r\n\r\nhe  is  suffering  from is that  the  call  can  be\r\n\r\nanswered  by the ambulance nearest to the  patient.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the  Thomson Road  General  Hospital\r\n\r\nprovides  a 24-hour ambulance service, and  if  the\r\n\r\npatient  is nearer to that hospital or around  that\r\n\r\narea,  it will be faster if an ambulance is  called\r\n\r\nfrom  that hospital. Therefore, the question asking\r\n\r\nfor  that  information is certainly not irrelevant.\r\n\r\nIf  a patient is suffering from an injury caused by\r\n\r\nan  accident, then the call is directed to the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade ambulance. Of course, one question\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhich  is  usually asked is, \"May I  know   who  is\r\n\r\ncalling?\" Sometimes the person who is in charge  of\r\n\r\nthe telephone may not ask it in a polite manner. He\r\n\r\nmay  ask, \"Who are you?\" We have issued a directive\r\n\r\nto  all  persons in charge of the ambulance service\r\n\r\nto  be  polite to members of the public  when  they\r\n\r\ncall for an ambulance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Moulmein, he said that\r\n\r\nwhenever  he  passed  the  two  hospitals  in   his\r\n\r\nconstituency, he had a gloomy feeling about  it.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know whether it is the appearance  of  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  or  whether  it  is  because  they   are\r\n\r\nhospitals. I agree with him that it is good to make\r\n\r\nhospitals attractive. But the trouble is that these\r\n\r\ntwo  hospitals  in his constituency  are  very  old\r\n\r\nbuildings, and a lot of money is needed to  do  any\r\n\r\nform of face-lifting. But whatever can be done will\r\n\r\ncertainly be done to make them more attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Member made concerned\r\n\r\nthe  behaviour  and  work  of  the  nurses  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals. He did take the opportunity to pay  them\r\n\r\na  high tribute. That, of course, is welcome and  I\r\n\r\nshall   convey   that  message   to   the   nurses,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Member himself is\r\n\r\na trade unionist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case of rudeness was brought up by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Punggol. In this respect, may I say that in any\r\n\r\norganisation there is bound to be a black sheep. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  rude  behaviour of  the  black  sheep\r\n\r\nshould not necessarily reflect on the good work  of\r\n\r\nthe majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1302 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1068.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the medical services in our country can be\r\n\r\nconsidered as one of the best in South-east  Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nacknowledged fact of which the people of Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  be  proud. The medical services have improved\r\n\r\nin  many  ways recently, but there is  still  more\r\n\r\nroom  for  improvement. For  instance,  we  should\r\n\r\nexpand and improve the services of the Outram Road\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital casualty ward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often I have been around this casualty ward\r\n\r\nand  I see that it is very busy and crowded. There\r\n\r\nare  many  patients, and many  of  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninjured have to wait for more than an hour or  two\r\n\r\nbefore  they  are admitted. If the  Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat this is due to inadequate staff, then my view\r\n\r\nis  that  perhaps they lack efficiency. I hope  he\r\n\r\nwill  do  something to improve the  efficiency  of\r\n\r\nthis  casualty ward, so that our medical  services\r\n\r\ncan become even better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall, may I thank the Member for Thomson for saying\r\n\r\nthat  our  medical services have greatly  improved\r\n\r\nrecently.  May  I also add that I agree  with  him\r\n\r\nthat there is always room for further improvement.\r\n\r\nHe  mentioned the Emergency Unit as a place  where\r\n\r\nthere could be more improvement. He also mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  he visits it, he finds  it  rather\r\n\r\ncrowded. May I give him the reasons?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only two Emergency Units for the whole\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. One is at the Outram  Road  General\r\n\r\nHospital  and  the  other is at the  Thomson  Road\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital.  There are  normally  only  two\r\n\r\ndoctors  manning the Emergency Unit and in certain\r\n\r\nhours  it  is reduced to one doctor at the  Outram\r\n\r\nRoad  General  Hospital Emergency  Unit.  Formerly\r\n\r\nthere was only one doctor on duty at all times. So\r\n\r\nthere is improvement in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time taken to attend to an emergency case\r\n\r\ndepends  on  how busy the Emergency  Unit  is, in\r\n\r\ncases  of  dire emergency, the patient  is  rushed\r\n\r\nthrough  as  quickly as possible, cutting  through\r\n\r\nthe queue of waiting persons. However the majority\r\n\r\nof cases which go to this\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEmergency Unit are not really emergency cases.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past year there has been an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  non-emergency  cases  attending   the\r\n\r\nEmergency Unit. Therefore, it invariably takes  up\r\n\r\na  good  deal  of the staff's time to  screen  and\r\n\r\nexamine them, and, as a result, the time spent  in\r\n\r\nattending  to them has taken away the  time  which\r\n\r\nshould   be  devoted  to  truly  emergency  cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is under constant review  and\r\n\r\nwe  have  made certain other improvements  in  the\r\n\r\norganisation of the Emergency Unit. We  have  made\r\n\r\nmore  space available so that more doctors can  be\r\n\r\nput on duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution to this problem which I have\r\n\r\nstated  before is to direct persons who  come  for\r\n\r\nnon-emergency  treatment to  the  nearest  private\r\n\r\npractitioner who opens after office hours. A  list\r\n\r\nof these clinics has been supplied to the Ministry\r\n\r\nby  the  Singapore  Medical Association.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no complete solution to guarantee  that\r\n\r\npersons attending the Emergency Unit will not have\r\n\r\nto  wait.  There  must be adequate facilities  and\r\n\r\nsufficient medical staff. There must also  be  co-operation between doctors in private practice  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  service  and  the  public  should\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  actual  role  of  the   Emergency\r\n\r\nService, i.e. if the cases are of a non-emergency\r\n\r\nnature,  they should not go to the Emergency  Unit\r\n\r\nand clog up the work of the doctors there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is hoped that with the taking over\r\n\r\nof  the British Military Hospital at Alexandra  in\r\n\r\n1971,  the pressure on the Emergency Service  will\r\n\r\nbe decreased and consequently the waiting time can\r\n\r\nbe brought down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1302 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1204.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I, in my discussion, range over my next\r\n\r\namendment+?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n+ The amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1302 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1226\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, everyone is\r\n\r\naware  that  in  order  to provide  better  medical\r\n\r\nservices   for   the  people  of   Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   set   up   out-patient   clinics\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  island. These out-patient  clinics\r\n\r\nare  set  up with the money derived from the  taxes\r\n\r\nthat Government collects from the people, and these\r\n\r\nclinics belong to the state. They are owned by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. However, certain doctors  in\r\n\r\nthese  out-patient clinics treat these  clinics  as\r\n\r\ntheir  own  personal property, totally disregarding\r\n\r\nthe public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on one occasions some members\r\n\r\nof  the  national volleyball team and I went  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain inoculation centre for inoculation. It  was\r\n\r\nabout 1.30 p.m and there was a slight drizzle. Many\r\n\r\npeople  were queueing up for inoculation in a  very\r\n\r\norderly  manner  in  front of  the  porch  of  this\r\n\r\nclinic, to shelter from the rain. They were waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the arrival of the doctor. He arrived  in  his\r\n\r\ncar.  However,  when he saw them  standing  on  his\r\n\r\nparking  lot, he sounded the horn to warn  them  to\r\n\r\nclear out. But because it was raining at that time.\r\n\r\nit  was unreasonable of him to ask them to get  out\r\n\r\nof  the  porch. At first I intended to reason  with\r\n\r\nhim,  but  before  I could approach  him  I  saw  a\r\n\r\nsignboard  fastened to the pillar with  the  words,\r\n\r\n\"Private Reserved Parking Space\". So I gave up  the\r\n\r\nidea.  But I still am of the opinion that all these\r\n\r\ninoculation  centres are set up by the  Government,\r\n\r\nand the porches at these centres are also built  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. They are not built by the  doctors\r\n\r\nthemselves. How can they abuse their privilege  and\r\n\r\nmonopolise the use of the porches? It is common  to\r\n\r\nsee  doctors making use of these porches  as  their\r\n\r\nparking  lots.  Even in the MacPherson  Out-patient\r\n\r\nClinic,  which  is  in  the  constituency  of   our\r\n\r\nMinister, that is no exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.30 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures does the Minister intend to take to\r\n\r\ndeal with this kind of conduct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point relates to the attitude of the\r\n\r\nnurses  at  the out-patient clinics.  Just  now  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Member for Moulmein,  paid  a  fine\r\n\r\ntribute to their work. However, I cannot agree with\r\n\r\nhim  on this point. I spoke at great length on  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the nurses when the Budget was  debated\r\n\r\nlast year. There are still some nurses who are very\r\n\r\ncontemptuous  of  the  patients.  I  have  received\r\n\r\ncomplaints  by  the  residents  and  I  myself  had\r\n\r\noccasion to witness an incident. It was like  this.\r\n\r\nAn  elderly woman who was very ill was taken to the\r\n\r\nMacPherson  Outpatient  Clinic  for  treatment.  On\r\n\r\narriving  there she vomited and dirtied the  place.\r\n\r\nAt  that  very moment a nurse came along.  She  was\r\n\r\nquite  beside herself. She screamed and shouted  at\r\n\r\nthis poor woman. This elderly woman was very ill and  probably the fact that she had travelled a  long\r\n\r\ndistance on bumpy roads to the clinic caused her to\r\n\r\nvomit.  This particular nurse by not rendering  any\r\n\r\nhelp  to  her  was  already  making  a  very  grave\r\n\r\nmistake;  but  to show callousness towards  such  a\r\n\r\npatient  was to add insult to injury. Many patients\r\n\r\nat the clinic were very unhappy about this incident\r\n\r\nand  tried  to argue with the nurse.  She,  with  a\r\n\r\nscornful look, walked away. Since she dared to show\r\n\r\nher  insolence and rudeness before so many  people,\r\n\r\nyou  can  imagine  what more she  could  have  been\r\n\r\ncapable of. I wonder whether the Minister has noted\r\n\r\nsuch rudeness and irresponsibility shown by some of\r\n\r\nthe nurses and, if so, what measures he intends  to\r\n\r\ntake to deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Moulmein paid a tribute\r\n\r\nto the nurses, but now I am doing the contrary -  I\r\n\r\nam criticising them. I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvey  to  the nurses who work in his Ministry  my\r\n\r\nfeelings  of  dissatisfaction  with  them  and   my\r\n\r\ncriticism of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed\r\n\r\nin  a  very  interesting position! The  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein has asked me to convey his tribute  to  my\r\n\r\nnurses, and now I have been asked by the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar to convey to them his criticism of their\r\n\r\nrudeness  to members of the public. I shall  convey\r\n\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are altogether 27 out-patient\r\n\r\ndispensaries scattered all over Singapore to  serve\r\n\r\nthe public. For the year 1969 there were 47 doctors\r\n\r\nand   83   nurses  working  in  these   out-patient\r\n\r\ndispensaries. The total number of out-patients seen\r\n\r\nand  treated was 1,573,171 in 1969. But the  number\r\n\r\nof  complaints regarding rudeness received  against\r\n\r\nthe  doctors and nurses in 1969 was only  six.  The\r\n\r\ntwo instances of rudeness which the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar has narrated to this House were not, however,\r\n\r\namong these six complaints of rudeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the out-patient dispensaries, the doctors and\r\n\r\nnurses  are  in constant contact with  the  public.\r\n\r\nLarge  crowds  are seen there daily,  and  in  such\r\n\r\nlarge  crowds  there are bound to  be  patients  of\r\n\r\ndifferent temperaments, and some of them  may  make\r\n\r\nunreasonable  demands. When their demands  are  not\r\n\r\nmet,  they do sometimes make rude remarks and lodge\r\n\r\nofficial complaints. However, the staff of the out-patient  dispensaries have frequently been reminded\r\n\r\nto  be courteous to members of the public. This  is\r\n\r\ndone   by   routine  inspections   of   out-patient\r\n\r\ndispensaries    by   senior    members    of    the\r\n\r\nadministrative office of the Out-patient  Services.\r\n\r\nWhenever a complaint is received, a visit  is  made\r\n\r\nto  the  particu1ar out-patient dispensary  and  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation is carried out. The officer concerned\r\n\r\nis  asked  to  give an explanation  and  a  written\r\n\r\nreport  of the incident. He is also called  up  and\r\n\r\ninterviewed. If it is felt that there is still room\r\n\r\nfor  improvement in his conduct, then he is warned\r\n\r\nand advised to be\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nless  abrupt and more helpful in his dealings  with\r\n\r\nthe  public.  In  general, the staff  of  the  out-patient  dispensaries have been told to  be  always\r\n\r\npolite to the people and to be sympathetic to their\r\n\r\nrequests. But in dealing with such a large crowd of\r\n\r\npatients,  there  are likely  to  be  instances  of\r\n\r\nfrayed  tempers,  and  these are  investigated  and\r\n\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, out of the six complaints\r\n\r\nreceived,  every  one of them was investigated  and\r\n\r\nwas found to be unsubstantiated. Unfortunately, the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar did not see fit to submit his\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to  me. If he had done  so,  the  matter\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  properly investigated.  It  will\r\n\r\ngreatly assist the work of my Ministry to provide a\r\n\r\ncourteous  and  efficient medical  service  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  if  Members can give specific instances  of\r\n\r\nrudeness  by  the staff of the Ministry immediately\r\n\r\nupon  their occurrence either to me or my  Director\r\n\r\nof  Medical  Services, and not  bring  them  up  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  Of  course, if we did  not  adequately\r\n\r\ndeal  with the complaint, the Member could air  the\r\n\r\nmatter  in Parliament. Unfortunately, this was  not\r\n\r\ndone.  What we need is a specific complaint, backed\r\n\r\nby  witnesses if necessary, so that the complainant\r\n\r\ncan  assist the Ministry in identifying the officer\r\n\r\nconcerned and the case dealt with properly. As  you\r\n\r\nknow, in any incident there are always two sides to\r\n\r\nthe story. It is only fair that both sides must  be\r\n\r\nheard and considered. However, if the complaint  is\r\n\r\nsubstantiated, disciplinary action  will  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  the officer concerned. As Members know,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  a person who will flinch from taking  firm\r\n\r\nand  drastic  action  against any  officer  who  is\r\n\r\nguilty  after the case has been fairly  and  justly\r\n\r\nconsidered, whatever the consequences. A vague  and\r\n\r\ngeneral  allegation will certainly not help  us  at\r\n\r\nall.  As  a  matter  of fact, my Ministry  welcomes\r\n\r\nsubstantiated complaints, not only from Members but\r\n\r\nalso   from  members  of  the  public.  We   regard\r\n\r\nsubstantiated complaints as a means of intelligence\r\n\r\nreport that tells us whether the operations of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  have  been  carried out  efficiently  and\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has no less than 20,000 members - about 10,000 in the Hospitals Division and 10,000\r\n\r\nin  the  Public Health Division. Unless we  have  a\r\n\r\nsystem  of  feed-back  by members  of  the  public,\r\n\r\nincluding   Members,  who  can  make  substantiated\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  there is no good way in which  we  can\r\n\r\nknow  whether  every one of the 20,000  members  is\r\n\r\nworking  efficiently.  I  myself  can  make   field\r\n\r\nvisits, which I often do, but the snag here is that\r\n\r\nwhen they know that I am coming, everything appears\r\n\r\nall right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any organisation there are\r\n\r\nbound  to  be a few black sheep whose bad behaviour\r\n\r\nbrings  a  bad name to the whole organisation.  Our\r\n\r\nproblem  is to identify these few black  sheep  and\r\n\r\ntake  tougher action against them. With a  view  to\r\n\r\nmaking it easier for members of the public not only\r\n\r\nto  identify these few black sheep but also, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  to  commend those  officers  who  are\r\n\r\ncourteous   and   efficient,  I  have   last   year\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  system whereby every officer  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry has to wear a name tag. This is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat these few black sheep should not get away with\r\n\r\ntheir  anonymity  and  mar the  good  name  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of our doctors and nurses who are working,\r\n\r\nin the words of the Member for Moulmein, \"very hard\r\n\r\nto  maintain the best medical service in this  part\r\n\r\nof the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore I withdraw my amendment, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to reply to my question of porches  in\r\n\r\nfront of the clinics being used by doctors to  park\r\n\r\ntheir cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The Minister mentioned name\r\n\r\ntags.

Of  course, they are used for that  purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Member asked whether patients should be allowed\r\n\r\nto  take shelter under the porches if it rains.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, to a doctor who has humanity at heart, I am\r\n\r\nsure  that  irrespective  of  directives  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  he will allow human beings, rather  than\r\n\r\nhis car, to take shelter under the porch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI am not very satisfied with the reply given by the\r\n\r\nMinister.

The proposed plan provides for  only\r\n\r\none  senior health officer, while I consider  that\r\n\r\nmore  than  one  doctor will be required  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  industrial  health  of  around  80,000\r\n\r\nworkers   in  the  manufacturing  industries.   An\r\n\r\nauthority,   the  President  of  the  Society   of\r\n\r\nOccupational Medicine, in an article reproduced in\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsouvenir  magazine commemorating a public forum  on\r\n\r\n\"Health,  Labour and Productivity\", in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  World  Health Day, estimated  that  at  least\r\n\r\nfive  doctors  would be required to  run  the  Unit\r\n\r\nefficiently, besides being adequately  staffed  and\r\n\r\nequipped. The differences in the reckonings of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  the  President  of  the  Society  of\r\n\r\nOccupational  Medicine are too wide apart  to  make\r\n\r\nboth  right. One must be terribly off the  mark.  I\r\n\r\nam   convinced  that  the  Industrial  Health  Unit\r\n\r\nrequires more than one doctor to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nfunction  satisfactorily.  Will  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth make a categorical statement that one doctor\r\n\r\nwill  be  sufficient to achieve fully the programme\r\n\r\nlaid out by him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the dramatic changes that have\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  about  by the Minister  for  Health.\r\n\r\nInstead  of an ad hoc inter-departmental industrial\r\n\r\nhealth committee, we have a permanently established\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Health  Unit within the  Public  Health\r\n\r\nDivision.  Instead of having a doctor shuttling  to\r\n\r\nand  from  the Ministry of Health and  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate on two mornings each week, we  have  a\r\n\r\nfull-time  senior health officer  attached  to  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  Health Unit. In addition, there  is  an\r\n\r\ninspector  of  Factories pinched from  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate.  There  are  also  going  to  be  two\r\n\r\ntrainee  public health inspectors and  two  student\r\n\r\nnurses   at  the  earlier  stages,  if  I  presume\r\n\r\ncorrectly.  Without casting any aspersions  on  the\r\n\r\nincumbents  of  the two latter mentioned  posts,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to say that this is the  biggest  joke\r\n\r\never  played by the Minister for Health so far.  It\r\n\r\nwill  take  a  couple of years  more  before  these\r\n\r\ntrainee public health inspectors and student nurses\r\n\r\nqualify  and  gain  experience  in  the  field   of\r\n\r\nindustrial health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the Minister for Health had the\r\n\r\ngreatest audacity to announce in Parliament on  the\r\n\r\n22nd of December 1969, that there were going to  be\r\n\r\na  full-time medical officer - this is granted now -\r\n\r\nan   industrial   hygienist  with  an   engineering\r\n\r\nbackground, and eight other professional  and  non-professional staff. It is agreed there will be  one\r\n\r\nstenographer,  one general clerical assistant,  one\r\n\r\nwatchman  and  one  office boy.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  knows  as well as I do that the  Industrial\r\n\r\nHealth   Unit   does   not  depend   so   much   on\r\n\r\nstenographers,  clerks, watchmen and  office  boys.\r\n\r\nWhere are the professional staff that he knows will\r\n\r\ngive  adequate industrial health services? I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Health Unit is  under-staffed  and\r\n\r\nrickety  and  will  be unable to  realise  all  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  laid  down  by the  Unit.

If I have my finger at the right\r\n\r\npoint, I think it is the Treasury boys who are\r\n\r\nagainst the plan of the Ministry of Health just as\r\n\r\nthey were against the upgrading of the post of\r\n\r\nChief Inspector of Factories and the stepping up of\r\n\r\nthe expansion of the Factory Inspectorate. Probably\r\n\r\nthe Treasury bureaucrats who sit in their cool,\r\n\r\nclean and comfortable offices are not very\r\n\r\nconvinced that Singapore's economic progress\r\n\r\ndepends partly on the health of the workers. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Health will be rest assured that all\r\n\r\nworkers and thinking people are behind him in his\r\n\r\nfight, if he makes it his fight, with the Treasury\r\n\r\nto get a bigger allocation for the Industrial\r\n\r\nHealth Unit. I would have been able to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health heartily if he had set up the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Health Unit on a more sound basis. I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister for Finance will take note that\r\n\r\nit is important to safeguard the health of the\r\n\r\nworkers in the course of industrialising the\r\n\r\ncountry, for here lies the future of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Health Unit appears to be a very\r\n\r\nfavourite subject of the Member for Kallang.

May I also say\r\n\r\nthat a medical officer will be immediately\r\n\r\nappointed to head the Industrial Health Unit? A\r\n\r\nsecond medical officer will be sent on a one-year\r\n\r\nWorld Health Organisation fellowship to be trained\r\n\r\nin industrial health in the United Kingdom in\r\n\r\nSeptember\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n1970.

More  doctors\r\n\r\nwill be recruited if experience shows that this  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.

I  hope  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  industrialisation,  we  do  not  forget\r\n\r\nproblems arising from industrial activities. One of\r\n\r\nthese  problems is that of water and air  pollution\r\n\r\ncaused  by  refineries, steel works, cement  works,\r\n\r\nfoundries, quarries, power stations and other forms\r\n\r\nof  industrial  undertakings.

Even the Ministry of Health did\r\n\r\nnot   reckon  that  the  problem  required  special\r\n\r\nattention  and  forward planning,  as  was  in  the\r\n\r\nAnnual Report of 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote one instance where the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health has failed the people  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.  The  Ministry seems not  to  have  been\r\n\r\nbothered  in  the  least about  the  health  hazard\r\n\r\ncaused  by  cement  dust to the  health  of  school\r\n\r\nchildren  and  teachers at Towner  School,  Whampoa\r\n\r\nSchool,  Balestier Mixed Boys and Girls School  and\r\n\r\nalso to the health of the residents staying at  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  quarters along McNair Road  and  Towner\r\n\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents, out of concern for the health of the\r\n\r\nschool  children,  teachers  and  themselves,  have\r\n\r\ncomplained  about the dust which they have  had  to\r\n\r\nbreathe almost 24 hours a day for many years past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this cement factory has a fleet\r\n\r\nof  tracks  which run at intervals of approximately\r\n\r\nten  minutes and, in the course of transporting the\r\n\r\ncement,  have to pass along the schools and  houses\r\n\r\nalong  Towner  Road  and McNair  Road.  When  these\r\n\r\ntrucks  pass by, a thick dust of cement  fills  the\r\n\r\nair.  It  covers  the houses, cars,  furniture  and\r\n\r\nother  household effects. Washing  is  made  dirty.\r\n\r\nHealth becomes endangered. The residents waited and\r\n\r\nwaited  for some form of action to be taken by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health. It is my understanding that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health had proposed some measures,  but\r\n\r\nthey  were ineffective because there were no built-in  dust trapping devices. However, the factory was\r\n\r\nallowed to continue its operations during all these\r\n\r\nyears.  How  long  more will the residents,  school\r\n\r\nchildren and teachers in the area have to  suffer?\r\n\r\nThe residents, frustrated at having to wait for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health to do something positive,  re-directed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\ntheir  complaint  to  the Prime Minister's  Office.\r\n\r\nThis may be a surprise to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is no surprise to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\ncement factory is not the only factory causing  air\r\n\r\npollution.  However, I am glad that the  Government\r\n\r\nwill be taking measures to combat the pollution  of\r\n\r\nair   and  water  in  Singapore.  I  think  we  are\r\n\r\nfortunate in having a Prime Minister who  does  not\r\n\r\nlike  smoke  to  such an extent that  he  will  not\r\n\r\naddress  a group meeting if there is smoking  going\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the issue under consideration,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am informed by the Prime Minister's Office\r\n\r\nthat  the  cement  factory  will  be  relocated  to\r\n\r\nanother  site  as  soon  as  negotiations  for   an\r\n\r\nalternative site have been finalised.  Four  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf months have passed since the representation to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's  Office  was  made.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health is so concerned - I hope he will\r\n\r\nbe   concerned  about  this  problem - he  will   do\r\n\r\nsomething  quickly to solve this problem  which  is\r\n\r\naffecting the health of the people staying in  that\r\n\r\npart of Kallang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, air pollution in Singapore is\r\n\r\ncaused at the present moment more by vehicles  than\r\n\r\nby  factories.  In spite of what  the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles and the Police may have boasted they  have\r\n\r\ndone,  they  have been total failures in  punishing\r\n\r\nculprits  responsible for air  pollution.  I  think\r\n\r\nmore   drastic  measures  must  be  taken  by   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  as  a  whole in combating  atmospheric\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health may want to believe that\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  air  pollution  is  but  a  minor\r\n\r\nnuisance.  But I do not think so. I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  condition  of  our  public  and  private\r\n\r\nvehicles can compare more favourably than  that  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  and private vehicles in  other  places\r\n\r\nwhere  the  density of population is comparable  to\r\n\r\nthat  of  Singapore. The maintenance  consciousness\r\n\r\namong vehicle owners in Singapore is truly\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nshocking. One can witness hundreds of cars, lorries\r\n\r\nand buses emitting black fumes and smoke, and still\r\n\r\nthe  drivers and owners get off scot-free. It  must\r\n\r\nbe  realised  that petrol engines  also  cause  air\r\n\r\npollution.  According to some studies made  in  the\r\n\r\nU.S.A. and  Australia, petrol vehicles cause  some\r\n\r\n60.6 per cent of total air pollutant in the air and\r\n\r\nemits  92.9  per  cent  of  total  carbon  monoxide\r\n\r\nemitted by all sorts of air pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the Minister for Health to\r\n\r\npress  for  legislation to make  it  necessary  for\r\n\r\nvehicles  to  undergo a stringent test  every  five\r\n\r\nyears.  The owners of such vehicles should be  made\r\n\r\nto  rectify all faults before the vehicles could be\r\n\r\nallowed on the road again. Any owner who uses  such\r\n\r\na   vehicle   against  the  instructions   of   the\r\n\r\nauthorities   should  be  brought  to   book,   and\r\n\r\npersistent  offenders should  have  their  vehicles\r\n\r\nconfiscated  and condemned, and no vehicles  should\r\n\r\nbe  auctioned  by the Government itself  until  the\r\n\r\nfaults have been rectified. It must not try to make\r\n\r\na quick profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, those who market bulk petrol should\r\n\r\nbe  made to reach an agreement among themselves not\r\n\r\nto  market lead added fuel. I have received  advice\r\n\r\nfrom  some  competent authority  that  if  all  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies do not compete with one another by adding\r\n\r\nlead additives, we would probably make some headway\r\n\r\nto reduce air pollution. One other measure which we\r\n\r\ncan  take  at  this stage is possibly  to  make  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  ships  to fit  anti-smoke  devices.\r\n\r\nFactory  chimneys should be made  tall  enough  and\r\n\r\nanti-smoke and dust traps should be installed.  For\r\n\r\nfactories discharging effluence, properly  designed\r\n\r\ntraps should be installed to minimise discharge  of\r\n\r\nharmful effluence into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\naccept  my suggestion that in order to keep an  eye\r\n\r\non  the  problem of air pollution, a council should\r\n\r\nbe  set  up as soon as possible comprising  doctors\r\n\r\nand  engineers from the Industrial Health Unit, the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Health Division, the Public Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard, the Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks   Department,   representatives   from    the\r\n\r\nindustry,  the Automobile Association of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  other  relevant bodies who can  co-operate  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  I do not think any kind  of  inter-departmental   committee  composed  of   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments   will  be  able  to  make   a   proper\r\n\r\nassessment of this problem and combat pollution  of\r\n\r\nour atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

But  I\r\n\r\nthink that the same concern, if not more, should be\r\n\r\nexpressed  over air pollution caused by  automobile\r\n\r\nfumes.  In an article written for the 1969  edition\r\n\r\nof the Britannica Year Book entitled Agenda for the\r\n\r\nfuture,  the recent President of the United States,\r\n\r\nMr Lyndon Johnson, speaking on air pollution said,\r\n\r\n'...the  automobile  is  probably the  greatest  single\r\n\r\npoisoner of the air.' I am quoting\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfrom page 42 of the book. I think more positive and\r\n\r\nfirm  action  should be taken with regard  to  this\r\n\r\nform of chemical warfare, which in the long run  is\r\n\r\nbeing  directed  against  our  children,  for   the\r\n\r\neffects  of  this pollution are slow and  insidious\r\n\r\nand  may  not  be fully felt except by  the  coming\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with pollution from motor vehicles,\r\n\r\nSir,   I   say  that  the  Health  Ministry  should\r\n\r\ninvestigate  and decide what are the  standards  of\r\n\r\nemission  of  smoke  that may be  permissible,  and\r\n\r\nsternly enforce these standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It is somehow a happy  coincidence,\r\n\r\nSir, as I was looking through the latest edition of\r\n\r\nthe  London  Times dated 19th March, 1970,  in  the\r\n\r\nMembers' Room today I came across a letter  to  the\r\n\r\neditor  from a public health inspector  urging  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  of  air  pollution  caused   by   motor\r\n\r\nvehicles. The relevant point that I would  like  to\r\n\r\nbring out from this letter is that in America there\r\n\r\nis, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...a minimum standard whereby the emissions of\r\n\r\nhydro  carbon  and  carbon  monoxide  are  limited.\r\n\r\nFurther it is expected that other controls will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced in the near future.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I learned from the same letter that in\r\n\r\nBelgium there are standards enforced in relation to\r\n\r\npollution  from  diesel  engines.  What   are   the\r\n\r\nstandards, if any, that we set? I hope that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  lag  behind in this respect. Just as  we  have\r\n\r\nmobilised public concern for the cleanliness of our\r\n\r\ncity  with  regard to garbage disposal, litter  and\r\n\r\nthe  mosquito menace, in the same way  we  have  to\r\n\r\nsecure the active participation of our citizens  in\r\n\r\nkeeping our atmosphere clean. Moreover, Sir, I  say\r\n\r\nit  is the Ministry of Health's duty also to awaken\r\n\r\nthe different relevant sectors of our Government to\r\n\r\ntheir particular responsibility where air and other\r\n\r\nforms of pollution are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from air pollution, there is also the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  contamination  of  our  streams   and\r\n\r\nbeaches.  The  Singapore River and the  beach  area\r\n\r\nbordering  the  \"Golden Mile\"  frequently  exude  a\r\n\r\nstench  which is offensive to our sense  of  smell.\r\n\r\nCannot something be done about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in relation to atmospheric pollution,\r\n\r\nthere  is  the  question  of  noise.  In  the  same\r\n\r\nnewspaper which I quoted from, there is an  article\r\n\r\non  the danger of excessive noise to health. I will\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  bother with too many excerpts,  but\r\n\r\nthere is one point which I would like to bring out.\r\n\r\nIt is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The financial loss from inefficiency and damage\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly caused by noise has been put\r\n\r\nat  something  between \u00a31,000  million  and  \u00a32,000\r\n\r\nmillion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is as far as the United Kingdom is concerned.\r\n\r\nOf  course, there is the health aspect of noise  in\r\n\r\nthat  laboratory investigations have revealed  that\r\n\r\nalthough  a person cannot hear a particular  volume\r\n\r\nof  noise in his sleep, there is some effect on the\r\n\r\nregistration of his brain waves, and although noise\r\n\r\nseems to be tolerable to the human ear, it has some\r\n\r\ndeleterious  effect  on the  animal  ear.  This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly an indication that noise has an effect on\r\n\r\nour health. But somehow or other, I feel that there\r\n\r\nis  no  adequate legislation to ensure that  people\r\n\r\nshow respect to each other with regard to noise.  I\r\n\r\nhave  had members of my constituency coming  to  me\r\n\r\nand  saying  that they had lodged complaints  about\r\n\r\nexcessive  noise being emitted by certain  concerns\r\n\r\nnear their dwelling places, and all that the police\r\n\r\nsaid  was  that  they  would  have  to  inform  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment-control people, and that was  all  that\r\n\r\ncame of it. I think the Minister, with his staff of\r\n\r\nable  helpers, should be able to find out  in  what\r\n\r\nway we can control this problem of noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, air and\r\n\r\nwater  pollution is again another favourite subject\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Kallang.

I do welcome their\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nspeeches  very much, because they do indicate  that\r\n\r\nnot only Members of Parliament but also members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  are  beginning  to  be  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ndeleterious  effects  of air and  water  pollution.\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament have expressed concern  about\r\n\r\nthe  problem of air and water pollution that we are\r\n\r\nfacing  today. May I say that I am equally, if  not\r\n\r\nmore, concerned about this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first say something about water pollution\r\n\r\nin  Singapore? This is caused by the  discharge  of\r\n\r\nuntreated trade and domestic wastes as well as  the\r\n\r\nthrowing  of  refuse into open  drains  and  water-courses.   Water   pollution  control   accordingly\r\n\r\nrequires that such liquid wastes be discharged into\r\n\r\nthe  sewerage  system  and, where  sewers  are  not\r\n\r\navailable,  to pre-treat such liquid wastes  before\r\n\r\ndischarging  them  into  open  drains  and   water-courses.  Measures are now being taken  to  improve\r\n\r\nwater  pollution control. These include the phasing\r\n\r\nout  of  all bucket latrines and the use, in  their\r\n\r\nstead,  of  water-seal latrines  or  septic  tanks.\r\n\r\nWhere sewers are available, quicker connections  to\r\n\r\nthe   sewerage   system  are  being   made,   while\r\n\r\nextensions  of  the sewerage system into  unsewered\r\n\r\nareas are being continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, gully-traps will be provided to drain all\r\n\r\nliquid  wastes  from markets, hawker  centres,  and\r\n\r\nrefuse-bin    centres   of   multi-storey    flats.\r\n\r\nIndustrial   waste  waters  from   new   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment   projects  will  be  required   to   be\r\n\r\npretreated  before discharge into  open  drains  or\r\n\r\nwatercourses,  and action will be taken  to  induce\r\n\r\nthe  management of existing trade premises to start\r\n\r\npre-treating  their  liquid trade  waste.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  a  United Nations expert was  invited  to\r\n\r\nstudy  the  water pollution problem from industrial\r\n\r\nwaste  and to advise on more effective measures  to\r\n\r\nbe taken. His assignment has been completed and his\r\n\r\nofficial report is expected soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, water pollution control measures require\r\n\r\nactive    participation   by   various   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  statutory  boards,  besides   the\r\n\r\nPublic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nHealth  Division  of  the Ministry  of  Health.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  has been rightly pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Katong, the co-operation of members  of\r\n\r\nthe public must also be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to announce here that a working\r\n\r\ncommittee,  with  my  Permanent Secretary  (Special\r\n\r\nDuties)  as Chairman, has been formed to coordinate\r\n\r\nand  supervise the efforts made to implement  water\r\n\r\npollution  control measures. This,  in  effect,  is\r\n\r\nsome   sort   of   an  inter-departmental   working\r\n\r\ncommittee, and members of the committee include the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Public Works, the Deputy Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical   Services  (Health),  the  Senior   Health\r\n\r\nOfficer  (Environmental Health),  the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor Public Health, the Chief Water Engineer (Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board),  the Senior  Executive  Engineer\r\n\r\n(Sewerage)   and  the  Senior  Executive   Engineer\r\n\r\n(Drainage  and  Marine), both of  the  P.W.D.,  the\r\n\r\nSenior   Public   Health   Engineer,   the    Chief\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officer (Jurong Town  Corporation),\r\n\r\nand  representatives from the Ministry of  Finance,\r\n\r\ntogether   with   a   member  from   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board.  In other words,  progress  has\r\n\r\nbeen made on the question of water pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now say something about air pollution,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  touched on by  two  Members?  Air\r\n\r\npollution  is a relatively new problem in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  has  been  brought about by the present  rapid\r\n\r\nrate  of  industrial development. This  problem  is\r\n\r\naggravated by the exhaust gases from cars and taxis\r\n\r\nand  on diesel fumes from buses and lorries, as the\r\n\r\ntwo  Members  have mentioned. A W.H.O. expert,  Dr\r\n\r\nGraham Cleary, has been requested by my Ministry to\r\n\r\nassist,  and he has just completed a study  of  our\r\n\r\nair  pollution problem. As a result, steps are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  taken to form an Air Pollution Control  Unit\r\n\r\nand,  based  on  his  advice  and  recommendations,\r\n\r\nregulations to implement control measures  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Officers  will be  sent  overseas  for\r\n\r\ntraining in air pollution control, after which they\r\n\r\nwill staff this new unit which is being formed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the problem of air pollution in\r\n\r\nSingapore has not yet become critical, we are fully\r\n\r\nconscious of the need to tackle this problem  early\r\n\r\nas  this  will  save us a lot of effort  and  money\r\n\r\nlater    on    should    the    situation    become\r\n\r\nuncontrollable. There again, much progress has been\r\n\r\nmade within a short space of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the specific issue of the cement\r\n\r\nmixture  plant at McNair Road which the Member  for\r\n\r\nKallang  brought up. I am certainly  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  created there. Perhaps to the surprise  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member, I myself have visited the  place.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  is  to find an alternative  site  for  the\r\n\r\nplant.   There   has  been  disagreement   on   the\r\n\r\nalternative  site  and, as a result,  notices  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sent  to the plant to comply with our  health\r\n\r\nrequirements.  If  these notices are  not  complied\r\n\r\nwith,  I  can  assure the Member for  Kallang  that\r\n\r\nprosecution action will be instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> What about the problem of noise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> This again is a new problem\r\n\r\nwhich  has come about as a result of close  living,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our high-rise flats.

Where the toilets  in\r\n\r\nany  eating  house  are  found  to  be  dirty,  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  is required to clean and maintain  them\r\n\r\nin  a  sanitary condition.

The hawkers  who  depend  on\r\n\r\ntheir  stalls for a living are complaining of  lack\r\n\r\nof  business. I would therefore like to  know  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether these hawkers can be  allowed\r\n\r\nto do their business in Sambau Street instead of at\r\n\r\ntheir  present  site,  and  whether  they  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to go back to Palmer Road later on when the\r\n\r\npresent reconstruction work there is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that a hawker near a bus-stop\r\n\r\nin  Keppel Road has been asked to shift his  stall,\r\n\r\nwhereas  another hawker further down the same  road\r\n\r\nand near another bus-stop is allowed to do business\r\n\r\nthere. I presume this constituency has not yet been\r\n\r\ncleared  for  resiting hawkers.  Generally  in  the\r\n\r\nuncleared areas hawkers are free to ply where  they\r\n\r\nlike. Can I know why this hawker, who is also in an\r\n\r\nuncleared  area, should not be allowed to  continue\r\n\r\ndoing  business  there? With  due  respect  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister, may I ask him if he will reconsider  this\r\n\r\ncase   and  allow  the  hawker  to  continue  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a point\r\n\r\nabout  the collection of hawkers' licence fees.  We\r\n\r\nall know that except for a small minority\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nof  hawkers, the great majority of them lead a very\r\n\r\npoor  life. Most of them work hard during  the  day\r\n\r\nand  can only earn just enough to keep their family\r\n\r\nalive.  Very  few of them have savings.  Previously\r\n\r\nthe  authorities  allowed them to  pay  their  fees\r\n\r\nmonthly.  However, as from January this  year,  the\r\n\r\nhawkers' licence fees have been increased, and  the\r\n\r\nnew  regulation is that they must pay three months'\r\n\r\nfees  in advance, that is to say, they must pay  at\r\n\r\nthe beginning of the month the licence fees for the\r\n\r\nnext three months. Vegetable hawkers previously had\r\n\r\nto  pay only $6 per month, but now they have to pay\r\n\r\n$15.  Also, they have to pay three months'  licence\r\n\r\nfees,   i.e.,  $45,  in  advance.  Hawkers  selling\r\n\r\nprovisions  had to pay $45 per month previously  as\r\n\r\nlicence  fees. Now if they are also selling  canned\r\n\r\nfood,  they  have to pay $180 as licence  fees  for\r\n\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just said that the great majority of the\r\n\r\nhawkers  are  poor and their daily income  is  just\r\n\r\nsufficient for their livelihood. If we ask them  to\r\n\r\npay  their  fees for three months in one lump  sum,\r\n\r\nare  we  not bringing hardship on them? Also  those\r\n\r\nhawkers  who  cannot afford to pay their  fees  for\r\n\r\nthree  months in advance have to borrow,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill have to pay interest on their loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the authorities found it\r\n\r\nnecessary   to   change  the  system   of   monthly\r\n\r\ncollections to quarterly collections. I am not sure\r\n\r\nwhether  this  is  to  reduce the  work  of  public\r\n\r\nservants.  If  it  is so, I think we  have  thereby\r\n\r\nincreased the hardships of the hawkers. This  is  a\r\n\r\nmost inappropriate action. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nreconsider  this collection of quarterly  fees.  We\r\n\r\nmust  remember that some hawkers cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\npay  such  a  big sum of money and we should  allow\r\n\r\nthem to pay their fees monthly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister about the taking-over of markets\r\n\r\nby  the  Housing and Development Board. All markets\r\n\r\nare  at  present  under  the  Hawkers  Department's\r\n\r\ncontrol.

There are two organisations  with\r\n\r\ndifferent  systems of management. People often  get\r\n\r\nconfused,  and  this  is likely  to  give  rise  to\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.  As far as I  know,  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  intends  to hand over  the  control  of\r\n\r\nthese  markets to the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nin  order  to centralise the administration.  These\r\n\r\ntwo  bodies have carried out negotiations  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.

In  other\r\n\r\nareas  it has deteriorated. In constituencies where\r\n\r\nthe   Members  of  Parliament  are  Ministers,  the\r\n\r\nhawkers' situation is deteriorating. If you  go  to\r\n\r\nthe Kreta Ayer area, you can see that the situation\r\n\r\nis  very bad. If you go to some other area under  a\r\n\r\nMinister's  control, the situation  there  is  even\r\n\r\nworse.  For  example, if you go  to  Dr  Toh  Chin\r\n\r\nChye's constituency, the situation there is just as\r\n\r\nbad. Therefore, the Minister for Health should  pay\r\n\r\nattention to those constituencies where the Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament are Ministers. In other words, hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors dare not go to constituencies where  the\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament are Ministers. They only dare\r\n\r\ngo    to    ordinary   Members   of    Parliament's\r\n\r\nconstituencies. This discrimination by  the  hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors is no good. I represent the people and I\r\n\r\nvoice their feelings here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Annamalai market, 6th m.s. Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nRoad, there was an Indian man selling food. He  was\r\n\r\ncharged  $25 for dropping some rice grains  on  the\r\n\r\nfloor after washing his dishes. On another occasion\r\n\r\na  vegetable hawker was fined unreasonably. He  was\r\n\r\nfined by a hawker inspector simply because some\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nof the vegetable leaves fell on to the ground after\r\n\r\nthe  customers  had selected their vegetables.  The\r\n\r\nhawker inspectors are behaving like bulls and  that\r\n\r\nis  why  they are called \"earth bulls\" in  Chinese.\r\n\r\nMaybe  the Minister will say, \"This is not done  by\r\n\r\nme  personally.\"  But  when soldiers  kill  people,\r\n\r\ntheir  commander  must  be  responsible  for  their\r\n\r\ndeeds.  I  hope the Minister will pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the constituency of the Minister for Law and\r\n\r\nNational Development, the hawkers are hawking along\r\n\r\nthe  streets. This is really a shameful  sight  for\r\n\r\ntourists to see. Yet we talk about making Singapore\r\n\r\na  garden  city.  The  Minister should  immediately\r\n\r\nremove  this  awful sight if we are going  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore a garden city. He should go and  see  for\r\n\r\nhimself the places where the hawkers' situation  is\r\n\r\nunsightly.  There are many places where  he  should\r\n\r\ntake  action. He should emulate the example  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  What  is  the  use  of  building   a\r\n\r\nhawkers' centre at a cost of $300,000 or even more?\r\n\r\nWe should build as many markets as possible for the\r\n\r\nhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I will deal with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Ulu  Pandan first. He has paid what I consider\r\n\r\nto be a compliment when he says there has been some\r\n\r\nimprovement  since he last spoke  on  the  hawkers'\r\n\r\nsituation. He says that the hawkers' situation  has\r\n\r\nimproved  only  in ordinary M.P.s'  constituencies,\r\n\r\nbecause our hawker inspectors dare to go there  and\r\n\r\nenforce  the  law, whereas in constituencies  which\r\n\r\nhave  Ministers  as  Members  of  Parliament,   the\r\n\r\nsituation has deteriorated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that this is a gross misrepresentation\r\n\r\nof  the  actual conditions, because we deal equally\r\n\r\nwith every constituency, irrespective of whether it\r\n\r\nhas  a  Minister  or  an ordinary  Back-bencher  as\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Teck Him</B> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, let me finish first and\r\n\r\nthen  the  Member can have his say. That  is  being\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  is  it not? To put it ironically,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Ulu Pandan should be very grateful  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health when he says that inspectors\r\n\r\nvisit  his  constituency to see that the  place  is\r\n\r\nclean,   and  I  am  wondering  why  he   complains\r\n\r\nabout that. The Member says that hawker  inspectors\r\n\r\nare  like \"bulls\" and they are not welcome  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Perhaps whenever he  sees  a  hawker\r\n\r\ninspector, he sees red. I think I have sufficiently\r\n\r\nreplied to what he has said about hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Tiong Bahru? He\r\n\r\nhas  told us a sad story of the hawkers' hardships.\r\n\r\nI beg to disagree with him. First of all, may I say\r\n\r\nthat  the new rates of fees for hawkers which  came\r\n\r\ninto force on the 1st of January, 1970, only revise\r\n\r\nand   standardise  licence  fees  for  the  various\r\n\r\ncategories of hawkers which had remained  unchanged\r\n\r\nfor  over 20 years. I think I dealt with them quite\r\n\r\nadequately  in Parliament in answer to  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  on the 17th of this month. In  general,\r\n\r\nthe  fees  for hawkers have not been raised  except\r\n\r\nfor  itinerant  hawkers and wall show-case  hawkers\r\n\r\nwhose  fees  have been brought into line  with  the\r\n\r\nrates payable by pitch hawkers. I admit there is  a\r\n\r\nmarginal  increase  in fees in respect  of  hawkers\r\n\r\nconducting business in the immediate vicinity of  a\r\n\r\nmarket.  Perhaps  the instances  which  the  Member\r\n\r\nquoted just now about the increase in fees could be\r\n\r\nin respect of hawkers who have stalls or pitches in\r\n\r\nthe immediate vicinity of a market. Their fees have\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  into  line with  their  counterparts\r\n\r\ninside  the  markets.  This was  done  for  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons  in order that we can encourage hawkers  to\r\n\r\nply their trade inside markets where they can enjoy\r\n\r\nbetter facilities, i.e., proper cover from weather,\r\n\r\nsupply  of  pipe-water, etc.  Experience  has  also\r\n\r\nshown  that if fees outside the markets were  less,\r\n\r\nhawkers prefer to ply outside them as they can  get\r\n\r\nmore customers since they are able\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nto  sell  their goods at a cheaper rate.  This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  unfair  to the stallholders  within  the\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the hardship of hawkers, may I say\r\n\r\nthat, in general, hawkers may not appear to be well-dressed but they are generally making good money. I\r\n\r\nknow that an ice-cream vendor on good days can sell\r\n\r\n$100 worth of ice cream and make a clear profit  of\r\n\r\n$30.  Some ice-water sellers earn, on the  average,\r\n\r\n$40  to  $50 a day and I know of some food  hawkers\r\n\r\nwho  even  own  houses  for  rent  and  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  overseas for higher studies.  Almost  all\r\n\r\nhawkers do not pay income tax. This is because  the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Income Tax has no means of assessing\r\n\r\nthe  hawker's  income, short of sending  a  man  to\r\n\r\nstand  by  his stall and jot down his receipts  of\r\n\r\npayments,  which  proposition is not  feasible.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I do admit that there are a few hawkers who\r\n\r\ndo  not  earn  that much money. But these  few  who\r\n\r\ncannot  make  a  living out of hawking  should  not\r\n\r\ncontinue hawking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our rapid economic growth, we are now\r\n\r\nexperiencing  a  shortage  of  labour  in   certain\r\n\r\nfields.  Members must have heard the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  say  in  this House that there  is  now  a\r\n\r\nshortage of skilled and semi-skilled labour for our\r\n\r\nbooming  industries. We are also short  of  certain\r\n\r\ncategories of unskilled labour. I must tell Members\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Health is  also  finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to recruit cleansing workers and  garbage\r\n\r\ntruck  drivers. Members are also aware that  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult nowadays to get domestic servants even if\r\n\r\nyou  are  willing to pay $120 to $150 a month  with\r\n\r\nfull  board and lodging plus Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions. There is also a shortage of  workers\r\n\r\nin  our building industry. I know of many instances\r\n\r\nof  hawkers who have been offered steady  jobs  and\r\n\r\nwho  have turned them down because they frankly say\r\n\r\nthat working in a Jurong factory is too irksome and\r\n\r\nthey   do  not  make  as  much  money  as  hawking.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the recitation by the Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru of the hardship experienced by the hawkers, I\r\n\r\nam  afraid,  sounds like a familiar tune  emanating\r\n\r\nfrom an old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\ngramophone record which might have been  valid  two\r\n\r\nor three years ago but which is certainly not valid\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the specific complaint of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tiong Bahru about payment of licence fees three\r\n\r\nmonths in advance, I say that this is necessary for\r\n\r\nadministrative reasons and also for the convenience\r\n\r\nof  the hawkers themselves. The monthly payment  of\r\n\r\nfees  as  in  the past not only meant  a  waste  of\r\n\r\nmanpower,  time,  money and paper  work,  but  also\r\n\r\nresulted in laxity, which in turn resulted in  loss\r\n\r\nof  revenue. The present procedure is also for  the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of hawkers who have to make  only  one\r\n\r\ntrip to the Hawkers Department or collecting centre\r\n\r\nfor  the  payment of fees once every  three  months\r\n\r\ninstead  of  every month. Sir, may I  say  that  no\r\n\r\nother  Ministry  collects fees on a monthly  basis,\r\n\r\nand  it is not proposed that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nshould  continue  to do so. For example,  motor-car\r\n\r\nlicences and taxi licences are all collected  on  a\r\n\r\nyearly  or  six-monthly  basis.  However,  adequate\r\n\r\nprovisions  exist  to assure the Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  that  we  allow  the Superintendent  of  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department to permit monthly  payments  of\r\n\r\nfees  only  in  respect of hawkers  in  receipt  of\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare aid and others who can  prove  that\r\n\r\npayment  of  fees  three months in  advance  causes\r\n\r\nundue hardship to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Member for Anson. He wants\r\n\r\nto know how many constituencies are already cleared\r\n\r\nof  hawkers. Although hawkers have been  completely\r\n\r\nresited  in  five  constituencies,  and  these  are\r\n\r\ncalled  \"cleared constituencies\", there are cleared\r\n\r\nareas  in  no  less  than 17 other  constituencies.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, most of the hawkers who  used  to  ply\r\n\r\nalong major roads and thoroughfares throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland  have  been cleared, resited  and  licensed.\r\n\r\nMost  of  them  have been resited in backlanes  and\r\n\r\nopen  areas where they do not cause obstruction  to\r\n\r\nvehicular and pedestrian traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws relating to the cleanliness of the\r\n\r\nenvironment are enforced equally stringently on all\r\n\r\nhawkers,  be  they  in cleared or uncleared  areas.\r\n\r\nThat is what\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI must stress to the Members for Anson and Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan need not be so excited.
