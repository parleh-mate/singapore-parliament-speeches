Each year, we expect about 80 overseas graduates to\r\n\r\nbe  registered  for  practice in  Singapore,  including  both\r\n\r\nforeign  doctors and overseas trained Singaporeans.   The  20\r\n\r\nuniversities whose medical degrees are registrable  with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Council are in various developed countries,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  UK,  USA and Australia, so we have  sufficient\r\n\r\nchoice  of graduates.  This number also excludes the  160-odd\r\n\r\ndoctors who are under temporary registration in Singapore  at\r\n\r\nany one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overseas medical schools are top ranking\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  their respective countries  and  have  been\r\n\r\nassessed  to  be of a standard comparable to the NUS  medical\r\n\r\nschool,  or better.  The list is reviewed from time  to  time\r\n\r\nand  updated.  The present list remains relevant  and  serves\r\n\r\nour needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  if we are in fact short of doctors here again  and,\r\n\r\nif  it  is  so,  why  are  we adhering  with  the  policy  of\r\n\r\nrestricting the number of recognised universities for medical\r\n\r\nstudents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When we debated the health policy in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper in 1993, we made it quite clear that we want\r\n\r\nto   prevent  over  supply  of  doctors  and  specialists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Because  if  there  are  too  many  doctors  and\r\n\r\nspecialists, the demand for medical services will be inflated\r\n\r\nand  healthcare  costs  will go up.  So  that  has  been  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  pillar of our policy.  In the  White  Paper,  we\r\n\r\nwould  control the output from NUS at 150 per year  and  also\r\n\r\nfrom foreign trained doctors at 50 per year.  Because of  the\r\n\r\nchange in population policy, we have increased the intake  in\r\n\r\nNUS  to  200 and also the intake from foreign trained doctors\r\n\r\nfrom 50 to 80.  So we have made the necessary adjustments  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  higher population that we have.  The situation  is\r\n\r\nquite comfortable today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is\r\n\r\nlikely that we will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequiring many more doctors for multi-factorial reasons,  one\r\n\r\nof  which  will be the ageing population that will need  more\r\n\r\nmedical  care.   And will a shortage of doctors  in  fact  be\r\n\r\nperpetual  in  the coming years, especially  if  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend  mainly  on our own university for the supply  of  our\r\n\r\nmedical personnel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We are constantly reviewing our\r\n\r\nrequirement for doctors.  The need for doctors for an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  is  in fact factored in the White Paper  when  we\r\n\r\nstudied  the  issues in the White Paper  in  1992/1993.   The\r\n\r\npopulation profile and the ageing phenomenon in Singapore are\r\n\r\nquite  well  understood.   This is  something  that  you  can\r\n\r\nproject  30-40 years ahead of time.  What is new now  is  our\r\n\r\nthrust into life sciences.  That is a new factor which we are\r\n\r\ntaking into consideration.  As you may know, Dr Tony Tan  has\r\n\r\nset  up  a task force to look at how Singapore should respond\r\n\r\nto  life sciences.  It is entirely possible.  Because of this\r\n\r\nnew  requirement,  we  may have to  increase  the  intake  of\r\n\r\ndoctors, both in servicing for clinical trials as well as for\r\n\r\nresearch.   So  I do not rule out the need for  more  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom  both our local intakes, local training as well as  from\r\n\r\noverseas   sources.   But  for  the  time   being,   the   20\r\n\r\nuniversities  that  we have, as registrable  under  the  SMC,\r\n\r\nserve our need because we can recruit what we want from these\r\n\r\n20  universities.   And  those who do  not  come  from  these\r\n\r\nuniversities,  we  can  put  them  either  on  temporary   or\r\n\r\nconditional registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Will the Minister be able to get better\r\n\r\npostulation  on  our  medical staff requirement,  considering\r\n\r\nthat  medical training takes many years to complete and  that\r\n\r\nmany years of advance planning is necessary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is indeed one of the\r\n\r\nconsiderations, that it takes many years to train  a  doctor,\r\n\r\nand  also  the people, particularly Singaporean  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents, make their decisions based on what we put up.  When\r\n\r\nwe say that there are 20 registrable universities, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould put their children in these universities and those  who\r\n\r\nhave  done so since 1993 will have reason to be upset  if  we\r\n\r\nchop  and change every other year.  So when we do projections\r\n\r\nfor medical personnel, particularly doctors, we have to do so\r\n\r\nin  a  very  deliberate manner.  And we did so in  1992-1993.\r\n\r\nThe  situation has changed somewhat.  We have adjusted it  in\r\n\r\n1998,  not  so  long  ago, by increasing the  intake  in  our\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  allowing more registrations  from  overseas.\r\n\r\nNow,  there  is  another new consideration, how  to  position\r\n\r\nourselves  for life sciences.  As I said, this  is  something\r\n\r\nthat  we are studying and it is conceivable that, because  of\r\n\r\nthis   very  major  change,  we  may  have  to  make  further\r\n\r\nmodifications to our plans.  But I would be reluctant to chop\r\n\r\nand change because people are making very important decisions\r\n\r\nbased on what we publish as registrable universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

Because  the\r\n\r\npeople who can come in and are registrable without having  to\r\n\r\ngo  for  extra examinations are the ones listed in  these  20\r\n\r\nuniversities.

In  1993, we  changed  from  170-odd\r\n\r\nuniversities and we trimmed it down to 20.  People made their\r\n\r\ndecisions  based on this list of 20 universities.  They  have\r\n\r\ncommitted their children to study in these 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversities.  If now we change without good reasons, I think\r\n\r\nif  I were a Singaporean parent, I will be quite upset.   But\r\n\r\nif  there  is a significant change in the direction  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded,  say,  for  example, life  sciences,  and  we  cannot\r\n\r\ngenerate the graduates to meet this requirement from within - that  is the subject of a task force set up by Dr Tony Tan  - then, of course, we may have to broaden or widen the list  to\r\n\r\ntake in the necessary numbers from overseas.  But, today,  we\r\n\r\nhave   expanded  from  50-odd  to  80  doctors  and  the   20\r\n\r\nuniversities  can  provide  the  80  doctors  that   we   are\r\n\r\nrecruiting  every  year.  Those who do not  come  from  these\r\n\r\nuniversities, we will put them under temporary or conditional\r\n\r\nregistration, that means they work under certain hospitals or\r\n\r\nVWOs  for very specific purpose.  The situation today is that\r\n\r\nour   needs   are  met  through  temporary  and   conditional\r\n\r\nregistration of these foreign doctors.  My primary concern is\r\n\r\nif  you  tell Singaporeans that you will recognise  these  20\r\n\r\nuniversities and they have gone overseas for studies, I  will\r\n\r\nbe very reluctant to chop and change so frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> May I ask the Minister how accurate is this\r\n\r\nmanpower  projection because it is always changing from  time\r\n\r\nto  time?  Since it is changing all the time, how accurate is\r\n\r\nyour projection for such manpower needs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We do not have a fixed ratio that we\r\n\r\ntarget for.  It is not to say that if you have one doctor  to\r\n\r\n700  population, you are going to get so much better  medical\r\n\r\ncare  than 1:750.  These are not critical numbers or planning\r\n\r\nnorms. Basically, the indigenous population of Singapore  can\r\n\r\nbe  quite easily projected.  What happens is in 1996, we made\r\n\r\na  major strategic decision to increase the intake of PRs and\r\n\r\nthat  changed the scenario quite drastically.   Now,  we  are\r\n\r\nconsidering  the second strategic decision that  we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  probably  this year and, that is, we have  to  look  at\r\n\r\ndoctors  not  just as servicing the healthcare industry,  but\r\n\r\nalso as participants in this new life sciences industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I see these as two major changes in the strategic\r\n\r\nscenario.  Other than that, you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot project accurately how many will stay after they  have\r\n\r\npassed  out from their university.  Give and take  10  or  20\r\n\r\nevery   year,   it  does  not  change  your  situation   that\r\n\r\ndrastically.  What we are looking for are significant changes\r\n\r\nin  direction, ie, the 1996 population intake of PRs, and now\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are  going to do strategically for  life  sciences.\r\n\r\nThese are major decisions which of course will have an impact\r\n\r\non  the  production of doctors.  Beyond that,  we  are  quite\r\n\r\ncomfortable.  Our primary care sector is well taken care  of.\r\n\r\nWe  are building new hospitals, and all these projections are\r\n\r\ntaken care of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> In view of the move by Singapore to make our\r\n\r\nplace  a  medical  hub  and to develop a  medical  centre  of\r\n\r\nexcellence, are these factors taken into consideration in the\r\n\r\nprojection for manpower?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> This is nothing new.

Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, yesterday on Foreign Affairs, many Members raised issues\r\n\r\non  a  wide variety of subjects, our relations with Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia, the position in ASEAN, East Timor, United Nations,\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance,  amongst  others.   My  colleague,  Mr\r\n\r\nZainul Abidin has touched on Singapore-Philippines relations,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  morning,  we will address the other issues  which  were\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Malaysia-Singapore relations, a matter\r\n\r\nwhich  several MPs touched on.  They asked me about the state\r\n\r\nof  relations  as  well  as some specific  aspects,  such  as\r\n\r\nupdating  on the package negotiations. As far as the  overall\r\n\r\nrelations  are  concerned, I last  touched  on  this  at  our\r\n\r\nsitting on 17th January this year when I updated the House on\r\n\r\nthe   status  of  the  package  negotiations  on  outstanding\r\n\r\nbilateral issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would describe our relations with Malaysia to be\r\n\r\nin  a  \"holding  pattern\".  Following three rapid  rounds  of\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on outstanding issues in March,  April  and  May\r\n\r\nlast  year, the momentum of negotiations except on  CLOB  has\r\n\r\ngrounded to a halt.  We all know that for the better part  of\r\n\r\nlast   year,  Dr  Mahathir  and  his  Government   had   been\r\n\r\npreoccupied   with  domestic  issues  such  as  the   general\r\n\r\nelections  in  November and there has not  been  a  focus  on\r\n\r\nrelations with Singapore. Now that the elections are over, it\r\n\r\nis  our  hope of course that efforts can be resumed to  renew\r\n\r\nand enhance the cooperation between our two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, let me emphasise that Malaysia and\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  indeed bound by a multiplicity  of  different\r\n\r\nties.  Any such close relationship inevitably must go through\r\n\r\ndifferent phases.  I think it is natural that there  will  be\r\n\r\nups   and   downs  during  our  relations.   But  Singapore's\r\n\r\nrelations  will be marked by both competition and cooperation\r\n\r\nto advance our respective national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's position remains unchanged, that is, we are\r\n\r\ncommitted   to   forging  a  mutually  beneficial   long-term\r\n\r\nrelationship  with Malaysia based on mutual  respect,  trust,\r\n\r\nreciprocity  and mutual benefit. We believe in the  principle\r\n\r\nof  prosper-thy-neighbour and we would  continue  to  take  a\r\n\r\nconstructive approach towards realising the full potential in\r\n\r\nour bilateral relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members also asked for an update on the package\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  As I said, the senior officials met in  March,\r\n\r\nApril  and  May  last  year  on the  package  of  outstanding\r\n\r\nbilateral issues.  Singapore tried to be helpful and took the\r\n\r\napproach  of  offering \"maximum benefits for both  sides\"  by\r\n\r\ntrying  to accommodate new Malaysian requests on issues  such\r\n\r\nas  the  POA  and  the  CPF withdrawal  by  West  Malaysians.\r\n\r\nHowever, Malaysia has not given any indication yet that it is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accommodate Singapore's request on the  various\r\n\r\nissues, especially the supply of raw water to Singapore after\r\n\r\nthe expiry of our water agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have informed this House previously that it is\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  turn  to  host  the next  round  of  talks.   The\r\n\r\nMalaysians have on several occasions indicated that they  are\r\n\r\naware that the ball is in their court. But they have not  yet\r\n\r\nresponded  with  specific dates.  We want  to  resolve  these\r\n\r\nissues  as soon as possible. When Malaysian Foreign  Minister\r\n\r\nDatuk  Seri Syed Hamid visited Singapore last year, we agreed\r\n\r\nthat  officials from both sides should try to narrow the gaps\r\n\r\non  the  issues, so as to arrive at a win-win  package  deal.\r\n\r\nThat continues to be our expectation and our approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would seem that the immediate priority of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians is on the UMNO General Assembly elections  in\r\n\r\nMay.  As  such, it remains to be seen whether there  will  be\r\n\r\nsignificant  movement  on the discussions  of  the  bilateral\r\n\r\npackage  before  that date.  But it is clearly  in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterest of both countries to resolve the issues as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not touch on the CLOB issue where the Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange  and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have reached  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  and  legally  binding  solution,  because  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister had dealt with  this  in  this  House\r\n\r\ncomprehensively yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the railway land, which is also part of the package\r\n\r\ndeal,  all I need to do is to reiterate what I said  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  before.  The  fact that there is a package  discussion\r\n\r\ngoing on and that it has taken some time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto resolve this matter does not, in any way, affect the legal\r\n\r\nposition of these agreements and undertakings under the  law.\r\n\r\nSome  of  these  issues involve questions of  principles  and\r\n\r\nquestions of law.  And these positions of principles, whether\r\n\r\nit  is  sovereignty or on legal interpretations  of  existing\r\n\r\nagreements,  such as the railway land, have to be  maintained\r\n\r\nby Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, under the Points of Agreement, Members will\r\n\r\nrecall   that   there  are  clear  legal   undertakings   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and a time schedule which has to be  adhered\r\n\r\nto.   There  are  certain obligations  to  be  performed  and\r\n\r\nundertaken under the agreements and that continues to be  our\r\n\r\nposition.   As I pointed out in Parliament on 5th June  1997,\r\n\r\nthe  POA  provides  for  a \"maximum period  for  the  railway\r\n\r\nstation  to be moved from Keppel, that is, within five  years\r\n\r\nfrom  the  time the MRT reaches Woodlands New Town, which  it\r\n\r\ndid on 10th February 1996.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members also referred to Pedra Branca, but I wish\r\n\r\nto  point  out  to the Members and they will  recall  that  I\r\n\r\ninformed this House last year in January that officials  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore did reach an agreement in 1998 on  the\r\n\r\ntext  of  a  special agreement to refer Malaysia's  claim  to\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca to the International Court of Justice.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthis matter is no longer a pressing issue which explains  why\r\n\r\nit  was not included in the package of outstanding issues for\r\n\r\nbilateral negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong had reiterated his suggestion for an\r\n\r\neconomic union between Singapore and Malaysia.  I would refer\r\n\r\nto what Prime Minister Goh said in reply in this House on 5th\r\n\r\nJune 1997, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He (Mr Chiam) got his economic history of our Malaysia\r\n\r\ndays   wrong,  and  he  has  ignored  important  non-economic\r\n\r\nfactors,  but the economic logic of his proposal is  correct.\r\n\r\nHowever,  cooperation takes two willing parties.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  this is the right time to talk about an economic union\r\n\r\nwhen bilateral relations are strained and we are still having\r\n\r\ndifficulties implementing specific items of cooperation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore and Malaysia share a symbiotic relationship.\r\n\r\nI fully subscribe to Dr Mahathir's philosophy of 'prosper-thy-neighbour'.  It  is  an important way to strengthen  our  two\r\n\r\ncountries'  symbiotic relationship and  help  each  other  to\r\n\r\nbecome developed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was what Prime Minister said. What Mr Chiam was\r\n\r\nsaying  yesterday is whether an economic union of the  Suzhou\r\n\r\ntype  of  project or other economic projects, there are  many\r\n\r\nopportunities  for the two sides to undertake  to  strengthen\r\n\r\neconomic  cooperation.  I agree.  I would say that there  are\r\n\r\nendless  opportunities for both countries  to  cooperate  for\r\n\r\nmutual  benefit.  But there must be political will  from  the\r\n\r\nother  side to respond to Singapore's efforts.  If  there  is\r\n\r\nany  perceived lack of progress on economic cooperation,  let\r\n\r\nme say that it is not due to any lack of effort on our part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\nhad  proposed a framework of wider cooperation with  Malaysia\r\n\r\nin  line with the 'prosper-thy-neighbour' philosophy which Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  has  espoused.   Under  this  framework  for  wider\r\n\r\ncooperation,   Prime  Minister  Goh  had  proposed   concrete\r\n\r\ncooperation  projects  such  as  the  development  of   water\r\n\r\nresources  in  Malaysia for sale to Singapore and  the  joint\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Malayan Railway land in Singapore.   Members\r\n\r\nmay also be aware that Prime Minister Goh spent a lot of time\r\n\r\nand  effort and, in fact, he met with Dr Mahathir eight times\r\n\r\nin  the  past  two years.  More recently, Prime Minister  had\r\n\r\nindicated  that he is prepared to meet Dr Mahathir.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  press  on and persevere  with  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote bilateral cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin's suggestion was for more\r\n\r\nresources to be made available to the civil societies, and in\r\n\r\nparticular,   the  Singapore  International  Foundation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore   Institute  of  International  Affairs   for   the\r\n\r\npromotion  of people-to-people cooperation between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia.   I  would agree that the  fostering  of  good\r\n\r\nrelations  is  not the sole prerogative of governments.   The\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, civic organisations, cultural organisations,\r\n\r\nsporting organisations, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nname  a  few,  all  play a role in promoting  good  relations\r\n\r\nbetween our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his specific suggestion that more finances and\r\n\r\nresources  be  made available to civic bodies, if  there  are\r\n\r\nspecific and worthwhile projects and a request made  to  MFA,\r\n\r\nwe  will of course be prepared to consider them on a case-by-case  basis.   Of course, Members have to bear in  mind  that\r\n\r\nmany  civic  organisations are autonomous  organisations  and\r\n\r\nmight want to retain their autonomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Mr Hawazi Daipi and a few other\r\n\r\nMembers  spoke about the letter by Mr Malik Tahir  which  was\r\n\r\npublished recently in our local press. They asked whether  Mr\r\n\r\nMalik  Tahir's  views typify the general  feelings  of  Malay\r\n\r\nMalaysians.   I of course cannot speculate if his perspective\r\n\r\nrespresents  the  views of the majority of Malay  Malaysians.\r\n\r\nBut  let me say that we should make a distinction between the\r\n\r\nviews  expressed by such individuals and private  parties  on\r\n\r\nthe one hand, and the official views of a Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned before in this House on several\r\n\r\noccasions, after separation, Singapore and Malaysia have,  in\r\n\r\nfact, evolved and developed into two distinct societies.   It\r\n\r\nwould  not  be possible for Singapore to give up  its  system\r\n\r\nwhich  is based on meritocracy and multi-racialism.  But  our\r\n\r\napproach  would  be, notwithstanding the differences  between\r\n\r\nour two systems, both countries stand to benefit greatly from\r\n\r\nbilateral cooperation. Such cooperation must be on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  sovereign equality and mutual benefits.  It cannot be  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of unequal or differential relationship prescribed\r\n\r\nby Mr Tahir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected with this matter, Mr Sin Boon Ann asked\r\n\r\nwhether we are doing enough to put our position across to the\r\n\r\nMalaysians  so  that our views, stand and  positions  can  be\r\n\r\ndisseminated better or more effectively in Malaysia.  Let  me\r\n\r\nsay that when issues arise, we do, in fact, take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderable measures to put our views across, not only here,\r\n\r\nbut  also  in Malaysia.  And where there are reports  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian media which are erroneous or false, we rebut  them.\r\n\r\nWe also publish our speeches, press releases and rebuttals on\r\n\r\nour  MFA website as well as in the website of our Mission  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur.  Therefore, I wish to assure Members that  MFA\r\n\r\nand  our  Missions  abroad  have been  proactive  in  putting\r\n\r\nSingapore's views across when necessary.  This has even  been\r\n\r\nnoted by the Malaysian media. For example, on the CLOB issue,\r\n\r\nthe  New  Straits Times reported on 29th February this  year,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"One of the lessons of the CLOB affair is perhaps the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  effective public relations.  The Singaporeans  had\r\n\r\ntheir  whole  Government involved, including  their  overseas\r\n\r\nmissions,  telling their side of the CLOB  story.   In  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur,  for  example,  the  Singapore  High  Commission  was\r\n\r\nsending  copies of CLOB-related documents to the media.   The\r\n\r\nsame intensity was absent from the Malaysian side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think this speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the latest developments, if\r\n\r\nany,  on  the  Singapore-Johor  bridge  which  Malaysia   was\r\n\r\nreported  to  have  proposed  to  construct  to  replace  the\r\n\r\nCauseway. The answer to that is that we have not received any\r\n\r\nofficial proposal from the Malaysian Government. As  this  is\r\n\r\nan   important  issue  involving  two  sovereign   countries,\r\n\r\nnaturally,  we  can only consider this matter when  a  formal\r\n\r\nproposal  is received from the Malaysian Government  and  not\r\n\r\nthrough any other party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Charles Chong also referred to newspaper\r\n\r\nreports  in  Malaysia  to  the effect  that  Malaysians  have\r\n\r\nbriefed Prime Minister Goh during his recent visit to  Johor.\r\n\r\nIndeed,   during the Hari Raya party which the  Johor  Mentri\r\n\r\nBesar  hosted  for  the Prime Minister on 30th  January,  the\r\n\r\nMentri  Besar,  Dato Abdul Ghani, showed Prime Minister  some\r\n\r\nmodels  and  pictures  of  a possible  new  bridge  over  the\r\n\r\nCauseway,  but  there was no discussion of  the  issue.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister made it clear to the Johor Mentri Besar  that\r\n\r\nit should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregarded  as a non-briefing.  In other words, it was  not  an\r\n\r\nofficial briefing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Singapore has, to date, not\r\n\r\nreceived any official proposal from Malaysia.  If and when an\r\n\r\nofficial  proposal is received, I think there  are  obviously\r\n\r\nsome  key questions which will have to be considered.   First\r\n\r\nand  foremost,  what  is  the justification  for  wanting  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the Causeway with a bridge?  If there is a proposal,\r\n\r\nwe need to consider carefully whether it is feasible.  And to\r\n\r\nconsider and conclude whether it is feasible, one would  have\r\n\r\nto  make a careful cost benefit analysis.  If the study shows\r\n\r\nthat  the proposal is not feasible, then we will not be  able\r\n\r\nto  support it.  Anyway, as I said, no proposal has been  put\r\n\r\nto  the  Government and therefore, at the  moment,  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing to study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members then turned to the situation in Indonesia. They\r\n\r\nasked me about the state of our relations with Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nalso  certain specific questions.  If I may make  some  broad\r\n\r\nobservations about the situation in Indonesia,  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat  Indonesia is actually in transition.  There  have  been\r\n\r\npolitical, economic and social changes there, and there  have\r\n\r\nalso  been greater demands for regional autonomy, as well  as\r\n\r\nregions requesting a greater share of local resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election of Abdurrahman Wahid as President and\r\n\r\nMegawati   Soekarnoputri  as  Vice  President  represents   a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  leadership.  Notwithstanding  its  legitimacy,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that it has a difficult job in dealing with  post-Soeharto  changes.   With  this new leadership,  other  power\r\n\r\ncentres have also emerged.  They are seeking a greater say in\r\n\r\ngovernment  as  well as acting as a check and  balance.   The\r\n\r\nrole of the armed forces is also being reshaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Wahid has begun a process of political\r\n\r\nconsolidation,   national   reconciliation   and    restoring\r\n\r\ninternational confidence.  This is important for  the  return\r\n\r\nof  economic  stability  and foreign  investment.   President\r\n\r\nWahid  also  sought to deal with the regional  pressures  for\r\n\r\ngreater autonomy and, in some cases, even calls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor independence.  But he has received the endorsement of the\r\n\r\ninternational community on Indonesia's unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Wahid continues to face considerable\r\n\r\nchallenges.   Singapore  supports the Indonesian  government,\r\n\r\nand  wishes President Wahid well in his efforts to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe political, economic and social changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our relations with Indonesia, I said in last\r\n\r\nyear's  Committee of Supply debate that relations  then,  one\r\n\r\nyear  ago,  were going through a difficult period.   At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  various Indonesian leaders and officials had made  all\r\n\r\nsorts of allegations and negative comments against Singapore.\r\n\r\nMembers  will recall that,  subsequently, later in the  year,\r\n\r\nin  November, responding to a question on bilateral  ties,  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that Indonesia was one of our closest neighbours and  a\r\n\r\nmajor  trading partner, and we would like to see a prosperous\r\n\r\nand stable Indonesia.  That is our position.  We are ready to\r\n\r\nwork  with Indonesia to assist in its economic recovery.   We\r\n\r\nare  a small country and our contribution can only be modest.\r\n\r\nBut  we  can  play a catalytic role to help restore  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence through practical measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Indonesia now enjoy warm and friendly\r\n\r\nties.   The  foundations of our relationship are  strong  and\r\n\r\nhave  withstood many storms.  We have cooperated  for  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit  for  many years, and Singapore is one of Indonesia's\r\n\r\nlargest  foreign  investors and our bilateral  trade  remains\r\n\r\nstrong,  notwithstanding  the economic  crisis.   We  have  a\r\n\r\nvested   interest  in  Indonesia's  stability,   growth   and\r\n\r\nprosperity.     Furthermore,   Indonesia   is   strategically\r\n\r\nimportant  for both Singapore, for the region and for  ASEAN.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore in everyone's interest to see a  prosperous\r\n\r\nand stable Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even during the difficult times, Singapore did not lose\r\n\r\nconfidence in Indonesia.  Members will recall the West Natuna\r\n\r\nGas  project  and  the  Pertamina-Singapore  Power  agreement\r\n\r\nreflected  Singapore's  faith  and  long-term  confidence  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   I would add that President Wahid's  decision  to\r\n\r\nmake Singapore his first stop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  his  ASEAN tour also underscores the importance he places\r\n\r\non  relations with Singapore.  And the return visit by  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   in  January  continued  the  process  of   further\r\n\r\nstrengthening bilateral relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the questions by Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  Daipi about the recent troubles in Bintan and whether\r\n\r\nit  has  affected Singapore's investments there, this  matter\r\n\r\nhas  been  addressed by the Minister for Trade and  Industry.\r\n\r\nBut  let  me say that the demonstrations in Bintan were  over\r\n\r\nthe  issue of land compensation.  It was unfortunate that the\r\n\r\nissue  resurfaced.  When development works by the  Indonesia-Singapore  joint  venture company on  the  Bintan  Industrial\r\n\r\nEstate  began more than five years ago, compensation for  the\r\n\r\nland  had  been  fully  settled and  the  land  was  free  of\r\n\r\nencumbrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrations which occurred recently caused losses\r\n\r\nfor companies operating there as work had to be stopped.   It\r\n\r\nalso   affected  tourist  arrivals  and,  consequently,   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the people was also affected.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nsuch disturbances are unchecked, it would affect investors in\r\n\r\nthe  Bintan  Industrial Estate and, in turn,  dampen  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors'  confidence in Indonesia.  And it will affect  our\r\n\r\nrole to act as a catalyst to enhance investor confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have conveyed to the Indonesian authorities at\r\n\r\nall  levels  the  importance for Indonesia  to  resolve  this\r\n\r\nmatter.   But  let  me  add that the disturbances  in  Bintan\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen in the context of other incidents of  social\r\n\r\nunrest in various other parts of Indonesia.  President  Wahid\r\n\r\nhimself  has  said that the outbreaks of unrest in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nwere the product of a conspiracy against his government.  The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  authorities have indicated  that  the  disruptive\r\n\r\nelements  from other parts of Indonesia had been involved  in\r\n\r\nBintan.   They recognise the nature and potential  impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem,  and they have taken swift action  to  end  the\r\n\r\ndisturbances.  Since then, the situation in Bintan  has  been\r\n\r\nstabilised, and it is our hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestor   confidence   will   not   be   affected   by   the\r\n\r\ndemonstrations.   Such incidents should not  deter  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom   pursuing  bilateral  cooperation  projects  with   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian government in the Riaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam asked whether the Government could\r\n\r\nconsider  leasing from the Indonesian government one  of  the\r\n\r\nRiau  islands  to  develop  it into  an  economic  area  with\r\n\r\nSingapore   having  full  control  on,  such   as   security,\r\n\r\nimmigration and allowing entry by Indonesian nationals and so\r\n\r\non.   I think Mr Chiam must know that this is not a practical\r\n\r\nproposal, because he himself pointed out that this is a  very\r\n\r\nsensitive  issue.  I think he knows that it will be  open  to\r\n\r\nall    sorts   of   misunderstandings   and   interpretation,\r\n\r\nparticularly  when what he proposed may be seen as  impinging\r\n\r\non  Indonesia's rights of sovereignty.  This is especially so\r\n\r\nwhen   Mr  Chiam's  proposal  envisaged  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  exercise  what  may  amount  to   sovereign\r\n\r\nfunctions  like immigration and security control  in  another\r\n\r\nterritory.   At  a time when there is so much sensitivity  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  over calls for separatism, autonomy, independence,\r\n\r\nI  think  Mr Chiam will agree when I say that it is  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  this proposal would be considered, in his words,  as  a\r\n\r\npurely \"business\" or commercial deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to Indonesia, some Members also asked about East\r\n\r\nTimor.  Three questions were posed.  One is to ask about  the\r\n\r\nassistance  which  we have already given; second,  about  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance or training which we may give  to  East\r\n\r\nTimor;   and,  thirdly,  prospects  of  East  Timor  becoming\r\n\r\nindependent and they applying for ASEAN membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assistance we have given to East Timor up to now,\r\n\r\nas  a  member of the UN support group for East Timor, we have\r\n\r\ncontributed  US$230,000 to the UN Trust Fund for East  Timor.\r\n\r\nThe  Trust  Fund  was  set up to fund UN activities  in  East\r\n\r\nTimor.    Then,   as  Members  will  know,  there   was   the\r\n\r\nInternational  Force  for  East  Timor  (InterFET)  and   our\r\n\r\ncontribution   comprised  a  medical   detachment,   military\r\n\r\nobservers,  logistics  support and two  landing  ship  tanks.\r\n\r\nAltogether, a total of 250 personnel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere involved.  The cost of maintaining our contributions  in\r\n\r\nEast Timor was not small.  We incurred some $22.2 million for\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our  contributions to InterFET  and  the  United\r\n\r\nNations Assistance Mission to East Timor.  InterFET then  was\r\n\r\nreplaced  by United Nation Assistance Mission in  East  Timor\r\n\r\n(UNAMET)  and  our contributions to UNTAET  are  40  civilian\r\n\r\npolice, 8 military observers and staff officers, a level  one\r\n\r\nmedical  team  comprising  up  to  26  members.   The  40-man\r\n\r\ncivilian  contingent will be deployed to East  Timor  on  6th\r\n\r\nMarch  and  I assume they are already there.  An SAF  officer\r\n\r\nhas  also  been  appointed as a deputy  chief  of  staff  for\r\n\r\nmilitary and civil affairs in UNTAET.  If the UN accepts  all\r\n\r\nour  contributions,  the  total  contribution  to  UNTAET  is\r\n\r\nestimated to cost about $9.1 million for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the kind of technical assistance and training\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can  give  to East Timor, the leaders,  Mr  Xanana\r\n\r\nGusmao and Jose-Ramos Horta, visited Singapore in January, as\r\n\r\npart of their regional tour to establish the  groundwork  for\r\n\r\nfuture  relations with friendly regional countries, and  they\r\n\r\nwere   also   wanting  to  gain  support  for  East   Timor's\r\n\r\nconstruction   efforts.   They  expressed  an   interest   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  development experiences since independence.   At\r\n\r\ntheir request, briefings were arranged with EDB, HDB, MPA and\r\n\r\nPSA.   They  also  visited  a  HDB  new  town  and  met   our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gusmao thanked us for our contributions to InterFET\r\n\r\nand  UNTAET,  and  he also requested our  help  in  providing\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance to East Timor.  They were  particularly\r\n\r\ninterested in the area of human resource development such  as\r\n\r\nport  and airport management. We have assured him that within\r\n\r\nthe  limits of our resources, we would do what we can to help\r\n\r\nout.  We  have extended an invitation to a team  of  Timorese\r\n\r\nofficials  to visit Singapore to discuss how we can  dovetail\r\n\r\nsome   of   our   technical  assistance   to   East   Timor's\r\n\r\nrequirements.  I expect the team will come in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards East Timor's independence and thereafter\r\n\r\napplying for membership,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  had  informed  Mr Gusmao and Mr Jose-Ramos  Horta  during\r\n\r\ntheir  visit  that  while Singapore  would  be  open  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of East Timor's membership in ASEAN, it was  really\r\n\r\npremature  to consider this issue now.  Our message  to  them\r\n\r\nwas  that  in  the next few years the priority should  be  to\r\n\r\nachieve  independence, reconstruction  and  nation  building.\r\n\r\nEast  Timor's  reconstruction needs  are  enormous  and  will\r\n\r\nrequire  massive assistance and strong political backing  for\r\n\r\nsome  time.  The UN and the international community  will  be\r\n\r\nthe   people  with  the  resources  and  experience  to  best\r\n\r\nfacilitate  East Timor's transition to independence.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that the international community and the UN  remain\r\n\r\nengaged  in  East Timor.  ASEAN countries themselves  do  not\r\n\r\npossess all the necessary capabilities to undertake this task\r\n\r\nof  reconstruction  for  East Timor.   Many  ASEAN  countries\r\n\r\nthemselves  are  recovering from the financial  crisis.   But\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  to  say  that ASEAN should  take  a  hands-off\r\n\r\napproach.   ASEAN  will be involved, as  we  have  been  with\r\n\r\nINTERFET  and  the  UN  support group  for  East  Timor,  and\r\n\r\nindividual  ASEAN countries, I am sure, including  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwill  continue to support the international effort  for  East\r\n\r\nTimor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for membership of ASEAN, when they eventually apply\r\n\r\nfor  membership, I am sure ASEAN will have to give it serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.   East Timor, like any other aspiring  member,\r\n\r\nwill  have to meet certain criteria and we will have to  take\r\n\r\nthis  one step at a time.  In any case, ASEAN membership  has\r\n\r\nto be decided by consensus.  They have to follow a procedure.\r\n\r\nThere  has  to be an application first.  Usually the  country\r\n\r\nbecomes an observer, after that they apply for membership and\r\n\r\nmembership  comes  after undertakings to  adhere  to  certain\r\n\r\nbasic  ASEAN  agreements, including the Bangkok  Declaration,\r\n\r\nthe  Treaty  of  Amity  and  Cooperation  and  various  other\r\n\r\nagreements.   There  are some six agreements  which  aspiring\r\n\r\nmembers will have to undertake to be bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members then asked about ASEAN. A common question was:\r\n\r\nhas ASEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutgrown itself?  I think Dr Ong Chit Chung asked that.    Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran asked: have we expanded too fast?  Because  of  the\r\n\r\nexpansion, has ASEAN slowed down?  These are valid  questions\r\n\r\nwhich  even members in ASEAN are asking themselves.  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that ASEAN is going through an important testing period.\r\n\r\nIt is going through a difficult period because, firstly, many\r\n\r\nof  the  countries are recovering from the financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  ASEAN has been touted for many years as  the  most\r\n\r\nsuccessful  regional grouping.  If it was considered  as  the\r\n\r\nmost successful regional grouping, it was because many of the\r\n\r\nmembers were doing well economically, and there was political\r\n\r\nstability.   That is not so now:  Economically, some  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  are  having problems.  Politically,  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  like  Indonesia are going through  very  difficult\r\n\r\nchallenging   times  in  their  political  transition.    The\r\n\r\nperception  is that ASEAN's reputation has been  dented.   It\r\n\r\nhas lost its shine or lustre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the challenge for ASEAN is how it can reorganise\r\n\r\nitself,  re-invent  itself,  so  to  speak,  to  recover  its\r\n\r\nrelevance  as  a  vibrant  regional  grouping.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  challenge and ASEAN will have to demonstrate  that\r\n\r\nit  is  relevant to the region, and relevant to the  external\r\n\r\nplayers.   As  I have mentioned in my answer to Dr  Ong  Chit\r\n\r\nChung on the strategic situation, ASEAN has been relevant  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  because  of its ability to engage  key  powers  in\r\n\r\ndiscussions on security in the region. If ASEAN does not live\r\n\r\nup  to  this challenge, then it will be marginalised  and  it\r\n\r\nwill be just another one of those many organisations that  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen in the world today.  But I am confident that ASEAN\r\n\r\nwill face this challenge squarely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked about Singapore's chairmanship of\r\n\r\nASEAN  for the previous year, which culminated in our hosting\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN meeting and the ARF meeting.  As Chairman of ASEAN,\r\n\r\nwe  initiated an honest reappraisal of ASEAN at  the  meeting\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore chaired.  It is precisely because  of  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that ASEAN is going through that I  introduced,\r\n\r\nwith the agreement of the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters,  for  the  first  time  ever,  an  ASEAN   Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters'   Retreat,  in  other  words,  just  the   Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters without officials at all.  We had a frank  exchange\r\n\r\nof  where  we are going.  The consensus was that this  was  a\r\n\r\nvery  candid exchange of views.  To indicate the candour,  we\r\n\r\ntook  note  of  the  danger  of  ASEAN  becoming  a  two-tier\r\n\r\norganisation,  in other words, some of the new entrants  like\r\n\r\nthe  Indochinese countries on the one hand, and on the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  original ASEAN member states.  It  was  important\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  prevent  ASEAN  from  becoming  a  two-tier\r\n\r\norganisation.    To  prevent  that,  it  was   important   to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  efforts to integrate and  assist  the  newer\r\n\r\nmembers of the organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singapore's role during our chairmanship and\r\n\r\nafter  our  chairmanship, I would say that we have  tried  to\r\n\r\nplay  a constructive role by coming out with practical  ideas\r\n\r\nto  advance  ASEAN's role.  For example, Members will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  the  Prime Minister proposed, and the leaders accepted,\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  sending  missions  or  road  shows  abroad  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  to Europe, America and elsewhere that  ASEAN  is\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  get  back on its feet.  These  missions  were\r\n\r\nagreed upon, and one mission already took place to Japan  led\r\n\r\nby  Malaysia with other members of ASEAN.  BG George Yeo, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry, will lead this ASEAN mission\r\n\r\nto  the  United States in May.  Thailand will also  lead  the\r\n\r\nthird   mission  to  Europe  in  May.   Singapore   will   be\r\n\r\nrepresented   in  all  these  missions.   Other   Singapore's\r\n\r\ninitiatives and efforts which were agreed upon were the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's e-ASEAN initiative, which is intended to transform\r\n\r\nASEAN  into  a borderless and seamless market instead  of  10\r\n\r\nfragmented  markets.   They  also endorsed  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nproposal to accelerate AFTA.  So Singapore continues to  play\r\n\r\na  constructive role in ASEAN by coming out with ideas  which\r\n\r\nhave been agreed upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also to indicate how ASEAN is trying to adjust, the\r\n\r\nleaders  agreed that we should have an ASEAN Troika.  Because\r\n\r\nonce  you  have  10 members and if you meet once  a  year  at\r\n\r\nForeign Ministers' Meeting, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders meet once a year, how do you deal and respond to fast\r\n\r\nchanging events?  So it was proposed at the Leaders'  Meeting\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  have a troika of three members  to  have  a\r\n\r\nfaster mechanism for ASEAN's response.  This was agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was Singapore's major task ahead this year for\r\n\r\nASEAN?  I wish to inform Members that we will be hosting  the\r\n\r\nFourth  ASEAN  Informal Meeting in November  this  year.   We\r\n\r\nintend to build what has been achieved in Manila.  I doubt if\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  have some grand visions or themes.  Rather,  we\r\n\r\nhope to focus on the message that ASEAN has to renew itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ARF, responding to Mr Simon Tay, I agree with him\r\n\r\nwhen  he  says that moving into preventive diplomacy is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.   Singapore is very mindful of that and  Singapore\r\n\r\nsupports the practice of preventive diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other Members who might not be very au fait with\r\n\r\nARF,  the ASEAN Regional Forum had three phases of evolution.\r\n\r\nFirst was confidence building measures.  The second phase  is\r\n\r\npreventive diplomacy, and the ultimate objective is  to  make\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN Regional Forum into a body which can be engaged  in\r\n\r\nconflict  resolution.  For the past few years we really  have\r\n\r\nbeen  focusing on confidence building measures.  Some of  us,\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore, feel that we should now nudge ourselves into\r\n\r\nthe preventive diplomacy phase.  So I agree with Mr Simon Tay\r\n\r\nwhen   he  says  that  Singapore  should  support  preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.  I want to assure him that we are ready to do  our\r\n\r\npart  in  terms  of preventive diplomacy.  But  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nSingapore itself engaging in preventive diplomacy, that is  a\r\n\r\nslightly   different  matter  because  he   knows   that   in\r\n\r\ninternational  practice  and  international  law,  preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy, if you offer yourself as good offices, depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  consent  of whichever parties are disputing.   You  just\r\n\r\ncannot  impose yourself on disputing parties.  We  will  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  other  ARF countries to see how we can  accelerate\r\n\r\nslowly   the   process  of  ARF  moving  towards   preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked about Myanmar. I can say that the\r\n\r\nsituation there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally  calm  and the State Peace and Development  Council\r\n\r\nremains  firmly  in  control.  I  understand  that  they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned over Myanmar's economic slowdown as a result  of  a\r\n\r\ncombination of various factors including the Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis.    He  asked  about  ASEAN's  role  and  constructive\r\n\r\nengagement.  I have explained in this House before that being\r\n\r\nan   ASEAN   member,   Myanmar  has  greater   exposure   and\r\n\r\nopportunities  to come into contact with the other  countries\r\n\r\nin  ASEAN.   We take this opportunity to have a quiet,  frank\r\n\r\ndiscussion.  Many of us, individually and separately, quietly\r\n\r\nexercised some suasion in trying to persuade Myanmar  on  the\r\n\r\nways  of  achieving normalcy, as in some of the  other  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries.   But we do not take the approach  of  some  other\r\n\r\ncountries like in the East who are inclined to imposing their\r\n\r\nviews and insisting that various measures be taken.  We think\r\n\r\nit  is  better to have quiet diplomacy.  Notwithstanding  the\r\n\r\nhelp  and  encouragement Singapore and other ASEAN  countries\r\n\r\ncan give Myanmar, in the end the pace of reform measures must\r\n\r\nstill be left to them to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about ASEAN-EU relations. It is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  there  is  a difficulty and  that  difficulty  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  EU has a common policy with regard to  Myanmar.\r\n\r\nBecause  of the common policy, they maintain that  they  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to allow the Myanmar Foreign Minister to attend\r\n\r\nany  meetings held in Europe.  Therefore, for the first  time\r\n\r\nlast year, the ASEAN-EU Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which has\r\n\r\ntaken place regularly for many years, was cancelled.  It  was\r\n\r\nto  take  place  in  Berlin.  It was  cancelled  because  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Union insisted that they would not give a visa  for\r\n\r\nthe  Myanmar  Foreign  Minister but the  rest  of  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nForeign  Ministers could come.  Naturally,  ASEAN  could  not\r\n\r\naccept that condition, and the meeting therefore did not take\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position on Myanmar vis-a-vis the European Union is\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  Europeans that they are free, and should  feel\r\n\r\nfree, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake whatever position they want with regard to Myanmar,  but\r\n\r\nto  distinguish their relations with ASEAN as an organisation\r\n\r\nfrom  their  relations with Myanmar.  Just as  when  we  held\r\n\r\nmeetings  here, as I chaired the meetings last year,  we  had\r\n\r\nthe Myanmar Foreign Minister and the European Union here, and\r\n\r\nthey  had  no difficulty in sitting down in the same  meeting\r\n\r\nwith  Myanmar  Foreign Minister.  So this is a real  problem.\r\n\r\nWe  have  persevered  with European Union.   There  are  many\r\n\r\ncountries in the EU who would like to break this impasse  and\r\n\r\nget back to the productive ASEAN-EU relationship.  So we will\r\n\r\nwork  with  them  to  see  how we can  revive  this  ASEAN-EU\r\n\r\nMinisterial  process,  and many behind-the-scene  discussions\r\n\r\nare going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mr Charles Chong also asked, if we should have\r\n\r\na  \"tit  for tat\", and will ASEAN take a similar position  on\r\n\r\nthe  Austrian  government.  I cannot speak for  the  rest  of\r\n\r\nASEAN,  but  I  doubt  it.  Because  if  ASEAN  wants  to  be\r\n\r\nconsistent  over  the  position we  have  taken  with  EU  on\r\n\r\nMyanmar, then it should follow that ASEAN's relationship with\r\n\r\nEU,  which  is  a bloc-to-bloc relationship,  should  not  be\r\n\r\ncontingent on whether a particular government or a particular\r\n\r\nMinister is in that government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and a few others asked about our United\r\n\r\nNations  Security  Council candidature.  First,  to  give  an\r\n\r\nupdate.   Singapore is bidding for a seat, which is in  Asian\r\n\r\nGroup  seat,  for the United Nations Security  Council,  non-permanent  member.   The election will be  later  this  year,\r\n\r\naround October or so.  Because it is in Asian Group seat, and\r\n\r\nthere is no rival Asian candidate competing with us, and  the\r\n\r\nAsian  Group earlier has endorsed Singapore's candidature  as\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  Group's agreed candidate, I would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nprospects of us being elected are very good.  But we are  not\r\n\r\nbeing complacent.  We are continuing with all our efforts  to\r\n\r\ntalk  to  other countries in other regions to ensure that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  good  result when voting takes place in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations.  But I am reasonably\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfident that we will be elected, and the election is for  a\r\n\r\ntwo-year term starting in January 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to say this. If we can get elected to\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Security Council, we should not get carried away  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  we will be in the Security Council  for  two\r\n\r\nyears.  And it does not mean that we have suddenly arrived or\r\n\r\nthat  for  two  years we will have some magical power  status\r\n\r\nbestowed on us.  That is not the case.  During the two years,\r\n\r\nif  we  are on the Security Council and thereafter,  we  will\r\n\r\nstill continue to be a small country and we cannot pretend to\r\n\r\nbe  otherwise.  I thought I should emphasise this.  We should\r\n\r\nhave a sense of proportion and not have any delusion that  we\r\n\r\nare  not  a  small country.  And the reason why I  make  this\r\n\r\npoint  is  yesterday,  as  I was listening  to  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncomments,  questions and observations in the cuts on  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs,  I  thought  that  there  was  a  little   lack   of\r\n\r\nproportion,  a  little lack of realism.  When I  listened  to\r\n\r\nsome  of  the comments, say, \"look, can we send so many  more\r\n\r\nmilitary missions, peacekeeping operations, can we expand our\r\n\r\ntechnical assistance, not just human resources but  also  try\r\n\r\nto  influence the policies in these countries\", and so on,  I\r\n\r\nwould say, you better come down to reality and remember  that\r\n\r\nwe  are a small country with limited resources.  We shall  do\r\n\r\nour  best  to  be active in foreign policy - to  advance  our\r\n\r\ninterests, to be a responsible international citizen  and  to\r\n\r\nhave  constructive ideas on issues, whether in the region  or\r\n\r\nin international organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that if we are elected to\r\n\r\nthe  Security  Council, we will do our best to contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  work of the Council by bringing to the Council -  and  I\r\n\r\nthink this is Mr Simon Tay's question - the perspective of  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country,  and  we  will try  to  demonstrate  wherever\r\n\r\npossible  that a small state can also play a useful  role  in\r\n\r\nthe Council.  And we will work with like-minded countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  Council,  including those from the Non-aligned  Movement\r\n\r\nand  the  G77, on issues of common interest.  As the endorsed\r\n\r\ncandidate  of  the Asian Group, naturally we will  also  work\r\n\r\nwith the Asian Group to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreflect their views and concerns in the Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether on issues we would side with\r\n\r\nthe  big  powers.  I think our record speaks for itself.   In\r\n\r\nall  these  years, people consider Singapore  to  have  taken\r\n\r\npositions on the basis of principle and that we would have an\r\n\r\nindependent foreign policy, and we shall continue to  do  so,\r\n\r\nwhether we are in the Security Council or we are not  in  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask your permission, Sir, for my colleagues\r\n\r\nDr  Ow  Chin  Hock  and Mr Zainul Abidin  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nremaining issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock):</b> Sir, on Singapore-Japan relations, I agree with Dr\r\n\r\nOng  Chit  Chung that the bilateral relations  are  warm  and\r\n\r\nclose,  and  I  may  add,  the  relations  have  strengthened\r\n\r\nsignificantly in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, during the Asian financial crisis, both countries\r\n\r\nhave  consulted  closely to assist the  regional  economy  in\r\n\r\novercoming  their economic difficulties.  Japanese government\r\n\r\ndelegations  visiting the region also visited  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nhad substantive discussions with our leaders and officials on\r\n\r\nregional development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, bilateral cooperation and interaction have\r\n\r\nbroadened   and  institutionalised.   Several  key  bilateral\r\n\r\nprojects  endorsed at the highest political level  have  been\r\n\r\nimplemented.   These include the Japan-Singapore  Partnership\r\n\r\nProgramme for the 21st Century, Japan-Singapore Symposium and\r\n\r\nJapan-Singapore  Business Council.  Further,  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh's  visit  to Japan in December last year was  successful.\r\n\r\nThe  visit provided more opportunity for Singapore and  Japan\r\n\r\nto  explore  new areas to further enhance bilateral  economic\r\n\r\ncooperation in the new millennium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the visit, Prime Minister Goh and Japanese Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Obuchi  agreed  to launch  a  joint  study  on  the\r\n\r\nfeasibility to establish a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between\r\n\r\nJapan and Singapore.  Both sides\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  joint study will help to  enhance  bilateral\r\n\r\neconomic  integration  and cooperation  as  well  as  further\r\n\r\ncomplement ongoing efforts of the two countries to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe multi-trading system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked for the progress on FTA. The first meeting\r\n\r\nor  inaugural  meeting  of  the joint  study  has  just  been\r\n\r\nconcluded.  It was held on 7th and 8th.  Both countries  were\r\n\r\nrepresented  in  the  joint study by  senior  officials  from\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries  and members of the  private  sector  and\r\n\r\nacademia.   The first meeting had made positive  progress  in\r\n\r\nidentifying the scope of such an FTA.  The next meeting  will\r\n\r\nbe  in Japan in late April this year.  Both sides will strive\r\n\r\nto  complete the study and to submit by November 2000 a joint\r\n\r\nreport   to  their  respective  Prime  Ministers,  with   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation on whether both countries should proceed  with\r\n\r\nformal negotiation for such a Free Trade Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to Singapore-China relations.\r\n\r\nSingapore-China  relations  are  good,  underscored  by   the\r\n\r\nfrequent  exchange of high level visits.  There are no  major\r\n\r\nbilateral  issues between our two countries.   Following  the\r\n\r\nresolution  of the Suzhou Industrial Park issue  or  dispute,\r\n\r\nrelations have been problem-free.  The strongest basis of our\r\n\r\nbilateral  relation  is in the area of economic  cooperation.\r\n\r\nBilateral trade between Singapore and China has been steadily\r\n\r\nincreasing  at  an  average annual rate of  14%  since  1990.\r\n\r\nSingapore is also one of the top investors in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's impending entry into the WTO is expected to\r\n\r\nprovide  new opportunities for our businesses and  investors.\r\n\r\nSome  new  areas for cooperation, such as public housing,  IT\r\n\r\nand the financial sector, have already been identified during\r\n\r\nPremier  Zhu  Rongji's  visit  to  Singapore  last  November.\r\n\r\nSingapore   would  continue  to  explore  stronger   economic\r\n\r\ncooperation with China in these new areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the\r\n\r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations.  We are confident that\r\n\r\nfuture cooperation between Singapore and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina will continue to expand and strengthen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also commented on the PRC's White Paper on \"the\r\n\r\nOne-China  principle and the Taiwan Issue\".   Some  observers\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out that the White Paper has introduced  a  new\r\n\r\ncondition,  that  China will resort to force  if  the  Taiwan\r\n\r\nauthorities  refuse indefinitely the peaceful  settlement  of\r\n\r\ncross-strait settlement or reunification through negotiation.\r\n\r\nBut  the Chinese leadership has countered that this has  been\r\n\r\nits  consistent position.  However, the fundamental  position\r\n\r\nof  the White Paper is that China would not renounce the  use\r\n\r\nof force to settle the Taiwan issue.  This is not new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, China has clearly set their OB markers against\r\n\r\nindependence for Taiwan which Taipei would not breach.  Given\r\n\r\nthat  both  China  and  Taiwan are  currently  enjoying  high\r\n\r\neconomic  growth, it is unlikely that they will  want  to  be\r\n\r\ndrawn into a conflict at this time.  However, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  pointed out yesterday, the Taiwan issue is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  significant uncertainties in the region.  An escalation\r\n\r\nof  cross-strait tensions would be disastrous for the  region\r\n\r\nat  a  time  when it needs stability to sustain its  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery.   In  the  interest of the region's  stability  and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  it  is our hope that the parties  involved  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to exercise restraint in their efforts  to  resolve\r\n\r\ndifferences across the Taiwan Strait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked what is Singapore's stand on the cross-strait relationship. We have always abided by the One-China\r\n\r\npolicy.   The  release of the Chinese White  Paper  will  not\r\n\r\naffect  our  policy.  Nonetheless, we hope for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\npeace, regional peace and stability, any cross-strait problem\r\n\r\ncan be resolved peacefully between the two parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong further asked whether Singapore can play a role.\r\n\r\nLet  me  point out that cross-strait relations are considered\r\n\r\nby PRC as an internal matter or family affair.  Singapore can\r\n\r\nplay  a  role only if we are invited to do so by both  sides.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in 1992, we facilitated the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWang-Ku  Hui Tang, or Wang-Ku Talks, by providing  the  venue\r\n\r\nfor their dialogues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to respond to two questions raised by Members,  one  on\r\n\r\nEALAF and the other on technical cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member, Mr Ravindran, mentioned yesterday, East\r\n\r\nAsia  has  got  institutional links with both  North  America\r\n\r\n(through APEC) and with Europe (through ASEM).  There is this\r\n\r\nobvious missing link between two dynamic regions of East Asia\r\n\r\nand  Latin  America.   Thus to bridge  this  gap,  EALAF  was\r\n\r\ninitiated  by  Singapore, in fact by our Prime  Minister,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities for closer interaction  in  political,\r\n\r\neconomic, social and other spheres.  This is how we feel that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  play a facilitator role in the  international\r\n\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some update, which was asked by Mr Ravindran, the\r\n\r\ninaugural  meeting  of officials was held in  September  last\r\n\r\nyear  where  in fact 27 countries participated.   There  were\r\n\r\nthree major outcomes out of this meeting last September.  The\r\n\r\nfirst was the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Chile which would\r\n\r\nbe held in the first quarter of 2001 and would be preceded by\r\n\r\ntwo  preparatory Senior Officials' Meetings (SOMs).   Second,\r\n\r\nEALAF  should  be  the  working name for  the  Forum  pending\r\n\r\nconsensus  on  the new appellation to be agreed  upon  later.\r\n\r\nThird,  EALAF  will have a multi-dimensional nature  covering\r\n\r\npolitical, economic, social, cultural and other tracks.   The\r\n\r\nmeeting  also has confirmed 17 projects, three of which  were\r\n\r\noffered by Singapore in different areas, to give substance to\r\n\r\nEALAF's  multi-dimensional  character.   The  three  projects\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore has offered include (1) an economic study  on\r\n\r\nobstacles and potential for greater economic linkages between\r\n\r\nEast  Asia  and the Latin American countries, spearheaded  by\r\n\r\nISEAS;  (2)  a Journalists' Visit Programme (JVP)  for  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerican countries.  One journalist each from Brazil and Peru\r\n\r\nhas been selected for the first JVP.  In fact, Thailand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   also  indicated  interest  in  dovetailing  a   similar\r\n\r\nprogramme  in  Thailand with the JVP; and (3) a Travel  Trade\r\n\r\nFair  (TTF)  for  Latin  American countries  to  be  held  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with the PATA Travel Mart in April  2000.   Thus\r\n\r\nfar,  three  countries - Mexico, Venezuela and  Ecuador  have\r\n\r\nagreed to participate in this fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next EALAF meeting, the Chileans have proposed\r\n\r\nthe  dates of 16-18 August 2000 for the next EALAF SOM to  be\r\n\r\nheld  in  Santiago,  Chile.  And this  will  be  followed  by\r\n\r\nanother  preparatory SOM meeting back-to-back with the  first\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Meeting scheduled also to be held  in  Santiago,\r\n\r\nChile, in the first quarter of 2001.  A summit is planned  to\r\n\r\nbe held later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, EALAF is a Singapore initiative, and we\r\n\r\nwill  continue to actively pursue it.  Although EALAF  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  initial  stages, we are heartened from the responses  of\r\n\r\nmember  countries  thus far, and remain optimistic  that  the\r\n\r\nEALAF process will take off as planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the cut on technical and developmental\r\n\r\nassistance.   Mr  Simon  Tay has raised  quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\nobservations.   This  is  the  second  year  he  is   raising\r\n\r\nquestions on technical development assistance.  Mr Simon Tay,\r\n\r\nin  his  cut,  has asked that MFA need not say \"yes\"  but  to\r\n\r\nagree  to at least review its policy on technical assistance.\r\n\r\nLet  me  first  say  that MFA always makes  it  a  policy  to\r\n\r\nevaluate  the programme's effectiveness and we will  continue\r\n\r\nto  do  so.  Nevertheless, it is unlikely that we will change\r\n\r\nthe fundamental thrust of the Singapore Cooperation Programme\r\n\r\n(SCP).   It is time-tested and has been proven right  by  the\r\n\r\nfeedback we get from its beneficiaries.  The basis of the SCP\r\n\r\nhas always been human resource development.  This is what was\r\n\r\nasked  for by the beneficiaries and we will need to  continue\r\n\r\nwith that thrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I answer some specific questions and comments\r\n\r\nraised  by Mr Tay, allow me first to give a broad picture  of\r\n\r\nthe  SCP  and  its  achievements.   The  SCP  is  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontribution to the international community for  the  benefit\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping   countries.    We   believe   in   sharing    our\r\n\r\ndevelopmental experience with developing countries,  just  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  benefited from assistance from  international\r\n\r\norganisations and developed countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1992, the SCP has grown not only\r\n\r\nquantitatively, but also qualitatively.  From a modest budget\r\n\r\nof  S$8.1  million in 1993, it has doubled to S$17.8  million\r\n\r\nlast  year.   The  total number of participants  grew  nearly\r\n\r\nthree  times from 849 in 1993 to a projected 2,500  (and  not\r\n\r\n1,200  as stated by Mr Simon Tay) this fiscal year.  To train\r\n\r\n2,500  participants in one year is significant  for  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry.   They are from 123 countries with the  majority  of\r\n\r\n74.5%  coming  from Asia.  On 22nd November  last  year,  the\r\n\r\nprogramme celebrated its 10,000th participant to the SCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also the Third Country Training Programme (TCTP)\r\n\r\nwith  other  partners in order to organise and  run  training\r\n\r\ncourses  jointly for developing countries.  This has  enabled\r\n\r\nus  to stretch the SCP dollar to reach out to more developing\r\n\r\ncountries    and   tap   the   expertise   of   international\r\n\r\norganisations and partner countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Singapore has signed TCTP MOUs with 21\r\n\r\npartners,  including the World Bank, IMF,  the  Commonwealth,\r\n\r\nColombo Plan, UNDP and WTO.  And we will sign an MOU with the\r\n\r\nInternational  Atomic Energy Agency shortly and  negotiations\r\n\r\nare also going on with the EU for another possible TCTP MOU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual total cost of Singapore's technical\r\n\r\nassistance to foreign countries is estimated to be more  than\r\n\r\n$50  million.  This includes training provided under the  SCP\r\n\r\nand those organised by other Ministries and their agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Simon Tay would be happy to know that yes, when\r\n\r\nspecial circumstances arise, we do provide special responses.\r\n\r\nDo not forget, during the financial crisis, our assistance to\r\n\r\nthe region included -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Humanitarian assistance comprising S$10 million of\r\n\r\nrice and S$2 million of medical supplies that was provided to\r\n\r\nIndonesia in three tranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) 150 undergraduate scholarships to ASEAN countries,\r\n\r\nincluding Indonesia, over a period of five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Increased technical assistance in financial\r\n\r\nmanagement   and  healthcare  training  to  assist   regional\r\n\r\ncountries  develop  sufficient  capacity  to  overcome  their\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We also incurred S$22.2 million for our\r\n\r\ncontributions to InterFET and UNTAET in East Timor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also said that our SCP programmes are labour-intensive and attach foreigners to our Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.   That  is not true.  All our  SCP  courses  are\r\n\r\nconducted   by   our  training  institutes   established   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministries or departments to  train  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  foreigners.   And our SCP participants are  attached  to\r\n\r\nsuch groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the examples of training agencies which we are\r\n\r\nusing  include the NUS and NTU for estate management courses,\r\n\r\nurban  and  building  and  economic  development  programmes;\r\n\r\nPolytechnics  for tourism and healthcare and  IT;   RELC  for\r\n\r\nEnglish  Language; the Singapore Aviation Academy  (SAA)  for\r\n\r\nCivil  Aviation,  Search  and  Rescue  programmes;   PSB  for\r\n\r\nproductivity;   PSA,  or their training institute,  PSI,  for\r\n\r\nport management; and EDB Consultancy and TDB Consultancy  for\r\n\r\ninvestment and trade promotion programmes respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attachments of foreigners to Government departments are\r\n\r\narranged only during study visits.  But these are done at the\r\n\r\nrequest  of  recipient countries.  Some 30 study  visits  are\r\n\r\narranged   as  opposed  to  over  200  training  courses   or\r\n\r\nprogrammes per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our SCP offers are different from other donor countries.\r\n\r\nNo strings are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecipients  are not expected to purchase Singapore  products.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to share development experience and generate\r\n\r\ngoodwill.   No  one has misconstrued our objectives  so  far.\r\n\r\nInstead,  many have praised Singapore's technical  assistance\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback we received confirm that participants are happy\r\n\r\nto  see  Singapore's  economic and social  developments  with\r\n\r\ntheir  own  eyes.  This is better than flying out consultants\r\n\r\noverseas as our experts cannot be away for too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of learning from our experience\r\n\r\nabout policy reforms, as raised by Mr Simon Tay, our approach\r\n\r\nis  to  show  developing  countries  how  correct  Government\r\n\r\npolicies   can   assist  countries  in  overcoming   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  for  example,  our  recent  CPF   cuts,   wage\r\n\r\nrestraint, training and retraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses on reforms in civil service, good governance,\r\n\r\nfinancial management, judicial reforms, productivity are  all\r\n\r\naimed  at  showing  right  policies  to  overcome  structural\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I seek\r\n\r\nclarification from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary on  his\r\n\r\nresponse  on  the  technical  and  developmental  assistance.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  on the attachments.  Clearly these  training\r\n\r\ninstitutes,  as I understand them, are run by  the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  which he has named. I take it also that  his  comment\r\n\r\nthat  the experts cannot be away for long would mean that  we\r\n\r\nare  on the same manpower.  Some of the institute people  are\r\n\r\nalso from the agencies that run the institutes.  Am I correct\r\n\r\non  that?   Secondly,  while I accept his  reassurance,  this\r\n\r\narrangement  means that most of the money we are spending  is\r\n\r\nbased in Singapore and most of the training happens here.  Am\r\n\r\nI  correct on that?  Thirdly, I am gratified again  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  willing  to consider the policy  again,  as  it\r\n\r\nalways  does.  May I ask the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary,\r\n\r\nin   this  ongoing  review,  will  the  Ministry  take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the Minister's own remarks  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nnewly recognised danger of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   two-tier  ASEAN,  and  will,  in  this  sense,  this  new\r\n\r\nrecognition of a development since 1992 spurs us to do more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> My Minister will answer the\r\n\r\nlast  question.  On the first two questions, since  they  are\r\n\r\nongoing  programmes  which  are  conducted  by  our  training\r\n\r\nagencies, I do not think it is an extra imposition  on  them.\r\n\r\nSo  they  are  run concurrently with the existing  programmes\r\n\r\nwhere Singaporeans also benefit from.  These participants who\r\n\r\nare from overseas are also part of the training programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of money spent, if we go on the\r\n\r\nprinciple that it is best held here, and as beneficiaries  of\r\n\r\nthese  programmes  themselves  request  that  they  come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  see how Singapore implements its developmental\r\n\r\nprogramme,  they will have to come here.  When they  do  come\r\n\r\nhere.   ,  they  will  have to live  in  our  hotels  or  our\r\n\r\naccommodation  and  the  training  programme  costs  will  be\r\n\r\nexpended here.  So I think it is only natural that it  should\r\n\r\nbe  done  that way and that in fact is also the way  done  by\r\n\r\nmany donor countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, when we want to prevent a two-tier ASEAN, the other ASEAN countries have to help these\r\n\r\nnewer  countries to integrate with the rest of ASEAN  and  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I should say that, firstly, we have  a  special\r\n\r\nIndo-China  Assistance  Fund  under  our  Technical  Training\r\n\r\nProgramme specifically dedicated to the Indo-Chinese country.\r\n\r\nAnd  secondly,  on  the figure that the Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  mentioned that we train over 2,000  persons  every\r\n\r\nyear, more than half are for ASEAN countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about\r\n\r\nForeign Service staff careers and training.  I thank him  for\r\n\r\nhis concern. I agree with him that MFA must have a fair share\r\n\r\nof local talents.  Indeed, for Singapore to remain successful\r\n\r\nin  carving out diplomatic space for itself in spite  of  its\r\n\r\nsmall size, MFA must ensure that it has high quality and well-motivated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign   Service   officers  through  a  comprehensive   and\r\n\r\nintegrated   recruitment,  training  and  career  development\r\n\r\nprogramme and an attractive scheme of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our recruitment, I must say, so far so good. Dr Ong may\r\n\r\nbe  pleased  to learn that in spite of the severe competition\r\n\r\nfrom  the  private sector and other Government agencies,  MFA\r\n\r\nhas  so far been able to attract good quality officers to the\r\n\r\nForeign  Service. Currently, more than half  of  our  Foreign\r\n\r\nService  officers  have  at least a  Second  (Upper)  Honours\r\n\r\ndegree.   In addition, since 1996, 17 PSC scholars have  been\r\n\r\nattracted to the Foreign Service. We also complement our pool\r\n\r\nof   Foreign  Service  officers  with  talent  injection   of\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officers and PSC scholars. At  the  Heads  of\r\n\r\nMission  level,  we  have  as  Ambassadors  people  who  have\r\n\r\ndistinguished  themselves in their  respective  careers,  for\r\n\r\nexample, Chan Heng Chee and Walter Woon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On terms and conditions, the foreign service is a\r\n\r\nchallenging but tough career.  The prestige and glamour of  a\r\n\r\ndiplomatic career is no longer an attraction or draw for  our\r\n\r\nyounger  Singaporeans as it used to be.  On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  disruption to family, in particular, to  the  career  of\r\n\r\ntheir  spouses and their children's education is  becoming  a\r\n\r\ndisincentive.   MFA has put in place a good  training  scheme\r\n\r\nand  package of overseas cost of living allowances and  other\r\n\r\nallowances  to make MFA career more attractive.  However,  we\r\n\r\nare   mindful  that  nowadays,  Singaporeans  who   like   to\r\n\r\nexperience  living  and  working overseas,  have  many  other\r\n\r\nattractive  career  options,  in  both  private  and   public\r\n\r\nsectors.  MFA would have to continuously review  and  improve\r\n\r\nthe  terms and conditions of its scheme of service to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat we continue to attract good quality officers to join the\r\n\r\nForeign Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong raised two specific points: First, on language\r\n\r\ntraining, let me say that MFA administers three main  schemes\r\n\r\nto  encourage officers to acquire, maintain or upgrade  their\r\n\r\nlanguage skills. Firstly, officers who are going for overseas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposting  where  the  language that is commonly  used  is  not\r\n\r\nEnglish, are given intensive training in that language before\r\n\r\nthey  assume duty. The training is conducted in the  form  of\r\n\r\npart-time  class or tuition in Singapore at  the  country  of\r\n\r\nposting  or  at  a  third  country.  Secondly,  officers  are\r\n\r\neligible  for language allowance if they attain  the  minimum\r\n\r\nrequired  proficiency  level.   Thirdly,  part-time  language\r\n\r\ncourses  are  open to everyone in MFA. The  course  fees  are\r\n\r\nfully reimbursed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question on the education of the children\r\n\r\nof diplomats, under the Education Assistance Allowance (EAA),\r\n\r\nofficers with school-going children up to the age of  18  are\r\n\r\nfully  reimbursed for tuition in an approved  school  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry of posting. For officers stationed in countries where\r\n\r\nthe  educational  facilities are  inadequate  and  the  child\r\n\r\ncannot  remain  in Singapore for his education,  the  officer\r\n\r\nreceives  the  EAA for the child to be educated  in  a  third\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their return to Singapore, MFA facilitates the\r\n\r\nreintegration  of  these children into the  Singapore  school\r\n\r\nsystem in close cooperation with the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I want to thank\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  and  the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary  for\r\n\r\ntheir  answers.

Artistic  creativity  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant component of a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our local arts scene has made good progress and\r\n\r\nstrides  in the last ten years or so. Credit must go  to  the\r\n\r\nNational  Arts  Council whose activities and programmes  have\r\n\r\nhelped  nurture  a  more  vibrant arts  scene  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever, what has been achieved to-date is not enough to make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a renaissance city.  We still have a long  way  to\r\n\r\ngo.   Our  arts  and cultural scene would  have  to  grow  to\r\n\r\nsupport this vision of a renaissance city.  Singaporeans need\r\n\r\nto  be  nurtured  to appreciate the arts and greater  efforts\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  made to attract, develop and support  both  our\r\n\r\nlocal  and foreign arts talents. Local artists and  the  arts\r\n\r\ncommunity  should be rendered further assistance.  They  need\r\n\r\nto  win  the  support and patronage of Singaporean audiences,\r\n\r\nwhose willingness to spend on the arts or on the various arts\r\n\r\nforms will influence their progress and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am disappointed with the grant given to the\r\n\r\nNational  Arts Council in the proposed budget.  The NAC  this\r\n\r\nyear  will  receive  some  $20 million  in  grant,  a  slight\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $3 million from the $17 million allocated  last\r\n\r\nyear  or  the  current financial year.  In  the  budget,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment grant comes to $620,000 and this is peanuts.  How\r\n\r\ncan we develop a renaissance city with this money?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this budget, our spending on the arts in the\r\n\r\nbudgeted year works out to only about $7 per capita per year.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the budget allocated for the promotion of sports\r\n\r\ncomes  up  to  some  $80  million,  $40  million  on  current\r\n\r\nexpenditure   and   another  $40   million   on   development\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Our funding for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsports  works out  to about $25 per capita per year.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot according the same priority to arts that we do to sports.\r\n\r\nTo  realise our dream for Singapore to be a renaissance city,\r\n\r\nthe  Government must commit more funds to promote  the  arts.\r\n\r\nThere should be a total plan to develop and promote the  arts\r\n\r\nscene.  The current grant of $20 million allocated to NAC  is\r\n\r\ngrossly  inadequate.  Our per capita funding for the arts  of\r\n\r\n$7  per  year is very low compared to cities like Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nwhere  the spending is $24 per capita per year; London,  $108\r\n\r\nper  capita  per year, and even in the state of  Victoria  in\r\n\r\nAustralia,  the  arts spending comes to $15  per  capita  per\r\n\r\nyear.   So we have a long way to go to be a global arts  city\r\n\r\nand more needs to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that MITA has embarked on a major study to\r\n\r\ndevelop a total plan to make Singapore a renaissance city.  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore like to ask the Minister if he is  ready  to\r\n\r\ntell   the  House  his  Ministry's  plans  and  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  commit more financial resources,  and  how\r\n\r\nmuch,  and  over what time-frame.  Unless we commit  as  much\r\n\r\nresources  and  priority to arts as we do to sports,  we  can\r\n\r\nnever be successful in making Singapore a renaissance city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, our Prime Minister\r\n\r\nrevealed  in  his  National Day Rally  speech  that  MITA  is\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a vision for Singapore to be a renaissance  city.\r\n\r\nIt  has  created  some excitement among people  in  the  arts\r\n\r\ncommunity and Singaporeans at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way. MITA has been proactive\r\n\r\nin  the  arts  scene.  I am aware that both the Minister  and\r\n\r\nMITA  officials  have  been  very encouraging  towards  local\r\n\r\nartists.    The  National  Arts  Council  has   been   making\r\n\r\nmilestones  in  initiating  new  projects  and  strengthening\r\n\r\nexisting  programmes.  I am happy to see in  the  latest  NAC\r\n\r\nmagazine,  a message from their Executive Director where  his\r\n\r\nappeal  to the arts community is \"To work with us\". He called\r\n\r\nfor a linkage of minds and efforts between the arts community\r\n\r\nand the NAC.  His call is a win-win\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach as both are dependent on each other and have to work\r\n\r\ntogether if we are to make Singapore an arts hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must do more if we are to become a cultured and\r\n\r\ncultural society.  All involved must do more if Singapore  is\r\n\r\nto  become an international arts hub.  My wish list  for  the\r\n\r\narts  scene are many. Some of these are that we must  further\r\n\r\ndevelop  local talent by enhancing training and  giving  them\r\n\r\nmore scholarships.  They must be given more opportunities  to\r\n\r\nperform so that they can become professionals.  We must  also\r\n\r\nhelp create more audience locally by educating the public  on\r\n\r\nthe  arts  as the key to the survival of our arts groups  and\r\n\r\nartists are occupied seats, and not empty seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also got to encourage and give incentives for\r\n\r\nour local productions to be created and marketed both locally\r\n\r\nand  overseas.   We  have  also got  to  increase  Government\r\n\r\nfinancial support to our arts groups and individual  artists,\r\n\r\nand I share the concern of my GPC Chairman, when he said that\r\n\r\nthe  funding  for  NAC is way, way below as compared  to  our\r\n\r\nregional neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also continue to build more performance arenas\r\n\r\nand make it affordable for arts groups.  We have also equally\r\n\r\ngot  to  ensure  that  foreign talent  and  arts  performance\r\n\r\ncompanies  set  up office here and would hold shows  here  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  not  only serve the local market,  but  also  the\r\n\r\nregional  and international markets.  In this, I  would  also\r\n\r\nurge   MITA  to  see  how  we  can  initiate  and  hold  more\r\n\r\ninternational  arts events here to attract  both  locals  and\r\n\r\ntourists  alike. I would also like to ask MITA how  they  are\r\n\r\nworking  with other Ministries, like the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nand  the EDB, to offer tax and other financial incentives and\r\n\r\ngrants to attract businessmen to pursue opportunities in  the\r\n\r\narts field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that many Singaporeans share the\r\n\r\nsame  ambition  of  making Singapore  an  international  arts\r\n\r\ncentre  and  are  behind the Government  to  ensure  that  we\r\n\r\nsucceed. I would also like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  share with us what  are  MITA's  plans  to\r\n\r\nrealise our vision of making Singapore a renaissance city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, like the two\r\n\r\nMembers before me, I am rising to plead for more funding  for\r\n\r\nthe arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alluding also to the Prime Minister's National Day Rally\r\n\r\nspeech  last August, we were most excited to hear that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  promise for more funding to be going to the arts  and\r\n\r\nthat  unfortunately does not seem to have been translated  in\r\n\r\nthis  year's  budget.   It sounds good  in  terms  of  a  14%\r\n\r\nincrease  for the NAC's budget because the base is so  small.\r\n\r\nIn absolute terms, as Mr Chew has noted, at $20 million worth\r\n\r\nof  funding for all of the arts programmes that we have under\r\n\r\nthe  NAC banner, I do not know how much you can achieve  with\r\n\r\nthat.  I also noted that when you look at the audience reach,\r\n\r\nin the workload and in productivity indicators, you will find\r\n\r\nthat  the  reach in fact seems to be shrinking. For the  arts\r\n\r\nprogrammes, we have about 277,000 audience reached  the  year\r\n\r\nbefore  and  it is estimated to drop to 210,000  for  FY2000.\r\n\r\nThe  arts  education programmes and the outreach  programmes,\r\n\r\nboth  in  terms  of activities and outreach, seem  to  remain\r\n\r\nstatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have this comprehensive plan that MITA is\r\n\r\nputting  together to turn Singapore into a renaissance  city,\r\n\r\nand  if  that plan could be very quickly forthcoming, perhaps\r\n\r\nwe might be more successful in getting more resources for the\r\n\r\narts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In it, I see a fascinating programme and the\r\n\r\norganisers are to be  congratulated for it.  There are  shows\r\n\r\nfrom  the  four  corners  of the  world  for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and visitors to enjoy, and it is indicative of  the\r\n\r\nmost  vibrant  cultural  scene in Singapore.   My  subsequent\r\n\r\ncomments should therefore be taken in this context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the arts and culture scene to be ever\r\n\r\nimproving in Singapore and all that I would like to  do  here\r\n\r\nis  to  contribute, if I can, to making it a  little  better.\r\n\r\nWhile I admire the programme for our arts festival in June, I\r\n\r\nam  slightly  disappointed to see that we do not invite  more\r\n\r\nparticipation from our ASEAN neighbours.  There are only  two\r\n\r\nitems on the June programme from our ASEAN neighbours.   Now,\r\n\r\nASEAN  with 10 countries must be said to be one of  the  most\r\n\r\nculturally  diverse areas in the world.  Some countries  like\r\n\r\nours   may  indeed  have  several  different  cultures,   all\r\n\r\nexhibiting  different costumes, musical instruments,  dances,\r\n\r\nsongs.  If we add on the different artistic styles that  they\r\n\r\nhave, we have enough, I believe, for several arts festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Singapore, as with other ASEAN countries,\r\n\r\nhas  a  national  ASEAN COCI secretariat.   And  one  of  the\r\n\r\nobjectives of this secretariat, I believe, is to preserve and\r\n\r\nrevitalise  ASEAN  cultures.   I  hope  that  ASEAN  COCI  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  come  up with a flagship project  that  would\r\n\r\nhighlight ASEAN cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this brings me to my suggestion: can we not consider\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  a permanent cultural centre devoted  to  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncultures?   Such a cultural centre can be, to use the  phrase\r\n\r\nof  the  times,  a  one-stop centre  -  a  museum  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncultures  to  be  part  of  our  Asian  civilizations  museum\r\n\r\nnetwork,  a  theatre for performances by  ASEAN  artistes,  a\r\n\r\nconcert  hall  for musicians and so on.  Singaporeans,  young\r\n\r\nand old, as well as visitors to our island, can enjoy the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvibrancy  of  ASEAN cultures in Singapore.  I am looking,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, not at the centre only as a tourist attraction.  I am\r\n\r\nhoping  that  it can be a well funded centre that  will  help\r\n\r\nalso  in  documenting and encouraging scholarly  research  on\r\n\r\nASEAN cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can such a centre hope to achieve? First of all,\r\n\r\nthe  centre's  activities will be to  educate  and  entertain\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and visitors.  We have heard much about the lack\r\n\r\nof understanding among Singaporeans for our ASEAN neighbours.\r\n\r\nUnfairly or fairly, we are said to be xenophobic and tend  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  bit  smug towards our neighbours.  I believe a  centre\r\n\r\nlike  this would have great advantages.  It would be  a  good\r\n\r\nlearning experience for Singaporeans.  It would also  send  a\r\n\r\nsignal  to  our  ASEAN neighbours that we are  interested  in\r\n\r\nlearning about their cultures.  In so doing, we also increase\r\n\r\nthe  understanding  of  our people,  making  people-to-people\r\n\r\ncontacts  among  ASEAN countries much more pleasant  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  even  business  people may  find  understanding  our\r\n\r\nneighbours in the region a bit easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, such a centre can serve as a resource centre for\r\n\r\nASEAN  cultures,   promoting  the  idea  of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ncultural  hub for the ASEAN region.  Of course,  my  wish  is\r\n\r\nthat  all  other ASEAN neighbours will, in due course,  build\r\n\r\nsimilar  centres, so that we can all be networked  to  become\r\n\r\none.   But  until  that  time  comes,  we  can  endeavour  to\r\n\r\nestablish  ourselves as a strong resource  centre  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and finally, we might want to regard the centre\r\n\r\nas  a public statement of the commitment of Singapore to  the\r\n\r\nASEAN region, ie, our ASEAN peoples living together in a zone\r\n\r\nof  peace, neutrality and harmony.  I hope that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill consider such a centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have\r\n\r\nread an article in which the author wrote about his stay with\r\n\r\nhis  friend in the countryside.  His friend was a blind  man.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay there, every morning, he and his friend would\r\n\r\ntake a walk at the woods nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne  day  when  he came back from the walk, his friend  asked\r\n\r\nhim,  \"Did  you  have any new discovery in the woods  today?\"\r\n\r\nThe  author  replied, \"No.  Isn't everything  the  same  here\r\n\r\nevery  day?\"   His  blind friend was very  surprised  by  his\r\n\r\nreply.   He said, \"How could it be?  Did you not notice  that\r\n\r\nyesterday's  flower buds are in full bloom today?   The  wild\r\n\r\nstrawberries  are giving out the fragrance  of  ripeness.   I\r\n\r\nthink  they must have ripened.\"  The author was shocked  when\r\n\r\nhe  heard what his friend had said.  His blind friend  seemed\r\n\r\nto  have  seen more than he did.  Although they  had  a  walk\r\n\r\ntogether, the effect was quite different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the principle is very simple. Very often, we\r\n\r\nlook  but see not what is around us.  Our sensibility is  not\r\n\r\nas  acute as the blind man.  We have eyes, but we do not  pay\r\n\r\nattention  to  what we see.  We can only feel that  there  is\r\n\r\npressure  from  our work and we have forgotten  the  pleasure\r\n\r\nthat we can derive from mother nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should spend more time to promote more cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  to  widen  our scope and  to  let  us  enjoy  the\r\n\r\npleasure  in life.  Let the melodies and musical  notes  open\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  in  our  soul, so that we can really  enjoy  life.\r\n\r\nCultural activities will not only make us relax but also give\r\n\r\nus a better harmony and balance in our life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when I was young, I watched a lot of\r\n\r\nshows put up by the children's drama groups, eg, a musical by\r\n\r\nthe  name  of \"Tiny Screwdriver\" left an indelible impression\r\n\r\non  me,  and  I learned about our traditional values  through\r\n\r\nthese performances.  Therefore, now that we have done well in\r\n\r\nour  economic development, we should spend more resources  to\r\n\r\npopularise cultural activities among our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a breakthrough in the\r\n\r\npromotion  of culture and arts in Singapore.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  already  made  great efforts to  build  up  a  \"cultural\r\n\r\ngarden\".   We  are no longer a cultural desert.   However,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  on this basis, the Government should finance  and\r\n\r\nsupport  our  cultural organisations  so  that  they  can  do\r\n\r\nbetter.  I also hope that the National Arts Council and  MITA\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring  arts  and  culture to our working place  so  that  our\r\n\r\nworkers   will  have  the  chance  to  enjoy  some   artistic\r\n\r\nperformances.   The NTUC spends about $80,000 every  year  to\r\n\r\nsponsor some 20 cultural activities for our workers, but that\r\n\r\nis  not  enough.  I hope that the NAC and MITA would consider\r\n\r\nencouraging  and financing more arts groups  to  bring  their\r\n\r\nactivities  to reach out to the workers.  Perhaps  we  should\r\n\r\nalso  give  discounts  on concert admission  tickets  to  our\r\n\r\nworkers,  like what we do to our SAF personnel, so  that  our\r\n\r\nworkers  would have more opportunities to enjoy  the  various\r\n\r\ncultural performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that when these cultural bodies are putting\r\n\r\nup  their  performances, they could  perhaps  set  aside  one\r\n\r\nspecial  show for the workers.  I also hope that our cultural\r\n\r\norganisations  would consider putting up some  not  so  heavy\r\n\r\nperformances for our workers to appreciate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, we are fortunate that many of our\r\n\r\narts  groups  are  given help in many ways by  MITA  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  National  Arts  Council.   The   two   main\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  local  arts groups were  that  they  did  not\r\n\r\nreceive  financial  assistance and that the  cost  of  having\r\n\r\ntheir own building premises was too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first problem has been partly alleviated by\r\n\r\nboth  Government and the private sector joining hands to help\r\n\r\nthem.  It shows that many of our arts groups have gone on  to\r\n\r\nbigger productions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second common complaint by our arts groups has been\r\n\r\nthat  they do not have their own buildings.  A home  is  very\r\n\r\ncritical  for arts groups.  It helps them keep their  members\r\n\r\nand  audiences,  and creates a bond between  them.   It  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  remove  any  uncertainty, particularly  among  new\r\n\r\nmembers  joining these groups, where it will be in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun.   It  also  gives  them a certain sense  of  permanence.\r\n\r\nHere,  the National Arts Council has helped through the  Arts\r\n\r\nHousing  Scheme.   Through the scheme,  one  gets  space  for\r\n\r\ntraining,  practise peformance, administration  and  storage.\r\n\r\nThe NAC identifies suitable Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuildings  and convert these spaces to house arts groups  and\r\n\r\norganisations at subsidised rental.  I understand that as  at\r\n\r\nend  1998, the NAC had managed 17 buildings and 10  units  of\r\n\r\nshophouses, housing 49 arts organisations, 26 visual artistes\r\n\r\nand  two arts institutions, including NAFA and LaSalle  under\r\n\r\nthe Arts Housing Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to ask the Minister is: have we\r\n\r\ndone  enough?  I would like to ask the Minister  whether  his\r\n\r\nMinistry could do more.  An innovative scheme was thought  of\r\n\r\nwhen  some  of  the arts groups were co-located  in  two  new\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, namely, Marine Parade and Ulu Pandan  CCs.\r\n\r\nCan  we  also work out a scheme whereby all arts  groups  who\r\n\r\nwish to be co-located at an existing community club or a  new\r\n\r\ncommunity  club  can  register  themselves  either  with  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association or with the National Arts Council?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  such a coordination already in place?  If not, can  we\r\n\r\nestablish such a form of coordination so that arts groups can\r\n\r\nlet know their intention that they are looking for a place?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask how can MITA facilitate\r\n\r\nand  encourage  even  the private sector  to  co-locate  arts\r\n\r\ngroups within their buildings.  Here, Creative Technology has\r\n\r\nshown  a  fine  example by offering $2 million  and  offering\r\n\r\n12,000 sq ft of space at its headquarters building to be used\r\n\r\nfor  multi-cultural theatre training.  We must find new  ways\r\n\r\nfor  our  arts  groups to be housed not only  in  old  vacant\r\n\r\nbuildings  but  in new buildings as well.  Grants  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to such groups who are prepared to co-locate in  these\r\n\r\nnew  buildings,  be they from the Government or  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  For the private sector, perhaps incentives could  be\r\n\r\ngiven   whereby  selective  property  tax  and  other  monies\r\n\r\nexpended  for  the arts groups' housing should be  considered\r\n\r\nfor  tax  deductions to further promote this idea of  housing\r\n\r\nthe  arts groups.  Would the Minister share with us the steps\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Ministry to provide housing  for  local  arts\r\n\r\ngroups?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday, we are debating the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallocation for the Ministry of Information and the Arts,  but\r\n\r\neverybody is talking about money.  So \"Money Not Enough\"   is\r\n\r\nnot  just a problem for the lower income group, it is also  a\r\n\r\nproblem for our arts groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Chairman of the GPC. The Government is\r\n\r\ngiving more money for sports but certainly not enough for the\r\n\r\narts.   Our  Minister for Education said  that  we  want  our\r\n\r\nstudents  to  be thinking, and able to appreciate  the  arts.\r\n\r\nBut  with  all this emphasis on sports and so little  on  the\r\n\r\narts,  our  students may grow up to be physically strong  but\r\n\r\nmentally  simple.   I  think the most  practical  way  is  to\r\n\r\npractise  what  we  have preached.  Creative  Technology  has\r\n\r\ndonated  $2  million  for the promotion  of  arts.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nlaudable deed.  The Government should take the lead and  give\r\n\r\nmore  money to MITA.  Then it will inspire the private sector\r\n\r\nto  follow  suit.   Sim Wong Hoo's gesture  is  a  very  good\r\n\r\nexample.  The media has given it good coverage.  He is giving\r\n\r\nback  to  society  what  he  has  benefited  from  it.    The\r\n\r\nsuccessful entrepreneurs should also do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, MITA presented commendation awards to\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs who donated $50,000 or more to  the  arts.   If\r\n\r\nyou  have only donated $49,999 it is not good enough.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  if  you  have donated $50,000 or more,  then  you  will\r\n\r\nreceive  an  award.  From this year onwards, so long  as  you\r\n\r\ndonate  more  than $10,000 you will receive  a  commendation.\r\n\r\nThere are many successful businessmen in Singapore. Let  them\r\n\r\ndonate whatever amount they so wish to donate.  Even if it is\r\n\r\na few thousand dollars, we should also commend them for that.\r\n\r\nI hope MITA will seriously look into this matter and give the\r\n\r\narts groups the support they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from recognising the sponsors, we should also\r\n\r\nrecognise the performing artistes. They sacrifice their  time\r\n\r\nand  energy  and  even money to present  their  arts  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   For  most art bodies, we have not  given  them  due\r\n\r\nrecognition.  So in order to encourage more performing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroups  and artistes, we should give them more space so  that\r\n\r\nthey can perform in better facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Istana is open to the public a few\r\n\r\ntimes  in a year and a great number of members of the  public\r\n\r\nhave  been visiting it.  But on every occasion, we  saw  just\r\n\r\nschool  or  military bands playing music.   Why  can  we  not\r\n\r\ninvite  more local artistes to perform there?  In  fact,  our\r\n\r\nperforming groups should be very happy to be given the honour\r\n\r\nto  perform at the Istana.  Every year, we have this National\r\n\r\nDay Rally and every year we have just an orchestra performing\r\n\r\na few pieces of music there.  Why  can we not also invite the\r\n\r\nlocal artistes to perform there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this cut, I would like to talk about money too.\r\n\r\nCable  TV  has reached almost all the families in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  can now tune in to a lot of channels.  When any important\r\n\r\nevent   is  happening,  we can switch  from  one  channel  to\r\n\r\nanother channel to follow the coverage.  For example, at  the\r\n\r\nCountdown  to the New Millennium, our Singapore  viewers  had\r\n\r\nthe  chance  to  view the various events taking  place  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of countries in the world. Now our audience  can  say\r\n\r\nthe  programme in one country is more exciting than  that  in\r\n\r\nanother country.  The audience can  turn from one  channel to\r\n\r\nanother  channel at ease.  According to a survey,  viewership\r\n\r\nfor TCS programmes is declining, not significantly, but there\r\n\r\nis some slight decline in viewership.  Our audience has now a\r\n\r\ngreater variety of programmes to choose from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past one or two years, TCS has spent a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney  on recreational programmes,  but there is still a  lot\r\n\r\nof room for improvement in its current affairs programmes.  I\r\n\r\nthink we should do better in this aspect.  In current affairs\r\n\r\nand  arts, our programmes are still lagging behind the  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  So, the opening of Cable TV is a good thing.   It\r\n\r\nbrings   competition.  The question is whether the Government\r\n\r\nwould  allot  more money to TCS to enable  it   to  send  our\r\n\r\njournalists to other countries to make more detailed reports,\r\n\r\nas it is done by the TV stations in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  countries.

The TV media  here  are  thus\r\n\r\nalmost monopolised by either the Government-linked company or\r\n\r\nSCV.   Is  this  situation desirable?  And does  it  not  run\r\n\r\ncounter to the principle of market economy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sitting of Parliament on 21st March 1995,\r\n\r\nMITA's  Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government  has\r\n\r\nto  be  certain that it will be economically viable before  a\r\n\r\nlicence  is given to another commercial TV station.  He  also\r\n\r\nsaid that the SBA will monitor the industry to determine when\r\n\r\nthe  market should be liberalised.   I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  the time is ripe now to allow  another  TV\r\n\r\nstation to be set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of foreign TV station programmes, currently\r\n\r\nit  has  to  be carried by SCV's cable.  Would the Government\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing foreign broadcasting stations to broadcast\r\n\r\ndirectly into households?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the new millennium saw our\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  group  restructuring its various  TV  Channels  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a new look, a new image and to meet the competition.\r\n\r\nThis is a laudable move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV12 has restructured its existing channels (Prime and\r\n\r\nPremiere)  to  a fully Malay Channel (Suria)  and  one  niche\r\n\r\nchannel concentrating on children and arts programmes as well\r\n\r\nas   Indian  programmes  (Central).   Sports  programmes   on\r\n\r\nPremiere  have  now moved to a new channel called  SportsCity\r\n\r\nunder  TCS.  Channel NewsAsia, which recently celebrated  its\r\n\r\nfirst anniversary,  is now expected to go regional before the\r\n\r\nend of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increased segmentation and specialised focus of\r\n\r\nthe  various  channels  allow  them  to  cater  to  different\r\n\r\ninterest groups, reflecting our multi-racial society and  the\r\n\r\ndiffering  needs  of different age groups. MediaCorp  has  no\r\n\r\nchoice.   Unless  it constantly changes and  moves  with  the\r\n\r\ntimes, it will lose out to SCV and other foreign TV channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, restructuring is one thing. Equally, if not more\r\n\r\nimportant,  is  the  need  to recruit,  motivate  and  retain\r\n\r\ntalents  within the MediaCorp Group.  On this  aspect,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned whether MediaCorp is ready to compete on  an  equal\r\n\r\nfooting with the foreign broadcast media.  In the last  year,\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen the departure of several big name broadcasters\r\n\r\nand  artistes like Christine Tan, Darryl David, James Lye and\r\n\r\nthe impending departure of Lynette Tye from Channel NewsAsia.\r\n\r\nAnd  recently, we read about the resignation of  TCS'  former\r\n\r\nCEO, Lee Cheok Yew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to be effective, competitive and relevant,\r\n\r\nI  would like to suggest that the current HR policies  within\r\n\r\nthe  MediaCorp group be reviewed.  This is in order  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  ensure that with all the best laid plans such as Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia's  intention to go regional, we  would  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinually  attract and retain the best talents  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthis goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.     Sir, for MediaCorp to succeed in the long term, it  has\r\n\r\nto  quickly address its manpower problem.  Unless it is  able\r\n\r\nto recruit, motivate and retain talents in the group, it will\r\n\r\nlose  out.   I would therefore like to ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nplans  MediaCorp  has  to  meet  its  challenges  ahead,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, its HR policies to attract, motivate  and  retain\r\n\r\ntalents in the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, 30th January 2000 saw the relaunch of\r\n\r\ntwo  existing channels and the introduction of a new channel,\r\n\r\nnamely,  Suria, Central and SportsCity.  Last year,  we  also\r\n\r\nsaw  the  launch of Channel NewsAsia. These are new and  bold\r\n\r\ninitiatives  of TCS and the Media Corporation  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFirst, let me deal with the topic of Channel NewsAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am impressed with the quality of Channel NewsAsia\r\n\r\nprogrammes in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreporting.   It has certainly kept many Singaporeans  updated\r\n\r\non  local  and  international developments,  particularly  on\r\n\r\nregional  developments.  Sir, my only complaint is, how  long\r\n\r\nare  they going to keep their broadcast on Channel 5?  In the\r\n\r\nmornings  between 6 am and 9 am, it gets boring to watch  the\r\n\r\nsame news being repeated on Channel NewsAsia between 6 am and\r\n\r\n9  am.  One cannot get away from them if we switch to Channel\r\n\r\n5.   While  I  understand the original rationale   that  some\r\n\r\nSingaporean  homes could not access CNN, it has continued  to\r\n\r\nslot  on  Channel 5 for far too long.  I long for a breakfast\r\n\r\nprogramme  like AM Singapore on Channel 5, and I  also  think\r\n\r\nthere  could  be  better use of broadcast in the  morning  on\r\n\r\nChannel 5.  I hope this could be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the new Channel, which is Central.\r\n\r\nThere  are three slots here.  The first slot belongs to  Arts\r\n\r\nCentral.  I get good reviews on Arts Central because  it  has\r\n\r\ngot a good programme mix and is well received by arts lovers.\r\n\r\nIn  trying to meet the needs of three segments, MCS has  tied\r\n\r\nits hand with strict time slots.  Arts Central was originally\r\n\r\nscheduled  from  9.30 pm  to 1 am.  It  was  tough  for  arts\r\n\r\nlovers  which  include students too.  Many  of  them  carried\r\n\r\nheavy  eye bags under their eyes.  Sir, I am happy  that  the\r\n\r\ntime  slots  have been brought earlier to 9  pm.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nworrying  is  that instead of restricting arts programmes  to\r\n\r\nbetween 9 pm and 1 am, is it possible that some of these arts\r\n\r\nprogrammes  be  shown  on earlier time slots  when  there  is\r\n\r\nbroadcast time, and even shifted to SportsCity whenever there\r\n\r\nare no sports programmes being shown on SportsCity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to Vasantham Central, which caters to\r\n\r\nIndian audience.  Sir, originally the time slot was from 7 pm\r\n\r\nto  9.30  pm, and now it has become from 6.30 pm to 9  pm  on\r\n\r\nweekdays.  The quality of the programmes has improved and  it\r\n\r\nis  heartening  to see more local productions and  children's\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Sir, the feedback I receive is the concern  over\r\n\r\nthe  allotment  of  time for Tamil and non-Tamil  programmes.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  fear that slowly more non-Tamil programmes  are\r\n\r\ncoming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  Vasantham Central.  Perhaps the Minister can allay  the\r\n\r\nfear  by  explaining what is the proportion of time  that  is\r\n\r\nallocated  for Tamil and non-Tamil programmes.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister could also disclose the viewership numbers for these\r\n\r\ntwo types of programmes.  If there is indeed a programme from\r\n\r\nthe  non-Indians  for movies like Hindi  movies  and  dramas,\r\n\r\nwould the Minister consider removing this slot to Suria where\r\n\r\nat  present  there is no broadcast before 5 pm  on  weekdays?\r\n\r\nTwo groups of audience can enjoy these programmes if they are\r\n\r\nput on other channels provided a dual sound broadcast is also\r\n\r\nprovided.   Two groups of people can also enjoy on these time\r\n\r\nslots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to Kids Central. Sir, I think it\r\n\r\nhas  got a good programming slot and meets the needs  of  our\r\n\r\nkids,  whether they are from the morning or afternoon  school\r\n\r\nsessions.  What  I  hope  to  see is  more  local  children's\r\n\r\nproductions and live broadcast of children's events from  our\r\n\r\nschools on large scale community events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me move on to SportsCity. It has\r\n\r\nclearly  satisfied  the needs of many ardent  sports  lovers.\r\n\r\nMany  of us who are sports lovers are happy to see more local\r\n\r\nevents  on  competition being broadcast live  on  television,\r\n\r\nlike  the  S-League games.  I certainly hope that more  local\r\n\r\nevents  can  be  shown  more  regularly  on  SportsCity,   if\r\n\r\npossible, live on TV.  This will certainly raise the  profile\r\n\r\nof  our  local sportsmen and motivate many others to take  up\r\n\r\nsports seriously.   Perhaps the Minister can tell us how  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  intends  to ensure a substantial  number  of  local\r\n\r\nsports programme content and what is the future direction for\r\n\r\nSportsCity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Programme Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  (PAC) has once again completed its review  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  TV  programmes and released its  report  recently.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  most of its recommendations and  I  applaud  the\r\n\r\nCommittee for its efforts.  In particular, I agree  with  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  that  our  locally  produced  TV  programmes\r\n\r\nshould  reflect  more of our multi-racial representation  and\r\n\r\nthat imported TV programmes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  be biased towards American-produced  programmes.\r\n\r\nInstead   we   should  source  more  programmes  from   other\r\n\r\ncountries,  so  that  our  citizens  would  not   be   unduly\r\n\r\ninfluenced by any one culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am, however, not entirely convinced by the PAC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation that there appears too much violent content as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the promotion of negative values on prime time  TV.\r\n\r\nThe  report  cited prime time programmes such  as  Buffy  the\r\n\r\nVampire Slayer and Charm amongst others.  Many young people I\r\n\r\nspoke  to disagree with the PAC.  They enjoy programmes  like\r\n\r\nCharm  and  Buffy the Vampire Slayer for their  entertainment\r\n\r\nvalue.   Frankly, I believe that Singaporeans today are  more\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan  and are more mature to handle  and  distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween entertainment and real life.  Indeed, a quick channel\r\n\r\ncheck of Channel 8 shows that many programmes on Channel 8 as\r\n\r\nwell   involve  horror,  ghosts,  gangsterism  and  violence,\r\n\r\nalthough  they are so called Asian content programmes.   They\r\n\r\ntoo have good entertainment values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, TCS has a difficult task. It has to stay\r\n\r\ncommercially viable, as well as relevant to our own  citizens\r\n\r\nwho have increasing access to alternative channels or mediums\r\n\r\nfor  entertainment including the Internet and cable TV.   TCS\r\n\r\nalso  has a critical role to serve in national education  and\r\n\r\ninformation.   I would like to suggest that we  should  grant\r\n\r\nthem  as  much flexibility in their choice of programming  as\r\n\r\npossible  so  that  they  can  continue  to  be  relevant  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and to Singaporeans as a whole.  They  would  then\r\n\r\ncontinue to be an effective medium for national interests  as\r\n\r\nwell.   I  therefore would like to ask the  Minister  if  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  agrees  with  the  PAC's recommendations  and  what\r\n\r\nfollow-up actions will the Ministry take as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the past few\r\n\r\nyears,  there has been remarkable improvement in the standard\r\n\r\nof Chinese programmes produced by TCS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany  TV  programmes have won not only the praises  from  the\r\n\r\naudience but many international awards as well.  This is very\r\n\r\nheartening indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our media are different from other countries because\r\n\r\nthey have to take into consideration the multi-racial, multi-lingual  and  multi-cultural characteristics of our  society,\r\n\r\napart  from  keeping  a high sense of social  responsibility.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  constraints, TCS is still able to  maintain  its\r\n\r\ncredibility  by not simply lowering its taste to  please  the\r\n\r\npublic,   and  has  even  managed  to  produce  some  quality\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  This is indeed very remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from producing a number of TV serials with\r\n\r\nlocal  flavour such as Stepping Out, they also produced  some\r\n\r\nvery good current affairs and informative programmes, such as\r\n\r\nCultural  Escapades,  Asia  - A  New  Horizon,  The  Forensic\r\n\r\nDetectives, Tuesday Features, Focus, etc.  They are very good\r\n\r\nand  have received good comments from the audience.  They are\r\n\r\ninformative and interesting, commanding very high viewership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Seng Han Thong has said, there are a lot of\r\n\r\nchannels and a lot of programmes available to the viewers.  I\r\n\r\nhope that TCS could reinforce our current affairs section, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be  able to produce more excellent  Chinese\r\n\r\ninformative programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for recreational programmes, I feel that so long as\r\n\r\nMITA  can  give  TCS  more  flexibility  to  purchase  better\r\n\r\nprogrammes  from  other countries, that is enough.   But  for\r\n\r\ncurrent affairs, they must have high credibility.  They  have\r\n\r\nto  take into consideration our neutral position.  We have to\r\n\r\nput  in  more  money and more human resources to improve  the\r\n\r\nquality and quantity of our current affairs programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the locally-produced Chinese programmes, there is\r\n\r\nanother  aspect  that we should pay particular attention  to,\r\n\r\nthat is, the children's programmes.  I am glad to notice that\r\n\r\nin  recent years, TCS has also attained some breakthrough  in\r\n\r\nthe children's programmes. For example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are a number of very good children's programmes  which\r\n\r\nare  very  popular.   My children are faithful  followers  of\r\n\r\nthese  programmes.  TCS should produce more  such  programmes\r\n\r\nthat   are   educational  and  appealing  to  the   children.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  they  will  pull the  children  away  from  over-indulgence in computer games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nfind ways to increase the time allocated to the broadcast  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary debates.  I do so because, first, Parliament is\r\n\r\na  key  institution in debating the important issues  of  the\r\n\r\nday.  Second, many MPs, including PAP backbenchers, make good\r\n\r\nspeeches  and  deserve to be heard and they play  a  role  in\r\n\r\nraising important questions and suggestions.  And thirdly, in\r\n\r\nthe making and understanding of public policy and law, it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  not only to know the final results  but  also  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  and even what has not been fully accepted.   The\r\n\r\npresent coverage gives too little time for this.  All we  get\r\n\r\nare  the answers.  It is like watching a football match  with\r\n\r\njust the goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a Straits Times' journalist pondered whether\r\n\r\n10  days were necessary for this Budget debate.  I believe it\r\n\r\nis.  And as we all know, we move at a very brisk pace to keep\r\n\r\nit to 10 days.  Many other parliaments take much longer.  But\r\n\r\nI  cannot  help but consider whether the public  understands.\r\n\r\nCan  they understand why we take a whole day or afternoon for\r\n\r\na  sitting, when all they get is 15 minutes of the compressed\r\n\r\nanswers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to consider more air time. It\r\n\r\nshould  not be live; it should be edited down.  But it should\r\n\r\nbe  substantial enough to capture the exchanges, the mood and\r\n\r\nthe discussions.  Of course, this may be a minority interest.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is an important minority of open and active citizens\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  public  issues.  The  means  for  this  can\r\n\r\ndiffer.   We  now  have  a  full time news  channel,  Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia,   with  a  one-hour  news.   There  is   increasing\r\n\r\npenetration  of  cable  and this gives  many  more  channels.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  now web-casting of what could  otherwise  be\r\n\r\ntelevised.

It is now known as the news channel  of\r\n\r\nquality and fair reporting, presenting not just a Singaporean\r\n\r\nviewpoint but also an Asian viewpoint.  The coverage of major\r\n\r\nevents  is  timely  and  balanced.  The  success  of  Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia  has strengthened Singapore's position  as  a  media\r\n\r\nhub.  I congratulate the management and staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to make a suggestion\r\n\r\nconcerning the one-hour news broadcast which, to many,  seems\r\n\r\na  bit  too long.  For most of us, we are interested  in  the\r\n\r\nnews  itself  and  not so much the analyses and  discussions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps MITA can advise Channel NewsAsia to reformat the one-hour  news to a half-an-hour news, followed by a second  half\r\n\r\nhour devoted to more in-depth discussions and analyses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel NewsAsia plans to launch the Asia service by\r\n\r\nsatellite  later this year.  Many of our business  community,\r\n\r\nespecially those who travel often, will welcome this service.\r\n\r\nBut  the  question is: why limit the broadcast to Asia?   Why\r\n\r\nnot  extend this service to the other countries?  In view  of\r\n\r\nChannel  NewsAsia's  success, is there any  plan  to  have  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  broadcast  also in Chinese?   Many  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nbusiness  community who are unable to understand English  are\r\n\r\ncurrently unable to enjoy the benefits of this news  channel.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, perhaps some Chinese subtitles could be used\r\n\r\nto help the Chinese-speaking community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I go on to the next amendment, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Thank you. Sir, over the years, TCS has\r\n\r\nproduced  many artistes; however, a substantial  number  have\r\n\r\nleft.   When  they left TCS, I believe they left the  station\r\n\r\nbut  not  their acting career.  But, unfortunately, our  film\r\n\r\nindustry is still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall.  Ex-TCS artistes have to take up other jobs to earn  a\r\n\r\nliving.  This is a waste of good acting talent, especially in\r\n\r\nthe context of our limited manpower and talent pool.  We have\r\n\r\ntoday  a  substantial  pool of acting talent  and  supporting\r\n\r\ntechnicians  to support a film industry.  We  have  also  the\r\n\r\nfinancial resources to develop Singapore as a film centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Film Commission was formed in 1998 in\r\n\r\nresponse to the rapidly growing local film industry.  Some of\r\n\r\nour  local  productions have been well received  locally  and\r\n\r\noverseas.   The Commission helps to facilitate 12 productions\r\n\r\nin the past years through grants.  The first locally produced\r\n\r\n3-D  animation, Rex-2000, The Young Heroes, has high  quality\r\n\r\nanimation  and  an interesting story line.  We therefore  now\r\n\r\nhave the capability and the capacity to develop Singapore  as\r\n\r\na 3-D animation centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, film making is an expensive business, but it is a\r\n\r\nhigh value-added industry.  MITA should work closely with EDB\r\n\r\nto provide attractive grants and incentives to encourage more\r\n\r\nlocal   productions.

Many\r\n\r\napplications  have  to be filled and submitted  to  different\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.  Would MITA consider setting up a one-stop  service  centre  where movie  production  houses  could\r\n\r\nsubmit  all the relevant applications for permits, and  MITA,\r\n\r\nwith its efficient staff, help to get fast clearance with the\r\n\r\nother relevant agencies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the Singapore film industry is\r\n\r\nmaking  a  comeback.  A number of production houses and  film\r\n\r\nmakers  have increased manifold.  With the recent success  of\r\n\r\nfilms like Money No Enough, Liang Po Po, That One Not Enough,\r\n\r\nmore  companies  and  individuals are  looking  at  the  film\r\n\r\nindustry  seriously.

Are we producing the necessary  actors,\r\n\r\ndirectors, production technicians, sound engineers and  other\r\n\r\nsupport  staff?  If not, are we liberal in admitting  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent to supplement these talents?

Is the  EDB\r\n\r\nactively working with MITA on this score?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, the Singapore Film Commission was set up\r\n\r\nin  1998 under the National Arts Council.

I would like the Minister to explain  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  as to how the Singapore Film Commission has gone about\r\n\r\nfulfilling  its  mission  to-date.   I  also  would  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to share with us his Ministry's programmes and plans\r\n\r\nfor  the film industry in Singapore and answers to the  above\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, in view of the greater\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the news media and its impact on our  local\r\n\r\nprint media, I have a few concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that our local print media, ie, our\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  are driven by commercial interests as  they  are\r\n\r\nowned  by a publicly listed company.  In view of the scarcity\r\n\r\nof  resources in a small country like Singapore,  it  appears\r\n\r\nthat, with increasing regionalisation and global competition,\r\n\r\nit  is  inevitable that our local print media  will  have  to\r\n\r\npromote  entertainment and more coverage of populist  stories\r\n\r\nin its newspapers in order to sustain readership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern stems from the fact that as the industry\r\n\r\nconsolidates and we open up to the world, our local media may\r\n\r\nbe  tempted  to  neglect its nation-building role.   If  they\r\n\r\ncontinue  to play that role, will they succeed or be  dwarfed\r\n\r\nby the major competition from the big boys?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that if they are perceived to be mere\r\n\r\nmouthpieces  channelling  official press  releases  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they  would  suffer a credibility  gap  and  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  would  simply  shift to  more  accessible  Internet\r\n\r\nchannels  or  other cable stations for their news.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister if there are indeed plans to ensure\r\n\r\nthat our local print media, ie, our newspapers, will continue\r\n\r\nto  remain  relevant and to play an effective nation-building\r\n\r\nrole.   Or  are  there other viable alternatives  should  our\r\n\r\nlocal  newspapers embark on pure commercialisation, in  order\r\n\r\nto remain competitive in the future?

I understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  Library there is very popular now and that the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary Board will continue to try out new strategies to make\r\n\r\nour library services useful and accessible to all age groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the proposed Budget, some $86 million is\r\n\r\nallocated  for current expenditure and another  $101  million\r\n\r\nfor  development  expenditure under  the  Library  programme.\r\n\r\nDevelopment expenditure shows a five-time increase  over  the\r\n\r\nestimated   development  expenditure  for  the  current   FY.\r\n\r\nPresumably,  a large portion of this development  expenditure\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearmarked for the new National Library.

For example,  are\r\n\r\nthere  plans  to  improve accessibility such as  through  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    One   network   or   through   our   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I wish to speak\r\n\r\non  neighbourhood libraries.  I have spoken on  this  subject\r\n\r\nbefore.   After  I  have mooted this idea in Parliament  some\r\n\r\nyears  back, I noted that not long after, such a library  was\r\n\r\nbuilt  in the Prime Minister's constituency at Marine  Parade\r\n\r\nGRC.   The point is why such a neighbourhood library  can  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in the Prime Minister's constituency but such  similar\r\n\r\nlibraries cannot be set up in other constituencies.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  it is not a case of favouritism.  Is it because  Marine\r\n\r\nParade is the Prime Minister's constituency that it is  given\r\n\r\npreference  of  having  such  a  useful  facility  and  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies are deprived of them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I brought up this question of building such a\r\n\r\nlibrary  in Potong Pasir, the then Minister, Dr Seet Ai  Mee,\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there were libraries already built at  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nCentral and the children in my constituency could take  buses\r\n\r\nto  get there.  If that is so easy, why build a neighbourhood\r\n\r\nlibrary  at  Marine Parade constituency?  Why did  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  accede to the request of the grassroots leaders  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a neighbourhood library in his constituency?  Why  did\r\n\r\nhe  not  ask the children there to take a bus to  go  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity library or some other library in that area?  He did\r\n\r\nnot  do that and went ahead to build a neighbourhood library.\r\n\r\nBecause the Prime Minister knows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  is important that libraries must be built close  to\r\n\r\nthe  homes  of  the  children.  The library  must  be  easily\r\n\r\naccessible  and within walking distance of their  home.   The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister knows that for young children to take a bus to\r\n\r\nthe  central  or  regional  library  is  time-consuming,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  even  risky.  The round trip may  take  about  one\r\n\r\nhour.   In  that  one  hour,  children  can  do  homework  or\r\n\r\nsomething  useful at home.  Travelling by bus and walking  in\r\n\r\npublic   roads  may  be  dangerous  to  unescorted  children,\r\n\r\nespecially  female children.  If they are unlucky,  a  female\r\n\r\nchild may meet a molester.  Children can also be knocked down\r\n\r\nby  careless drivers.  Therefore, it is not preferable to ask\r\n\r\nchildren  to  go to a library which may be a  long  way  from\r\n\r\ntheir homes.  But it is better to bring the library nearer to\r\n\r\nwhere the children live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building of neighbourhood libraries is within the\r\n\r\nfinancial  means  of the Government.  The  Government  enjoys\r\n\r\nbudget surpluses every year and its coffers are bulging  with\r\n\r\nfunds.   What a neighbourhood library needs is about a  floor\r\n\r\nspace of about 3,000 square feet, walled up and tiled at  the\r\n\r\nvoid  deck.  There must also be sanitary facility.  The  rest\r\n\r\nof   the   job  could  be  left  to  the  residents  of   the\r\n\r\nconstituency.   I  am certain residents in  the  constituency\r\n\r\nshall  be happy to help out to furnish the library with books\r\n\r\nand furniture if they are asked to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am calling not only for such a neighbourhood\r\n\r\nlibrary  to be built in my constituency at Potong Pasir,  but\r\n\r\nin  every constituency which does not have one at the moment.\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  libraries  are educational  tools.   They  are\r\n\r\nnecessary to teach children to read at an early age.  In this\r\n\r\nway,  more future citizens shall learn to read and be  better\r\n\r\nequipped for the knowledge-based economy.  Marine Parade  GRC\r\n\r\nhas one such library.  I cannot see why the Government cannot\r\n\r\nprovide other constituencies with such facilities.  Money  is\r\n\r\nnot a problem.  In fact, the Government's reluctance to build\r\n\r\na  neighbourhood  library  in  every  constituency  is  going\r\n\r\nagainst its own policy in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  21  vision and the new economy.   I  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to delay any further but to go ahead and build\r\n\r\nat least one neighbourhood library in every constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,  I declare that I am a member of the Advisory  Council\r\n\r\non  TCS on Chinese Programmes.  It is in that capacity in the\r\n\r\nlast  two years that I realised how many Singaporeans watched\r\n\r\ntelevision and how important it can be as an educational tool\r\n\r\nfor families and children.  For example, 900,000 Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwatched the last episode of Stepping Out, a 30-chapter  drama\r\n\r\ndocumentary serial on the successes and failures of Singapore\r\n\r\nmigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember clearly what Mr Wijeysingha, the former\r\n\r\nPrincipal  of Raffles Institution, once said, that television\r\n\r\nis  not  a  bad thing.  As long as adults are watching  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  with their children, there is less  fear  of  the\r\n\r\nnegative impact of some of the programmes because parents can\r\n\r\ntake  the opportunity to moderate the influence by discussion\r\n\r\nand  guidance.   It is therefore an important  task  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  continually review, support and strengthen  not\r\n\r\njust the entertainment element, but the educational value  of\r\n\r\ntelevision.   More resources could be committed to  importing\r\n\r\nand  developing  good programmes locally and internationally.\r\n\r\nI  support  the call by Mr Chew Heng Ching and  Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to raise another aspect of television as\r\n\r\npublic  education.   I  was  most  impressed  by  the  latest\r\n\r\ncommercial series put up by the Ministry of Defence.  It  was\r\n\r\ntheir  \"Total  Defence\" campaign which ran  over  two  weeks,\r\n\r\nusing  five  different versions of 15-second TV  commercials.\r\n\r\nThe messages were captured in a powerful visual that educates\r\n\r\nand  communicates to the public about the role  in  defending\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I congratulate the Ministry of Defence  for  this\r\n\r\nseries  of  brilliant commercial.  And I was  told  that  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  cost  $200,000 for a total number of  96  spots  in\r\n\r\nprime time as well as fringe time programmes.  I was also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformed that the Ministry paid the rates which apply  across\r\n\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of our concerns in doing social work is how do\r\n\r\nwe  reach  out  to the public with our messages,  how  do  we\r\n\r\ninform Singaporeans what voluntary welfare organisations  are\r\n\r\ndoing.  The situation resulted in a frustrating vicious cycle\r\n\r\nof  mismatch.   Good social service programmes are  available\r\n\r\nbut  they do not reach the kind of people who most need them.\r\n\r\nCould I propose that TCS allocate some slots of air-time  for\r\n\r\ncommunity  services to publicise their activities at  a  much\r\n\r\nsubsidised  rate as part of a national commitment  to  public\r\n\r\neducation?   I  know  MCD  had in  previous  years  committed\r\n\r\nresources to producing many good commercials, like the series\r\n\r\non  the  elderly people last year.  Sir, I am requesting  for\r\n\r\nfinancial support for similar initiatives to emerge from  the\r\n\r\npeople sector to complement the work of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways television air-time could be\r\n\r\nmaximised by VWOs.  They can extend their reach by using good\r\n\r\nvisuals  during  commercial  slots  in  prime  programmes  to\r\n\r\npresent   their  services,  spread  their  messages,  recruit\r\n\r\nvolunteers  and publicise their programmes.  All  these  will\r\n\r\nonly  add  to public awareness in an extremely cost effective\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I gather, if I were to buy into a programme,\r\n\r\nlet  us say, Growing Up which has a loading of 6.5 times,  it\r\n\r\ncosts me $6,500 for a 30-second commercial spot.   Rates  for\r\n\r\nbuying into the fringe programmes are much less.  But  if  we\r\n\r\nadd  up,  all this is still too much for VWOs.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the reach and frequency, we need a mix of prime  and\r\n\r\nfringe  programmes.  So I would urge the Ministry  to  really\r\n\r\nconsider  special rates for VWOs.  By lowering these charges,\r\n\r\nmore sponsors will be attracted to fund the commercial.  This\r\n\r\nis  apart  from talking about funding the production  of  the\r\n\r\ncommercial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of using television as an education tool,\r\n\r\nan  instrument for raising social awareness and  the  bonding\r\n\r\nprocess\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  community  must  be  apprised  within  the  overall\r\n\r\nobjective  of  building community understanding  by  matching\r\n\r\nservices  and  people's needs in the social  service  sector.\r\n\r\nThis is just one more suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

With our society being more open and  the\r\n\r\nadvent  of  information  technology, Internet  is   impacting\r\n\r\nheavily on our lifestyle. We know that it is not easy to curb\r\n\r\npornographic materials on the Internet and this has been  the\r\n\r\nconcern  of many countries.  However, we should try our  best\r\n\r\nto  control  the  undesirable materials  in  our  movies  and\r\n\r\nmagazines.  I  feel  that  our  censorship  is  getting   too\r\n\r\nliberalized now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this open society, people sometimes are so used to\r\n\r\nall  strange  happenings around them  that  they  are  simply\r\n\r\nimmune  to them.  As it is said that if you are in  a  smelly\r\n\r\ntoilet  for too long, we would be immune to the stench there.\r\n\r\nIt  would appear that I am the only MP speaking on censorship\r\n\r\nin this year's Budget debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am really too old-fashioned.  Notwithstanding that,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  know to what extent  will  censorship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  be liberalised and opened up?  Would the  lack  of\r\n\r\nstringent censorship influence the minds of our people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at the reports in Shin Min Daily News, a\r\n\r\nChinese  evening  press.  There are more and  more  cases  of\r\n\r\nmolesting, rapes and abandoning of babies and there is even a\r\n\r\nreport  of a very bold and uninhibited female who is  in  the\r\n\r\nhabit of walking around stark naked in her flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have become too liberalised in the censorship\r\n\r\ncriteria.  If you look at the newspapers, you can see  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  advertisements of R(A) movies, for example, \"Virgin of  8\r\n\r\nWonders\",  \"That's it\", \"Holy Smoke\", \"Downfall  Prostitute\",\r\n\r\n\"Women  Soup\",  \"Surrogate Woman\", etc.  Must we  allow  this\r\n\r\nkind of movies to flood our cinemas?  Why should we allow it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, I suggested to my children to go and watch the\r\n\r\nmovie  \"Shakespeare in Love\".  My children told me not to  go\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am an MP and that we should not be seen  watching\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  movie. It is a R(A) movie.   Since  when  has\r\n\r\nShakespeare been linked to a R(A) movie?  I insisted on going\r\n\r\nbecause  I  wanted  to know what kind of censorship  criteria\r\n\r\nMITA  was  adopting. In my view,  there were only two  scenes\r\n\r\nwhich  were  objectionable.  Have them cut and the story-line\r\n\r\nof  the movie would still be intact, and the R(A) movie could\r\n\r\neasily be re-classified as PG.  And there is one lecturer who\r\n\r\nshowed  me a children's magazine and he asked me why  such  a\r\n\r\nmagazine  which contains pornographic material is allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe circulated in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children are allowed to read such magazines. This\r\n\r\nis  a  great  puzzle  to  me.  In this  year's  Asian's  Film\r\n\r\nFestival,  we  have  got Asian pornographic  movies  and  the\r\n\r\nChinese readers' reaction is that these are no more than blue\r\n\r\nfilms under the disguise of art.  Therefore, although we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot control Internet, we would be able to control the kind\r\n\r\nof  films  to  be  shown here.  If we try our  best,  we  can\r\n\r\ncontrol  such  films.   I hope that MITA  can  look  at  this\r\n\r\nproblem  seriously.  We  should not  further  liberalise  our\r\n\r\ncensorship and I hope my views would be looked upon seriously\r\n\r\nby the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am urging the Government to\r\n\r\nprovide a systematic review of documents and information that\r\n\r\nit holds, with a view to releasing as much as possible to the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? I make this suggestion because (1) information is\r\n\r\nthe  life blood of the knowledge economy; (2) people need  to\r\n\r\nhave  better  information in order to evaluate decisions  and\r\n\r\nGovernment actions; (3) there is a danger otherwise  that  we\r\n\r\nbreed a culture of suspicion and secrecy; (4) there is a cost\r\n\r\nin  keeping  too  much  information secret;  and  (5)  timely\r\n\r\nrelease  will help foster greater understanding, transparency\r\n\r\nand accountability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that something will always need to be kept\r\n\r\nsecret.  But we cannot reach the situation in which the  only\r\n\r\nGovernment department paper that is not secret is the  toilet\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be grateful if the Government will consider\r\n\r\nsetting up such a system of review and release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, various reasons have\r\n\r\nbeen  cited  for restricting public use of satellite  dishes,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  control of content, censorship, prime time for  the\r\n\r\ncorportisation of TCS and for local broadcaster  to  compete,\r\n\r\nand  that satellite dishes are bulky and unsightly.  However,\r\n\r\nwith  the meteoric rise of the Internet, several factors have\r\n\r\nchanged.  First, the cabling of our nation has  led  to  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   having  broadband  access  to  the   Internet.\r\n\r\nImages, news reports, video clips and whole programmes can be\r\n\r\ndownloaded  and viewed on the Internet. To add  to  this,  we\r\n\r\nhave  wireless  access to the Internet from portable  devices\r\n\r\nsuch  as  3-G phones and WAP phones. All these mean  that  we\r\n\r\nhave the ability to view any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsite and any information that is on the world wide web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the technology has and will continue to\r\n\r\ntransform  the  ugly  duckling of the satellite  dishes  into\r\n\r\nincreasingly  smaller  versions.  While  this  has  made  the\r\n\r\nsatellite dishes more appealing in looks, technology has also\r\n\r\nmade  them  much  harder to detect and therefore,  harder  to\r\n\r\nmonitor and restrict.  In the light of these changes, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether the prohibition of satellite\r\n\r\ndishes  is  still necessary.  Is it time for  regulations  to\r\n\r\nchange to respond to a rapidly changing technology?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members for their comments\r\n\r\nand suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Jennifer Lee reminded us that\r\n\r\nPM  Goh  promised  more  funds to promote  the  arts  at  his\r\n\r\nNational Day Rally speech last year.  PM announced then  that\r\n\r\nMITA   was  developing  a  vision  for  Singapore  to  be   a\r\n\r\nrenaissance city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that the \"Renaissance\r\n\r\nCity  Report\",  articulating this vision  and  proposing  the\r\n\r\nstrategic direction to guide our promotion of culture and the\r\n\r\narts  has been completed.  This \"Renaissance City Report\"  is\r\n\r\navailable  on  the  MITA website from  today  and  a  printed\r\n\r\nversion will also be available soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last comprehensive overview of our arts and\r\n\r\ncultural  scene  was  in  1989, by the  Advisory  Council  on\r\n\r\nCulture  and  the Arts.  That report laid the foundation  for\r\n\r\nthe  burst  of cultural activities that we witnessed  in  the\r\n\r\n1990s.   It  has  been a decade since the Advisory  Council's\r\n\r\nreport.  It is timely to review the progress made so far  and\r\n\r\nset  the direction for the future development of culture  and\r\n\r\nthe arts, in the context of our overall national development.\r\n\r\nMITA  consulted  with  members of the cultural  community  to\r\n\r\ngather  inputs  and  views.  The resulting  Renaissance  City\r\n\r\nReport has been accepted by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has two aims. First, it is to establish\r\n\r\nSingapore as a global city of the arts.  We want to  position\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a key city in Asia and as one of the  cultural\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the  world.  The idea is to be one  of  the  top\r\n\r\ncities in the world to live, work and play in, where there is\r\n\r\nan  environment  conducive to knowledge-based industries  and\r\n\r\ntalent,  where Singaporeans can be creative and  well-rounded\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is to provide cultural ballast in our nation-building efforts. In order to strengthen Singaporeans' sense\r\n\r\nof  national identity and belonging, we need to inculcate  an\r\n\r\nappreciation of our artistic and cultural heritage.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the Singapore heartbeat through  the  creation\r\n\r\nand  sharing  of Singapore stories, be it in theatre,  dance,\r\n\r\nmusic, literature, film or the visual arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to articulate a vision came about because we\r\n\r\nwanted to explain how culture and the arts can contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  national  picture  and how they can  enhance  individual\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked ourselves what kind of society we wanted\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  have. How do we want to position Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  international context?  And what part does  culture  and\r\n\r\nthe  arts play in all of this?  The result was a vision  that\r\n\r\nis  described at the level of the individual, the society and\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the level of the individual, we envisage a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  who  is  well-rounded,  has  an  inquiring   and\r\n\r\ncreative  mind,  a  passion for life, and is  a  civic-minded\r\n\r\nactive  citizen.  He appreciates and cherishes his  heritage.\r\n\r\nHis   graciousness  is  underpinned  by  a  fine   sense   of\r\n\r\naesthetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the societal level, our Asian heritage is enhanced\r\n\r\neven  as we evolve a Singaporean identity.  We encourage  and\r\n\r\nreward  experimentation and innovation, whether in the  arts,\r\n\r\nin  technology  or  in business.  Culture and  the  arts  are\r\n\r\nmobilised to animate and add character to our city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the international arena, Singapore is an active\r\n\r\ninternational citizen with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreputation  for  being  dynamic and vibrant.   The  \"Made  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\"  label  is  known  for  technologically  advanced,\r\n\r\naesthetically designed and creatively packaged  products  and\r\n\r\nservices.   Our arts and cultural scene helps  to  project  a\r\n\r\npositive and well-rounded image of Singapore internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used the term \"renaissance\" to embody the wide\r\n\r\nand  diverse range of attributes that I have just  described.\r\n\r\nThis  is  by  no  means a desire to hark back  to  the  post-medieval  days of European Renaissance.  Rather,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nspirit   of  creativity,  innovation  and  multi-disciplinary\r\n\r\nlearning  and  of socio-economic, intellectual  and  cultural\r\n\r\nvibrancy  that  we want to help create.  In the  era  of  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy, such qualities  take  on  an  added\r\n\r\nimperative because they contribute to innovation, imagination\r\n\r\nand the creation of new knowledge  - key inputs in the future\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop our arts and cultural scene, the Report has\r\n\r\nadopted two approaches:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to nurture audiences with a deep appreciation\r\n\r\nfor the arts and keen sense of aesthetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to attract, develop and support both local and\r\n\r\noverseas creative talents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will pursue six strategies. They are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Develop a strong arts and cultural base. This\r\n\r\ninvolves  enthusing Singaporeans with an interest in culture,\r\n\r\nparticularly   through   arts   education   programmes,   and\r\n\r\nsupporting study and research in our arts and heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Develop major arts companies. Currently, only the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Symphony  Orchestra  and  the  Singapore   Chinese\r\n\r\nOrchestra  receive  a level of support that  allows  them  to\r\n\r\nfocus   on  raising  their  levels  of  professionalism   and\r\n\r\nproducing  works of an international standard that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  be  proud  of.   The  Report's  main  recommendation  in\r\n\r\nfinancial terms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  that  a substantial amount of additional funding be  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  support and groom up to  eight  more  of  such\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Recognise and groom talent. This calls for\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to  discover,  groom  and  recognise   promising\r\n\r\nartistic talents that can contribute to the arts and cultural\r\n\r\nscene in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Provide good infrastructure and facilities. The\r\n\r\nprovision   and  maintenance  of  good  infrastructure   will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be an important factor in supporting culture  and\r\n\r\nthe arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Go international. In order for Singapore to be a\r\n\r\ncultural  centre in a globalised world, we must  promote  our\r\n\r\narts  and  heritage in the international arena and  encourage\r\n\r\ninternational  collaboration between Singapore  and  overseas\r\n\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Develop what we call an arts and cultural\r\n\r\n`renaissance' economy.  We need to invest in programmes  that\r\n\r\nwill  add  to  the excitement and attraction of our  cultural\r\n\r\nscene, and do this in such a way that positions Singapore  as\r\n\r\nan international city of culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA has projected that we will need additional funding\r\n\r\nof  $50 million over the next five years.  The Government has\r\n\r\ngenerally accepted the recommendations in the Report  and  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  provide the additional funds.   A  few  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations,   particularly   those   relating   to   tax\r\n\r\nincentives would, however, require further study before  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  considered  for implementation.   This  sum  of  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  is over and above existing Government arts  funding.\r\n\r\nIt  is not inclusive of capital and operating expenditure for\r\n\r\ninfrastructure projects for which funding will be  separately\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching is right to note that our expenditure\r\n\r\non  arts and culture is below those of Hong Kong, the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  and  Australia.  On a per capita  basis,  Government\r\n\r\noperating  expenditure  on the arts in  Singapore,  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  about  $7,  is about half that  of  the  state  of\r\n\r\nVictoria  in  Australia, and less than a third that  of  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.  The additional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$50  million over 5 years will raise our per capita operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure to about $10.  While still modest compared to the\r\n\r\nlevels  of  funding  in more developed countries,  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few months, MITA and its agencies will\r\n\r\nimplement  the  recommendations  in  collaboration  with  our\r\n\r\npartners in the cultural community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members have raised specific comments on what we\r\n\r\ncan do to promote arts and culture in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Seng Han Thong that we need to broaden\r\n\r\nand  vary  the  form  of  recognition for  artists  and  arts\r\n\r\npatrons.  MITA has identified a list of artists who could  be\r\n\r\ninvited  to attend suitable state events.  The National  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil  also  facilitates opportunities for arts  groups  to\r\n\r\nperform at the Istana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked if we could look into providing more\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  arts groups.  NAC has been administering  an\r\n\r\nArts  Housing Scheme to provide arts groups and artists  with\r\n\r\nrehearsal  and  administrative spaces at below market  rental\r\n\r\nrates.   NAC  has  also been working closely  with  community\r\n\r\norganisations and the People's Association to co-locate  arts\r\n\r\nfacilities  in residential heartlands as part of its  aim  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  arts closer to the masses.  NAC will continue  to\r\n\r\nexplore  opportunities  for new arts housing  spaces  in  the\r\n\r\nheartlands.  NAC would be happy to match-make arts groups  to\r\n\r\nbe  housed  with community centres, as well as  with  private\r\n\r\ncommercial spaces.  Creative Technology's gesture in  housing\r\n\r\na  drama  training programme is exemplary and we  hope  other\r\n\r\nbenefactors will follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked what we are doing to bring the\r\n\r\narts  to  the  workers, while Mr Ravindran was interested  in\r\n\r\nwhat more can be done to bring the arts to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audience development and outreach programmes are very\r\n\r\nimportant in our efforts to promote the arts.   NAC has  been\r\n\r\norganising a number of activities as part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  its  outreach programme.  Programmes such as  the  fringe\r\n\r\nactivities  under  the Arts Festival see tremendous  turnout.\r\n\r\nNAC will continue to explore what further can be done in this\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Yeo's query on workers, he may be\r\n\r\naware   that   concessions  such  as  a  10%   discount   for\r\n\r\nperformances  under the Singapore Arts Festival are  extended\r\n\r\nto  NTUC  members and NTUC Income policyholders.  I  want  to\r\n\r\nreassure Members that MITA has always emphasised the need  to\r\n\r\nreach  out to our heartlanders.  This is acknowledged in  the\r\n\r\nRenaissance City Report.  Arts and culture cannot just be for\r\n\r\nan elite few, not if we want to be a society and a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung has raised some points about the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Cultural  Centre.   I  think  it  is  something  worth\r\n\r\nconsidering and given the opportunity, I will raise this with\r\n\r\nmy ASEAN colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to some information and media\r\n\r\nmatters.   The  media  landscape is  changing  rapidly.   The\r\n\r\nrecent merger of AOL and Time Warner sent a loud wake-up call\r\n\r\naround  the globe.  No one could have dreamt that an Internet\r\n\r\ncompany with limited physical assets could buy up one of  the\r\n\r\nlargest media conglomerates in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless broadband technology will take off in the near\r\n\r\nfuture.   It  will  enable  personal digital  assistants  and\r\n\r\ncellular telephones broadband access to the Internet anytime,\r\n\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convergence of traditional media, such as\r\n\r\nbroadcasting and print, with the Internet has changed the way\r\n\r\npeople obtain information and are entertained.  The challenge\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  is to ride the wave of media convergence  and\r\n\r\nglobalisation while enabling a Singapore identity to flourish\r\n\r\namong   Singaporeans.   In  the  deluge  of  foreign  content\r\n\r\nentering Singapore, especially via the Internet, Mr Chew Heng\r\n\r\nChing rightly asked if we should examine how local media  can\r\n\r\nretain  their  nation-building role, yet compete  effectively\r\n\r\nagainst  foreign  media. MITA shares his concerns.   We  have\r\n\r\nbeen studying this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissue of creating a functional and competitive industry  with\r\n\r\ngreat  care.   Whatever media structure emerges, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  have  our own media which continue to report  on  local\r\n\r\nhighlights   and  viewpoints,  and  anchor  Singaporeans   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local media should continue to cover local events\r\n\r\nand  news attractively. They should also not be disadvantaged\r\n\r\nwhen  they cover the events at home compared to foreign media\r\n\r\nallowed  into Singapore to also report on Singapore news.  We\r\n\r\nmust  judiciously  create  a  level  playing  field.   During\r\n\r\nelection  time,  the  same campaigning rules  must  apply  to\r\n\r\nforeign media as to MediaCorp or SPH.  We are working on  the\r\n\r\nnecessary guidelines and procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked whether we should introduce more\r\n\r\ncompetition  by  granting new licences for newspaper  and  TV\r\n\r\nstations.   One  thing is certain: our media  companies  must\r\n\r\ngear themselves up quickly to face increasing competition and\r\n\r\nto  seize  opportunities presented  by  the  Internet.   When\r\n\r\ncompanies have to compete for customers, it quickens the pace\r\n\r\nof  innovation, and spurs management to try out new ideas and\r\n\r\ntake risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media industry is both a local industry and a global\r\n\r\none.   There  is  no  shortage of competition  globally  and,\r\n\r\nincreasingly,  this is being felt here through  the  Internet\r\n\r\nand cable TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the local market, we need to recognise that we are a\r\n\r\nsmall  market, and have limited talents.  There are  only  so\r\n\r\nmany hours of time each person will spend on TV, Internet and\r\n\r\nreading   newspapers.   There  will  be  competition  between\r\n\r\ndifferent  media, as well as within one particular  class  of\r\n\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is still possible within a small market.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  need  to  consider how best  to  structure  the\r\n\r\nindustry  so  that  our  companies can  be  more  competitive\r\n\r\nlocally, grow regionally, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompete effectively against global media players.  Our  local\r\n\r\nmedia  companies  will then be in a better position  to  hold\r\n\r\ntheir  local  audiences and contribute to our nation-building\r\n\r\nefforts.  MITA is studying this issue and we expect to  reach\r\n\r\ncertain conclusions this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Ravindran and Mr Low Thia Khiang\r\n\r\nhave  asked if we should not lift the ban on satellite dishes\r\n\r\nnow and allow them to provide the competitive push, since  it\r\n\r\nis increasingly untenable to continue the ban.  In the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate  last year, my predecessor BG George Yeo said that  we\r\n\r\nwould  allow wireless subscription TV service into  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  compete with SCV when its monopoly ends in 2002.  As part\r\n\r\nof  our study into the media industry, we are looking at  all\r\n\r\npossibilities,  including the pros and  cons  of  introducing\r\n\r\nanother free-to-air or pay TV operator, be it terrestrial  or\r\n\r\nsatellite-based, into the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked my colleague, Mr David Lim, to answer the\r\n\r\nother questions concerning the media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MITA will launch a Speak Good English Movement next\r\n\r\nmonth.   It  will be known as a Movement because we  hope  to\r\n\r\nmake it a grassroots effort.  It will also take a more light-hearted  approach to encourage people to speak good  English.\r\n\r\nThe   Movement   will  be  led  by  a  Committee   comprising\r\n\r\nindividuals  from both the private and public sectors.   Col.\r\n\r\n(NS)  David Wong, Senior Advisor, Ernst and Young, has agreed\r\n\r\nto chair the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Movement will not disparage Singlish as there are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially from the older generation,  who  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  the  opportunity  to learn  English  formally  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  cannot  speak it well.  As  such,  the  Movement's\r\n\r\ninitial  target audience will be Singaporeans under 40  years\r\n\r\nold,   including  school,  ITE,  polytechnic  and  university\r\n\r\nstudents, working adults and parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua asked for more control to be exercised\r\n\r\non R(A) films, publications and the Internet.

Our  position on censorship remains unchanged.   The\r\n\r\ncontrols  over  R(A)  films  remain  strict.   Explicit  sex,\r\n\r\nviolent  scenes  and  objectionable  themes  continue  to  be\r\n\r\ndisallowed  in  R(A) movies, and R(A) cinemas are  still  not\r\n\r\nallowed  in  HDB estates.  We also conducted 281  raids  last\r\n\r\nyear  against uncensored and pornographic videos.   Some  one\r\n\r\nmillion uncensored and pornographic VCDs were seized and  the\r\n\r\ndistributors charged in court.

Even  then in this year's festival,  out  of  300\r\n\r\nfilms  to  be  screened, only 14 are in  the  \"Sex  in  Asian\r\n\r\nCinema\"  segment.  They will be shown for one or two viewings\r\n\r\nto small groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will leave the other points to be answered by my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, Mr David Lim and Mr Yatiman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek one clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are running out of time.

It is preparing  to\r\n\r\nlist  on the Stock Exchange within the next one or two years.\r\n\r\nThis  will sharpen their commercial sense and I think it will\r\n\r\nalso enable them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto better retain talent because they will be able to pay more\r\n\r\nmarket oriented compensation packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of Members have made various suggestions\r\n\r\nabout changes to TV programming.  They have suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould  have  more coverage of Parliament, more coverage  for\r\n\r\nTamil  programmes,  more  sports,  more  arts,  more  Chinese\r\n\r\ncurrent affairs, more Chinese children's programmes and  more\r\n\r\neducational  programmes.  I think the only  thing  they  said\r\n\r\nless  of was the news.  I am not sure that reflects anything.\r\n\r\nAt  least,  I think it reflects diversity in our society  and\r\n\r\nhow we are changing and how our interests are broadening out.\r\n\r\nI  think MCS will be glad with all the Members' feedback, but\r\n\r\nthe  principle is this.  Unless there is an audience,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot commercially viable for MCS to put on the programme.  You\r\n\r\ntake  Parliament,  for example.  We put on  a  live  telecast\r\n\r\ndebate  some  years back, and less than 1% of  people  viewed\r\n\r\nthat  programme.  So it is not just a matter  of  putting  on\r\n\r\nmore  programming but also ensuring that there is an audience\r\n\r\nfor it, because what is the point if you screen something and\r\n\r\nnobody watches it.  Then you might as well not screen  it  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin also asked about CNA and whether we could\r\n\r\nnot  encourage it to go world-wide now that it has taken  the\r\n\r\nfirst step to go to Asia.  Yes, but again, we must not forget\r\n\r\nthat  CNA  is barely one year old and going into  the  region\r\n\r\nalready  involves  a  great commitment of  resources.   Going\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  region will require even more.   So I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould take it one step at a time.  But in the meanwhile,  if\r\n\r\nyou  really want to watch CNA and happen to be in  New  York,\r\n\r\nyou  can always tune on the Internet, especially if you  have\r\n\r\ngot broadband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang made a suggestion about buying more\r\n\r\nforeign  Chinese  drama rather than producing  them  locally.\r\n\r\nLocal  dramas  are very popular.  As Mdm Claire Chiang  said,\r\n\r\nthe series Stepping Out received a very good reception.  She\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned  the figure of 900,000 viewers.  I have a  slightly\r\n\r\nmore modest figure, but I think they are in the same order of\r\n\r\nmagnitude.   But the value of local dramas lies  beyond  just\r\n\r\nthe  popularity.  Local dramas may deal with the same  themes\r\n\r\nas  foreign  dramas, whether they be about  love  affairs  or\r\n\r\nabout  entrepreneurs,  but  they  are  set  in  the  familiar\r\n\r\nsurroundings  that  Singaporeans  can  resonate   with,   the\r\n\r\nbuildings,  the  costumes,  the  language,  even  the  little\r\n\r\nvignettes, the stories within stories.  These tend  to  bring\r\n\r\nout  a warmer and more personal reception among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThis  is a good thing.  In the Internet age, we run the  risk\r\n\r\nthat   people  will  lose  common  experiences.    We   watch\r\n\r\ndifferent movies, we subscribe to different magazines, we  go\r\n\r\nto  different  places on holiday.  So having dramas  produced\r\n\r\nlocally  that  everyone can relate to and talk about  creates\r\n\r\nshared  experiences.  These are the basis on  which  we  give\r\n\r\nmeaning to shared values.  This helps to solidify a Singapore\r\n\r\nidentity  and it contributes to nation building. So I hope Mr\r\n\r\nYeo  will agree with me that spending a little bit more money\r\n\r\non  local  dramas is perhaps well worthwhile.  In  any  case,\r\n\r\nmany of them do travel overseas and are quite comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked a specific question about the\r\n\r\nProgramme  Advisory  Committee regarding  Buffy  the  Vampire\r\n\r\nSlayer  and  Charm.  I am neither a vampire slayer  nor  very\r\n\r\ncharming,  but the intent of the Programme Advisory Committee\r\n\r\nwas  more to caution about violence and supernatural  content\r\n\r\nin  these programmes and not to recommend their removal.   We\r\n\r\ndo  recognise that again there are a variety of interests and\r\n\r\nsome people do enjoy these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I address the question that Mdm Claire\r\n\r\nChiang  brought  up  about allocating  air  time  or  setting\r\n\r\npreferential rates in the local media for community services.\r\n\r\nShe  has given many good reasons why it is useful for  us  to\r\n\r\npublicise  and  raise  social awareness  about  the  services\r\n\r\nprovided  and  also  the purpose of these  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.  But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is  better  that we  keep  separate  commercial\r\n\r\ndecisions  and  community service decisions.  As  Mdm  Chiang\r\n\r\nherself  has  pointed out, air time is  very  expensive.   So\r\n\r\nthere  is a real opportunity cost involved.  But if  we  keep\r\n\r\nthese  decisions  separate, I think  it  ensures  that  media\r\n\r\ncompanies will run their businesses competitively but without\r\n\r\nignoring their role in the community. So we can leave  it  to\r\n\r\nSPH  or  MCS to decide on the rates that  they want to charge\r\n\r\nfor  commercial  services  as  well  as  to  what  amount  of\r\n\r\ndiscounts or sponsorship they are willing or able to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  community  services.    Where  public  messages  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are concerned, Ministries can, within  their  own\r\n\r\nbudgets, buy air time for advertisements for their own public\r\n\r\neducation programmes and campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, Dr Ho\r\n\r\nTat  Kin and Mr Ravindran asked about the development of  our\r\n\r\nfilm  industry and of Singapore as a film centre and  whether\r\n\r\nwe have enough local talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the Singapore Film Commission in\r\n\r\n1998 was timely as its role of nurturing and supporting local\r\n\r\ntalent in film-making, the production of Singapore films  and\r\n\r\na film industry in Singapore will help us towards our goal of\r\n\r\nbecoming a Film Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in this House, it was reported how the\r\n\r\nCommission has been helping the local film industry in  three\r\n\r\nmain  areas: talent development, facilitation and  financing.\r\n\r\nFor    talent   development,   the   Commission   gives   out\r\n\r\nscholarships,  bursaries and grants for film-related  courses\r\n\r\nand programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Film Sound and Video\r\n\r\nSchool works closely with the Commission.  As the local  film\r\n\r\nindustry  grows and foreigners choose to produce their  films\r\n\r\nhere, we envisage a shortage of film professionals, which  we\r\n\r\ngradually  have to build up through continuing programmes  to\r\n\r\nnurture local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalent and by bringing in foreign talent to supplement them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilitation is a key initiative of the Commission.\r\n\r\nLocal  film-makers can and indeed do come to  the  Commission\r\n\r\nfor  help  either  for a general letter  of  support  or  for\r\n\r\nspecific   requests.    Film-makers  sometimes   still   have\r\n\r\ndifficulty with some agencies and we are working with them to\r\n\r\nsee how these can be resolved.  In the area of financing, the\r\n\r\nCommission gives out small grants to makers of short films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho raised the matter of co-productions. I understand\r\n\r\nthat   discussions  on  two  co-productions  with   Singapore\r\n\r\nproducers  are underway, one with Canada and the  other  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also works closely with the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  the  Singapore  Tourism  Board  and  the\r\n\r\nNational Arts Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help make Singapore an attractive Film Centre, the\r\n\r\nCommission  is  currently studying what countries  with  more\r\n\r\nmature  film industries offer in terms of business incentives\r\n\r\nand  film financing and how we may learn and adapt from them.\r\n\r\nThese    alone,   however,   are   not   enough.     Creative\r\n\r\nscriptwriters,  talented film-makers and  good  business  and\r\n\r\nmarketing sense are also crucial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to turn Singapore into a thriving film industry hub\r\n\r\nincluding  3D features will thus require sustained effort  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  talent  in  all  aspects of  film-making  and  sound\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  marketing  acumen,  essential  elements  to  a\r\n\r\nvibrant  film industry.  I am hopeful that slowly but  surely\r\n\r\nwe shall get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew asked about the special features of the proposed\r\n\r\nnew  National  Library  Building.  The  National  Library  is\r\n\r\nSingapore's   main  repository  of  books,  information   and\r\n\r\nresources.    The  new  building  must  reflect   Singapore's\r\n\r\naspirations  to be a learning nation. It will be  a  one-stop\r\n\r\nlibrary, offering an integrated learning experience with  its\r\n\r\nspecial reference libraries such as the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeritage, the Arts and Business Libraries.   For example, the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Heritage  Library  will  hold   a   comprehensive\r\n\r\ncollection of all materials on or about Singapore.   It  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  world-class centre for research on Singapore. The  new\r\n\r\nlibrary   building  will  also  house  the  Central  Regional\r\n\r\nLibrary.   Collectively, the building will  house  about  one\r\n\r\nmillion library books and other library materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the building will also have a multi-media\r\n\r\ncentre,  exhibition hall, auditorium and a  select  range  of\r\n\r\noutlets  like  cafes and other shops to enhance  the  library\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the visitors.  The building will  incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  latest  technology  to  transform  the  library  into  a\r\n\r\nborderless  library  with  state-of-the-art  facilities   and\r\n\r\nconnectivity to information all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew also asked about IT initiatives to increase\r\n\r\nlibrary  utilisation.  Since 1995, with its NL.Line, NLB  has\r\n\r\nopened  its  doors  to  a  network of  borderless  libraries,\r\n\r\nlinking  the  publicly  funded  libraries  in  Singapore   to\r\n\r\noverseas libraries.  The amount of information available  on-line, such as databases, CD-ROMs and optical discs, has grown\r\n\r\ntremendously  that  library users can  now  access  some  400\r\n\r\ndatabases and news services worldwide.  The NLB has created a\r\n\r\nnetwork of borderless libraries by co-operating with overseas\r\n\r\nsources  of  information including the  National  Library  of\r\n\r\nChina,  Shanghai Library, British Library and  Russian  State\r\n\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB has also developed a Student Virtual Community\r\n\r\n(SVC), launched in September 1999, to connect students to the\r\n\r\ninformation  world and promote interaction  over  cyberspace.\r\n\r\nMore  recently, the NLB spearheaded the creation of HuayiNet,\r\n\r\na  major  resource portal on the Chinese Diaspora.  This  was\r\n\r\nlaunched last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong has asked for a neighbourbood\r\n\r\nlibrary  in Potong Pasir.  Somehow he assumed that there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  some favouritism.  But I think he did not get his facts\r\n\r\ncorrect.  The Marine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParade  Library  was set up not as a new  library  but  as  a\r\n\r\nreplacement  of the old library.  The old library  in  Marine\r\n\r\nParade,  known as a regional library, has already been  there\r\n\r\nsince Marine Parade Town was built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he appears to be exaggerating the danger of\r\n\r\ntravelling in public areas in Singapore, picturing  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  though it is like New York.  I think he has overdone  it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Sir, he had asked the same question in 1993, 1996 and\r\n\r\n1997  without  fail.  I am offering the  same  reply.   I  am\r\n\r\nafraid my reply will be nothing new to him.  I would like  to\r\n\r\ninform him that the children's libraries here are built  with\r\n\r\nthe   support  of  the  NLB  according  to  certain  planning\r\n\r\nparameters  such as geographical factor, population  density,\r\n\r\nage group, proximity to other libraries, and not according to\r\n\r\nthe  parliamentary  constituencies.  We  are  targetting  100\r\n\r\nCCLs  and  our objective is eventually to have it everywhere,\r\n\r\nhopefully,  including Potong Pasir, many, many  years  later.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if Mr Chiam is impatient, there is  nothing  to\r\n\r\nstop  him or his Town Council under his charge to set up  his\r\n\r\nown  library  subject to the approval of the  HDB  and  other\r\n\r\nrelevant authorities.  After all, Mr Chiam himself said  that\r\n\r\nit  costs very little.  Just put tiles on 10,000 sq ft  area,\r\n\r\nput up a wall and hence we have a library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I mean in every sense\r\n\r\nthat  the  word  connotes,  that is,  environmentally  aware,\r\n\r\nenvironmentally  friendly, actions and  practices  which  are\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  minimise  damage to the  environment,  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  that  is sustainable.  Here, I  mean  the  whole\r\n\r\ncommunity  or  businesses,  each  and  every  one  of  us  as\r\n\r\nindividuals.   If we were to consider our anti-littering  and\r\n\r\nclean  toilet campaigns as surrogates, then I would  have  to\r\n\r\nsay   \"not  very  clean\".   These  campaigns  have  not  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful but it is not really the fault of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe Environment.  In fact, I think they have done a fantastic\r\n\r\njob  in keeping Singapore clean and green.  But that is their\r\n\r\njob.   The job of keeping Singapore clean and green seems  to\r\n\r\nrest  on  the  shoulders  of the Ministry  alone.   That  our\r\n\r\nstreets  are  litter-free  is  not  due  to  the  absence  of\r\n\r\nlittering  but rather due to the thousands of cleaners  going\r\n\r\nabout  their  jobs  to keep Singapore litter-free.  That  our\r\n\r\ntoilets  are not smelly and dirty is due more to the frequent\r\n\r\ncleaning by the toilet attendants than the toiletry habits of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the efforts that we have put into trying to\r\n\r\nmake  Singaporeans  environmentally friendly  and  green,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  honestly say that we have succeeded.  Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\ntime to rethink on the way we tackle these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would really like to see a complete stock-take\r\n\r\nof  where  we  are  now.  How green are  we?   What  are  the\r\n\r\npractices  and habits of our community that can be considered\r\n\r\nas  environmentally positive? What are the practices  of  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses  considered as friendly to the environment?   What\r\n\r\nare  the  governmental and regulatory measures that encourage\r\n\r\ngreen  practices by businesses, the community and the people.\r\n\r\nLet us have a complete report card on these and other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would like to set objectives on where we want to\r\n\r\ngo and the appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesired time frames to achieve these objectives.

Periodic\r\n\r\nreport  cards  such  as  annual stock-takes  should  then  be\r\n\r\nproduced to provide markers on the progress made.  What I  am\r\n\r\nproposing  is  not  really new.  We already had  successfully\r\n\r\nused  this method in the cleaning up of Singapore River.   We\r\n\r\nset  a time frame for the Singapore River to be cleaned,  and\r\n\r\nwe  applied  the  resources to that time  frame  and  we  had\r\n\r\nperiodic  reports  along  the  way.   Also,  the  green  plan\r\n\r\nproduced by the Environment Ministry some years ago will be a\r\n\r\ngood place to start for this environmental master plan.   The\r\n\r\ngreen plan currently is more like a statement of what we want\r\n\r\nSingapore  to be.  All that is needed, Sir, is  to  make  the\r\n\r\ngreen  plan  more  comprehensive and to add in  the  specific\r\n\r\naction plans and resources to achieve specific goals.  Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink this approach could work. At least, I think it would be\r\n\r\nmore  effective  than what has been done  so  far.   What  is\r\n\r\nneeded  is  the inclination and willingness of the Government\r\n\r\nto put enough resources into this plan.  And by resources,  I\r\n\r\ndo not mean just more cleaners and attendants, but rather the\r\n\r\nresources to change the mindset of the nation.  The  approach\r\n\r\nshould  not emphasise on the cleaning up but rather  be  more\r\n\r\ndirected  at prevention in the first place.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nSir, we should do all we can to ensure that we do not pollute\r\n\r\nin  the  first  place and not spend most of our resources  on\r\n\r\ncleaning up the pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a comprehensive Master Plan and a total\r\n\r\napproach can energise all three sectors - the Government, the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and the people - to make Singapore a truly  green\r\n\r\nisland.  It is an idea worth considering, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, a few years\r\n\r\nago,   recycling  has  been  promoted  actively.   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments were using recycled papers and recycled bins were\r\n\r\nplaced  in  the main thoroughfares for recycled items  to  be\r\n\r\ndropped in.  The public was reminded that recycling should be\r\n\r\npractised whenever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible to preserve our earth's scarce resources and not  to\r\n\r\ndeplete our natural resources mindlessly.  There seems to  be\r\n\r\nnot  much  follow-up  action by the Ministry.   It  would  be\r\n\r\nironical  that the nation that is completely without  natural\r\n\r\nresources  can afford to ignore the importance of  conserving\r\n\r\nsuch scarce resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, on one of my visits to Canberra, Australia, I\r\n\r\nobserved  that the authorities have limited the size  of  the\r\n\r\nrefuse bin of each household.  The objective is to limit  the\r\n\r\namount  of  refuse generated, a compulsory way of  compelling\r\n\r\neveryone to recycle and not to unnecessarily generate  refuse\r\n\r\nby  needlessly throwing away reusable articles.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  can consider ways to encourage residents  to  limit\r\n\r\nthe  amount of refuse.  This can be done by making it one  of\r\n\r\nthe criteria to be included in giving rebates to blocks which\r\n\r\nare judged to be the cleanest in our HDB estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the Ministry to put through the message of\r\n\r\nrecycling and come up with more creative ways to promote this\r\n\r\ncause.   For example, the Ministry can call on the people  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the  usage of disposable plastic cups and  polystyrene\r\n\r\nfood  boxes  and  plates,  as  they  cannot  be  recycled  or\r\n\r\nbiodegradable  and are harmful to our environment.   If  this\r\n\r\ncannot  be  practised at the commercial places, at  least  at\r\n\r\nhome, for hygiene and time taken to clean usable utensils are\r\n\r\nnot  critical.   Any programme we can come up with  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  take  some time for everyone to get used  to.   This\r\n\r\ninvolves  changing not only our daily habits  but  the  whole\r\n\r\nmindset  of the nation.  But unless we can make a start  now,\r\n\r\nwe may create serious problems for our future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, half\r\n\r\nof  the  water consumed in Singapore is supplied by  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  the  other half is from our own reservoirs.   The  first\r\n\r\nwater  agreement with Malaysia will expire in 2011.  To-date,\r\n\r\nthere is still no sign of what will happen upon the expiry of\r\n\r\nthe  said  agreement.   Much  has  been  reported  about  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the water catchment in Indonesia and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexploration of desalination technology.  Lately, there was  a\r\n\r\nreport  about  selling  of  high-grade  industrial  water  in\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, industrial water or recycled water could be an\r\n\r\nimportant  source of water supply in meeting our water  needs\r\n\r\nwhen we fail to secure other reasonable raw water supply deal\r\n\r\nwith  our  neighbouring countries.  In fact, almost  all  the\r\n\r\nused  water enters into our sewer system, together  with  the\r\n\r\nrain  water.  Our sewer system discharges more than what  PUB\r\n\r\nhas  supplied into the sea after treatment.  If half  of  the\r\n\r\nwater discharged is recycled, we shall be self-sufficient  in\r\n\r\nour  water  needs.   Based  on today's  technology,  the  low\r\n\r\npressure  membrane is able to produce water of  good  quality\r\n\r\nand  at  very  reasonable  cost.  This  is  why  high-quality\r\n\r\nindustrial water is able to find its market under the private\r\n\r\nsector initiative in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the people in the water business, I know that the\r\n\r\nMinistry has an ongoing project on the research and study  of\r\n\r\nrecycled  water.  May I ask the Minister on the  progress  of\r\n\r\nthe  said  recycled water project?  Does the quality  of  the\r\n\r\nrecycled  water  meet  that of the Bedok  or  Chua  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nreservoirs'  standard?   What is the cost  of  producing  the\r\n\r\nwater?  What is the application of the water produced so far?\r\n\r\nIs  there a possibility that the recycled water can meet  the\r\n\r\nwater  needs of Singapore?  If so, what plans do we  have  in\r\n\r\nmaking people to accept recycled water as an alternative when\r\n\r\nwe should be self-sufficient in our own water supply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, in recent times, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  much  talk,  and  unfortunately much  misunderstanding,\r\n\r\nabout genetically modified (GM) food.  This is not surprising\r\n\r\nas the idea of having food that we consume, a product of some\r\n\r\nform  of  modification by the addition of a gene from another\r\n\r\nsource  using  biotechnological  techniques,  can  be   quite\r\n\r\ndiscomforting, to say the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of impact would such food have on us and our\r\n\r\ndescendants, since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGM  food  is unlikely to occur in nature even with  the  most\r\n\r\nsophisticated  form of cross-breeding?  Are  we  not  playing\r\n\r\nGod?  How would they square against our religious and ethical\r\n\r\nbeliefs?   What sort of impact would such organisms and  food\r\n\r\nhave  on  the  environment and the ecology?  Sir,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nreally  know  what the answers are.  The technology  is  new,\r\n\r\nonly  about 20 years old, and I doubt that there are many  in\r\n\r\nthe  world who would say that they have the complete  answers\r\n\r\nto all these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say, Sir, is that GM food is here to stay.\r\n\r\nThe world needs it.  The fact is that the spectre of Malthus'\r\n\r\nprediction  is  not  upon us is due mainly  to  the  advances\r\n\r\nscientists have made in the production of food.  GM  food  is\r\n\r\nbut  just another step in the same direction.  In fact,  with\r\n\r\npopulous  countries,  like China and India,  on  the  way  to\r\n\r\nbecoming  middle class countries, and with rising  affluence,\r\n\r\nwe  will have more demand on food.  The demand on food in the\r\n\r\nworld can only intensify in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a matter of interest, even in Singapore, can we\r\n\r\nreally  say that we have not been really consuming  GM  food?\r\n\r\nTake the ubiquitous soya bean and the products made from  it.\r\n\r\nWe  take  it in the form of soya sauce, bean curd, soya  milk\r\n\r\nand  in  various forms like tou chiu, tou gua, tou  pok,  tou\r\n\r\nkee,  and  various types of tou.  Soya bean is also  used  in\r\n\r\nmany  of  the food we eat.  We also eat the meat  of  animals\r\n\r\nwhich  feed  on  soya-based feed-mill.  The  reality  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter is that the US is the world's largest exporter of soya\r\n\r\nbeans,  and that is, about 50% of the soya bean crops in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States are already genetically modified.  So  can  we\r\n\r\nhonestly  say  that  the food that we consume  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially  processed food, contains none of those  beans  in\r\n\r\none form or another?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in light of this, I support the rationale and\r\n\r\npractical approach taken by the Environment Ministry on  this\r\n\r\nissue.   We  should not irrationally condemn all GM  food  as\r\n\r\nunfit for human consumption.  On the other hand, if there are\r\n\r\nreasonable alternative sources, then obviously we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  avoid  GM  food  as much and  as  long  as  possible.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I believe that on this issue, individual  consumers\r\n\r\nshould  have the final say on the type of food they  wish  to\r\n\r\nconsume.  It is therefore the Government's responsibility  to\r\n\r\nprovide  all available information for our consumers to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  choices.  And here, Sir, I am referring to the subject\r\n\r\nof labelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry should implement a labelling policy\r\n\r\nimmediately.    I   am   aware  that  there   are   technical\r\n\r\ndifficulties  involved  -  issues  such  as  threshold.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  what  percentage  would  the  use  of  GM  food  in\r\n\r\nprocessed food have to be before labelling them as containing\r\n\r\nGM   food?   Despite  all  these  difficulties,  I  think  an\r\n\r\nimperfect labelling policy is better than no policy  at  all.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think that we have the luxury of  waiting  for  a\r\n\r\nperfect solution to this issue.  Let us start, Sir, with some\r\n\r\nform of labelling and change the labelling specifications and\r\n\r\nstandards  with improving technology and testing  techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this way, while the Ministry keeps the broad parameters of\r\n\r\nensuring that Singapore has safe food, the final choice  lies\r\n\r\nwith the consumers, with us, Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I support the views\r\n\r\nput  forward by my GPC Chairman, Mr Heng Chiang Meng, on  the\r\n\r\nlabelling of genetically modified food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is genetically modified food? It is food\r\n\r\ncontaining  ingredients coming from the genetically  modified\r\n\r\ncrop.   These  are  crops which have genes taken  from  other\r\n\r\norganisms,   plants  and  animals  and  inserted   into   the\r\n\r\ngenetically  modified crop.  Soya bean is the  most  commonly\r\n\r\ngrown  GM  crop, followed by corn, rape seed and potato.   In\r\n\r\ntheory, anything containing these crops or lecithin, which is\r\n\r\nmade from soya bean, could come from the GM ingredients.   We\r\n\r\nconsume food every day which is genetically modified  but  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  even notice it.  If you ask the manufacturer whether\r\n\r\nthe  food  is genetically modified, from experience of  other\r\n\r\nadvanced   countries,  clear  answers  are   hard   to   get.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is hard to know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  it is GM food or it is safe to consume, unless  they\r\n\r\nare forced to disclose by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of genetically modified food are unknown.\r\n\r\nThe main concern is that food has subtle and long-term effect\r\n\r\non  health  and we seem to be making a significant change  to\r\n\r\nour  food supply without checking whether or not it  will  be\r\n\r\nhaving  any  impact on our health.  There are  also  concerns\r\n\r\nabout the effect of introducing genes which are resistant  to\r\n\r\nvirus,  herbicide,  as GM crops are certainly  a  cross-breed\r\n\r\nwith  weeds.   Morally, there are also other  problems,  like\r\n\r\nintroducing  genes of animals into the food which  may  cause\r\n\r\nreligious  and  also moral concerns.  It also causes  certain\r\n\r\nspecies  of plants to lose their nature of reproduction.   On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, it could also cause it to reproduce so quickly\r\n\r\nbeyond the control of human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the manufacturer's point of view, GM food could be\r\n\r\nproduced  at  a  much lower cost, lower risk  in  production,\r\n\r\nfetch  better  price  for  the  product  and  will  be   more\r\n\r\nmarketable if the consumers preferred the characteristics  of\r\n\r\nthe  food to be enhanced.  These include the colour, flavour,\r\n\r\nsize  and  any other preferred ingredients.  There  are  also\r\n\r\nhopes  that  there  will be increase in productivity  of  the\r\n\r\ndeveloping nation in increasing the food production.  To  the\r\n\r\nconsumers, they may get cheaper and better looking food,  but\r\n\r\nthe  impact  on health due to the food is relatively  unknown\r\n\r\nand uninformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent conference sponsored by the OECD held in\r\n\r\nEdinburgh,  consumer groups, scientists and legislators  were\r\n\r\ngathered to discuss the matter concerning GM food.  The  term\r\n\r\n\"substantial equivalent\" used to assess the safety of the  GM\r\n\r\nfood  was  debated and strongly criticised  by  the  consumer\r\n\r\ngroups.   The modern GM technology was compared to the  early\r\n\r\ndays  of  nuclear  power technology development.   Scientists\r\n\r\nthen   expounded   on  their  incredible  potential   without\r\n\r\nrealising or warning about the danger of nuclear power.   The\r\n\r\nscientists were urged to be more truthful about what they did\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  on  the  issue  of  GM  food.   The  term  \"substantial\r\n\r\nequivalent\" was introduced by the OECD in 1993 to assess  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of GM food.  It was adopted three years later by  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  Food and Agricultural Organisation  and  the\r\n\r\nWorld Health Organisation, and has been used ever since.  But\r\n\r\neven  some  scientists  have  criticised  it  for  not  being\r\n\r\naccurate enough to prove that GM food is safe.  It is only  a\r\n\r\nguide   for   safety  assessment  and  there  are   different\r\n\r\ninterpretations and much is dependent on the expertise of the\r\n\r\npeople making the assessment.  When we deal with the GM  food\r\n\r\nissue,  we  must  be  careful in the  adoption  of  the  term\r\n\r\n\"substantial  equivalent\" in approving the sale  of  GM  food\r\n\r\nhere.   The  consumers' long-term health safety must  precede\r\n\r\ncommercial and scientific interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consumers in Singapore are ignorant about GM\r\n\r\nfood  and  their  health implications.  They  deserve  to  be\r\n\r\nbetter informed about what scientists are doing to their food\r\n\r\nand  what they are eating.  If nothing is done, GM food  will\r\n\r\nflood the market and the people will continue to consume  the\r\n\r\nfood  by not knowing the implications.  If GM food should  go\r\n\r\nwrong  one day, the Government has to be responsible for  not\r\n\r\nkeeping  the consumers adequately informed of the matter.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that we should consider mandatory measures by asking the\r\n\r\nGM  food producers and importers to disclose the content  and\r\n\r\nwhat they had done to the food and compulsorily labelling all\r\n\r\nGM  food  sold locally.  Mandatory labelling allows consumers\r\n\r\nto decide for themselves whether they like to eat GM food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to seriously consider the labelling\r\n\r\nof GM food and the compulsory disclosure of the content of GM\r\n\r\nfood sold locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, despite concerted\r\n\r\nefforts  to  eradicate the problem of littering in Singapore,\r\n\r\none  of  the  major complaints the town council has  received\r\n\r\nfrom the residents is the untidiness and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlack  of cleanliness in the estate.  Although the legislation\r\n\r\nprovides   for   severe   fines   for   people   who   litter\r\n\r\nindiscriminately, enforcement remains a big problem.  Keeping\r\n\r\nthe  estate  clean and tidy depends very much  on  the  civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness of the residents, and not on the  frequency  of\r\n\r\nthe   cleaning.   Theoretically,  if  nobody   litters,   the\r\n\r\nenvironment will remain clean even without cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example is in the comparison between the public\r\n\r\nhousing  estates and the private condominiums.  The  standard\r\n\r\nof  cleanliness in condominiums has always been higher and it\r\n\r\nis  not because they are cleaned more frequently.  It is more\r\n\r\nin  the  mindset of the residents that they regard  the  area\r\n\r\neven  outside their units as their own.  Therefore, they  are\r\n\r\nmore conscious in keeping the estate clean and tidy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the necessary expenses caused by cleaning up\r\n\r\nthe  public  housing estates, it also affects the environment\r\n\r\nwe  live  in.   And Singapore being an urban  city,  we  must\r\n\r\ncultivate  civic consciousness in everyone of us  whether  we\r\n\r\nlive  in private or public estates.  I hope the Ministry  can\r\n\r\nput  more efforts in promoting public consciousness,  keeping\r\n\r\nour environment clean and stepping up enforcement in catching\r\n\r\nthose who litter indiscriminately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which needs to be looked into is how to deal\r\n\r\nwith those businesses who send out fliers to the residents in\r\n\r\nHDB   estates.   These  businesses,  while  saving  on  their\r\n\r\nadvertising  cost,  have  indirectly generated  a  tremendous\r\n\r\namount of litter as 99% of the residents would discard  these\r\n\r\nfliers   immediately  after  taking   them   out   from   the\r\n\r\nletterboxes.   Some  measures have been taken  by  some  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  to  modify  the  letterboxes  to  prevent  this  by\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  trough under the letterboxes  to  collect  these\r\n\r\ndiscarded  fliers.  But in most housing estates,  this  still\r\n\r\nremains a source of environmental pollution.  Perhaps, a form\r\n\r\nof   fine  or  levy  can  be  put  on  these  businesses  who\r\n\r\nindiscriminately  send out fliers in our  public  estates  to\r\n\r\ndefray the extra cleaning cost incurred by the town council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen seems to imply\r\n\r\nthat  people who live in condominiums are more civic  minded.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  too  sure whether his assessment is correct,  and\r\n\r\nwhether it is fair to the people who live in HDB estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, using punishment by inflicting economic losses\r\n\r\nthrough fines and publicly shaming offenders seem to  be  the\r\n\r\ncornerstone  of  the Government in solving  social  problems.\r\n\r\nHeavy  fines  and  CWOs  to punish  litterbugs  is  one  such\r\n\r\nexample.

It could also consider\r\n\r\nhow  to  empower  individuals to deal with  litterbugs.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the Environment has made offenders  to  perform\r\n\r\nCWOs by cleaning up some areas.  So far, I have not known  of\r\n\r\nany offenders being made to clean up areas in Hougang Estate.\r\n\r\nI  wonder  how the Ministry selects which area to  clean  up.\r\n\r\nDoes the Ministry only select areas in the PAP wards?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  say  to  Mr Low Thia Khiang that I am not aware  that  my\r\n\r\nhousing estates are being cleaned by CWO workers too.  So  it\r\n\r\nis  not just Hougang that is being excluded.  I do not  think\r\n\r\nthe CWO serves the purpose of cleaning up housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, essentially, Mr Low is right in that it is not\r\n\r\nfines and it is not CWOs that would ultimately solve the root\r\n\r\nof  the  problem.   The  root  of the  problem  is  community\r\n\r\nconsciousness, as he has pointed out,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand a civic consciouness among people such that there is this\r\n\r\nshame  or  perhaps  humiliation if  you  are  seen  to  throw\r\n\r\nsomething  on  to the floor when it is clean.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nwe have a problem here in that, culturally, Singaporeans, and\r\n\r\nAsians, in general, do not find it a comfortable thing to  do\r\n\r\nto  confront  somebody  in public and tell  them,  \"Hey,  you\r\n\r\ndropped something.  Can you please pick it up?\"  We have seen\r\n\r\nalso, where handphones are concerned, that the reaction could\r\n\r\nbe  something very violent.  So I think it is a long way more\r\n\r\nand a big cultural change that we may have to institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because I do believe that this problem\r\n\r\naffects  two other areas.  I want to talk particularly  about\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  River and the Civic District.  Seven  million\r\n\r\ntourists  visit us every year.  Some of these are journalists\r\n\r\nand  government officials, and they leave Singapore with  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that it is clean and green and then  they  spread\r\n\r\nthe  word and send more people our way.  We have indeed  done\r\n\r\nvery  well and our Ministry of the Environment deserves  high\r\n\r\npraise for the work they have done.  This is particularly  so\r\n\r\nwhen  we  realise  that the cleanliness is  achieved  through\r\n\r\nsheer  diligence in sweeping the streets and, as Mr Low says,\r\n\r\nheavy  fines  and the Corrective Work Order for  recalcitrant\r\n\r\noffenders of our anti-littering laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special efforts seem to have been put into keeping\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road,  our prime tourist belt, and  Changi  Airport,\r\n\r\nspotlessly  clean.  Somehow, I think cleanliness  does  beget\r\n\r\ncleanliness  and, as I said earlier, if the place  is  clean,\r\n\r\nthe person who throws litter will feel a little bit conscious\r\n\r\nif  he  were to be the first to make the place dirty.  But  a\r\n\r\nperson who wants to litter will feel less compunction if  the\r\n\r\nstreet is already very dirty.  Ultimately, we must change the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the people.  But today, I am not here  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout what kind of civic campaigns we must introduce or  what\r\n\r\nnew fines we must institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have a small request of the Ministry.

And I pass the historically\r\n\r\nquaint  Cavenagh Bridge where I have the pleasure  of  seeing\r\n\r\nfishermen  fish from the Singapore River.  This  River  is  a\r\n\r\nlong way from the black, smelly, immensely filthy river of my\r\n\r\nchildhood  30-40 years ago.  All credit goes to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nagain  for  the  miracle they have wrought.  People  actually\r\n\r\ntravel on this river now on pleasure cruises!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that keeping up such cleanliness is a\r\n\r\ndifficult  task.   I just wish to alert the Ministry  to  the\r\n\r\nfact that more attention should perhaps be given to the river\r\n\r\nand the Civic District through which it runs.  I have had  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions   written  letters to  the  Ministry  on  the\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  state of cleanliness during  my  daily  walk.\r\n\r\nBeer  bottles  are littered at odd hours of the  day;  leaves\r\n\r\nclog  drains;  debris float on the river; oil stains  on  the\r\n\r\nriver  and  on  the  roads;  tour  buses  running  their  air\r\n\r\nconditioners while they wait for their passengers  to  rejoin\r\n\r\nthem  and  spewing, in the meantime, lots of pollutants  into\r\n\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry pay the same attention to this area as\r\n\r\nthey  do for Orchard Road and the Airport before many of  the\r\n\r\ntourists  visiting  here  start telling  their  friends  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is not really that clean after all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A.

We\r\n\r\nlive  in  a small island surrounded by water and the fear  is\r\n\r\nmore real when heavy rain continues for several days and  the\r\n\r\ntide is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70s, we saw the development of 3,178 hectares of\r\n\r\nflood prone land involving $20 million worth of manpower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  about  $68  million in improving canals in  flood  prone\r\n\r\nareas.  In 1998, there were 260 hectares of flood prone  land\r\n\r\nleft  that  can still be developed.  These flood prone  areas\r\n\r\ncan  cause  difficulties to the public when flood occurs  and\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  traffic  jams and damage  to  vehicles  and\r\n\r\nproperties.   The  question is: why did the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment not develop the 260 hectares of flood prone land?\r\n\r\nIs  it  due to shortage of budget or other factors that flood\r\n\r\nprone areas still exist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the location of the 260 hectares of land? What\r\n\r\nprojects   are underway and will be carried out?  Can  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  in  10 years' time from today,  Singapore will be  free\r\n\r\nfrom flood?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was reported in 1998 that there were about 5,183\r\n\r\ndengue cases and 75 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever.  With\r\n\r\nregard  to  malaria there were 405 cases, of which  369  were\r\n\r\ncases  reported  to be brought in by victims  from  overseas.\r\n\r\nOnly  36 cases of malaria occurred here.  Although the figure\r\n\r\nis  quite  high,  only  one died from dengue  and  five  from\r\n\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibilities of reducing dengue and malaria\r\n\r\ncases rest on the shoulder of the Vector Control and Research\r\n\r\nDepartment,  Ministry of the Environment.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow whether the said department has thus far been successful\r\n\r\nin  informing  the  public on the importance  of  eradicating\r\n\r\ndengue  fever  and  malaria?  What are the figures  for  both\r\n\r\ndiseases?  At the end of 1999, were the figures going  up  or\r\n\r\ndown?   If  it  had  gone  down, what  are  the  contributory\r\n\r\nfactors?  If in 1998 malaria had taken five lives and  dengue\r\n\r\none, what about 1999? Is the death toll increasing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were informed that 369 malaria cases were brought in\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas.  What measures have been taken to reduce  the\r\n\r\nfigure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, how many researches were conducted by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment so  that  dengue  and  malaria\r\n\r\nproblems could be overcome, if not eradicated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of the Environment will continue to\r\n\r\ndo the necessary to ensure that Singapore is free from dengue\r\n\r\nand  malaria.  We do not want our country, known as a  \"clean\r\n\r\nand green city\" to be otherwise.  Not many tourists will come\r\n\r\nif there is a dengue and malaria epidemic in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well-known for its cleanliness and greenery\r\n\r\nand her citizens live in comfort. According to WHO, water and\r\n\r\nair pollution is  well under control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public and private sectors have both actively\r\n\r\nparticipated in various projects to enhance our  healthy  and\r\n\r\nclean  environment such as the \"Clean and Green  Week  1998\".\r\n\r\nAll  these  activities will enhance public awareness  on  the\r\n\r\nimportance of living in a clean and green environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1996, refuse collection has been privatised and\r\n\r\ntaken   over   by  SEMAC  Pte  Ltd  (Singapore  Environmental\r\n\r\nManagement  Company).  I have been informed that  to  enhance\r\n\r\ncleanliness,  the Ministry of the Environment has  introduced\r\n\r\ncompetitors to collect 7,790 tonnes of refuse per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the administrative point of view, the effort of the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   the  Environment  is  commendable   but,   in\r\n\r\npracticality,  we  find  that in recent  months,  the  refuse\r\n\r\ncollection  has not been going on smoothly and  according  to\r\n\r\nschedule.  At times, we find that the collectors were slow in\r\n\r\ncollecting   the   refuse   and   the   job   performed   was\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  They used to collect the refuse  very  early\r\n\r\nin  the morning.  However, they suddenly did not collect  the\r\n\r\nrefuse  for  one or two days.  What worries me is that  their\r\n\r\ninconsistency  and slow clearance of the refuse  would  bring\r\n\r\nabout an unhealthy environment and various diseases.  Do  the\r\n\r\nselected  contractors lack the experience?  Or is it  because\r\n\r\nthey  lack manpower?  In addition, they use smaller  vehicles\r\n\r\ncompared to the ones used by the Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\nWhat  action would the Ministry take on the contractors  that\r\n\r\ncould not complete their tasks?  When will the new tenders be\r\n\r\nreleased?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the selection of contractors for this task, I\r\n\r\nhope  the Ministry of the Environment would be more selective\r\n\r\nand  it  should impose heavier punishment to be  rendered  on\r\n\r\ncontractors who could not perform their job satisfactorily so\r\n\r\nthat Singapore's status as a \"clean city\" is ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my cut is on refuse collection\r\n\r\nfrom   residential  properties.  When  the  Ministry  engages\r\n\r\nprivate   contractors   to  collect  rubbish   from   private\r\n\r\nresidential  properties,  it sends a  letter  asking  private\r\n\r\nhouse  owners  not to use rubbish bins, but to tie  up  their\r\n\r\nrubbish  in plastic bags and leave them outside their  houses\r\n\r\nearly in the morning. Their collection trucks are supposed to\r\n\r\ncome early to collect those rubbish that are left outside  in\r\n\r\nthe open. The problems are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The rubbish trucks do not come early as promised\r\n\r\nbut  come in the late morning or sometimes past twelve  noon.\r\n\r\nBy  then, dogs and cats would have torn up those plastic bags\r\n\r\nto  look for food and pieces of fish bones, chicken bones and\r\n\r\nother perishable materials would be strewn on the road, which\r\n\r\nare  not only very unsightly but also attract flies and other\r\n\r\ninsects;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Some householders do not employ maids and cannot\r\n\r\nget  up at 5 am or 6 am to leave the rubbish outside. So they\r\n\r\ntake  out  the rubbish and leave them outside in  the  night.\r\n\r\nThat  is  even worse. The rubbish left out in the  night  are\r\n\r\nsure to attract not only dogs and cats, but rats as well. The\r\n\r\nplastic bags will be torn open and foodstuff and other  waste\r\n\r\nmaterials would be strewn all over the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that private houses also have\r\n\r\ngardens  and  they often leave cut branches, cut grass,  dead\r\n\r\nbranches  and  other debris outside their  houses.  For  some\r\n\r\nunknown  reasons, the rubbish collectors do not seem  anxious\r\n\r\nto  collect  them away in a hurry. Such rubbish left  outside\r\n\r\nthe  nice  houses situated in nice estates can  be  quite  an\r\n\r\neyesore  and  do not look well for the general appearance  of\r\n\r\nthe  estate.  Can you imagine if visitors from  overseas  are\r\n\r\nbrought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround  to see some of those private housing estates and  the\r\n\r\nbeautifully built houses, costing a few million dollars each,\r\n\r\nwith  piles  and  heaps of rubbish left  in  front  of  those\r\n\r\nbeautiful  houses?   The Ministry should do  something  about\r\n\r\nrubbish  collection in private estates.  I still think  using\r\n\r\nstandardised  rubbish bins like the ones  used  in  Australia\r\n\r\nwould be the best solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem which I would like to highlight is that\r\n\r\nI  notice  nearly  all  the rubbish collectors  do  not  wear\r\n\r\ngloves.  I do not know whether those rubbish collectors  take\r\n\r\non  second jobs as food handlers at hawker centres.   If  so,\r\n\r\nthey  need a lot of washing of their hands when they take  on\r\n\r\ntheir second jobs at hawker centres.  I think it is good that\r\n\r\nrubbish collectors be supplied with gloves and to ensure that\r\n\r\nthey  wear them.  It is also for their own safety.  They  may\r\n\r\nsometimes  be handling broken bottles or pieces of glass  and\r\n\r\nbroken  branches with thorns, and they may get hurt.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry shall take note and do something with regard  to\r\n\r\nwhat I have just pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nrecently, the issue of public toilets seems to be a hot topic\r\n\r\nfor public discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the TV news recently that some public\r\n\r\ntoilets in United Kingdom had to be closed down because  they\r\n\r\nwere  not  properly maintained.  The residents  and  visitors\r\n\r\nwere not happy and complained about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Korea, great care is taken to keep the public toilets\r\n\r\nspick-and-span.   The people there are so proud  of  it  that\r\n\r\ntourists  are often invited to visit the toilets, and  almost\r\n\r\nwithout  fail,  the toilets would win full  marks  for  their\r\n\r\ncleanliness.  In Japan, cleanliness of public toilets is also\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously.  When high-ranking officers from Japan  are\r\n\r\ninvited  to  visit your factory, the first thing  they  would\r\n\r\nlook  at  is your toilet. If your toilet is clean,  he  would\r\n\r\nhave confidence in the management of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyour  company.   But if your toilet is dirty and  messy,  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  he  would draw is that there  must  be  something\r\n\r\nwrong with the management.  In China, the public toilets  are\r\n\r\nnotorious for their uncomplimentary characteristics, some  of\r\n\r\nthe  public toilets have no doors.  If you want to go to  the\r\n\r\ntoilet,  you  need  to  bring  an  umbrella  with  you.    In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  of  course, we are not as good  as  in  Korea  or\r\n\r\nJapan, but we are not as bad as those in China or England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong has said that if we want\r\n\r\nSingapore to become a gracious society, we have to start from\r\n\r\nour  toilets.  If  we  cannot keep  our   toilets  clean  and\r\n\r\npresentable, how can we talk about having a gracious society?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in the process of picking the cleanest hawker\r\n\r\ncentre  in Singapore, I found that some of the public toilets\r\n\r\nin the hawker centres were very old and in very bad shape.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  renovate  all  these  public  toilets   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I have a few questions for the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how many public toilets are there\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and  if we want to upgrade  all  these  public\r\n\r\ntoilets, how much would it cost the Government.  When can the\r\n\r\nGovernment  start  to  upgrade them  and  when  can  this  be\r\n\r\ncompleted?   Secondly, after upgrading these public  toilets,\r\n\r\ncan the Ministry of the Environment set up some guidelines on\r\n\r\nhow  to maintain these public toilets so that the money spent\r\n\r\non  upgrading them would not go down the drain? Thirdly,  can\r\n\r\nthe  toilets  in the coffeeshops in HDB estates  and  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector be also included in the upgrading  programme?\r\n\r\nFourthly,  can we have the cleanest public toilet competition\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?  When we have this competition,  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ncan  pick  the three cleanest toilets and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nsingle out the three most dirty toilets so that something can\r\n\r\nbe  done  about them.  I believe we should take  this  matter\r\n\r\nseriously. Only then can we enjoy the reputation of  being  a\r\n\r\ncountry  with  the cleanest public toilets  around.   Lastly,\r\n\r\nwhen we are upgrading these toilets, we should also look into\r\n\r\nthe facilities of these toilets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I led a lion dance troupe to take part in a\r\n\r\ncompetition in Guangzhou, China.

I was not convinced, so I went into the toilet\r\n\r\nto  check  for  myself.   To my surprise, I  found  that  the\r\n\r\ntoilet  was  fitted with the latest type of  automatic  taps.\r\n\r\nAll  you  had to do was to put your hands under the  tap  and\r\n\r\nwater  would flow out and stop automatically.  They are  more\r\n\r\nadvanced  than we are, so much so that our boys did not  know\r\n\r\nhow  to  use  these  modern gadgets.  Yes,  we  are  actually\r\n\r\nfalling  behind  the Chinese.  Yet we are  frequently  joking\r\n\r\nabout  the  pathetic state of some of their  public  toilets!\r\n\r\nPerhaps, it is time for us to catch up by installing some  of\r\n\r\nthese  modern taps which are more hygienic as we do  have  to\r\n\r\ntouch them to turn them on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would consider my suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, it is my understanding\r\n\r\nthat the Environment Ministry has since the late 80s, stopped\r\n\r\nissuing    new   hawker   stall   licences   to   applicants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, new markets and eating centres developed by the\r\n\r\nHDB  are now tendered out en-bloc to private contractors  who\r\n\r\nin  turn  rent  these  stalls  to  private  operators  at   a\r\n\r\ncommercial rate.  The operators will typically be  those  who\r\n\r\nare  well-established in the trade, or are connected  to  the\r\n\r\nparty who won the bid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens is that common people who are interested in\r\n\r\nrenting  these  stalls  but who do  not  have  the  necessary\r\n\r\nbusiness experience or financial ability, or for that  matter\r\n\r\nconnection, have a hard time trying to get a stall  at  these\r\n\r\ncentres.  Unfortunately, the people who need to set up  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to make a living for the family are  usually  not\r\n\r\nthe   ones   with  the  financial  ability  or  the  business\r\n\r\nexperience.

These would include cases where there  is\r\n\r\nonly one parent in a family to support young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as things go, there are many more\r\n\r\napplications  for  such  stalls than they  are  available  in\r\n\r\nschool  canteens. For my constituency alone, there  were  500\r\n\r\napplications  for four vacancies in a school canteen  when  a\r\n\r\nnew  school was opened recently.  While the school  tried  to\r\n\r\nallocate  the  stalls on the basis of financial  need,  there\r\n\r\nwere  many other equally needy families who had to be  turned\r\n\r\naway.   In  other  words, the fact that  there  are  so  many\r\n\r\napplications for such stalls from a sizeable number of people\r\n\r\nwith financial need would suggest that there is a crying need\r\n\r\nfor more of such stalls to be made available to them. We have\r\n\r\nalways  advocated the principle that we should not only  just\r\n\r\ngive our people fish but we should teach them to fish so that\r\n\r\nthey can help themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government\r\n\r\nwould  reconsider  its  policy of not  issuing  hawker  stall\r\n\r\nlicences  and to consider setting aside more stalls  for  the\r\n\r\nneedy. Perhaps as a suggestion, the Government should do  the\r\n\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to have a certain number of hawker stalls or\r\n\r\nmarket stalls set aside for the poor and needy families while\r\n\r\nthe  rest  can  be  tendered out.   Secondly,  to  set  basic\r\n\r\ncriteria  that  the families must meet in order  to  qualify.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to have information and advice on hand to teach  and\r\n\r\nhelp  these families to run the business.  Lastly, to provide\r\n\r\nsome soft loans as start-up capital if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make Singapore the best home for our people.\r\n\r\nWe do not want this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement  to  ring hollow for the poorer  Singaporeans.

Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, it is received wisdom\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore has no resources and therefore in  our  power\r\n\r\nneeds,  we  have to rely on fossil fuels like oil,  coal  and\r\n\r\neven  natural gas.  It is, of course, important for strategic\r\n\r\nreasons  that  we should vary the sources of energy  that  we\r\n\r\nhave and so we have actually signed deals with Indonesia, for\r\n\r\nexample, to use natural gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I think that we are sometimes wrong when we\r\n\r\nsay  that we have no resources and people would say that  our\r\n\r\nresource  is  manpower but we cannot have people running  and\r\n\r\nkeeping  the power stations' turbines turning.  So,  we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  think  of  realistic resources.  And  one  realistic\r\n\r\nresource is sunshine.  We have lots of sunshine each year.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is important for us to harness this energy to  give\r\n\r\nus our needs in electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do understand that solar power energy is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  convert and the technology is still  not  very\r\n\r\nadvanced  and it requires huge amounts of money and  lots  of\r\n\r\nspace  for  the solar panels.  I would just like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  if they could give the House an update on  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  efforts that can be made in this area.  Perhaps we could\r\n\r\nthink of tax incentives or grants to the universities here to\r\n\r\ndo  research into solar panels, so that eventually  we  could\r\n\r\nfind some technology which we can use for our power needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the emission of\r\n\r\nblack  smoke from heavy vehicles is one issue that we discuss\r\n\r\nyear  in and year out.  Last year, this matter was taken over\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry  of the Environment.  Now the  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nstepping  up enforcement against the offenders.  From  August\r\n\r\nlast year to February this year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  5,820  heavy  vehicles  and  1,900  motorcycles   were\r\n\r\nsummoned for emission of black smoke.  Perhaps these vehicles\r\n\r\nwere  too old, probably exceeding 10 years.  Therefore,  some\r\n\r\nowners of these vehicles are suggesting that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe   Environment  or  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology could give them some incentives  such\r\n\r\nas  reserving  COEs for them, so that they can replace  their\r\n\r\nvehicles to solve the problem once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they have doubts on the accuracy of the video\r\n\r\ncameras used to detect the black smoke.  Is there some way we\r\n\r\ncan  help  drivers  of  heavy  vehicles  to  condition  their\r\n\r\nvehicles and to prevent the emission of black smoke?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Malaysian registered vehicles are running on\r\n\r\nour   roads.   Will  they  be  also  subjected  to  the  same\r\n\r\nenforcement  action?   Are  they also  issued  summonses  for\r\n\r\nemission of black smoke too?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty is too heavy. I believe for the first\r\n\r\noffender,  the fine is $500.  At this time when  the  economy\r\n\r\nhas  not fully recovered, this is a very heavy burden on  the\r\n\r\ndrivers  of  these heavy vehicles.  I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  or  not we could give  them  some  rebates\r\n\r\nduring this difficult time.  Do not fine them so heavily and,\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, use other ways to educate them on how  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  emission of black smoke and how to maintain  or\r\n\r\nservice  their vehicles so that they will not  have  to  face\r\n\r\nthis predicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, we all know that we\r\n\r\nlive  in the 21st century with advanced technology in  almost\r\n\r\nevery frontier of science.  Yet, we are still haunted by  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty in controlling diesel smoke from the more than 100\r\n\r\nyears old technology.  It seems to be an insult to mankind in\r\n\r\nthis modern information age.  As I said in last year's speech\r\n\r\non  diesel  pollution, the diesel technology is  so  advanced\r\n\r\nthat preventing diesel vehicles from having smoky exhausts is\r\n\r\nno big deal.  Why do so many people still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplain of being booked for emitting excessive diesel smoke?\r\n\r\nThey  are  either ignorant of the technology or they  do  not\r\n\r\nbother about their vehicles until they are caught and fined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt we are in the IT age. Some people just do\r\n\r\nnot practise the right thing.  Instead, they cut corners, try\r\n\r\nto  save  some  work and some money.  In the case  of  diesel\r\n\r\nvehicles,   some  vehicle  owners,  instead   of   practising\r\n\r\npreventive  maintenance, they practise breakdown repair.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, they only maintain their vehicle when it breaks\r\n\r\ndown.  This is really unfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with such diesel emission violation, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  imposes  heavy fines on both  the  driver  and  the\r\n\r\nowner,  and I have no qualms about this.  However, as a  form\r\n\r\nof education, incentives and disincentives might perhaps help\r\n\r\nto  improve  the present system of penalty.  As the  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  responsible for the policy on environmental pollution  by\r\n\r\nvehicles, certain incentive concept could be built  into  the\r\n\r\nlaw  to  better achieve the goal in pollution  control.   One\r\n\r\ncould  ask  the recalcitrant vehicle owner for more  frequent\r\n\r\ninspections, say, half yearly instead of annual, for  private\r\n\r\nlorries  and  cars.  Those who always manage  to  keep  their\r\n\r\nexhausts  clean could be granted incentives by having  lesser\r\n\r\ninspections,  say,  biennially.   Those  who  are   genuinely\r\n\r\nignorant  of  how to keep exhausts clean could  be  sent  for\r\n\r\ncourses  in ITE.  Could the Minister comment on this proposed\r\n\r\nmeasure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2-stroke motorcycles, under the current\r\n\r\nregulations,  registration of new  2-stroke  motorcycles  has\r\n\r\nstopped.   But  there are still many on the road  which  were\r\n\r\nregistered  prior  to  the new regulation.   The  exhaust  of\r\n\r\nunburnt  hydrocarbon  from  these  2-stroke  motorcycles   is\r\n\r\nexcessive,  visible,  smelly  and  irritate  our  visual  and\r\n\r\nrespiratory  system.   I  recall  that  once  I   entered   a\r\n\r\nmotorcycle  lane at the Causeway Checkpoint by mistake.   The\r\n\r\nlevel of hydrocarbon from the motorcycles in the holding area\r\n\r\nwas highly unbearable and almost suffocating.  One\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhearing  this may just come to the conclusion that these  are\r\n\r\nMalaysian  motorcycles.   To many  people's  surprise,  these\r\n\r\nmotorcycles bear Singapore registration plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the case, many of the old 2-stroke\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  are  already  being  disowned  by   our   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It is time that we should consider phasing out\r\n\r\nall these old and polluted machines from the road.  We have a\r\n\r\nCOE  system which entitles all vehicles to be on the road for\r\n\r\n20  years  upon paying the prevailing COE premium, regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether  the  vehicle complies with our current  emission\r\n\r\nstandards.   In the case of the 2-stroke motorcycles,  it  is\r\n\r\ntime  for  us to phase them out completely on the  ground  of\r\n\r\npollution  when their current COEs expire.   It is insensible\r\n\r\nfor  one  to pay so much for owning an environmentally  clean\r\n\r\nvehicle, yet allowing this obvious pollution generator to  be\r\n\r\nstill  on  the  road.   Could the Minister  comment  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our car users have invested very heavily in keeping\r\n\r\nthe  high quality of clean air in Singapore, because cars are\r\n\r\nvery  expensive,  partially  because  of  the  anti-pollution\r\n\r\ndevices.   I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nimposing  the same vehicle emission standard for all  foreign\r\n\r\nvehicles entering Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, motorcyclists are now\r\n\r\ncharged  for the offence of polluted exhaust based  on  video\r\n\r\nevidence.  This topic was recently discussed in the media but\r\n\r\ndoubts linger.  The practice of using video evidence for this\r\n\r\npurpose is a departure from previous practice where a vehicle\r\n\r\nwas  stopped  to  have its exhaust measured  for  pollutants.\r\n\r\nSome  measurements were made and if the numbers  exceed  some\r\n\r\nvalues,  the motorcyclist was then charged.  Today, it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  an  enforcement officer merely carries a video  camera,\r\n\r\ntakes  a  video  of  a vehicle with smoke emitting  from  its\r\n\r\nexhaust and then sends the motorcyclist a summons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description may seem simplistic, but this is how\r\n\r\nthe public sees it.   Many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestions  come to mind.  Some dangerous gases are colourless\r\n\r\nand  not all coloured gases are dangerous.  Besides, what  is\r\n\r\ncaptured on the video also depends on the lighting conditions\r\n\r\nat  the time and place.  In the past, some numbers had to  be\r\n\r\nadduced  by  measurement to substantiate the charge.   Unless\r\n\r\nthe  legislation has been changed, what scientific basis  has\r\n\r\nbeen used to unmistakably correlate the video evidence to the\r\n\r\npreviously  used  measurements in terms  of  the  nature  and\r\n\r\ndensity of the polluting chemicals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question because some motorcyclists who have\r\n\r\nbeen  so  charged had sent their vehicles for  the  mandatory\r\n\r\nannual  check-up of their machines.  The vehicles passed  the\r\n\r\nexhaust  test carried out in the traditional way.  I want  to\r\n\r\nclarify that the check-ups were carried out at about the same\r\n\r\ntime  that  the  vehicles were said  to  have  committed  the\r\n\r\npolluting  offence.  The motorcyclists assured me  that  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  modify their vehicles in any way before the  check-ups.   As a result, they were very baffled.  However, if  the\r\n\r\nlegislation has been amended to admit this form of  evidence,\r\n\r\nthen  I assume that there is some basis for its use that will\r\n\r\nstand up to scientific and legal scrutiny.  This is important\r\n\r\nas  most  vehicles, be it motorcycles, cars, lorries, trucks,\r\n\r\netc, do emit some smoke sometimes.  I would appreciate it  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister could share with the House the basis upon which\r\n\r\nvideo evidence is now used as evidence and, in so doing, help\r\n\r\nto  answer some of the questions that I have just raised  and\r\n\r\nhence  assure  the  public  of  the  soundness  of  this  new\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, in Singapore, foul\r\n\r\nsmell  is  not  a pollution controlled parameter,  unless  it\r\n\r\ncauses  public nuisance or public health.  It is not uncommon\r\n\r\nthat  people are irritated by foul smell, either from rubbish\r\n\r\nbin  centres,  rubbish chutes, liquid leakage   from  garbage\r\n\r\ntrucks  and smell from the farms.  Most of the people in  the\r\n\r\ngarbage   collection  business  proudly  claim   that   their\r\n\r\noperations  are mechanised.  However, in their dealings  with\r\n\r\nfoul smell from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngarbage, nothing much has been done, partly because there  is\r\n\r\nno  environmental control requirement and partly because  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  immune to the smell after their  frequent  daily\r\n\r\ncontact with garbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that some odour standard should be set by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  keep all the odour generators  from  moderating\r\n\r\ntheir  emission.   Certain operational  guidelines  could  be\r\n\r\nrecommended  for the bin centres, chutes and  liquid  leakage\r\n\r\nfrom garbage trucks, so that some physical installations  are\r\n\r\nin place to avoid or reduce the generation of foul smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foul smell is not only in Chua Chu Kang. I think\r\n\r\nplaces  like Cheng San and other places also have  a  similar\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Especially PAP wards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I would like to talk\r\n\r\nabout  smell from animal waste from the farms.  It is  common\r\n\r\nthat  people  complain about smell from the farms  and  point\r\n\r\ntheir  fingers directly or immediately at the egg farms  that\r\n\r\ngenerate  the  waste.   There is no doubt  that  these  farms\r\n\r\ngenerate  the  waste.  But the smell of the  waste  could  be\r\n\r\nintensified  by the widespread application of the  biological\r\n\r\nfertiliser  used  by  the landscape companies  and  vegetable\r\n\r\nfarmers.   The  reason is that we now have so-called  organic\r\n\r\nfarm  products which are very attractive to consumers.  So  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  biological fertilisers are used and they generate  a\r\n\r\nlot of smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain farms have their own waste treatment facility.\r\n\r\nThose who do not have waste treatment facility supply the raw\r\n\r\nuntreated waste to farmers.  And the way the farmer uses  the\r\n\r\nraw  waste  can cause the objectionable smell that  leads  to\r\n\r\npeople's complaint.  On one occasion, a NUS researcher wanted\r\n\r\nto do a modelling of the pollution dispersion from a chicken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarm.  When the farmer asked him to provide some data to know\r\n\r\nwhat   will   be  the  acceptable  emission  level   at   the\r\n\r\ncomplainant's end, no answer was given.  What does  it  mean?\r\n\r\nIt  means that even the pollution researcher himself  has  no\r\n\r\nbasic  pollution emission standard for him to use as a  basis\r\n\r\nfor  his study.  In other words, there is no standard of what\r\n\r\nthe  odour  level will be acceptable.  Without an  acceptable\r\n\r\nodour  limit  on  the complainant's end, the complaint  would\r\n\r\nthen become relatively arbitrary.  In my view, we should  try\r\n\r\nto find out from other advanced countries and learn from them\r\n\r\nhow  we  could set an acceptable odour limit.  Only by  doing\r\n\r\nso,  our  farmers could then concentrate on their  production\r\n\r\nissue  instead  of  having  to deal  with  the  environmental\r\n\r\nofficers every now and then when the people complain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have guidelines for the planters to\r\n\r\nfollow if they are using the untreated biological fertiliser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, I wish to thank all Members for bringing up a wide range\r\n\r\nof  environmental  issues.  This gives me an  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nclarify   the  situation  and  also  to  explain   some   new\r\n\r\ninitiatives on the part of the Ministry.  I was very happy to\r\n\r\nnote  also that the debate has been very lively and it  seems\r\n\r\nto have provided a lot of room for humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Heng Chiang Meng's point that environment is\r\n\r\neverybody's  concern, and it is unfortunate that the  present\r\n\r\nsituation of our clean streets and low level of littering  is\r\n\r\nmainly  due to the work of our cleaners.  Ideally, we  should\r\n\r\nevolve  to  a  stage where people just do  not  litter.   The\r\n\r\nschools are teaching the students this.  Day-in day-out  they\r\n\r\nare teaching them not to litter, how to clean toilets and  so\r\n\r\non.    Unfortunately,  this  message  still  has   not   been\r\n\r\ninternalised.  I think this could be partly due to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat a lot of people moved from the kampongs and the villages\r\n\r\nin  the past.  In those days when you were in the village, it\r\n\r\ndid not matter, you just threw your rubbish everywhere.  If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  were living in a low rise attap house, it did not matter\r\n\r\nif  you  threw  out  your TV set, if  you  wanted  to.    But\r\n\r\nnowadays  if you are living in a highrise building,  you  may\r\n\r\nkill somebody.  In fact, some years back when I first started\r\n\r\nas  an  MP, I think HDB had to station teams to catch  people\r\n\r\nwho  threw  bags of curry powder out from their  windows  and\r\n\r\ncaused a lot of problems.  Hopefully, this situation has  now\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, littering is still a problem. If Members\r\n\r\nhave  good ideas on how to overcome this problem, I would  be\r\n\r\nmost grateful.  Of course, we are also trying to involve  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, and as mentioned by my predecessor, Mr  Yeo  Cheow\r\n\r\nTong,  we should have a civic group to help us in this  area.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  am happy to announce that we  have  this  year\r\n\r\nformed  a  private group known as the Anti-Littering Steering\r\n\r\nCommittee  which is chaired by Mr Wong Yew Kwan,  the  former\r\n\r\nCommissioner   of  Parks  and  Recreation  Department.    The\r\n\r\nCommittee  consists of some 20 civic-minded individuals  from\r\n\r\nboth the private and public sectors as well as non-government\r\n\r\norganisations.  So far, they have had two meetings this  year\r\n\r\nsince its formation and I am hoping they will be able to come\r\n\r\nout  with some fresh perspectives and fresh ideas on  how  we\r\n\r\ncan tackle this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.20 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, for us, there are also other people who are\r\n\r\nsimilarly civic-minded and I would like here just to  mention\r\n\r\na few groups.

Also, there is the  Waterways\r\n\r\nWatch  Society, which consists of members who  come  together\r\n\r\nand  patrol the Singapore River in the Society's boats  on  a\r\n\r\nregular basis every Sunday to look out for stretches  of  the\r\n\r\nriver that are polluted.  They will then provide the feedback\r\n\r\nto my Ministry and to the Marine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Port  Authority to take action.  Fortunately, after  all\r\n\r\nthese  years  of  cleaning up the river, we have  achieved  a\r\n\r\ntremendous result.  And if you compare the condition  of  the\r\n\r\nriver  at  the time when we were children, many  of  us  were\r\n\r\nschooling  in town, the river was just terrible.  We  had  to\r\n\r\nhold our noses when we went by.  Now it is clean and fish  is\r\n\r\nable to breed.  We have not only cleaned up all the unsewered\r\n\r\nareas,  but  we  have sewered them.  We have cleaned  up  the\r\n\r\nrivers, provided drainage  and so on.  But also we have these\r\n\r\nbooms  which trap the rubbish.  These are placed  at  various\r\n\r\nlocations draining into the Singapore River.  Even now, every\r\n\r\nday  my  Ministry has to collect some two tonnes of  rubbish.\r\n\r\nWe  must  continue to press on with our efforts to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat the environment is kept clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Prof. Toh that we do pay special\r\n\r\nattention  to  the Singapore River and the civic  areas.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, these are very crowded places, especially where there\r\n\r\nare  food  centres.   It is important that  these  areas  are\r\n\r\nprovided  with  adequate facilities to handle the  volume  of\r\n\r\nrubbish.  We have our inspectors go around to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthey do not throw rubbish into the river.  Unfortunately,  as\r\n\r\nit  was mentioned, the river is not spotlessly clean all  the\r\n\r\ntime.  We do have to be vigilant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned that some vehicles keep their\r\n\r\nengines running in Chinatown when they drop the tourists off.\r\n\r\nIf  possible, they should shut off their engines  and  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  volume  of  pollution.  But it is fair that  before  the\r\n\r\ntourists go on board they cool down the bus a little bit.  So\r\n\r\nfor  a  few minutes, they should run their engines  and  cool\r\n\r\ndown  the buses.  Otherwise they should shut down the engines\r\n\r\nand avoid polluting the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang seems to say that our fines are too\r\n\r\nheavy and CWO is not working.  I am not so pessimistic.   The\r\n\r\ndata is a bit difficult to interpret because it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npartly depends on where our officers are, whether they happen\r\n\r\nto  catch the people and also the amount of manpower we  have\r\n\r\nto  deploy.  This idea of empowering more civilians is a good\r\n\r\none.   Of  course,  I  do not know how many  individuals  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to do it.  We have offered it to grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nand  some  of  them are reluctant because they have  to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir  neighbours and there is always this fear that  if  you\r\n\r\nare  too  tough  you  might get a bloody nose,  or  something\r\n\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen mentioned an interesting point, and that\r\n\r\nis  the condominiums seem to be cleaner.  I think this has to\r\n\r\ndo with the mindset.  He has a valid point there, although Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia Khiang seems to think otherwise.  It is a fact that\r\n\r\nsomehow  when they move into a better environment  they  have\r\n\r\nthis  feeling of responsibility.  I think within condominiums\r\n\r\nand  private housing they have a greater sense of  ownership.\r\n\r\nSo  the residents are more careful.   For example, in private\r\n\r\nestates  the lifts are generally cleaner.  Whereas  for  many\r\n\r\nyears, the HDB lifts are terrible.  Every time I went for  my\r\n\r\nhouse-to-house visits we just had to bear the stench  in  the\r\n\r\nlifts,  so much so that we have to depend not only on  public\r\n\r\neducation but also on installing the devices in the lifts  to\r\n\r\nactually catch the people who urinate in the lifts.    So  we\r\n\r\ncan come out with new ideas, not just educating people, using\r\n\r\npeer  pressure and so on, but maybe new devices, new methods,\r\n\r\nnew perspectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to touch on this point raised by Prof. Low\r\n\r\nSeow  Chay about the recycling of sewerage effluent.   He  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.   We are in the process of setting up a pilot  plant\r\n\r\nof 10,000 cubic metres per day capacity at the Bedok Sewerage\r\n\r\nTreatment Works.  It is currently under construction and will\r\n\r\nbe  in  operation in May.  So it is not quite operating  yet.\r\n\r\nThereafter physical, chemical and micro-biological tests will\r\n\r\nbe  carried out over a two-year period on water samples  from\r\n\r\nthe  plant.   The  purpose  of  the  plant  is  to  test  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  costs for consideration  as  an  alternative\r\n\r\nsource  of  reclaimed water.  The reclaimed  water  from  the\r\n\r\nplant will be used for non-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotable  applications  such as watering  of  lawns  and  golf\r\n\r\ncourses and for industrial use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in extreme cases, if you look just at water\r\n\r\nscientifically, it can be shown that the quality is  as  good\r\n\r\nas  water  from natural catchments.  It can even be used  for\r\n\r\ndrinking but  there is the psychological barrier we  have  to\r\n\r\novercome.   It is a fact that in some countries water  is  in\r\n\r\nfact  recycled many times.  If you are living along the banks\r\n\r\nof the Thames River, for example, by the time you receive the\r\n\r\nwater downstream, I do not know how many times the cycle  has\r\n\r\ngone  through. Of course, the natural system is that sunlight\r\n\r\nbrings  up  the water and it comes down as rain and  you  are\r\n\r\nquite  happy  with  that.  But when  you  use  the  technical\r\n\r\ntreatment to get clean water from the sewerage effluent,  you\r\n\r\ncan use it for industrial purposes.  I think we still have to\r\n\r\npause and do proper education if we ever want to put it back,\r\n\r\nsay,   as   a  source  of  raw  water.   So  these  are   the\r\n\r\npossibilities we are experimenting.  Of course, we  are  also\r\n\r\ndoing  work on reverse osmosis processes for the desalination\r\n\r\nof  sea water.  In Singapore, there is a good case for us  to\r\n\r\nput  in all the efforts and allow research into various means\r\n\r\nof  reclaiming  water,  both from  the  sea  and  from  other\r\n\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of genetically modified food is, of course,\r\n\r\na  very  controversial  subject.  It is  the  result  of  the\r\n\r\ntremendous  developments  in  gene  technology  where  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  to take genes from insects, for example, and  plant\r\n\r\nthem  into  crops and so forth, and get qualities which  were\r\n\r\nnot there before.  As a result of this, people are fearful of\r\n\r\nthe  unknown.  At the same time, it promises us solutions  to\r\n\r\nthe  hunger problem, to diseases and all that, but it  raises\r\n\r\nmany  ethical questions.  It raises doubts.  That is why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is following this very closely.  It is a potential\r\n\r\narea  for  us to develop.  We are putting a lot of  resources\r\n\r\ninto research.  We hope to be a centre of life sciences,  not\r\n\r\nonly  in terms of R&D, but in terms of manufacturing  and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we monitor how the international\r\n\r\ncommunity is reacting to all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.   It  is not a straightforward question of  wanting  to\r\n\r\nknow.  It is also a question of trade protectionism.  If  you\r\n\r\nwere  a  big  country like the US and 50% of the crops,  soya\r\n\r\nbeans  or  corns are from these sources, and your  scientists\r\n\r\nhave  already  done all they can to make sure that  they  are\r\n\r\nsafe and if you compare that the  qualities are the same  and\r\n\r\nso  on, then you are fearful that if you start labelling, you\r\n\r\nput  people  off  the crop.  That is why there  is  this  big\r\n\r\nbattle  between  the Europeans and the US over  whether  they\r\n\r\nshould  label.  The Europeans on their part have  not  had  a\r\n\r\ngood  record.  They have handled badly many instances of  the\r\n\r\nmad  cow  disease and dioxin and so on, that the  public  has\r\n\r\nlost confidence in the European governments. Therefore, under\r\n\r\npressure from the NGOs, they are now very forceful, and  also\r\n\r\npressure  from their farmers who are affected  by  all  these\r\n\r\ncrops.   They  are asking for labelling, they  want  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  right  to ban imports and so on.  The US says,  \"Okay,\r\n\r\nyou can do all that, but is it WTO consistent?  Is it a trade\r\n\r\nbarrier?\"   That is why in Singapore we have to  monitor  all\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we want to be a centre for this area.\r\n\r\nWe  want to protect our citizens against some unknown  health\r\n\r\nhazards.   We want to make sure that it does not pollute  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  through introducing genes  that  would  lead  to\r\n\r\nunknown  results.  Whether it is time to label, I think  this\r\n\r\nis a question we have to consider very carefully.  There is a\r\n\r\ncommittee  set up known as the Genetic Modification  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee.  This is chaired by Prof. Lim Pin and it  consists\r\n\r\nof  all  the relevant Ministries, including my Ministry,  PPD\r\n\r\nand  so on.  MTI is, of course, represented.  So we will have\r\n\r\nto   follow  what  is  happening  in  other  areas   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational  scene and then decide for  ourselves  what  is\r\n\r\nbest  for  Singapore.  The assessment has got to be rational.\r\n\r\nIt  must  not  be  coloured by all  these  hue  and  cry  and\r\n\r\nposturings  overseas.   Look  at  the  basics.   Assess   for\r\n\r\nourselves, is it really safe, what you want to do  about  it.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment,  it  is  still premature  for  us  to  start\r\n\r\nlabelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of labelling, if you want to be very stringent\r\n\r\nabout it, can be prohibitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake  soya  sauce,  if  you trace all the  way  back  to  the\r\n\r\nproducers  and  whether the producers are using gene-modified\r\n\r\ncrops,  it is going to be a tremendous effort, and I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure whether it is really practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, they had a meeting in Montreal where they\r\n\r\nreached  an agreement known as the Cartagena Protocol.   This\r\n\r\nwas  really a conference on biodiversity, but somehow the 130\r\n\r\ncountries  which were represented managed to talk about  this\r\n\r\narea as well, what they call living modified organisms.  Some\r\n\r\ncountries seem to have got the point that countries should be\r\n\r\nallowed  to have the control, should be allowed to  stop  the\r\n\r\nimports  of LMOs, or they should be in a position to ask  for\r\n\r\nlabelling,  and  so  on.   But, to  my  mind,   there  is  no\r\n\r\nconsensus yet, and we are monitoring the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members should be careful not to stir up a lot\r\n\r\nof  irrational fears because this is an area of  the  unknown\r\n\r\nand where it is unknown people tend to be very fearful.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  area which is going to have so much impact on mankind\r\n\r\nthat so much attention is being focused on it.  When you  eat\r\n\r\nan ordinary food\r\n\r\nproduct, you do not know what goes into it.  You look at  the\r\n\r\nlabel, so many chemical components.  Have you asked yourself:\r\n\r\nAre  these components safe, and how safe is the world anyway?\r\n\r\nSo  we  have to be careful, but at the same time we  must  be\r\n\r\nrational.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is quite a bit of interest in clean toilets. I\r\n\r\nagree  fully that the measure of the culture of a country  is\r\n\r\nthe cleanliness of its toilets, putting on both my hats (MITA\r\n\r\nand Environment).  Mr Ang Mong Seng mentioned some places  in\r\n\r\nKorea where they are so proud of their toilets that they even\r\n\r\nhave  tourists visit the toilets.  And they say that you  can\r\n\r\nhave tea in the toilets.  Whether we can reach that standard,\r\n\r\nI am not sure.  If you go to some hotels, they are very clean\r\n\r\nand beautifully done up, and you have flowers, paintings and,\r\n\r\nof  course,  you  have  regular cleaning.   And  it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant for hotels to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclean  toilets, because the first thing that turns  away  the\r\n\r\nguests is to see an untidy toilet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we hope to do the same thing in the other sectors.\r\n\r\nWhere  it  concerns the Government toilets, that is  an  easy\r\n\r\nmatter.   The Environment Ministry is already doing  it.   We\r\n\r\nwill  be upgrading the public toilets in all 34 hawker stalls\r\n\r\nwhich  are  managed by Environment.  So far, three have  been\r\n\r\ncompleted at a cost of about half a million dollars.  We hope\r\n\r\nto  complete  the  rest by 2004 at an estimated  cost  of  $4\r\n\r\nmillion.   HDB,  on  its part, has also upgraded  23  of  its\r\n\r\nhawker centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang asked how many public toilets are there.\r\n\r\nSpeaking  from memory here, I think there are something  like\r\n\r\n30,000  public toilets, in coffee shops, hawker centres,  bus\r\n\r\nstops, cinemas, and the rest.  Those are the difficult  ones.\r\n\r\nI  think  for the hotels, the 4- and 5-star hotels, they  are\r\n\r\ngenerally very good.  The shopping centres are generally good\r\n\r\ntoo,  but there is room for improvement.  And there are these\r\n\r\nsmall places where sometimes the facilities are somewhat  old\r\n\r\nand lacking and upkeep is below expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our surveys have shown that there has been an\r\n\r\nimprovement overall, but there is still room for improvement.\r\n\r\nLast   year,   the  Ministry,  together  with  the   experts,\r\n\r\nconsultants and others came up with this guide book,  \"Better\r\n\r\nPublic   Toilets,   Design  and  Maintenance\"   [indicating].\r\n\r\nHopefully,  one  day, all our public toilets will  look  like\r\n\r\nthis [indicating].  This will be a desirable goal.  But if it\r\n\r\nis  a  toilet belonging to a coffeeshop owner, I am not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  you  can use the force of law to say it  must  spend\r\n\r\n$100,000 to upgrade its toilet.  I think there we have to use\r\n\r\npersuasion and maybe incentives.  So this is an area where we\r\n\r\nwill be looking into and the Environment Ministry is chairing\r\n\r\na  committee, involving several other Ministries (HDB, NParks\r\n\r\nand  so  on), to try and give this a special push.  Something\r\n\r\nas mundane as the toilet actually plays a very important part\r\n\r\nin  our  lives.  When people renovate their houses  nowadays,\r\n\r\nthey  pay  a  lot of attention to the toilets,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nrightly so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several questions were asked about vehicle emissions,\r\n\r\nthe  use of the video camera to catch the heavy vehicles  and\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  which emit smoke.  This was done  up  to  August\r\n\r\nlast  year by the Traffic Police.  We decided that we  should\r\n\r\ndo  it  ourselves because pollution is more our  problem  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  other priorities.  When we took over, we  decided\r\n\r\nthat  the best way is actually to use a video camera, because\r\n\r\nyou  have  a  record of the black smoke or the blue-and-white\r\n\r\nsmoke  that  comes from the motorcycles.  For the  two-stroke\r\n\r\nmotorcycles,  if  the owner adds too much  lubricant  to  the\r\n\r\nengine, the result is pollution - blue-and-white smoke.   And\r\n\r\nthis  smoke cannot be tested by the normal machine, which  is\r\n\r\nHSU-based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the regulations, if there is visible smoke, then\r\n\r\nit  is  an offence.  There is no doubt about that.  The limit\r\n\r\nfor  this HSU test, or the Hartridge Smoke Unit test,  is  50\r\n\r\nHSU, that corresponds to visible smoke.  So what we do is  we\r\n\r\nhave  CISCO  police shoot the exhaust of these vehicles,  and\r\n\r\nbased  on  these records, there will be a panel  of  officers\r\n\r\nwithin the Ministry who will decide which cases are bad.  For\r\n\r\nthose cases, they will be issued with summonses to pay  up  a\r\n\r\nfine  as well as to send their vehicles for testing.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  the Traffic Police have to actually test on the  spot.\r\n\r\nAnd basically the HSU tests the same thing, whether there  is\r\n\r\nvisible smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the past was that you have to stop\r\n\r\ntraffic,  and  it was very troublesome.  Many vehicle  owners\r\n\r\njust depended on the Government to catch them.  It was a cat-and-mouse effort.  If I were caught, I would go and  maintain\r\n\r\nmy  machine, clean it up, and then send for testing, and when\r\n\r\nI  pass, everything would be fine.  Now, we say that  if  you\r\n\r\nare caught on this video camera, you will be fined, and after\r\n\r\nthat, you must still get your vehicle properly maintained and\r\n\r\nre-tested.   If  the  person affected is  not  happy,  he  is\r\n\r\ninvited  to come to my Ministry to view the record.  So  far,\r\n\r\nthe  cases that come, the lawyers tell them that there is  no\r\n\r\ncase, that they better pay up.  Because it is very clear,  it\r\n\r\nis all on record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy  officers will give the benefit of the doubt to those  who\r\n\r\nare borderline cases.  If it is clearly very black smoke, you\r\n\r\ncannot  run  away from it.  But if it is slightly smoky,  you\r\n\r\njust  tell the person, go and maintain and clean up,  and  go\r\n\r\nfor a test, and there is no fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, because of the appeals from MPs and others, we\r\n\r\nhave reconsidered the level of the compound fines, especially\r\n\r\nfor  motorcycles.  The previous fine level of  $150  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  offence was rather heavy for some of these  low-income\r\n\r\npeople.   So  I decided to lower it to $70.  And  it  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect  to say that the first offence would incur a  penalty\r\n\r\nof  $500,  as one Member has mentioned.  The actual level  is\r\n\r\n$150   for  heavy  vehicles  for  the  first  offence.    For\r\n\r\nmotorcycles,  it used to be $150, but I have  lowered  it  to\r\n\r\n$70.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked how is it that they were fined,\r\n\r\nand when they went for a test they passed the test.  It is  a\r\n\r\nfact that it is possible to arrange the engines such that you\r\n\r\ncan  pass  the  test,  because the testing  is  under  idling\r\n\r\nconditions.   So  if you rev up your engine, you  do  certain\r\n\r\nthings  to  it,  you  will pass the test.   But  when  it  is\r\n\r\nrunning,  it  is  under load, you will  get  smoke.   We  are\r\n\r\nplanning to counter this problem by introducing what is known\r\n\r\nas the chassis dynamometer test.  This is a test, CDST, which\r\n\r\nhas  already been introduced in Hong Kong, Canada and the US.\r\n\r\nThis  allows  you  to set the load level and  then  test  the\r\n\r\nmachine.   So  there  is no running away  from  this  system.\r\n\r\nThere will be no dispute.  We intend to start doing this from\r\n\r\nSeptember this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Malaysian vehicles, and they used to be very\r\n\r\nbad  polluters, all the motorcycles coming in with their two-stroke cycle engines, and the heavy trucks, we catch them  at\r\n\r\nthe  location near the Causeway when they come in.  For them,\r\n\r\nwe  have to test them and fine them on the spot, because  you\r\n\r\ncannot  go  and take record, send them letters and hope  they\r\n\r\nwill respond.  So for motorcycles and vehicles from Malaysia,\r\n\r\nour teams will spot them, stop them and test them.

In\r\n\r\nfact, if the HSU limit exceeds 50, they will be fined.  If it\r\n\r\nis  above 80, their vehicles will be turned back to Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is, of course, a very heavy penalty for the  goods\r\n\r\nvehicles which are carrying all the goods down from Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to leave the other questions to be answered by\r\n\r\nmy Senior Minister of State, Mr Sidek Saniff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Senior Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik Sidek bin Saniff):</b> Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen asked about\r\n\r\nrecycling.  I agree with Mr Chen that we must learn to reduce\r\n\r\nwastes and, wherever possible, reuse things rather than throw\r\n\r\nthem  away.   The  principle  of \"polluters  pay  principle\",\r\n\r\nsuggested  by Mr Chen, is a good principle which my  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  adopted.  We have implemented a programme to remove  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  in  waste disposal.  Disposal fees will increase  to\r\n\r\n$87  per tonne over the next few years, as announced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are problems on the proposal to charge fees\r\n\r\nfor  the increasing amount of waste thrown by residents.   In\r\n\r\nour  HDB estates, common refuse chutes make it impossible  to\r\n\r\nidentify  the resident and the amount of refuse he  generated\r\n\r\nfor  charging purposes.  In our landed property  estates,  we\r\n\r\nhave  considered the use of pre-paid bags, but realised  that\r\n\r\nunidentified  bags would create collection problems,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  these problems.  Nonetheless, we will continue to  work\r\n\r\nwith  our  public waste collection contractors on schemes  to\r\n\r\nencourage the minimisation of waste generation.  Due  to  our\r\n\r\ntropical  weather,  refuse has to be  disposed  of  daily  to\r\n\r\nprevent  public health problems, rather than what the  Member\r\n\r\nsuggested, about three days once as in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Encik Harun Ghani asked about flood prone areas.\r\n\r\nThere  are now 250 hectares of flood prone areas as  compared\r\n\r\nto some 3,200 hectares in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  1970s.  These flood prone areas are located in some  117\r\n\r\nlocations  across  the island.  The permanent  ones  are  the\r\n\r\nChinatown  area, Alexandra Road area, including Jervois  Road\r\n\r\nand  Margaret Drive, Opera Estate, Lorong 101, Changi and the\r\n\r\nFarrer Park area.  Some roads which are prone to flash floods\r\n\r\ninclude  Balestier Road, Killiney Road and Selegie Road.   At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  we  are improving the Alexandra  canal  between\r\n\r\nTanglin  Road  and  Kim  Seng  Road  to  reduce  flooding  in\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road,  including Jervois Road and Margaret  Drive.\r\n\r\nWe  are  also  building a new drainage  pumping  station  cum\r\n\r\nstorage   pond   to   keep  the  Opera   Estate   flood-free.\r\n\r\nConstruction  work  for many other drainage  projects  is  in\r\n\r\nprogress.  These projects, when completed, will help to bring\r\n\r\ndown the number of flood prone areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, it is not feasible to completely rid\r\n\r\nSingapore of all floods.  Firstly, some of the areas, such as\r\n\r\nthose  in  Chinatown, Boat Quay and Dakota Crescent are  very\r\n\r\nlow-lying and are barely above the high tide level.  The only\r\n\r\neconomically  feasible  method  at  present  to  resolve  the\r\n\r\nflooding  in  these  areas  is  to  fill  up  the  land  upon\r\n\r\nredevelopment.  Secondly, there is a limit to  which  we  can\r\n\r\nwiden  drains  because  land is a constraint.   Very  intense\r\n\r\nrainfall which may occur once in every five years or so would\r\n\r\noverwhelm  the  capacity of the drains  and  cause  temporary\r\n\r\nflash floods.  Such floods, however, would be minor and of  a\r\n\r\nshort-term duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun also asked whether in 10 years' time\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be  free  from flood.   Out  of  these  250\r\n\r\nhectares,  we  are  left  only  with  about  70  hectares  at\r\n\r\nChinatown.    If   there  is  redevelopment,   there   is   a\r\n\r\npossibility,  whether it is five years or 10  years.   So  it\r\n\r\ndepends on the redevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun also asked about dengue fever and malaria.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  dengue fever and malaria situation in 1999  was  a\r\n\r\nhuge improvement over 1998.  Dengue cases came down more than\r\n\r\n70%, from 5,258 cases in 1998 to only 1,355 cases in 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two deaths though.  One was a foreign construction\r\n\r\nworker  and  the other was a permanent resident.  We  believe\r\n\r\nthey  sought medical attention too late.  Malaria cases  have\r\n\r\ndropped  from  36  in  1998 to 10 in  1999.   The  number  of\r\n\r\nimported malaria cases, that is infected outside of Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  was treated in Singapore, has also dropped from  396  in\r\n\r\n1998  to  306  in  1999.  There was one  death  which  is  an\r\n\r\nimported case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will remain vigilant against these communicable\r\n\r\ndiseases  to  ensure that our population continues  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nhigh  standards of public health.  My Ministry has also given\r\n\r\nmore  focus  on  research, especially  on  dengue,  and  also\r\n\r\nworking closely with the tertiary institutions on a number of\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Harun Ghani also asked about waste collection.\r\n\r\nWe  are  satisfied with the services rendered  by  our  three\r\n\r\nlicensed  public waste collectors that we have  appointed  so\r\n\r\nfar.   All  of  them  are performing in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nservice   standard   required.   One  of   them   encountered\r\n\r\ndifficulties  during  the  first  week  of  operation.  Their\r\n\r\nworkers  found the work too strenuous and could not  complete\r\n\r\ntheir  route  on  time.  This resulted in a backlog  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation  of  course snowballed.  The company  remedied  the\r\n\r\nproblem  by  shortening the length of some of the routes  and\r\n\r\nthat meant having to bring extra vehicles and of course extra\r\n\r\nmanpower.   During  this  period, some residents  experienced\r\n\r\nirregular  service, with no collection on certain days.   The\r\n\r\nteething  problem  lasted 10 days.   The  company  was  fined\r\n\r\n$25,500 for the lapse in service standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry is currently reviewing the tender\r\n\r\nspecifications  and  plans to call the third  sector  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of  this year.  Details of the  sector  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong asked about refuse collection\r\n\r\nfrom  residential properties.  If residents use proper refuse\r\n\r\nbins with a cover and deposit their refuse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninside  these bins, then it will be difficult for  strays  to\r\n\r\nget  at it.  It would help further if residents do not  bring\r\n\r\nout  their  refuse  at night.  However, I  agree  that  waste\r\n\r\ncollectors should communicate with residents about when their\r\n\r\ntruck will arrive so that the refuse need not be put out  too\r\n\r\nearly.   If Mr Chiam can give me more details, I will ask  my\r\n\r\nofficers  to  look  into  this  matter,  whether  it  is   at\r\n\r\nCarmichael Road, Sennett Estate, or Woodleigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for 5 am, we have never asked any resident to put out\r\n\r\ntheir  refuse at that hour because the truck will come around\r\n\r\n9  o'clock.   Unless of course one is an early riser  like  a\r\n\r\nMuslim, one loves one's wife and one does not want her to put\r\n\r\nthe rubbish outside so early in the morning.  One can put  it\r\n\r\nout  oneself when one goes to the mosque.  But I  can  assure\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, that they start their collection at about 9 o'clock\r\n\r\nand finish around noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of gloves, we do not make it compulsory. We\r\n\r\nleave  it  to the discretion of the companies.  If they  want\r\n\r\nto,  they can ask, at their own discretion, their workers  to\r\n\r\nuse gloves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about the allocation of market and\r\n\r\neating stalls.  Sir, the decision to tender out vacant hawker\r\n\r\nstalls  to the general public instead of allocating  them  to\r\n\r\nhardship  cases  was  taken  in  1990  for  several  reasons.\r\n\r\nOperating  a  hawker  stall  is a business  that  requires  a\r\n\r\nfinancial investment and good culinary skills.  Many hardship\r\n\r\ncases  who  were allotted stalls in the past were  unable  to\r\n\r\noperate  their stalls profitably and their businesses failed,\r\n\r\nleading  to  more  financial  hardship.   Some  resorted   to\r\n\r\nsubletting  their  stalls illegally.  It was  felt  that  the\r\n\r\nhawker  business  is  best left to the people  with  culinary\r\n\r\nskills,  while  hardship cases should  seek  other  forms  of\r\n\r\nemployment.  The present method of renting out vacant  stalls\r\n\r\nthrough public tender allows everyone with culinary skills to\r\n\r\nventure  into  the  food retail trade.  He will  operate  the\r\n\r\nstall  under market conditions and will strive to  work  hard\r\n\r\nand  to do well, and this will benefit not only him but  also\r\n\r\nhis customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of market produce stalls, there are\r\n\r\nmany vacant stalls available and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  would  not  be difficult to get one at a very  reasonable\r\n\r\nrent.   In fact, in two wet markets, that is, in Commonwealth\r\n\r\nAvenue and Balestier Road, you can just walk in and apply  on\r\n\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Toh See Kiat asked about solar energy. Sir,\r\n\r\nproducts that harness solar energy to supply heated water are\r\n\r\nwell  commercialised, and they are already being used in some\r\n\r\ncommercial facilities and private homes in Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\nleft  to  the  building  industry to  decide  on  their  cost\r\n\r\neffectiveness.   On its part, the Government  encourages  the\r\n\r\nuse of such products.  My Ministry administers an accelerated\r\n\r\ndepreciation  scheme which allows the capital investment  for\r\n\r\nsolar  heating or cooling system and solar energy  collection\r\n\r\nsystem to be expensed off in one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One notable application is the solar heating system of\r\n\r\nthe  flight  kitchen  building of  the  Changi  International\r\n\r\nAirport  Services (CIAS).  The system provides hot water  for\r\n\r\nthe   preparation  of  food,  cooking,  washing  and  bathing\r\n\r\nfacilities.   CIAS  has  achieved  substantial  cost   saving\r\n\r\nthrough the use of this system.  MINDEF has also installed  a\r\n\r\nsolar  power  system at the Tuas Naval Base as a pilot  study\r\n\r\nand  is  looking  into  larger scale  applications  when  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  to  convert  solar energy  into  electricity  has\r\n\r\nachieved further breakthroughs.\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while products to harness our solar energy to\r\n\r\nsupply  heated  water  are readily available  in  the  market\r\n\r\nplace,  the application of technology to collect solar energy\r\n\r\non  a large scale to produce electricity still faces a number\r\n\r\nof   major   constraints.   Given  the  state  of  the   art,\r\n\r\nelectricity  production from solar energy is far more  costly\r\n\r\nthan conventional form of electricity generation.  The growth\r\n\r\nin  the  use  of  solar  energy  will  have  to  depend  upon\r\n\r\ntechnology  breakthroughs to harvest it in a  cost  effective\r\n\r\nmanner  and  minimum  space  utilisation.   That  is  another\r\n\r\nconstraint - space utilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, research in large scale collection of\r\n\r\nsolar energy is limited.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like to encourage local researchers and private sector\r\n\r\ncompanies to be involved in this area of research.  They  can\r\n\r\napply  to the National Science and Technology Board  for  R&D\r\n\r\nfunding for their research projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay talked about foul smell. Sir,\r\n\r\nour  refuse  will smell,  with the warm and humid climate  we\r\n\r\nhave.   For this reason, special attention must be  given  to\r\n\r\nit,  starting from the person who generates the refuse to the\r\n\r\nperson who collects the refuse for disposal.  Refuse must  be\r\n\r\nbagged  before  they are thrown down the chute and  cleansing\r\n\r\nworkers  must  cover the refuse when they convey  the  refuse\r\n\r\nfrom  the chute chambers to the bin centres and do so without\r\n\r\nspillage.   At the bin centre, the refuse must be  stored  in\r\n\r\ncovered  bulk  bins.  It is the duty of the town  council  to\r\n\r\nensure all this.  The refuse from the bin centres are removed\r\n\r\ndaily  by  appointed  contractors in  covered  trucks.   Town\r\n\r\ncouncils  should  report  to  the  Ministry  if  the   refuse\r\n\r\ncollection contractors spill refuse after emptying  the  bulk\r\n\r\nbins, or if they do not perform.  When everyone cooperates in\r\n\r\nthis way, then the smell nuisance can be minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are of course engineering solutions such as\r\n\r\nthe  use  of mechanised refuse handling equipment  like  dust\r\n\r\nscrew  conveyors  and compactors in bin  centres  which  will\r\n\r\nminimise manual handling and consequently spillage.  All  new\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  built after 1990 have such equipment.  Refuse  is\r\n\r\nalso  collected daily to reduce smell problem.  As for refuse\r\n\r\ntrucks, they should not be leaking sludge water because these\r\n\r\nare  specially  designed vehicles, unless of  course  if  the\r\n\r\noperator is careless, otherwise it would not leak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refuse trucks have internal compaction units and upon\r\n\r\ncompacting  the  refuse in the truck, they  are  required  to\r\n\r\ndrain  off the surplus water into sewers provided for at  the\r\n\r\nbin  centres.   This will prevent sludge water from  spilling\r\n\r\nout  when  the  vehicle  is driven.   Licensed  public  waste\r\n\r\ncollectors  are  penalised  if  this  happens.    Sir,   town\r\n\r\ncouncils  should report cases of refuse truck  leaking  waste\r\n\r\nwater in their estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of smell at Sungei Tengah Agro-technology\r\n\r\nPark  arose  from the chicken dung generated by four  chicken\r\n\r\nfarms in the park.  Last year, one of the four farms operated\r\n\r\na  composting plant which will convert the chicken dung  into\r\n\r\nfertiliser  and  this  aggravated  the  smell  nuisance.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry, together with PPD, the licensing authority  of  the\r\n\r\nfarm,  intervened  and  the  farm installed  odour  treatment\r\n\r\nmeasures.  The number of complaints dropped after  that.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry will work with the Primary Production Department  to\r\n\r\nsee how best the problem can be further minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nclarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you give Mr Sin the floor first?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Thank you, Sir. Just some points of\r\n\r\nclarification for the Senior Minister of State.   The  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State said that, some years ago, the Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry  allocated the hawker stalls to the poor  and  needy\r\n\r\nand from past experience, many of these stalls had failed  in\r\n\r\ntheir businesses.  I would like to ask the SMS whether or not\r\n\r\nin  those  cases guidance had been given to these  people  to\r\n\r\noperate  these stalls and to help them along,  or  were  they\r\n\r\njust  given  a stall and were expected to make a  success  of\r\n\r\nthese stalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am not saying that the policy should be\r\n\r\nchanged  in  its entirety.  What I am saying is that  perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  stalls could be set aside to be allocated to those poor\r\n\r\nand needy families who can be trained to run these businesses\r\n\r\nproperly.   And my last point is that yes, SMS has said  that\r\n\r\nthere  are stalls available for rental to the poorer families\r\n\r\nif they tender for it.  Could I also ask the Ministry to make\r\n\r\nthis information readily available at least to the Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  so  that they can inform the  residents  of  such\r\n\r\nvacancies as and when these cases come to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, in my reply just now, the\r\n\r\nsecond part of the question\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  taken care of.

I take it that  we  should  take\r\n\r\nstock and think of whether we can do more in a total plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the haze situation, we had a respite last year\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  wet  weather,  wetter-than-usual  weather.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  we are coming to the tail  end  of  this  wet\r\n\r\nweather phenomenon and now, we find that whenever it  is  dry\r\n\r\nover  in  Sumatra or Kalimantan, they will start to burn  and\r\n\r\nthese  are not only the small-scale farmers but also the  big\r\n\r\nplantations.   The satellite pictures show very clearly  that\r\n\r\nthese  are plantation owners.  The Malaysian Minister  and  I\r\n\r\nmyself  have written to the Indonesian Environment  Minister,\r\n\r\nexpressing our concern.  He had a meeting with the  President\r\n\r\nand  the  Cabinet and I believe that they are doing the  best\r\n\r\nthey  can  to  try and resolve this problem.  It  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  issue because there are so many fires.  They  must\r\n\r\nhave  the  political will and really punish a  few  of  these\r\n\r\nplantation owners. So far, they have threatened to suspend or\r\n\r\ncancel  the licence of these plantation owners.   And  it  is\r\n\r\nobvious from this satellite, you pinpoint the location, which\r\n\r\nis the particular place.  But I am not sure, at this point in\r\n\r\ntime,  to  what extent the laws are watertight, whether  they\r\n\r\ncan  catch  these people, unless they have actual on-the-spot\r\n\r\nevidence.  So  far, they have been able to blame  it  on  the\r\n\r\nsmall farmers clearing the land and causing the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to work with them. I will be meeting my\r\n\r\ncounterparts  within ASEAN in Brunei in early April,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  have to do our best on the Government side, as well  as\r\n\r\nthe NGOs, to see how we can resolve this problem. My fear  is\r\n\r\nthat  we are going to enter into another dry spell very soon.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that the next El Nino phenomenon may occur\r\n\r\nthis   year  or  early  next  year,  and  if  this  situation\r\n\r\ncontinues,  we will have a haze like 1997 and, in that  case,\r\n\r\nif you are asthmatic, you had better put some filters on your\r\n\r\nair-conditioner.

It\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate the build-up of our city state into an info-communication hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this means that the Government has to make\r\n\r\ncompensation  to the two operators, SingTel and StarHub,  for\r\n\r\nthe loss of the so-called duopoly status. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  of  interest to the public and to the investors  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends to compensate them.

Otherwise, public funds may not be put to good\r\n\r\nuse.   Will  the Minister tell the House what  has  been  the\r\n\r\ninterest by foreign investors since the liberalisation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there still a national strategic role for a major\r\n\r\nnational telecommunication player in Singapore in view of the\r\n\r\nfact  that ready and appropriate access to telecommunications\r\n\r\ntechnology is of critical importance to Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also heard recently of the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications services development in Singapore and Hong\r\n\r\nKong.   In  many  surveys  and reports done  internationally,\r\n\r\nSingapore  usually  comes across as a more regulated  economy\r\n\r\nand   Hong   Kong   a  more  laissez-faire   one.    In   the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications services sector, this seems to work in the\r\n\r\nfavour  of  Hong Kong in the perception of business investors\r\n\r\nwho   have   the  capital  or  those  owners  of  proprietary\r\n\r\ntechnologies intending to make their presence in Asia or  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister give us some benchmark indicators of\r\n\r\nhow  we  stack  against  Hong Kong  especially  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ninfrastructures, pricing, inter-connectivity  and  the  range\r\n\r\nand  quality  of  our  services?   This  will  also  put   in\r\n\r\nperspective to the public how and where we stand in order for\r\n\r\nus  to mount the next step forward.

In   view   of   the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  measures  taken  for  the  telecommunications\r\n\r\nsector, almost anyone can come and join in the fun. In  order\r\n\r\nto attract interest, it is necessary to see that the existing\r\n\r\nstructure  of  licensing  fees  for  operators  and   service\r\n\r\nproviders is appropriate under the liberalised regime.  Also,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to make the business competitive and the  consumers\r\n\r\nget value for their money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I feel it is important that substantial revision\r\n\r\nin  the  licensing  fees be done, so as  not  to  negate  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of liberalisation. Will the Minister be able to  give\r\n\r\nhis views on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first let me thank Mr\r\n\r\nChay  for his comments.   He has raised a few points  on  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of the telecommunications  sector.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  compensation to the two operators, SingTel and  StarHub,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  what is the basis and the criteria, and how  much.\r\n\r\nThe  compensation issue is being undertaken by  a  consultant\r\n\r\nthat we have engaged from the United States who undertook the\r\n\r\nfirst  assignment when we first compensated SingTel in  1996.\r\n\r\nThe   criteria  are  being  worked  out  together  with   the\r\n\r\nconsultant and the companies, and we will have to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  fair to all parties. We do not want  to  over-compensate  them and, at the same time, we also  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsure that we are fair to ourselves and the people because  we\r\n\r\nare dealing with public money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the interest of the foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  with  the  liberalisation.   Since  I   made   the\r\n\r\nannouncement,  IDA  and EDB have been aggressively  marketing\r\n\r\nand promoting ourselves to companies in the United States and\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  In fact, shortly after I made the announcement, a\r\n\r\nfew  days  later, the first team left for the United  States.\r\n\r\nAltogether, they have made three trips and they are  planning\r\n\r\na  fourth very shortly to Europe.  The response has been very\r\n\r\npositive from the companies that they met, both in the United\r\n\r\nStates  and in Hong Kong. At the same time in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nInfo-communications Development Authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas received over 80 enquiries from interested parties. These\r\n\r\ncompanies  range  from companies that  have  an  interest  in\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  infrastructure  or  facilities,  as  well   as\r\n\r\ncompanies  that are interested in providing services.   There\r\n\r\nare  also companies that have seen the IDA and have expressed\r\n\r\nan  interest in coming to Singapore for the first  time,  and\r\n\r\nusing  Singapore, not just providing services  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  by  using Singapore as a base for their business in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the service-based competition to be fairly\r\n\r\nkeen  and  because  the services-based  operators  can  begin\r\n\r\noperation  very quickly, they do not require much  equipment.\r\n\r\nWe  expect  them to start operation around April  or  shortly\r\n\r\nafter. But for facilities-based competition, that would  only\r\n\r\nbe  developed  towards the later part of this year  or  early\r\n\r\nnext  year because, for the facilities-based companies,  they\r\n\r\nrequire time to roll out their infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether there is still a strategic role for\r\n\r\na  national telecommunications company, I think SingTel  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to play a very important role. The experience in all\r\n\r\ncountries    has    shown   that   the   dominant    original\r\n\r\ntelecommunications company, even after liberalisation,  tends\r\n\r\nto play a very important role because they have the advantage\r\n\r\nof having all the facilities and infrastructure in place, and\r\n\r\nthey have the advantage of having developed the market and it\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult to take market share from  an  entrenched\r\n\r\nprovider.  I would expect that SingTel will still play a very\r\n\r\nimportant  role in Singapore but I hope that would not  deter\r\n\r\nthe  new  companies from coming in because the new  companies\r\n\r\nshould  bring  with  them  new  technology,  new  value-added\r\n\r\nservices and, hopefully, a new approach which will allow them\r\n\r\nto win customers away from SingTel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about our competitiveness versus Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  whether  we  have  any benchmark  indicators.   It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to draw a definitive and objective conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween different countries because there are many factors to\r\n\r\ntake into consideration.  Mr Chay himself has mentioned quite\r\n\r\na  fair  bit - infrastructure, quality of service,  range  of\r\n\r\nservice,  pricing. There is a whole range.  Overall,  we  can\r\n\r\nsay  that Singapore compares fairly well versus Hong Kong and\r\n\r\nother telecommunications hubs in the Asia Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just quote two recent surveys that were\r\n\r\nundertaken by different bodies.  One was conducted by NUS and\r\n\r\nin  both these surveys, it shows that Singapore scored higher\r\n\r\nin  certain  aspects while Hong Kong scored higher  in  other\r\n\r\naspects. For example, Singapore tended to come out very  well\r\n\r\nin  terms  of competitiveness of pricing, quality of service,\r\n\r\nreliability.   On the other hand, Hong Kong fared  better  in\r\n\r\nterms  of consumer choice and the regulatory indicators,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  because  Hong  Kong has a  more  open  market  than\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think with full liberalisation from  1st  April\r\n\r\nonwards,  we  should  be  able to see keener  competition  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in terms of both pricing and service innovations.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would expect that in this multi-operator environment,\r\n\r\nour  telecoms sector should not just become more competitive,\r\n\r\nbut  in  the surveys, I think, we should come out even better\r\n\r\ntoo in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about the licensing fee structure, that\r\n\r\nit is important to have an appropriate fee structure and that\r\n\r\nwe should ensure that we have a substantial reduction in fees\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that we are competitive and we do  not  lose  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to make ourselves more competitive.  As  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  effort to attract the key telecoms players from all over\r\n\r\nthe  world, in preparing for the liberalisation, we  had,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  reviewed our regulatory framework, including  the  fee\r\n\r\nstructure.   We realise that it is important to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  fee  structure is appropriate, because  that  forms  the\r\n\r\nfirst hurdle that companies have to overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up the new fee structure, IDA removed the\r\n\r\ninitial  upfront licence fee which can be quite  substantial,\r\n\r\nand we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  retained the annual licence fee of 1% of  gross  annual\r\n\r\nturnover.  The reaction from the industry, so far,  has  been\r\n\r\nquite  encouraging and positive.  So far,  in  our  promotion\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  US  and Hong Kong, the reaction  from  the  80\r\n\r\ncompanies who have approached IDA, there has been no negative\r\n\r\nreaction  at  all  with  regard to  the  new  fee  structure.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the fully competitive environment, we can  expect\r\n\r\nthe  telephone  companies  to enjoy  a  much  smaller  profit\r\n\r\nmargin, and we will therefore have to correspondingly  reduce\r\n\r\nthe   annual  licence  fee  to  ensure  that  our  fees   are\r\n\r\ncompetitive and attractive vis-a-vis the other telecom  hubs.\r\n\r\nI have therefore asked my staff to review the various options\r\n\r\nfor  reducing  the annual licence fee.  The study  should  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  very shortly and we will be making an announcement\r\n\r\nthereafter.  I expect the fees to go down further and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the telecoms companies would then pass on these savings\r\n\r\nto  the  consumers.  It is a win-win approach,  because  when\r\n\r\nthey  pass  on  the  savings to the  consumers,  this  should\r\n\r\ngenerate higher demand, increase market size and in the  end,\r\n\r\nthe  telecoms  companies would benefit.  So it is  a  win-win\r\n\r\napproach and we hope that they will make the effort  to  pass\r\n\r\non the savings to their customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo, I suggest that we hear Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nand the other Members.  Mr Iswaran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Much obliged, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the digital divide is already upon us. We have\r\n\r\nhigh  profile  technopreneurs who are  making  millions  from\r\n\r\nesoteric  IT  ventures; yet there are  many  amongst  us  who\r\n\r\nremain intimidated by the mere sight of a computer.  We  have\r\n\r\na younger generation of Singaporeans for whom techno-lingo is\r\n\r\nsecond  nature; yet there are others amongst us who think  we\r\n\r\nare referring to a rodent problem when we talk about a mouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Information Technology that the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  allocate $25 million to bring the IT revolution  closer\r\n\r\nto  the  heartlands.  My concern is how this  money  will  be\r\n\r\nspent.   Because  a variety of purposes have  been  mentioned\r\n\r\nlike  training, computer ownership and even Internet  access,\r\n\r\nI  think they are important and laudable objectives.  But the\r\n\r\nkey  challenge, in my view, is psychological.   Our  task  is\r\n\r\nreally  to reach out to a large group of predominantly  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and to persuade them that they too are a part of\r\n\r\nthis new world of info-communications and it is not just  for\r\n\r\nyoung techies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three specific proposals for the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider.  The first is on the organisational element.  I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that IDA will be working closely with community  groups\r\n\r\nand  grassroots organisations on this initiative to bring  IT\r\n\r\nand \"e\" closer to the people.  But why not go all the way and\r\n\r\nlet  the People's Association drive the project.  I say  this\r\n\r\nbecause the IDA is a new agency with expert domain knowledge,\r\n\r\nbut  we do not really need very high-tech knowledge for  this\r\n\r\neffort.  Neither can we reasonably expect IDA's young, jeans-clad computer experts to effectively reach out to older, more\r\n\r\nconservatively    dressed   Singaporeans.     The    People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  and its grassroots are old hats at communicating\r\n\r\nsometimes  quite complex Government policies to  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  And I think they know the tricks of the  trade.\r\n\r\nSo, why not let them take the lead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, icons. I think we need e-icons, not the\r\n\r\ntype  we  click on a screen, but the type who can  touch  our\r\n\r\nhearts and click our minds, individuals whom we can relate to\r\n\r\nand  who might face the same fears as us when venturing  into\r\n\r\nthe e-world.  To me, Sir, Liang Po Po and Tan Ah Tek of Under\r\n\r\nOne  Roof   would be fantastic e-ambassadors.  They are  well\r\n\r\nknown,  they strike a chord with many Singaporeans and,  most\r\n\r\nimportant of all, they could inspire an attitude of \"if  they\r\n\r\ncan  do it, so can I\", amongst the average Singaporeans.  And\r\n\r\nI  would  urge  the Minister to consider this  form  of  mass\r\n\r\npublicity  and  sort of attitude-changing effort  through  e-icons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I would urge the agencies involved to\r\n\r\ntread  the path of least resistance.  It is important because\r\n\r\nwhen  delivering the e-message, we should do it in bite sizes\r\n\r\nand in an entertaining manner.  There is no point diving into\r\n\r\nthe  deep  end  talking about word processing, web  browsing,\r\n\r\nWindows 2000, Office 2000 and so on.  Rather, we should start\r\n\r\nwith  what  appeals, perhaps with games,  Solitaire  and  the\r\n\r\nlike,  just  get people comfortable with the  mouse  and  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  screen,  and then graduate from  there  into  other\r\n\r\nforms  of  entertainment before going into  e-mail  for  more\r\n\r\nsocial  purposes, and then web browsing and so on.  My  point\r\n\r\nin  saying  all of this is that these incremental steps  will\r\n\r\nimbue confidence and comfort with what would otherwise  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  alien  medium to many Singaporeans.   And  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  re-examine the process through  which  this  IT\r\n\r\nrevolution will be brought to the heartlands of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the Internet\r\n\r\nrevolution  will  be  one  of the major  milestones  of  this\r\n\r\ncentury.  It will have a major impact on business and also on\r\n\r\nthe life of the ordinary person.  The emerging importance  of\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  cannot be ignored, and Internet companies  are\r\n\r\nnow  able  to buy over established brick-and-mortar companies\r\n\r\nwith traditional business models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major trend in the horizon is the emergence of e-commerce communities. The rise of the Internet will lead to\r\n\r\nthe inevitable strengthening of e-commerce as a challenge  to\r\n\r\nconventional  businesses.   The  exponential  growth  of   e-commerce  procurement  and supply chain,  management  systems\r\n\r\nwill  increase  efficiency in the system and reduce  cost  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses.    The  end-to-end  situation   of   the   entire\r\n\r\nprocurement  and  supply chain will also  mean  reduction  of\r\n\r\nproduct  and  process costs.  E-commerce  business  can  make\r\n\r\ntraditional companies obsolete within a few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the Internet has also created yet another\r\n\r\ntrend.  Increasingly, traditional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  will lose top quality staff to Internet companies.\r\n\r\nThe migration of top quality talent to the virtual world will\r\n\r\nonly  strengthen the world of e-commerce.  This  is  a  trend\r\n\r\nthat is already happening in the USA and we are beginning  to\r\n\r\nsee this in Singapore.  The success of e-commerce is not only\r\n\r\ndependent  on business concepts but also on strong management\r\n\r\nskills.  Being an entrepreneur is only one of the ingredients\r\n\r\nfor  success.   It does not substitute for strong  management\r\n\r\nskills.  Internet  companies  grow  rapidly  and  can  become\r\n\r\nglobalised   within a short period of time.   The  speed  and\r\n\r\npace   at   which  Internet  companies  move   far   outpaces\r\n\r\nconventional  businesses.  If traditional businesses  do  not\r\n\r\nevolve, they will be overtaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is uniquely positioned to become an e-commerce\r\n\r\nvirtual global hub.  However, we must recognise these  trends\r\n\r\nand   prepare  ourselves  to  meet  the  challenges   of   an\r\n\r\ninterconnected world.  We must change our mindset and  adjust\r\n\r\nto the speed of the Internet world.  Hence, we must groom and\r\n\r\ntrain  people constantly to meet these new demands.  We  must\r\n\r\nalso  adjust our policies to position ourselves to meet these\r\n\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberalisation of the telecoms sector is a move in the\r\n\r\nright  direction.  With full liberalisation of  the  telecoms\r\n\r\nmarket  in  New  Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong,  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust   speed   up  its  liberalisation  process   to   remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  And I support the Ministry's plan on this.   We\r\n\r\nhave seen how the introduction of competition in the form  of\r\n\r\nM1 has made the entire handphone market more competitive.  It\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in better quality services and more  affordable\r\n\r\nprices  and  also  the introduction of new services  such  as\r\n\r\nwireless  applications  (WAP).   Increasingly,  the  Internet\r\n\r\nworld  will  move from the narrow to broadband  applications.\r\n\r\nAlthough Singapore has Singapore One and 98% of all homes are\r\n\r\nalready  connected, only 14% are subscribers.   If  Singapore\r\n\r\nwants  to become a serious broadband application provider  in\r\n\r\nthe  region,  we will need to increase broadband  access  and\r\n\r\nreduce the cost of broadband access.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the industry and Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nincreasingly  move  into the broadband applications  area,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  imperative that the cost be reduced.   Current\r\n\r\nADSL  prices  of SingTel Magix are significantly higher  than\r\n\r\nthat of Hong Kong Telecoms.  Current cable prices of SCV  are\r\n\r\nabout three times higher than that of Hong Kong.  It is  time\r\n\r\nfor  the  Ministry  to put pressure on service  providers  to\r\n\r\nlower  the  pricing of broadband access.   We  should  reduce\r\n\r\nprices  to the level that will be competitive to places  like\r\n\r\nHong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current wholesale prices for broadband access by service\r\n\r\nproviders such as SingTel to other ISPs are high, and make it\r\n\r\ncommercially  non-viable for other ISPs.  The  Ministry  must\r\n\r\nmandate  open  access  to broadband infrastructure  currently\r\n\r\nowned  by  SCV and SingTel and reduce the pricing  for  these\r\n\r\nservices,  so  that they can be offered to ISPs.   With  more\r\n\r\ncompetition  through lower wholesale prices,  more  ISPs  can\r\n\r\noffer these services to the public at more affordable prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of good policies and excellent\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  by themselves cannot propel us  to  be  first\r\n\r\nmovers in the Internet revolution.  We must create the  right\r\n\r\nmindsets and an understanding of the fast moving world of the\r\n\r\nInternet.   For  senior and middle management  staff  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service and statutory boards, yes, there are many  who\r\n\r\nare  already in tune like those in the MinCom, MCIT and  IDA,\r\n\r\nbut  there  are also many who are not in tune.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  take  the  lead to organise Internet  and  e-commerce\r\n\r\nseminars  for senior and middle management to help them  keep\r\n\r\nup  with the Internet revolution.  Experts and technopreneurs\r\n\r\nfrom  the virtual world of Internet can bring virtual reality\r\n\r\nto  the real world management.  One of the key areas that one\r\n\r\nmust  look  at  is administrative procedures and legislation.\r\n\r\nThey  must  be able to keep up with the pace of the Internet.\r\n\r\nAs  these span across different Ministries, there will  still\r\n\r\nbe  a need for a coordinating body.  Perhaps MCIT may be  the\r\n\r\nbest body to coordinate this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry must be congratulated for several\r\n\r\ninitiatives to help Singaporeans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoin  the  Internet revolution.  We must do more  if  we  are\r\n\r\nserious  in being a global player, and we must move fast  and\r\n\r\nwe must move now.  Only then can Singapore be a global player\r\n\r\nin the virtual world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, may I take my two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first, let me declare my\r\n\r\ninterest as a lawyer practising in intellectual property  and\r\n\r\ninformational  technology law with clients who  will  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  some  of these changes that I will be proposing  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been sitting in this Committee looking at\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  for the year 2000-2001 and it would be  expected\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  be talking of the \"f\"  word   -   finances.\r\n\r\nInstead,  we  are, not surprisingly, I think, talking  a  lot\r\n\r\nabout the \"e\" word, considering the ecstasy that is going now\r\n\r\nin  NASDAQ  and the rest of the stock markets of  Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nSingapore, London and so on.  The \"e\" word, ie, e-commerce, e-business,  is something that is in flavour.  I am  rising  to\r\n\r\nspeak not just because it is the flavour of the day but I  do\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we have to consider many things as we  go  helter\r\n\r\nskelter  into  these new challenges we face  in  the  new  e-economy.  Firstly, we have to reform some of the ancient  and\r\n\r\nobsolete laws we have.  A comprehensive study will need to be\r\n\r\ndone.   As  an example, I have had occasions to look  at  the\r\n\r\nAuctioneers  Act and I find that, in the physical  world,  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  consumers you need the  auctioneer  to  have  a\r\n\r\nlicence  and you need a specific person to pin down,  if  any\r\n\r\noffence is created, if there are any offences.  But in an  e-auction scenario, an auctioneer on the Internet, it would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  find this person even if you were  to  license\r\n\r\nhim. Perhaps there are some rules that may not be enforceable\r\n\r\nor not effective or not necessary in an e-economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second example would be to look at the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications   Act  and  the   MAS   regulations.    In\r\n\r\nparticular, we have had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecent  rules  dealing with stock trading.  The old  Telecoms\r\n\r\nregulations  dealt also with this issue of  e-trading,  using\r\n\r\nthe  networks to trade in stocks and shares.  There were some\r\n\r\nrather onerous provisions which I have actually informed  the\r\n\r\nformer  Director-General of TAS, and now the Deputy Executive\r\n\r\nof  IDA.  The rules may actually be onerous such that our  e-stock  traders would have to follow these rules,  but  nobody\r\n\r\nelse  in  the  world does.  We would effectively be  shooting\r\n\r\nourselves  in the foot because other people do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow  these  rules,  and  therefore  they  will  get   more\r\n\r\nbusiness.   It  might be necessary if we have to  have  these\r\n\r\nrules  that perhaps we should sell it as a kind of particular\r\n\r\nSingapore brand that we are very trusted and therefore  there\r\n\r\nis some value in our being regulated more than other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that I want to raise is with regard to\r\n\r\nchanging  the  laws,  for example, in intellectual  property,\r\n\r\ncopyright, for example. We have had some changes recently  in\r\n\r\nour  Copyright  law,  but we still have  a  very  big  piracy\r\n\r\nproblem.   It  used to be that Singapore and Hong  Kong  were\r\n\r\nknown as the piracy capitals of the world.  We have no longer\r\n\r\nthat  unfortunate image and reputation.  But I think we still\r\n\r\nhave  massive piracy problems and almost every  day  we  find\r\n\r\nnewspaper articles about so and so being fined and so and  so\r\n\r\nbeing  raided.   Unfortunately,  we  have  got  a  particular\r\n\r\nproblem  here,  ie,  many of these guys that  we  arrest  and\r\n\r\nfined,  are what we call \"fall guys\". These are the students,\r\n\r\nthe  retirees, the housewives, who are earning a little extra\r\n\r\nincome.   They  are  given incentives and  very  high  profit\r\n\r\nmargins,  and  their fines would be paid by the  kingpins  or\r\n\r\nsyndicate who run the shows.  They are quite happy to pay the\r\n\r\nfine  because they earn good money.  If we do not crush  this\r\n\r\npiracy  problem,  we  will  not be able  to  attract  content\r\n\r\nproviders to come to Singapore to provide content and to help\r\n\r\nin our e-economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare not suggest, but perhaps we could look at some\r\n\r\nmore  penalties  that would be felt by these \"fall  guys\"  so\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey would never do it again.  Imprisonment comes quickly  to\r\n\r\nmind.   If  a person has to be in prison, no matter how  much\r\n\r\nother people compensate him, the kingpin compensates him,  he\r\n\r\nmay  not want to do it or perhaps kill him, but it may be too\r\n\r\nheavy  a  penalty.  Perhaps the ones who rent out  the  shops\r\n\r\ncould  be imposed some kind of landlord occupier's liability.\r\n\r\nHe knows these guys are doing piracy.  He knows this is not a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  business.  He should not lend them legitimacy  by\r\n\r\nallowing  him  to  use  his  legitimate  shop.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinistry might consider this way of closing down the  den  of\r\n\r\nthieves, so to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, when we talk of tax law reform, we need\r\n\r\nto follow the trends in the rest of the world.  We cannot tax\r\n\r\nwhen others do not tax, or we cannot be too liberal about tax\r\n\r\nif  everybody  else is taxing.  But the more important  issue\r\n\r\nhere  is  that  we  should again look at our  Approved  Cyber\r\n\r\nTrader  Scheme.   It is meant to be a tax  incentive  for  e-commerce.  But to my knowledge, there are only two that  have\r\n\r\nbeen approved so far and it does not seem to be a very highly\r\n\r\nsought  after  status  among  some  of  our  traders.   Maybe\r\n\r\nsomething is not quite right and we should look at how we can\r\n\r\nimprove tax incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESOPs have been talked about. I know the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance has said that he would be looking into this issue and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  he would consider that.  Taxing a  person  who\r\n\r\nexercises  an option is a bit unfair because he has  not  got\r\n\r\nthe  money  yet.   He has not realised it.  Perhaps  the  tax\r\n\r\nshould  come  when  he  realises  the  profit.   Perhaps  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs,  and  some  of  my colleagues  in  this  House  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  about tax reliefs for business angels, individuals\r\n\r\nwho are throwing in the money to help push the e-economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also be looking at other rules like electronic\r\n\r\ncontracting rules.  It is right now a bit difficult to decide\r\n\r\nwhether the postal rules apply to a contractual situation  on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet.  We should perhaps abolish the postal rule and\r\n\r\nallow  contracts  to  be formed in the normal  way  upon  the\r\n\r\nreceipt of the offer and acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also be looking at the Electronic Transactions\r\n\r\nAct  (ETA).  It is a new Act, but we should be reviewing  it.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  introduced  it,  we have this  provision  that  the\r\n\r\nElectronic Transactions Act applies to commercial parties and\r\n\r\nthey  can  opt out of it.  But where Government is concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  ETA  does not apply to Government unless the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  opts  in.  This caution is not necessary  because\r\n\r\nour  Government  departments are all very  proactive  and  if\r\n\r\nthere is any particular department that is not yet ready  for\r\n\r\nthe  e-economy, they should jolly well declare themselves and\r\n\r\nthey  should say, \"We are not in the ETA scenario\".   Perhaps\r\n\r\nthen the pressure will be for them to change.  I think if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to have e-economy, we must have e-payment and our  laws\r\n\r\non payment could be changed.  We have a Bills of Exchange Act\r\n\r\nwhich  is  based on the English Act of 1832.   It  is  really\r\n\r\nancient.   We  could  perhaps be  looking  at  how  we  could\r\n\r\nelectronify the bills of exchange, perhaps even to  introduce\r\n\r\nlaws  of  truncation to permit the truncation of cheques  and\r\n\r\nthis would make the e-economy a better fluid situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of regulating e-economy, I would feel that the\r\n\r\nregulations  on certification authorities, for  example,  are\r\n\r\ntoo onerous and too uncertain.  It is based on a draft of the\r\n\r\nX.509 standards and it is so difficult to comply with that  I\r\n\r\nbelieve there is no licensee yet.  I think if we do not  have\r\n\r\nany licensee, it might be difficult for us to create trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of regulation, it would be important for us too\r\n\r\nto think of the protection of the consumer in a different way\r\n\r\nnow.  It is easier for somebody to con a consumer and to  con\r\n\r\nhim  faster and to get the results even faster.  For example,\r\n\r\nwe had the S888dot.com situation where within a month a party\r\n\r\ncould  actually amass a lot of money from the  public  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve this is to the tune of $6 million.  This is something\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have to carefully watch.  If it is so possible  to\r\n\r\nquickly  amass  so  much money, we must  have  some  kind  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  in place which would prevent Internet  companies\r\n\r\nfrom promoting and advertising themselves in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunconscionable  and  unethical  ways.   This   situation   is\r\n\r\nsomething  like  the  Fair Trading Act which  would  be  very\r\n\r\nuseful.   We should also be joining efforts with the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  world  to  create  a global situation  of  trust  in  e-commerce.   Perhaps  we  should join  in  efforts  to  pursue\r\n\r\ncomputer criminals and what I would call dot.cons -  the  con\r\n\r\nmen who  con the consumer and investor of his money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light and easy regulation is what the Ministry goes for\r\n\r\nnow.   Self-regulation is what it advocates.  These are  fine\r\n\r\nbut  we  must not reach a stage of laissez faire  -   you  do\r\n\r\nanything  you  like,  we  are  not  going  to  bat  an   eye.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if IDA were to spend money to preach the  digital\r\n\r\ndivide,  they  should  also  be  spending  money  to  promote\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the  inherent unreliability  of  perhaps  some\r\n\r\nInternet  sites.  Information on the Internet is  not  always\r\n\r\naccurate  and true and education of consumers, so  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  fall for dot.cons.  Money has to be used  because\r\n\r\neducation and awareness programme costs money.  To  expect  a\r\n\r\npoor  organisation like the Consumers Association to  do  all\r\n\r\nthis without help is not quite easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would quickly close, Sir, by saying that there are\r\n\r\nmany  other areas which we should be looking into.  The  list\r\n\r\nis  endless.  Domain name  registration, perhaps  grants  for\r\n\r\nresearch into e-commerce solutions and ultimately, if we have\r\n\r\nan  environment that promotes the e-economy and regulates  e-commerce in a careful way, we should be on to a good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the three\r\n\r\nMembers who have spoken up.  I will reply only to Dr  Toh  on\r\n\r\nhis  call for law reform.  Dr Michael Lim has spoken  on  the\r\n\r\npromotion of broadband.  There are three other cuts that  are\r\n\r\ncoming up.  So I will reply to him at that stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Toh has argued very strongly for the need to\r\n\r\nreform our various laws in order to bring them up to date  to\r\n\r\nthe  Internet age.  He has raised plenty of examples and,  as\r\n\r\nhe  said,  the list can go on and on.  I am glad he  stopped,\r\n\r\notherwise we would run out of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure him that I totally agree with him that\r\n\r\nas we enter the Internet Age, we will need to actively review\r\n\r\nand  update our various legislation. I would like  to  assure\r\n\r\nhim  also  that the problem that we face is not one  that  is\r\n\r\nunique to Singapore.  That is because the Internet revolution\r\n\r\nhas  resulted  in  such a huge flood of  new  businesses  and\r\n\r\nservices that many of these businesses and services were  not\r\n\r\neven  in the realm of imagination when the existing laws were\r\n\r\nfirst promulgated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Prof. Toh that the Attorney-General has set up a Law Reform Coordinating Committee. He\r\n\r\nchairs  it.  This Committee will identify those areas of  law\r\n\r\nthat  should  be  considered for law  reform.   However,  the\r\n\r\nactual  recommendations for legislative changes will continue\r\n\r\nto  be  made  by  the  respective Ministries  and  specialist\r\n\r\nagencies that are knowledgeable in their own technical areas.\r\n\r\nI  have  taken  note  of  Prof. Toh's  suggestions.   I  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely pass them on to the Committee for their review.  I\r\n\r\nwill  ask  my  Minister  of  State  to  reply  to  the  other\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> I will not reply to the subject\r\n\r\nof  digital divide now because later on there will  be  three\r\n\r\ncuts  relating  to  this topic.  So I will  respond  to  that\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now respond to Prof. Toh on his comments\r\n\r\nregarding  regulating the e-commerce.  Sir, e-commerce  is  a\r\n\r\nrelatively new concept, a fast growing one.  As a result, the\r\n\r\nregulation of e-commerce is still evolving.  Basically,  when\r\n\r\nwe   talk   about   e-commerce,  we  talk  about   electronic\r\n\r\ntransactions   between  businesses,   B2B,   businesses   and\r\n\r\nconsumers, B2C, as well as those between consumers, so it  is\r\n\r\nC2C.   In  the case of Singapore, our interest is to position\r\n\r\nourselves as a leading hub in e-commerce in the Asia-Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard,  I  want  to  assure  Prof.  Toh  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not adopt a laissez faire attitude because we\r\n\r\nrecognise that to succeed in this fast moving world\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof e-commerce, businesses will need to come out with creative\r\n\r\nideas  and be able to implement them very quickly.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, dot.com companies will need to be innovative and  move\r\n\r\nwith fast speed if they want to succeed.  So our challenge as\r\n\r\na  Government  will be to create an environment in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich   is  conducive  for  e-commerce  companies,    dot.com\r\n\r\ncompanies,  to succeed. This means, on the one hand, we  want\r\n\r\nto  create an environment that has sufficient safeguards,  to\r\n\r\ncreate  trust among businesses and consumers and yet  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time provide sufficient space for companies to innovate\r\n\r\nwith new ideas, to compete with new ideas.  In fact, this  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why we have decided to become one of  the  first\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  world  to put  in  place  the  Electronic\r\n\r\nTransactions  Act  (ETA) way back in 1998 so  as  to  provide\r\n\r\nenough  safeguards  in the business world  for  companies  to\r\n\r\nconduct e-commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ETA, public certification authorities can\r\n\r\napply  for  licence to issue and  to verify digital signature\r\n\r\nunder the Act.  Prof. Toh commented that the application  for\r\n\r\nCA licence is too onerous and uncertain.  I wish to point out\r\n\r\nthat  for Singapore to become an e-commerce hub, we  need  to\r\n\r\nensure that these licensees are trustworthy.  We also need to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  digital  certifications  issued  by  these\r\n\r\nCertification Authorities are recognised in other  countries,\r\n\r\notherwise we cannot be an e-commerce hub.  For these reasons,\r\n\r\nwe  want to make sure that our Certification Authorities  are\r\n\r\nevaluated  based on a well-recognised set of criteria.   This\r\n\r\nwould  include their financial standing,  operating  policies\r\n\r\nand procedures.  So even though the two CAs today have yet to\r\n\r\napply  to  IDA  for licence, my understanding  is  that  they\r\n\r\nintend  to  do  so  when  they are  ready  to  satisfy  these\r\n\r\ncriteria, and it is likely to be in a few months' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of consumer protection, there are already\r\n\r\nexisting laws, such as the multi-level marketing and  pyramid\r\n\r\nselling  prohibition Act and so on.  We recognise  that  with\r\n\r\nthe  emergence  of  e-commerce  and  the  new  Internet-based\r\n\r\nretailing, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  to  review the existing consumer protection legislation\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  they continue to be effective  in  the  new\r\n\r\noperating  environment.  And yet at the  same  time,  we  are\r\n\r\nmindful  that  we  should  not  over-regulate  the  industry,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  may stifle innovation in the market  place.   We\r\n\r\nwill   therefore  adopt  a  combination  of  industry   self-regulation,  Government regulation and consumer education  in\r\n\r\nthe protection of consumer interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of international pursuit of computer\r\n\r\ncriminals,  my  understanding is that the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and Police have already been using Interpol and other\r\n\r\ninter-agency arrangement to pursue these cyber criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also asked whether we can spend money to help\r\n\r\nto  promote awareness of the inherent unreliability  of  some\r\n\r\nInternet  sites.  We feel that this is best  done  through  a\r\n\r\nconsumer interest group, like CASE and so on.  What IDA would\r\n\r\ndo would be to cooperate with such agency and see what we can\r\n\r\ndo to make sure that the message gets across.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also mentioned about the need to review our\r\n\r\nground  rules on the domain naming registration.   I  believe\r\n\r\nprocedures  are  already  in place.   So  if  there  are  any\r\n\r\nspecific  suggestions from Prof. Toh, we would be  more  than\r\n\r\nhappy to receive them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh asked whether we would consider giving grants\r\n\r\nfor  research into e-commerce, such as e-payment, etc.  Prof.\r\n\r\nToh  may  be  happy  to  hear that,  in  fact,  the  research\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and  research centres  have  come  together  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss and they have jointly identified some areas of  joint\r\n\r\nresearch, and e-commerce will be one of them.  In fact, their\r\n\r\nresearch efforts will be supported by grants through the NSTB\r\n\r\nand eventually if need be, through the Innovation Development\r\n\r\nScheme managed by EDB and IDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Prof. Toh mentioned about allowing professionals\r\n\r\nto  accept payment in kind in the form of shares and options.\r\n\r\nI believe various professions in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  have their code of conduct, code of practice.  I think we\r\n\r\nwill leave it to the respective authorities to decide whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  appropriate to do so, because conflict of  interest\r\n\r\nmay come into play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I believe I have answered the questions\r\n\r\nraised by Prof. Toh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the GPC made its report on COE\r\n\r\nreview last year.  One of the recommendations was to smoothen\r\n\r\nout  the  peaks  in  COE replacement over the  next  two-year\r\n\r\nperiod.   Can the Minister  give us some feedback on  whether\r\n\r\nthis  step has given some stability to the COE bidding?   And\r\n\r\nwill the Minister also give us the new quota for COE for this\r\n\r\nquota  year, bearing in mind the time is quite near  for  the\r\n\r\nMay quota to be revealed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the ERP system has been fully introduced and\r\n\r\nextended, will the Minister tell us whether in the main,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has collected more or less in revenue as  compared\r\n\r\nto  the previous system of CBD ticket system?  I wish to urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to always provide more alternatives for  public\r\n\r\ntransport facilities, be they bus routes or by-passes, beyond\r\n\r\njust  monitoring  the traffic flow rate, before  deciding  on\r\n\r\nraising ERP charges to price congestion.  A lot of members of\r\n\r\nthe  public are keen to know about this, because many of them\r\n\r\nare  quite prepared to switch to alternative transport  modes\r\n\r\nif they are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> The ERP has been in existence\r\n\r\nfor some time and it has been used to optimise road usage and\r\n\r\ncontrol traffic usage.  Since its initial success in the CBD,\r\n\r\nit  has been extended to various other areas in Phase  2.   I\r\n\r\nremember, of course, that when Phase 2A was actually  imposed\r\n\r\nin  CTE,  it  took  a  bit of adjustment before  the  traffic\r\n\r\nimproved.   Initially, even though you paid the charges,  you\r\n\r\nhad  long jams.  But after they tweaked the charges,  traffic\r\n\r\nflow is very much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no doubt that the ERP has served its\r\n\r\npurpose.   However, Phase 2B is on the horizon  and  I  think\r\n\r\nwhat we want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  assured is that, firstly, like what my colleague has just\r\n\r\nsaid, there are viable alternatives and that MCIT will not be\r\n\r\ntoo  ready to place up the new gantries even though they have\r\n\r\nalready  placed  the  footings,  and  that  there  should  be\r\n\r\nadequate  buses  and  other alternative  modes  of  transport\r\n\r\nbefore we do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems is that if you start putting\r\n\r\ngantries up in the new cordons in Phase 2B, one needs  to  be\r\n\r\nreassured  that  you are not just shifting traffic  to  other\r\n\r\npossible  gantry areas where you have not put  the  gantries.\r\n\r\nBecause  if you do that, and if you keep on shifting  traffic\r\n\r\nfrom  one place to another place, eventually you will be able\r\n\r\nto  justify that Phase 2B should be fully implemented.   I am\r\n\r\nnot  affected  in Phase 2B; it is not within my constituency.\r\n\r\nBut I am sure many other MPs are also concerned that Phase 2B\r\n\r\nwill  not be implemented in a hurry.  So perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\nwould like to enlighten us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, in answering my\r\n\r\nquestion  on  25th  February  this  year,  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  MCIT said that LTA would study the possibility  of\r\n\r\nadjusting ERP charges for different seasons of the  year.   I\r\n\r\nfully support such a move.  I would like to know when we  can\r\n\r\nexpect the study to be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ERP is to optimise the use of public roads, through\r\n\r\nregulating   traffic  flow  by  way  of  pricing   mechanism.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it has to be made more responsive to varied  road\r\n\r\nsituations.   It is not difficult to notice that  during  the\r\n\r\nJune and December long school holidays, vehicles on the roads\r\n\r\nare  significantly  less than usual.  This  is  because  many\r\n\r\nSingapore  families  go overseas for  holiday.   During  such\r\n\r\nseasons,  ERP  charges  for certain roads  can  certainly  be\r\n\r\nadjusted downwards, especially during off-peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for the CBD, currently the off-peak hours\r\n\r\ncharge  is $1 per entry for cars.  I notice that many of  the\r\n\r\nroads leading to CBD are not well utilised, even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduring  lunch  time.  So this means there is  also  room  for\r\n\r\nadjustment or fine-tuning of the charges, instead of just the\r\n\r\ncurrent two-tier charges.  Can the Minister comment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, my basic question is this. How does\r\n\r\nthe LTA internalise the social costs of the projects that  it\r\n\r\nplans   and   implements  in  the  planning  process   before\r\n\r\nexecution?   The LTA is a large organisation.  It  undertakes\r\n\r\nmajor  projects.  These are not just large projects in  terms\r\n\r\nof  the  scale, cost or size, but also in terms of the impact\r\n\r\nit  has on the general public.  We have large amenities  that\r\n\r\narise  from them in facilities for road users, commuters  and\r\n\r\nthe  like.   But  these  amenities are  also  caused  by  LTA\r\n\r\nprojects   -  noise  pollution.   We  have  instances   where\r\n\r\ninconvenience has caused to some residents because they  have\r\n\r\nto  divert the mode of travel and in the extreme, it leads to\r\n\r\nacquisition of property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question then is: How does LTA consult or get\r\n\r\nfeedback  or  input  from residents who  are  potentially  or\r\n\r\nactually  affected  by such projects?  I  know  the  LTA  has\r\n\r\nextensive  consultation with many agencies of  Government  in\r\n\r\nplanning  its  projects.  But what about the  public  or  the\r\n\r\nsentiments and interests of the general public?  How is  that\r\n\r\ninternalised?   It  seems to me that typically,  consultation\r\n\r\noccurs at a rather late stage when designs have already  been\r\n\r\ndrawn, specifications have been made and tenders are about to\r\n\r\nbe called.  That is obviously too advance a stage at which to\r\n\r\nincorporate  feedback meaningfully.  Is  there  not  a  stage\r\n\r\nbetween the strategic planning level and the detailed  design\r\n\r\nplanning   level  where  some  views  can   be   sought   and\r\n\r\nincorporated?  The idea here, Sir, is not to fuel  not-in-my-backyard kind of sentiments, and accommodate that.   I  think\r\n\r\nwe  recognise that in public policy, we must give priority to\r\n\r\nthe  national interests.  Neither is it to shackle legitimate\r\n\r\npursuit  of national interests through large public projects.\r\n\r\nBut the purpose of my raising this question is really to ask:\r\n\r\nCan  we  not  accommodate some of the public  concerns  in  a\r\n\r\nvisible and tangible way in the process of LTA's activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, on 27th February this\r\n\r\nyear, the LTA made an announcement which I think passed  with\r\n\r\ntoo  little  fanfare.  And I believe that it deserves  praise\r\n\r\nbecause   it  is  one  of  the  most  progressive   transport\r\n\r\nadministrations in the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new measures for road safety include making road\r\n\r\ndividers brighter and expressway exits clearly, and so on.  I\r\n\r\nthink these measures are all very good.  The promise of  this\r\n\r\nprogramme,  however, is that these changes will  be  made  to\r\n\r\nmajor roads eventually and not just to expressways.  The  LTA\r\n\r\nstaff  have  reassured the community that they are constantly\r\n\r\nlooking  at  changes that need to be made, and they  have  in\r\n\r\nfact  engaged a New Zealand consultant as a \"fresh\"  pair  of\r\n\r\nexpert eyes to see what can be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that this is not the first time that the LTA\r\n\r\nhas  introduced good changes without fanfare and I think they\r\n\r\ndeserve  much  more praise.  For example, I  know  that  they\r\n\r\nintroduced road surfacing material, new material, in the  KJE\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have travelled on, and I find it very good  because\r\n\r\nthe water is absorbed and drained out by the sides.  It gives\r\n\r\ncars better road holding and it allows for the markings to be\r\n\r\nseen  better  because  there  is  no  sheen  from  the  road,\r\n\r\nespecially at night and when the roads are wet.  And  I  just\r\n\r\nhope  that  the Ministry would look at this and  see  whether\r\n\r\nthey  could be expanded to other roads in Singapore.  If they\r\n\r\ncannot  be  expanded to other roads, perhaps  highways  where\r\n\r\nspeeds  are  very high, should have cats' eyes  so  that  the\r\n\r\nmarkings  on  the roads are particularly clear when  we  have\r\n\r\nnight driving or driving in adverse weather conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the LTA for its\r\n\r\nproactivity, but I would like to also suggest that the review\r\n\r\nthat  it does should not just be on the expressways and major\r\n\r\nroads.   Some minor roads too have got potential  problems  - the  dangerous spots.  I could give the Ministry  a  list  of\r\n\r\nsome  of  these.  I hope that these situations  can  also  be\r\n\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, for better feedback, perhaps LTA could\r\n\r\ninstitute some kind of easily used system so that the million\r\n\r\nof  eyes  on  the road could be your eyes too, they  may  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be the experts, but everybody who drives  thinks\r\n\r\nhe  is  an  expert anyway.  Perhaps they could  just  call  a\r\n\r\nhotline to report their observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is 7.00 pm.
