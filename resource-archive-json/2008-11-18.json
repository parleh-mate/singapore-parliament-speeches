FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Senior Minister):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, total consumer loans grew by 10% year-on-year in <p align=left>Column: 887</p>September 2008.&nbsp; Two-thirds of the increase over this period were due to an increase in housing loans, which is not surprising given the buoyant property market in 2006 and 2007.&nbsp; Housing loans are, of course, secured on the property that is being financed and are subject to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) prudential requirements on their maximum loan-to-value ratios.&nbsp; In addition, banks will conduct rigorous credit assessments and consider the risk profile of the borrower, his debt servicing to income ratio and the value of the collateral before granting a housing loan.&nbsp; Car loans, which are also secured credit, have only increased marginally over the same period while share financing, which is the third major component of personal credit lines typically,&nbsp;has fallen.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the bulk of the increase being 10% year-on-year in September was due to housing loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for unsecured credit to individuals, total outstanding balances on credit and charge cards have grown over the past 12 months, consistent with the growth in previous years.&nbsp; However, reflecting the use of credit and charge cards more as convenient payment instruments than anything else, the percentage of outstanding balances rolled over for more than one month, in other words, where it is really a form of credit,&nbsp;has remained fairly constant at around 15%.&nbsp; Moreover, the charge-off rate, which measures credit card debt written off by banks and card issuers as a percentage of the rollover balance, remains low at 3% to 4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS' current rules on the eligibility criteria for personal unsecured credit are not too loose, and are in fact stricter than in most other countries.&nbsp; Firstly, applicants for credit cards and other unsecured credit facilities must meet the minimum annual income requirement of $30,000.&nbsp; Secondly, the maximum credit that can be <p align=left>Column: 888</p>granted by a financial institution to an individual on a credit card is limited to twice his monthly income.&nbsp; Other unsecured credit facilities granted to an individual are similarly capped by a separate limit of twice the monthly income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in consumer loans that we have seen has been in line with economic growth and the upturn in property purchases in recent years, and it&nbsp;is not in itself a cause for concern.&nbsp; We would, of course, be concerned if financial institutions are lending without regard to credit standards and risk assessment, and that borrowers are taking credit without considering if they can afford it.&nbsp; But the prudential and lending criteria employed by financial institutions and required by MAS address these concerns by maintaining sound lending standards at all times.&nbsp; MAS would continue to watch this, of course, including not just the charge-off rates but just the absolute growth in loans to individuals, and, if necessary discuss the matter with financial institutions.&nbsp; But, as of now, the charge-off rates are low, the institutions have proper risk assessment procedures for granting of personal loans as with other loans and of now, there is no concern.&nbsp; And we will continue to expand&nbsp;MoneySENSE, which is the national financial education programme that is&nbsp;expanded on the ground, so that we can help more Singaporeans acquire the skills and knowledge to&nbsp;manage their day-to-day finances, make prudent investments and plan for their longer-term needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If you look at credit card loans, the loans have grown by about $840 million as of September 2008,&nbsp;year-on-year, in other words, compared to September 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a fairly significant year-on-year growth, about 18% or 19%.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the amounts rolled over for more than a month have actually remained constant though, at about 15%, and the charge-off rates, which are&nbsp;essentially bad loans, have also remained relatively constant at 3%-4%.&nbsp; I think we should watch this carefully because the 18%-19% growth in credit cards, even in line with past economic growth, is something which we should watch carefully.&nbsp; MAS is monitoring this but, as of now, there is no serious cause for concern, and we will stay in close touch&nbsp;with the banks.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CREDIT LINES FOR BUSINESSES-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:CREDIT LINES FOR BUSINESSES:::892-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Senior Minister):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been closely monitoring developments in the global financial markets and their impact on Singapore.&nbsp; As far as the inter-bank market is concerned, there has been sufficient liquidity in our system. We have not seen the market freeze up, as happened in some other global financial centres in recent months.&nbsp; Banks have been able to obtain Singapore dollar <p align=left>Column: 890</p>funding among themselves in an orderly manner.&nbsp; Inter-bank funding rates, illustrated by the three-month, Singapore Inter-Bank Offer Rate (SIBOR), eased from over 2% during the quarter-end period in September to about 1% currently.&nbsp; This is lower than the 2.5% that we saw in July last year, before the crisis started. &nbsp; So inter-bank rates are now lower than they used to be, the market remains orderly and we have not seen major disruptions in Singapore inter-bank market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at end-September, total bank lending to non-bank customers is still growing.&nbsp; Specifically, loans to the building and construction sector, which Ms Lee Bee Wah was enquiring about,&nbsp;have increased by about 50% in the 12 months to September 2008.&nbsp; So year-on-year, it is a 50% growth in loans to the building and construction sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some tightening of bank credit is inevitable in an economic downturn.&nbsp; But we are unlikely to see this happen on the scale that is occurring in many other parts of the world, where banks are tightening credit not only because of increased risks that they perceive in a downturn, but because they are short of capital.&nbsp; We do not face that problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS' assessment is that while there is no large scale credit crisis in Singapore, some segments of borrowers may face higher borrowing costs. It will be inappropriate for the Government to direct banks to lend, or to get involved in who they should lend to.&nbsp; These are commercial decisions which the banks themselves have to make, based on their assessment of the risks as well as the relationships that they maintain with their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our banks make these assessments carefully, and take into account both the short-term risks and their long-term interests in keeping their customers. We should continue to leave these decisions to them. However, what Government can <p align=left>Column: 891</p>and will do is to enhance the various Government schemes that are in place to help our Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), possibly also some enterprises that are not SMEs but somewhat larger, to&nbsp;retain access to credit.&nbsp; The Prime Minister has spoken about this on Sunday, and we will be making some announcements quite soon.&nbsp; Most of these schemes will involve Government risk-sharing with the banks on loans to Singapore companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Micro-Loan Programme offers loans of up to $15 million for factory or machinery loans and $50,000 for unsecured working capital respectively.&nbsp; SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore have also introduced the Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS) which offers secured loans for working capital and trade financing. There&nbsp;are, in fact,&nbsp;among the existing schemes existing eligibility limits and quantums of loans.&nbsp;There has been a significant increase already this year in SMEs' use of these schemes.&nbsp; For instance, the amount of loans under the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) and the Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS) for the first eight months of&nbsp;this year&nbsp;has grown by more than 55% over the same period last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be enhancing and stepping up these loans schemes to help our companies,&nbsp;and will announce details soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B>&nbsp; First, on the statutory boards which have the exposure.&nbsp; To repeat, none of the statutory boards have any exposure to credit-linked notes which have seen early redemptions triggered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add that the universe of credit-linked notes includes both relatively safe instruments which are backed by very safe underlying securities&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;including those of some major Singapore companies&nbsp;&ndash; as well as credit-linked notes which are&nbsp;closer to the moderate to higher end of the risk spectrum.&nbsp; So there is nothing in credit-linked notes <I>per se</I> that speaks about high risk. &nbsp;I would like to clarify that.&nbsp; But in the interest of transparency&nbsp;&ndash; because I was asked about exposure to <p align=left>Column: 895</p>credit-linked notes&nbsp;&ndash; I provided that there are four statutory boards that do have some exposure to some credit-linked notes. &nbsp;Their performance on those notes alone has not been very different from that in global markets.&nbsp; In fact, I can tell&nbsp;Members that on those credit-linked notes alone, they have suffered a paper loss of about 14% in the course of this year.&nbsp; Fourteen percent, as you know from what is going on in the global markets, is not an extraordinary paper loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four statutory boards&nbsp;concerned are&nbsp;Civil Service College, Singapore Land Authority, Infocomm Development Authority and the Professional Engineers' Board.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exposure to these credit-linked notes, as a percentage of total investment portfolios of our statutory boards collectively, was about 0.05%.&nbsp; So, it is not a large sum. &nbsp;All our statutory boards are advised, not just for credit-linked notes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;which I have just explained&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;are not always high risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;I advise in investment portfolios to maintain sound principles of diversification and risk management.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:NEW HDB FLATS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:NEW HDB FLATS:::905-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (c) whether HDB will consider selling flats based on cost or further lowering the selling prices of new flats.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the Member is referring to <p align=left>Column: 896</p>recent media reports on the high prices of a small number of flats at prime locations, especially those at the Pinnacle@Duxton or under the Design, Build&nbsp;and Sell Scheme (DBSS).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we discuss affordability of HDB flats, one thing that I would like to point out is that HDB&nbsp;homeownership flats cater to a very wide range of flat buyers.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;they cater to over 80% of the Singapore population and, in this range, there are buyers with household incomes&nbsp;as low as $1,000 and buyers with household incomes as&nbsp;high as $8,000 a month.&nbsp; So this covers a wide range of buyers in terms of incomes, tastes and aspirations, and that is why&nbsp;HDB has to offer flats of different prices, locations and budgets to meet the different&nbsp;needs and budgets of this wide range of buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the lower income households, HDB builds smaller 2-room and 3-room flats and these flats&nbsp;range&nbsp;in price from about $77,000 for the lowest-priced new 2-room flat to about $275,000 for the highest-priced new 3-room flat. &nbsp;The prices vary depending on the location.&nbsp; For households at the higher end of the income range, we have the 4-room and 5-room flats, which start from as low as $158,000 for&nbsp;the cheapest&nbsp;4-room flat&nbsp;and go up to as high as $646,000, again depending on the location.&nbsp; The prices at the higher end of the price range are those located in prime areas such as the Pinnacle@Duxton, or those built by private developers under the DBSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to inform the Member that the high-end HDB flats such as DBSS flats make up less than 10% of the total annual&nbsp;supply of new HDB flats.&nbsp; For the vast majority of HDB flat buyers, there is ample supply of lower-priced new HDB flats to meet their needs at affordable prices.&nbsp; More than 90% of HDB's building programme are studio apartments, 2-room flats, 3-room flats, 4-room flats and the lower priced 5-room flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;This constitutes <p align=left>Column: 897</p>more than 90% of the total building programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Member asked why HDB sells new flats based on market price instead of cost.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain. &nbsp;In pricing a flat, HDB first determines what is its equivalent market price taking into account various factors such as location, finishes of the flat and other flat attributes, ie,&nbsp;its facing, what floor it is on, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;This market price is determined by actual transactions of similar flats.&nbsp; It is not a theoretical number, but it is based on what people have actually paid for flats in the surrounding vicinity and it&nbsp;is based on professional valuation principles.&nbsp; So, this is what the flat is worth, this is what people are&nbsp;willing to pay on the resale market for such a flat.&nbsp; HDB then sells this flat&nbsp;to eligible flat buyers at a significant discount to the market price, and this discount is the subsidy that is given by the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A market-based approach is the fairest way of pricing new HDB flats because it reflects what the flat is worth at the point of purchase&nbsp;which may have no relation, whatsoever,&nbsp;to what it costs to build.&nbsp; Take, for example, the Pinnacle@Duxton project.&nbsp; Between 2004 when the flats were first released and today, the market price of comparable flats in the vicinity has gone up by about 50%.&nbsp; I am talking about vicinity.&nbsp; I am talking about HDB flats in Cantonment Towers and&nbsp;around Tanjong Pagar area, for example.&nbsp; We are not talking about private developed flats, but HDB flats.&nbsp; So, when the second batch of&nbsp; the&nbsp;Pinnacle@Duxton flats was released for sale,&nbsp;the prices of the balance flats that were released in September 2008 also had to be&nbsp;about 50% higher than the prices in 2004.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Pinnacle flats are still subsidised flats because&nbsp;they are being sold at&nbsp;lower prices than what they would command in the market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 898</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The balance flats that were offered for sale recently had an over-subscription rate of&nbsp;over&nbsp;700%.&nbsp; In other words, for every flat that was put on sale, there were seven buyers waiting to buy the flat.&nbsp; I think this reflects the sense that these flats are actually good value for money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, when the market goes down, new flat prices are reduced accordingly.&nbsp; Members would remember that in the&nbsp;late '90s after the Asian Financial Crisis, the property market suffered a severe downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;So when HDB sold new flats at that time, the new flats were&nbsp;priced below the market rates.&nbsp; The HDB flat prices&nbsp;moved downwards.&nbsp; So the average prices of 5-room and executive flats, for example, in Sengkang when they were reoffered in 2005, were 30% lower than what they were first offered for sale in 1997 and 1998 because the market in 2005 was much lower than it was in 1997 and 1998.&nbsp; So it is not just the market going up and HDB following, but the market going down, HDB also follows suit, based on the market-based approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As HDB does not factor cost into its pricing, under the market-pricing approach, it is able to recover costs only in some projects while incurring losses in other projects. &nbsp;For example, a typical 4-room flat in Punggol or Sengkang today costs more than&nbsp;$300,000 to develop, taking into account current land, building and other costs.&nbsp; This is much higher than the subsidised selling price of between $200,000 and $260,000 for new flats in Punggol and Sengkang.&nbsp; If you take&nbsp;it as a whole, over the last three years,&nbsp;all the flats that HDB has built has incurred an average deficit of $530 million&nbsp;per year for its home ownership programme.&nbsp; So this is the cumulative sum of all the pluses and minuses&nbsp;for the whole building programme over the last three years, and this&nbsp;figure is published every year in its annual report.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 899</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Member asked whether HDB flats are affordable.&nbsp; A well-accepted and reliable measure of affordability is how much a household has to pay for its mortgage instalments, relative to its household income.&nbsp; Based on this, HDB flats have remained affordable, even though property prices have risen over the years in tandem with Singapore's economic growth.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, HDB flat owners' mortgage payments are on average below 25% of their monthly household income. &nbsp;This is within the international affordability benchmark of 30%.&nbsp; What is more encouraging is that&nbsp;70% of new flat buyers service their mortgage instalments entirely&nbsp;using their CPF monies without having to touch their&nbsp;cash.&nbsp; We have achieved one of the highest home ownership rates in the world, at 80% of the population. &nbsp;This would not have been possible without generous Government subsidies to ensure affordability of HDB flats.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B>&nbsp; Sir, based on the Minister's answer, would the Minister clarify that&nbsp;for&nbsp;first-time buyers who bought a flat directly from HDB, they may also suffer a loss when the market is down?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if that is the case,&nbsp;what is the subsidy that the Minister is talking about?&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp;a first-time flat buyer who bought a flat at $600,000 with a subsidy of $30,000&nbsp;from HDB, when the market is down, the flat may&nbsp;be only worth $400,000.&nbsp; So, where and what is the subsidy?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; Sir, the HDB market, like the private property market, will go through ups-and-downs in the short term.&nbsp;&nbsp;Property cycles are&nbsp;well known in the property market and HDB flats, if they are <p align=left>Column: 900</p>resold on the resale market,&nbsp;have to follow these property cycles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member asked, where is the subsidy? &nbsp;As I have explained, when the Government sells a $600,000&nbsp;value flat at, say, $500,000, that is&nbsp;a subsidy of $100,000.&nbsp; If it sells a $400,000 flat at $300,000, that is another $100,000 subsidy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that the $600,000 flat will always be priced at $600,000.&nbsp; In the short term, there may be fluctuations.&nbsp; But in the long run, as Singapore's economy grows, and the Government continues to maintain a stable property market and&nbsp;pumps in money to upgrade the HDB estates,&nbsp;the HDB flat value will go up over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB flat is not a short-term speculative investment which people buy today and then sell, say, in five years' time when the minimum occupation period is up.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

And as a long-term store of value, I have every confidence that the HDB flat price will go up over time as Singapore's economy grows.&nbsp; That is the reason why the Government subsidises HDB flats, so that people can have a stake in this growth in Singapore's economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy is what will help Singaporeans to buy their first flat.&nbsp; Whether you are&nbsp;a $1,000 household income&nbsp;or&nbsp;a $8,000&nbsp;household income, you will be able to afford a flat commensurate with your income.&nbsp; That is the first starting point.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;you will find that, over time, the value of your flat will grow.&nbsp; And, hopefully, when you retire, you will have this substantial store of value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just rhetoric, this has been proven.&nbsp; The store of value today&nbsp;collectively&nbsp;for all&nbsp;HDB flats&nbsp;is well over $100,000,&nbsp;and this is the&nbsp;value which they are able to cash out on when they retire one day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a real subsidy that we are talking about.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;a paper subsidy.&nbsp; It is a <p align=left>Column: 901</p>very real subsidy&nbsp;that&nbsp;all Singaporeans enjoy when they buy a HDB flat.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So my question to the Minister is whether indeed&nbsp;this is the focus and the priority of HDB in its building programme going forward.&nbsp; And I would like to suggest, at least from my experience, to focus more on building smaller flats where the price consideration is a major factor.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; The Member is absolutely right.&nbsp; The focus for us is to build more smaller flats, not just to allow more of the low-income families to own flats but also, to a certain extent, to allow some of the families who are facing financial difficulty to downgrade to the smaller flats.&nbsp; So for both these very good reasons, we are indeed building more of the smaller flats.&nbsp; In fact, for the first time, we are building 2-room flats and have also restarted building&nbsp;3-room flats in the last couple of years.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Member will be pleased to know that in the course of the next year, these new 2-room and 3-room flats will come onstream, and they will be able to provide a very useful outlet for some of the lower-income families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to&nbsp;reiterate the point that I made in my answer&nbsp;&ndash; the bulk of the HDB housing programme is really concentrated on the 3-room and the 4-room flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporean flat buyers would be interested to buy the 3-room and the 4-room flats.&nbsp; The 2-room flats are a small portion because they only cater to a very specific niche in the buyers' market, as are the high-end flats like the DBSS and the Pinnacle-type flats.&nbsp; They also cater to a very specific niche in the market.&nbsp; So the bulk of the flats are in the 3-room and&nbsp;the 4-room category.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 902</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;

five years, 10 years or 20 years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, second clarification: the Minister said that these are real subsidies, so I would like to ask the Minister what does he mean by \"real\".&nbsp; Real subsidy, to me, means that you can really benefit when you sell the flat.&nbsp; In the case where a first-timer who bought a flat from HDB, got a subsidy from the Government and he sold it five years later at a loss,&nbsp;he actually did not get any subsidy in real terms from the Government.&nbsp; So how is it \"real\" and what does he mean by \"real\"?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp; I think I have already answered the second question.&nbsp; The subsidy is the subsidy given as at that point in time. It is the difference between the market price and what he actually paid for it.&nbsp; If Mr Low goes and buys himself a flat from the private market&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I do not know what he would like to buy&nbsp;&ndash; let us say a condominium somewhere in Hougang&nbsp;and it is worth $1 million, and the developer tells him, \"For you, Mr Low, because you are the MP in this area and you have done such a good job, I will sell it to you for $900,000\", do you not agree that that is a $100,000 subsidy?&nbsp; If subsequently that $1 million flat goes down to $800,000, does it mean that the subsidy of $100,000 has disappeared?&nbsp; Surely not. He was given a subsidy as at that point in time because that was the difference between the market price and what he paid for it.&nbsp; That is a real subsidy; he saved $100,000.&nbsp; So to say that it is not a real subsidy, I think he is just trying to make a political point.&nbsp; I understand. [<I>Interruption.</I> ]&nbsp; Let me finish answering&nbsp;his first question.&nbsp; The first question is: what is long term?&nbsp; I think it is very difficult to determine what is long term.&nbsp; It depends on each individual family circumstances.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 903</p>But my advice to flat buyers is always: if you buy a flat suitable for your family, stay in it for the long run.&nbsp; Have your children there,&nbsp;see them grow up and even, preferably, retire there.&nbsp; And this is what majority of HDB flat buyers do.&nbsp; The phenomenon that we saw in recent years, or at least in the 90s or early 2000, where people bought and sold flats very frequently, I think those days should not come back.&nbsp; People should buy&nbsp;a flat that they can afford.&nbsp; If their family circumstances improve and they want to upgrade, by all means.&nbsp; Upgrade if they can afford to do so.&nbsp; But please consider your flat as a long-term investment and also a long-term place for you to raise your children and to retire in, not for you to go and buy and then sell five years later,&nbsp;and then after that, buy again five years later.&nbsp; That is not the purpose or the objective of the public housing programme.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Dr Faishal, last question.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; The 80% home ownership rate that I was talking about refers to the HDB home ownership rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty percent&nbsp;of Singaporeans&nbsp;own&nbsp;HDB flats.&nbsp; This is of course a reflection of the kind of eligibility criteria that we set.&nbsp; When we set the family income eligibility criteria at $8,000, that corresponds to about 80% of the number of Singaporean households.&nbsp; So if the Member is asking about the home ownership target for HDB flats, my answer is that there is no intention to vary that at the moment.&nbsp; I think it is a very large coverage, as it is, to have a public housing programme that covers 80% of the population.&nbsp; By any <p align=left>Column: 905</p>account, in any country in the world, it is an extremely wide and a generous one.&nbsp; So I do not think that there is intention to widen that even further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, there is also no intention for us to change it such that less people are eligible for HDB flats.&nbsp; There is no intention to do that either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to add, affordability actually has&nbsp;no relationship to the home ownership rate because when we talk about affordability, we will price our flat such that these people within that 80% range will be able to afford a HDB flat.&nbsp; So if you are a low-income family earning, say,&nbsp;$1,000 to $1,500, you will be able to afford a 2-room flat because it will be priced such that you can afford the 2-room flat.&nbsp; And, similarly, if your income is $5,000 to $6,000, you will be able to afford a 5-room flat because the price of the 5-room flat will be affordable to you.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:DEFAULTERS OF HDB MORTGAGE LOANS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:DEFAULTERS OF HDB MORTGAGE LOANS:::916-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at October 2008, there are 33,000 flat owners owing HDB arrears of&nbsp;three months or more.&nbsp; They make up less than 8% of the 420,000 <p align=left>Column: 906</p>households with outstanding HDB loans.&nbsp; The number has remained relatively stable over the last one year.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lessees in financial difficulty may apply to HDB for temporary reduction of their monthly loan payments.&nbsp; This is to give some time for them to work out a sustainable solution to their financial problems.&nbsp; However, it is not in their interest to stretch the loan payment reductions over too&nbsp;long&nbsp;a period, as the mortgage debt will continue to increase due to interest accumulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, lessees in financial difficulty need to be realistic about their financial circumstances, and consider long-term sustainable solutions.&nbsp; For example, they can sublet a room to generate additional income, or downgrade to a smaller, more affordable flat.&nbsp; HDB will assist on a case-by-case basis, for example, by providing another loan to help the lessees downgrade.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are lessees in mortgage arrears who are unwilling to work towards a long-term sustainable solution, even after HDB has provided ample time, assistance and advice.&nbsp; Their arrears continue to accumulate and their flats run the risk of falling into negative equity.&nbsp; In these cases, HDB has no choice but to initiate compulsory acquisition of the flat.&nbsp; Otherwise, the lessee will be settled with heavy debts even if he were to sell his flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that compulsory acquisition is considered only as a last resort, after all other avenues have been exhausted.&nbsp; HDB lessees facing financial difficulties with mortgage payments should work with HDB early on a long-term solution.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:&nbsp;</B> Sir, I thank Dr Lim for his supplementary questions.&nbsp; I think we understand that Singaporean home owners are concerned about the uncertain economic outlook and the issue of mortgage arrears has surfaced in many of our MPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me just reiterate&nbsp;a point first.&nbsp; Compulsory acquisition is the last resort.&nbsp; It is not the first action that HDB takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 908</p>HDB helps all home owners to&nbsp;manage their mortgage payments.&nbsp; I think, at the end of the day, as the Minister mentioned earlier, the policy of HDB is home ownership.&nbsp; We do not want to be&nbsp;in a situation where we encouraged home owners to have&nbsp;their own homes and later on work towards displacing them.&nbsp; That is not the idea at all.&nbsp; Sir, that is&nbsp;really to help home owners manage their mortgage payments as they go along.&nbsp; But given the economic situation, sometimes they do face difficulties.&nbsp; So what do we do with some of these home&nbsp;owners?&nbsp; Let me go from the fourth question upwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is the issue of reduced repayment packages and&nbsp;what we can do to help them.&nbsp; There are two broad possibilities.&nbsp; One is really we offer them reduced repayment schemes.&nbsp; We can offer them&nbsp;up to between 25%&nbsp;and 50% reduced&nbsp;repayments for&nbsp;six months' period, to be reviewed, and sometimes we go all the way to&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; Two years is quite a long time for them to manage and to look and find longer-term solutions.&nbsp; But I think at the end of the day, we must emphasise and&nbsp;tell the residents that&nbsp;it is better for them to look for long-term solutions rather than look at short-term repayment.&nbsp; The short-term reduced repayment scheme is really for them to tide over this difficult period.&nbsp; It is for those whom we assess as possibly having the ability to improve their economic circumstances again so that they can subsequently continue and get back on track to their mortgage payment plans. For those who possibly have difficulty in the longer term, I&nbsp;think finding longer-term solution is a better option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the longer-term solutions?&nbsp; Really,&nbsp;if they cannot manage the monthly repayment&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I will cite the cases later&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where the monthly instalment is almost equivalent to the income that they have today because of retrenchment, because of reduced income, it is really not tenable for them.&nbsp; If we assess that within the next&nbsp;six months or a&nbsp;year they may not <p align=left>Column: 909</p>have the ability to raise their income level back to the original sum, then they should&nbsp;sell the flat, buy a smaller flat that is more affordable with the mortgage payment lesser than the&nbsp;previous mortgage payment.&nbsp; So I think working with them very closely and&nbsp;finding all these long-term solutions will be a better option than really looking&nbsp;at extending short-term solutions for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next on the issue of interim housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, less than 8% of these mortgagees or home owners are facing some of these arrear&nbsp;problems and many of them are having mortgage arrears of between&nbsp;three&nbsp;and 12 months and some are above 12 months.&nbsp; For many of them,&nbsp;we can&nbsp;actually find solutions for them.&nbsp; Even after they sell their flats, there are possible&nbsp;solutions for downgrading.&nbsp; Interim housing is really the last option. We are considering some of the options and possibilities, but we do not envisage a situation where we have&nbsp;a large exodus of displaced individuals and families where we need to house them in temporary housing, like unused Government buildings&nbsp;or schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we want to work towards a situation where we find solutions for them.&nbsp; There are interim measures.&nbsp; We do have situations where such families are placed in sheltered homes but really these are small&nbsp;and far in between.&nbsp; As far as we are concerned, before we actually take any action against them, we find all these alternative solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just give&nbsp;Members some examples of what HDB has been doing to help some of these families.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think some of these families are quite similar to the kind of cases that&nbsp;Members of the House would be familiar with.&nbsp; One case, the lessees fell into arrears a month after their purchase of the flat because the husband lost&nbsp;his job.&nbsp; It was probably during the economic downturn previously.&nbsp; To help&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 910</p>lessees tide over the financial difficulties, the Branch Office allowed them to pay a lower instalment under the reduced repayment scheme which I talked about earlier, on three separate occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This meant that they had&nbsp;difficulties along the way.&nbsp; In 2001,&nbsp;2004 and&nbsp;July 2005, there were different situations where we actually assisted them with reduced repayment.&nbsp; However, the lessees still could not cope with the mortgage payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February 2007, that was the beginning of&nbsp;a crisis situation for them.&nbsp; They were adjudicated as bankrupts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wife subsequently was discharged from bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Branch Office&nbsp;then gave them ample time and opportunities to&nbsp;resolve their arrear problems to no avail.&nbsp; They had difficulties along the way.&nbsp; So to prevent the arrears from accumulating, approval was obtained in January 2008, some&nbsp;seven years later.&nbsp; They started having problems in 2001, only in January 2008 we obtained approval to compulsorily acquire the flat on grounds of mortgage arrears.&nbsp; The mortgage arrears would have already accumulated significantly to the point that we assessed it is better for them to find a more long-term solution.&nbsp; So compulsory acquisition&nbsp;(CA) notice was served on 11th February 2008 this year.&nbsp; After the notice of intent was served, lessees agreed to sell the flat.&nbsp; So they finally agreed to find a more long-term solution so that they can get a better price compared to the compulsory acquisition compensation amount.&nbsp; The CA compensation amount at that time was about $142,000, but they were able to sell the flat at $194,000.&nbsp; So currently the lessees are undergoing the resale transaction scheduled for early next year.&nbsp; In the meantime, they have agreed to stay with their relatives before they purchase the next flat.&nbsp; So that is one example of how HDB has over the years&nbsp;worked&nbsp;very hard, on a case-by-case basis, to assist these families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 911</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give an example of the second case, the case where Dr Lim talked about the&nbsp;potential actual compulsory acquisition.&nbsp; An ex-lessee purchased the flat in 1997.&nbsp; He fell into arrears in February 2001 because he lost his job.&nbsp; Although the Branch Office (BO) allowed him to pay reduced repayment or the RRS on four separate occasions,&nbsp;six months each, and deferred his mortgage payment, once from 2001, he still could not cope with the mortgage payments.&nbsp; The ex-lessee actually sublet the flat but did not use the rental income&nbsp;to&nbsp;pay for the mortgage payments.&nbsp; He remained uncontactable and BO was unable to refer him to CDC for job matching and other forms of assistance.&nbsp; So to prevent further accumulation of the mortgage arrears, approval was obtained in July this year to compulsorily acquire the flat.&nbsp; The title of the flat was revested in October this year and the lessee is still not contactable.&nbsp; BO is scheduled to recover the possession of the flat at the end of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that there are solutions and we will continue to work with the individual cases.&nbsp; So while we talk about the short-term solutions, let me just quickly run through some of the possible longer-term solutions for these lessees.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is that we can look into the possibility of refinancing the loan by&nbsp;including eligible members of the family.&nbsp; Some lessees ask whether they&nbsp;can&nbsp;wait for half a year or&nbsp;one year because their older children&nbsp;would&nbsp;be finishing their tertiary education and would be able&nbsp;to&nbsp;be part of the repayment plan and&nbsp;we allow them.&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility is to extend the loan&nbsp;if they have not reached the maximum period.&nbsp; So, at the end of the day, Sir, we will continue to try to help lessees who have difficulty with the mortgage arrears, especially during a&nbsp;difficult time like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Lim's&nbsp;first question&nbsp;on the projected trend, I think previous downturn showed us that at the end, if we are able <p align=left>Column: 912</p>to manage the situation, the arrear levels would not exceed the current situation that&nbsp;we are facing today.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor closely the situation and how we can assist these families.&nbsp; We will help them right from the very beginning.&nbsp; The moment we see that the arrear is&nbsp;starting to accumulate, we will respond.&nbsp; And we appeal to all the residents,&nbsp; the lessees, the home owners to respond&nbsp;to the efforts by HDB officers.&nbsp; Often times, they&nbsp;do not respond and allow the arrears to accumulate before they finally decide to come forward.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):&nbsp;</B> Sir, according to feedback from residents, sometimes it is the HDB officers that are not responding to calls that they made to the number provided.&nbsp; Can I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to please look into this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question is on the issue of downgrading and getting&nbsp;a rental flat.&nbsp; What happens is that when HDB wants to compulsorily&nbsp;acquire a flat, the residents want to find a&nbsp;way to go to a rental flat but usually the answer has always been \"there is a long queue for rental flats and therefore you can't have one\",&nbsp;or \"we might consider your case at a future time when there are flats available\".&nbsp; But the situation is when their flats&nbsp;are already acquired by HDB, then what is the option for them?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:&nbsp;</B> Sir,&nbsp;let me respond to the first part of the question, which is responses by HDB officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 420,000 households that are having outstanding loans and it is a massive programme, and HDB officers&nbsp;work very hard to try to respond to each and every case.&nbsp; And I appeal to&nbsp;Members' forbearance as far as HDB's responses&nbsp;are concerned.&nbsp; But we will try to reach out to every resident as far as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of rental flat, rental flat is really one of the options.&nbsp; A lot of times <p align=left>Column: 913</p>lessees&nbsp;see it as the only option.&nbsp; So when HDB officers counsel them and look at the alternative solutions, often times we look at what is the&nbsp;next possible solution.&nbsp; Sometimes when they sell the flat, they have the ability to actually downgrade.&nbsp; There are proceeds to the sale of their flat, and&nbsp;the proceeds may allow them the potential to own another flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB may be prepared to give them another loan but&nbsp;the loan that may be given to them is actually not sufficient due to their low income.&nbsp; So what we tried to tell them to do is, \"Let's look at your other options.&nbsp; You may not be eligible&nbsp;for rental&nbsp;flats because you do have proceeds, you are not totally low income.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes they do have income of more than $1,500, which means that they are not eligible for rental flats.&nbsp; So what are the options?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, they may be able to rent in the open market, which is less favoured by many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, really I think we should start talking about the possibility of getting support from their extended families, and many of the lessees actually do get support from their extended families.&nbsp; They live with&nbsp;their extended families for a while, save up so that they can get enough savings to be able to pay for the&nbsp;next flat or improve their income level so that the&nbsp;loan that HDB is prepared to give is higher and that will enable them to purchase the next flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;the point that we are trying to make is&nbsp;to make sure that every lessee understand and go through that process with the&nbsp;HDB officer on all the different options.&nbsp; Often times, the option that HDB&nbsp;presents to them is not their preferred option.&nbsp; Because certainly their preferred option is a simple rental flat which is heavily subsidised, but we have a lot of issues with subsidised rental flats as we had talked about before in this House.&nbsp; We talked about the fact that their numbers are limited, we&nbsp;talked about the <p align=left>Column: 914</p>fact that we want to focus and target subsidised rental flats to the really needy who have not obtained subsidies before.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I think it is not about just looking at rental flats as the only option.&nbsp; It is one of the options, but let us&nbsp;look at other options that are more viable for them too.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</B>:&nbsp; The&nbsp;question is really what are the solutions we have for some of these families.&nbsp; I think we are working towards multi-pronged approaches.&nbsp; The reason why some of these families get into difficulties, is really sometimes,&nbsp;at the onset, they might have not made their calculations right. They might have bought flats which are beyond their ability, given the economic circumstances or their&nbsp;reduced income.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 915</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we have for them?&nbsp; I think one of the solutions we have is for them to downgrade.&nbsp; The concern of many MPs really is the supply of smaller flats for them to downgrade to.&nbsp; We are looking into that, as the Minister had mentioned in&nbsp;his earlier response,&nbsp;and we are actively freeing up the supply of our smaller flats, including 2-room flats and 3-room flats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, when we&nbsp;talk about the solution, we are talking about&nbsp;MPs coming to us all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all also acknowledge the fact that there are many appeals and your own experiences tell you that&nbsp;many appeals come through HDB.&nbsp; And it takes a while for us to process each and every appeal, and for us to micro-manage each appeal is really an arduous process.&nbsp; So, I beg the forbearance of Members to appreciate that it is not an easy task to help families go through that whole process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, families do have their own expectations and their own preferred solutions.&nbsp; Like we say, in our assessment, sometimes the preferred solution is really not what they want or what we think is doable for them.&nbsp; So I take the point about alternative rental housing, whether we can differentiate the rentals as well as&nbsp;subsidies&nbsp;are&nbsp;concerned.&nbsp; I think the whole principle behind it is really how do we allocate Government subsidies to Singaporeans today.&nbsp; The structure is that you get subsidies through the housing ownership policy or through the rental policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have obtained one subsidy, you have differentiated levels of subsidies subsequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you have obtained two subsidies, then it is fair for you not to have further subsidies unless it is really an extenuating circumstance.&nbsp; I think we can continue to study the issue of how we allocate subsidies.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, we have to ask ourselves how much subsidies do we want to give Singaporeans, to what extent do you <p align=left>Column: 916</p>want to give subsidies to Singaporeans, at what point do we actually stop and say, that is it, I think&nbsp;you have benefited and let us&nbsp;find other solutions for you.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:2-ROOM AND 3-ROOM HDB FLATS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:2-ROOM AND 3-ROOM HDB FLATS:::920-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for National Development)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, resale HDB transactions take place on a \"willing buyer, willing seller\" basis.&nbsp; Resale prices, including cash-over-valuation (COV),&nbsp;are influenced&nbsp;by factors such as location and attributes of the flat as well&nbsp;as the circumstances of the buyers and sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on&nbsp;third quarter 2008 figures, 25% of the 2-room and 3-room resale&nbsp;transactions involved COV of $10,000 or less.&nbsp; The median COV amounts for 2-room and 3-room resale flats&nbsp;are $16,000 and $19,000 respectively.&nbsp; They have stabilised in recent quarters and are comparable to other flat types.&nbsp; However, there&nbsp;is a wide range of COV for each flat type across different towns, including transactions&nbsp;at or below valuation.&nbsp; For transactions in third quarter 2008 with positive COV, the median COV ranged from $4,100 in Ang Mo Kio, for example, to $23,000 in Bukit Merah for 2-room flats.&nbsp; For 3-room flats, the median COV ranged from $12,000 in Pasir Ris to $38,600 in Bukit Timah.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has provided resale information to help flat buyers make informed decisions.&nbsp; Every quarter, HDB publishes the median resale prices as well as the <p align=left>Column: 917</p>median COV, by town and by flat type, to aid flat buyers in finding a resale flat&nbsp;that meets their housing needs and affordability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existing stock of 2-room and 3-room flats is mainly in the&nbsp;matured estates, where demand is strong.&nbsp; HDB is building more 2-room and 3-room flats in tandem with the rising demand.&nbsp; This will further increase our&nbsp;stock and geographical spread of smaller flats in the resale market over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should point out that the COV can be positive&nbsp;or negative depending on market conditions.&nbsp; As buying a flat is a long-term commitment, flat buyers should exercise prudence and buy a flat within their means.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)</B>:&nbsp; Thank you, Senior Minister of State, for the comprehensive response.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have&nbsp;three supplementary questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this economic downturn, I really like to know how will downgraders to 2-room and 3-room flats be impacted, and whether there is a record in the HDB as to the number of downgraders who have been affected by this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point really is whether there&nbsp;is sufficient counselling on affordability that is conducted by HDB for potential downgraders or purchasers of&nbsp;flat, because I think it is important that we should inculcate in our Singaporeans this attitude of responsibility when they want to make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the&nbsp;last question really is with regard to what Mdm Cynthia Phua, my parliamentary colleague, has raised.&nbsp; There is concern that perhaps for residents&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and even for the benefit of the advisers and the MPs &ndash; whether there should be some more briefings carried out by HDB with the MPs on what is&nbsp;really <p align=left>Column: 918</p>being done to address those cases encountered.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</B>:&nbsp; Let me start with the third question with regard&nbsp;to residents who have encountered problem with their financial mortgages.&nbsp; I assume that is what the Member was asking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary, has provided&nbsp;very&nbsp;comprehensive answers to the earlier questions and so I do not intend to go through that question again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would the downturn affect downgraders to 2-room and 3-room?&nbsp; We&nbsp;expect more of&nbsp;them would have to take very realistic assessment of their economic position and financial position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are building more 2-room and 3-room flats.&nbsp; As the Minister has said in his reply to the earlier question, we have started building 3-room flats in 2004, and 2-room flats in 2006 again.&nbsp; So there is a good pipeline of the smaller room types coming on stream.&nbsp; In fact, for BTO this year, out of the 8,000 flats that we are building, there will be 1,000 of the smaller flat types.&nbsp; Next year and the year after, we are budgeting, at this point in time, about 2,000 units each for the following two years.&nbsp; So there will be a steady pipeline of small flat types coming on stream and really that is to provide a wide range of HDB flats to meet the needs of a wide range of residents with their respective economic position and affordability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether there will be sufficient counselling for downgraders, actually we totally agree with the Member's concern that residents should really buy within their means.&nbsp; And&nbsp;that is the reason why we have implemented a credit evaluation process, and all HDB buyers would have to obtain a housing loan eligibility letter before they could assess the loan capacity and the type of flats that&nbsp;they can buy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 919</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the really low income, meaning those that are probably earning from $0 to $2,000, we would actually&nbsp;like to see them keeping their monthly loan repayments to about 20% of their monthly pay, so that actually a large proportion of it can be taken care of by their CPF instalments and they&nbsp;do not have to dig into their&nbsp;cash salary to make the repayments.&nbsp; And it is absolutely important that we buy within our means so that we do not over-stretch ourselves and will not get into a situation where we have problem meeting our mortgage payments.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)</B>:&nbsp; May I ask the&nbsp;Senior&nbsp;Minister of State&nbsp;whether she&nbsp;will agree that the valuation of a property should be what&nbsp;a willing buyer and a&nbsp;willing seller would agree to pay for a flat.&nbsp; Therefore, would she&nbsp;agree to review the way the valuers value the value of a property?&nbsp; Because in&nbsp;the private market, the valuers value&nbsp;a property as the purchase price of the property rather than have this anomaly of cash-over-valuation.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</B>:&nbsp; We totally agree that the valuation should reflect market valuation.&nbsp; In fact, that is the basis of valuation being done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, in&nbsp;a situation where there has been a high rate of increase in the transacted price, it takes some time for the valuation to be updated to reflect the latest transaction price.&nbsp; Actually HDB reviews that valuation every few months.&nbsp; But as I have mentioned earlier on, in a situation where there is a high rate of increase, you do have situation where buyers are prepared to pay cash-above-valuation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that reason, COV is&nbsp;not necessary in&nbsp;a positive territory.&nbsp; In fact, we have seen as recent as two years ago, COV <p align=left>Column: 920</p>being a negative territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;A majority, I would say 90%, of the transactions was done at zero COV because the valuation reflected what the market was paying at that point in time.&nbsp; So the&nbsp;situation&nbsp;in an upmarket,&nbsp;you sometimes see a positive COV.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for the same reason in a downmarket, you may expect to see negative COV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the valuation is done professionally, giving the market an indication of what the transaction price has been.&nbsp; In fact, this would be&nbsp;a very good basis for buyers and sellers to determine what the transaction has been.&nbsp; And they should&nbsp;be really careful if they were to pay above that value, because I think none of us want our precious CPF savings to be overly extended into property, and the valuation is&nbsp;something that we should take guidance on.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CHILDCARE CENTRES-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:CHILDCARE CENTRES:::925-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Speaker, Sir, MCYS is in the process of enhancing the supply, accessibility, quality and affordability of childcare centres.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 921</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to availability and accessibility, my Ministry has drawn up a plan to facilitate the setting up of 200 new childcare centres within the next five years.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will bring the number of centres from 739 centres in January 2008 to about 940 centres in five years' time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These centres will add to the number of centres in HDB estates and near transport nodes to make it even more accessible and convenient for parents.&nbsp; We are currently working closely with HDB and other relevant agencies to facilitate the setting up of these centres.&nbsp; The sites will be released progressively in phases to commercial providers and voluntary welfare organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for quality, we have been working together with the Ministry of Education to introduce higher educational and qualification requirement for pre-school teachers.&nbsp; We are raising the minimum qualification for new teachers and supervisors to five GCE 'O' level credits, including the English Language, and a Diploma in Pre-School Teaching.&nbsp; Incumbent teachers teaching K1 and K2 must obtain a Diploma in Pre-School Teaching and an 'O' level pass in English or pass in English Language proficiency test by January 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help achieve these standards, MCYS will be offering scholarships and bursaries for childcare personnel to pursue Early Childhood Diploma and Degree courses.&nbsp; We will also ensure that there are sufficient training places for existing and new teachers on both full-time and part-time basis, in order to meet the increasing demand for pre-school teachers in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that a number of centres have increased or will be increasing fees.&nbsp; Some centres need to do so in order to meet the rising costs of <p align=left>Column: 922</p>living and the higher requirements for teacher qualification.&nbsp; Nevertheless, my Ministry strongly urges operators to exercise restraint and to keep their services affordable for parents.&nbsp; The Ministry's plan to increase the number of childcare centres in the near future will bring about more competition.&nbsp; And this competition will help moderate fees at an affordable level.&nbsp; It&nbsp;will also provide more choices for parents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The revised Marriage and Parenthood (MNP) package announced this August reaffirmed the Government's commitment to keep childcare fees affordable.&nbsp; We have enhanced the childcare subsidy from $150 a month to $300 a month, with effect from 17th August 2008.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Besides what I have mentioned, the Government will also provide recurrent grants to eligible not-for-profit childcare centre operators, so that they can serve as anchor-operators and set the benchmark for quality and affordability in the sector.&nbsp;

Firstly,&nbsp;the quality of childcare centres depends a lot on the quality of the staff but,&nbsp;at the same time,&nbsp;the salary and working conditions of childcare staff are low,&nbsp;therefore making it&nbsp;difficult for&nbsp;the industry&nbsp;to attract good quality childcare staff.&nbsp; Could the MOS share with this House what measures are being considered to improve the salary and working conditions of childcare staff, so as to improve the quality of childcare centres?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as we all know, infant care fees continue to remain high despite the higher subsidy given by the Government.&nbsp; Are there any additional assistance that the Ministry is planning to introduce to assist parents with infants and encourage people to have more children?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, could the MOS also share with us whether the five years' timeline is realistic, or whether&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;considering that we want&nbsp;people to have more children&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the Ministry should consider a shorter timeline?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;on how to help the early childhood personnel&nbsp;improve their working conditions,&nbsp;as I have mentioned earlier, the Government is looking into a recurrent grant to help to make sure that operators, <p align=left>Column: 924</p>which are non-profit, pay their staff a reasonable pay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subsidy for an individual child has also increased tremendously from $150 to $300, and $400 to $600 for infant care.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would look into the working conditions of this group of people.&nbsp; We will find&nbsp;anchor operators like NTUC&nbsp;&ndash; I am sure&nbsp;Members know&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;which is one of the very successful cooperatives in early childhood education.&nbsp; So we hope that, with the support of NTUC,&nbsp;we can&nbsp;also improve the working conditions of these people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;infant care, we do agree that&nbsp;it is very expensive.&nbsp; Therefore, it&nbsp;has been increased from $400 to $600 per child per month.&nbsp; I also mentioned that for the low-income group, from this year onwards, we will increase the income level from $1,500 to $1,800.&nbsp; I think Mdm Halimah had requested for it&nbsp;at the Budget debate. We have raised this low-income level cap to $1,800, after consideration, so that we&nbsp;can cover quite a number of families.&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest subsidy, on top of the $300 for the bigger children,&nbsp;the $600 for the infant care and the additional help from CFAC,&nbsp;can go up to approximately $340 a month.&nbsp; So, some of the families only pay as low as 10% or even 5%.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try our best and look at&nbsp;how to improve the fees or how to help the early childhood personnel, especially the infant care segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard&nbsp;to the&nbsp;timing of the five-year plan, I think, with the help of the anchor operators,&nbsp;starting&nbsp;with 50 centres a year, it&nbsp;should be achievable. The more difficult part&nbsp;is not the hardware but&nbsp;the training of the teacher.&nbsp; So I agree with&nbsp;Mdm Halimah&nbsp;that improving the working conditions and attracting good people, especially the&nbsp;'O' level graduates,&nbsp;to join this service is something&nbsp; that we need to work harder on.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B>&nbsp; One supplementary question, Sir.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have <p align=left>Column: 925</p>looked at this industry and realised that there is a concern from the perspective of the practitioners&nbsp;in&nbsp;early childhood.&nbsp; The image is a concern. So&nbsp;I would like to ask if there are any plans&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;like&nbsp;what MOE does to improve the image of teachers and the professionals in the education sector&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to improve it&nbsp;to a point where the attractiveness of this industry will also become as good&nbsp;as them, and&nbsp;create the career development of pre-school sector on par&nbsp;with the normal education sector.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But&nbsp;in the private sector, some operators&nbsp;have obtained really highly qualified teachers who are&nbsp;Degree&nbsp;holders&nbsp;or even Master Degree holders.&nbsp; I urge all the operators to&nbsp;bear in mind how to run effectively and improve&nbsp;their own image.&nbsp; Based on our experience, about 70% are run by private operators, and only 30% are run by VWOs.&nbsp;And for the 60% run by private sector, a majority of them do attract Degree holders. &nbsp;So, therefore,&nbsp;the Ministry is also going to&nbsp;target&nbsp;the different groups&nbsp;and help them improve their image.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ENABLING MASTERPLAN 2007-2011-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:ENABLING MASTERPLAN 2007-2011:::928-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 926</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (for the Minister&nbsp;for Community Development, Youth and Sports):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Disability is an inter-Governmental committee chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MCYS to coordinate and monitor the key performance indicators of the Enabling Masterplan from 2007 to 2011.&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua has asked for an update on the early intervention programmes, employment, learning, healthcare and residential living for people with disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have reduced the average waiting times for the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC)from&nbsp;nine months to&nbsp;four months.&nbsp; We have increased the capacity from 1,000 to 1,400 places, and increased the number of centres from&nbsp;nine to 11 EIPIC centres.&nbsp; The Standing Committee is collaborating with MOH and NCSS to develop an assessment framework to enhance quality in therapy standards.&nbsp; MCYS and NCSS have jointly launched the EIPIC Support Grant worth $3.6 million to assist needy families. &nbsp;This grant will help to ensure that every child will have access to appropriate early intervention programmes even if his family is less well-off.&nbsp; To date, about $343,000 has been utilised. &nbsp;We will continue to ensure that EIPIC services are both affordable and accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I would like to touch on life-long learning and employment for the disabled.&nbsp; The Enabling Masterplan had envisioned the \"Value Chain\" Employment Framework where a person with disability can access job assessment, training and placement several times during his working life to ensure lifelong employability.&nbsp; My Ministry has started collaborating with the Workforce Development Agency (WDA), the Singapore National Employers Federation, NCSS and various VWOs on initiatives such as the <p align=left>Column: 927</p>Open Door Fund (ODF), which allows companies to claim up to $100,000 per project for any job redesign and workplace modifications done to cater to the needs of persons with disabilities.&nbsp; To date, 115 persons have been employed under the ODF. &nbsp;Recognising that skills-training is an important component of employment and lifelong learning, we launched the Infocomm Technology Apprenticeship Training Programme in July 2008. This programme is supported by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) and the Society for the Physically Disabled.&nbsp; This successful public-private-people partnership aims to train some 400 persons with disabilities over the next&nbsp;three years. In total, $12.7 million will be committed to this project by IDA, MCYS, Tote Board, Microsoft Singapore and NEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons with disabilities seeking medical treatment today can access Government healthcare subsidies, Medisave and Medifund. Although MediShield does not cover congenital or pre-existing illnesses, persons with disabilities can apply for coverage for medical treatment of other medical conditions.&nbsp; To further help defray medical costs, several VWOs provide free health screening or medical consultation by medical professional volunteers.&nbsp; They have also initiated medical coverage such as personal accident insurance or medical insurance for hospitalisation for clients who work in sheltered and production workshops. &nbsp;NCSS also administers a Medical Fee Exemption Card for needy residents of disability homes to obtain free medical and hospitalisation treatment at Government or restructured hospitals and polyclinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On residential care, our current assessment has shown that there is no immediate need to build new homes as there are around 720 residents living in homes for disabled adults and children, <p align=left>Column: 928</p>while the combined capacity is 950.&nbsp; Having said that, MCYS and NCSS are assessing the capacity that will be required post-2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than the&nbsp;five areas raised by Ms Denise Phua, I also wish to highlight our continued effort in improving accessibility, and in promoting sports. &nbsp;The Building Construction Authority's $40 million Accessibility Fund which aims to upgrade existing buildings has already attracted applications from hotels to Government buildings. So, what I am trying to say is that by 2011 and&nbsp;2014, the HDB blocks will have their lifts upgraded and also have all the roads accessible to disabled people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I want to assure Members that we also pay attention to sports for the disabled.&nbsp; I am sure that we are very proud of Laurentia Tan, Theresa Goh and so on,&nbsp;for their wonderful performance at the Beijing Paralympics.&nbsp; So, everyone in our society, disabled or not, we should give them&nbsp;the opportunity to develop to their fullest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.00 pm</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Bill proposes two changes to the Property Tax Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first amendment <p align=left>Column: 929</p>clarifies the tax treatment of structural networks while the second amendment provides a mechanism to allow Government to set-off the amount of outstanding tax against what is due to the taxpayer from the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now explain the first amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Clarifying the tax treatment of &ldquo;structural networks&rdquo;</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural networks, which typically refer to networks of pipelines, cables, ducts and railway lines attached to land, have hitherto been subject to property tax in Singapore.&nbsp; This is similar to the tax treatment in other jurisdictions like the UK and Hong Kong.&nbsp; However, unlike these jurisdictions, we do not have specific provisions under our Act to explicitly treat structural networks as properties subject to property tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, IRAS taxes structural networks together with the building to which they are attached.&nbsp; For example, electricity networks are assessed together with the substations, and the property tax is payable by the owner of the electricity networks and substations since the owner is deriving the benefits from these networks.&nbsp; The electricity network may extend beyond the boundaries of the land on which the substation is sited and may pass through lands which the network owner does not own.&nbsp; As for the lands through which such network passes, the owner of the land is assessed for property tax which will not take into account the network concerned since he does not derive benefits from the network which passes through his land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, following a case taken to the courts by a taxpayer with regard to its network of pipelines attached to a cooling plant, the High Court in May 2007 arrived at the position that the pipelines, a type <p align=left>Column: 930</p>of structural network, were not assessable for property tax as the pipelines were considered to be part of the cooling plant which is classified as machinery falling within the ambit of section 2(2) of the Property Tax Act.&nbsp; Section 2(2) currently exempts machinery used for certain purposes from property tax.&nbsp; In March 2008, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the taxpayer that the pipelines were not subject to tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case also raised the issue of whether the current provisions of the Act allow IRAS to hold the owners of the structural networks responsible for paying the property tax for the parts of the networks that pass through lands not owned by the network owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments in this Bill thus seek to clarify the circumstances under which structural networks are assessable for property tax, in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it has been and remains the Government&rsquo;s policy intent to subject structural networks to property tax, just like in the UK and Hong Kong.&nbsp; We recognise that pipelines or cables attached to machinery could arguably be part of machinery and, hence, be exempted from tax under section 2(2) of the Property Tax Act.&nbsp; However, it has not been and is still not the policy intent for the property tax exemption for machinery to apply to the entire structural network, including those parts that extend outside and beyond the structural network of the owner&rsquo;s building which houses the machinery to which these are attached.&nbsp; Those parts of a structural network which perform a distribution or transportation function should not be considered as mere machinery.&nbsp; They should be subject to property tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For practical reasons, we propose to use the boundaries of building which houses the machinery to which the <p align=left>Column: 931</p>pipelines and cables are attached to draw the line between the parts of the structural network that may be considered as machinery (and hence be exempted) and those that may not be considered as machinery, and hence be subject to property tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also has been and remains the policy intent to hold the network owner responsible for the property tax since he is the one who derives benefits from the network.&nbsp; Otherwise, based on the court's decision, the owners of the land through which the structural network passes would have to pay the tax, which would be inequitable as these land owners do not, in practice, receive payment or benefit for the use of their land for such networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we need is to clarify in the Act the circumstances under which structural networks are to be subject to property tax, just as jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the UK have done.&nbsp; In these countries, they have specific provisions in their Acts to treat structural networks as properties assessable to tax.&nbsp; This is notwithstanding that their Acts, like ours, also exclude machinery from property tax.&nbsp; In the UK and Hong Kong, it is also the network owners that are taxed on the structural networks, including networks that extend beyond the building which the network owner owns.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, the Act was specifically amended in 1991 for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment to the Property Tax Act therefore seeks to provide, for avoidance of doubt, the circumstances under which structural networks are assessable for property tax.&nbsp; The proposed Bill is meant to preserve our current tax treatment of structural networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Property Tax (Amendment) Bill specifies the circum<p align=left>Column: 932</p>stances under which&nbsp;these networks are assessable for property tax, as outlined above.&nbsp; To give certainty to network owners on such scope of taxation, a list of structural networks that will be taxed in accordance with that scope will be prescribed in the Subsidiary Legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 of the Bill validates past collections of the property tax on or in respect of structural networks.&nbsp; This is in line with the policy intent all along to subject such structural networks to property tax.&nbsp; The validation clause will not affect cases such as the&nbsp;one&nbsp;in which the Court of Appeal has ruled in favour of the taxpayer, cases on structural networks that are before the Valuation Review Board, as well as unresolved cases on structural networks in respect of which objections have been made to the Chief Assessor or Comptroller of Property Tax, before 20th October 2008, which is the date of the First Reading of this Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the provisions of the Act will come into force, at the latest, by 1st January 2009 to correspond with the billing cycle for property tax on 1st January every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Allowing the Government to set-off the amount of outstanding tax owed to it</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the second amendment of the Property Tax Act.&nbsp; Presently, the Act provides for the appointment of a person, who can be someone in the private sector or statutory board, as an agent to pay over to IRAS monies that he holds for taxpayers who owe taxes.&nbsp; However, Government office-holders are currently not appointed as agents, as the Government is not included as a &ldquo;person&rdquo; under the Property Tax Act.&nbsp; This exclusion is inadvertent.&nbsp; Thus, clause 3 amends the Act to allow the Government to set-off tax arrears against monies due to the taxpayer from the <p align=left>Column: 933</p>Government.&nbsp; Similar amendments of the Income Tax Act, Stamp Duties Act and GST Act will also be made to effect the set-off mechanism for the Government to recover outstanding taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2008 comprises four tax changes.&nbsp; The first amendment gives legislative effect to a tax change announced in Budget Statement 2007, while three other amendments are tax changes arising from regular reviews to improve the administration of the GST system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A public consultation on the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2008 was conducted between August and September 2008.&nbsp; This Bill has incorporated the feedback received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 934</p>\r\n<p><I>GST Budget changes</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me highlight the tax changes covered by this Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>First, zero-rating treatment for the sale, leasing and servicing of containers used in the international transport of goods</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As announced in Budget 2007, to promote Singapore as a shipping and logistics hub, the sale, leasing and servicing of containers used in the international transport of goods is now allowed zero-rating.&nbsp; This is similar to the existing treatment for ships and aircraft.&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill reflects this change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Second, zero-rating treatment for prescribed machinery used in the manufacture of goods for export and related services</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, the GST Act was legislated to cater for the zero-rating of prescribed tools and relevant services used in the manufacture of goods for export.&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill extends the zero-rating treatment to supplies of prescribed machinery, which are akin to specialised tools, and relevant services used in the manufacture of goods for export.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Third, statutory power to appoint agent to recover GST arrears from non-taxable persons</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Comptroller has statutory power under the GST Act to appoint agents to recover GST arrears, but only for arrears owed by taxable persons (ie, persons who are registered for GST or are liable to register for GST).&nbsp; Hence, the Comptroller is unable to recover GST arrears owed by non-taxable persons under the GST Act, such as directors who commit GST fraud offences through their GST-registered companies.&nbsp; Clause 4 of the Bill provides the Comptroller with the statutory power to appoint agents to recover GST arrears from both taxable and non-taxable persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 935</p>\r\n<p><I>Fourth, allowing the Government to set-off the amount of outstanding tax owed to it</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GST Act will also be amended to allow the Government to set-off tax arrears against monies due to the taxpayer from the Government.&nbsp; As I have&nbsp;just explained this change in my earlier speech for the Property Tax (Amendment) Bill, I will not go into the details again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A public consultation on the Stamp Duties (Amendment) Bill 2008 was conducted between August and September 2008.&nbsp; The draft Bill has been revised to incorporate the public feedback received accordingly.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 936</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now explain the main amendments&nbsp;to the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>First, extension of stamp duty relief to more corporate structures</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, only transfer of assets between associated companies and registered business trusts qualifies for section 15 stamp duty relief.&nbsp; As the global business environment evolves, new business vehicles have also been introduced, such as Limited Liability Partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 15 to allow other types of business vehicles to also qualify for relief, as long as the transferor and transferee entities are associated.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

will now qualify for stamp duty relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Second, removal of mandatory adjudication for gifting of shares and property</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, IRAS currently requires taxpayers to submit a request for mandatory adjudication for transfer of shares and immovable property by way of gift, where the consideration paid for the transfer is nil or significantly below market value. The adjudication process serves as a safeguard against the revenue risk for such gift cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRAS has reviewed the process and concluded that the current requirement for mandatory adjudication for gift cases is no longer necessary.&nbsp;Firstly, most of the gift cases involved HDB flats where IRAS can easily ascertain their values through HDB's Valuation Table.&nbsp; Secondly, most property transfers have third party valuation reports which safeguard against the under-declaration of property values. Lastly, the value of the shares transacted <p align=left>Column: 937</p>can be computed based on the audited accounts (for unlisted shares) or traded prices (for listed shares) without the need to conduct another valuation in most cases.&nbsp;With the removal of mandatory adjudication, taxpayers can enjoy a faster transfer process and save on the adjudication and valuation fees.&nbsp; To safeguard stamp duty revenue, IRAS&nbsp;will continue to rely on the controls currently in place under the Stamp Duties Act and periodic audit of gift cases to detect stamp duty abuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp;clause 4 will make it no longer compulsory for taxpayers&nbsp;to go through mandatory adjudication for transfer of shares and immovable property by way of&nbsp;gift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Third, allowing the Government to set-off the amount of outstanding tax owed&nbsp;to it</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Stamp Duties Act will also be amended to allow the Government to set-off tax arrears against monies due&nbsp;to the taxpayers from the Government.&nbsp; As I have already explained this change, I will not go into the details again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mrs Lim Hwee Hua].</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL:::944-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 937</p><B>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.19 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I <p align=left>Column: 938</p>beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2008 comprises three groups of legislative changes. The first group provides for the income tax changes announced in the 2008 Budget Statement. The second group gives legislative effect to the tax changes under the recently enhanced Marriage&nbsp;and Parenthood (M&amp;P) Package. The third group covers other amendments to the Income Tax Act arising from regular reviews to improve our income tax system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill was released for public consultation from 27th June to 28th July this year. The Bill has been revised to incorporate public feedback accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I&nbsp;will now touch on tax policy changes announced in the 2008 Budget Statement, which the Bill provides for. Six key tax changes are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, personal income tax rebate of 20% for the Year of Assessment 2008, up to a cap of $2,000. This is provided by clause 56 of the Bill;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, tax changes to encourage companies, including the smaller ones, to carry out research&nbsp;and development in Singapore. Clauses 2, 20, 21, 22, 26 to 29, 32 to 34, and 53 of the Bill provide for this change;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, a new deduction for qualifying renovation or refurbishment expenditure. The deduction is aimed at helping businesses upgrade their business premises, especially small companies in the retail and service sector. Clauses 24, 25 and 32 of the Bill provide for this change;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 939</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, liberalisation of the start-up tax exemption scheme to encourage entrepreneurship, as effected through clause 39;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, various incentives for the financial and maritime sectors. These are covered in various clauses of the Bill such as clause 18 for family-owned investment holding companies and clause 42 for container leasing entities; and&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, enhancement of tax reliefs for the CPF and SRS contributions to encourage voluntary savings for retirement and healthcare. These changes are covered by clauses 5, 25 and 35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now move on to the legislative changes to effect the three tax changes under the Marriage&nbsp;and Parenthood Package&nbsp;(M&amp;P Package) announced in August this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first tax change is the enhancement of the Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) and the Handicapped Child Relief&nbsp;(HCR). With effect from the Year of Assessment (YA) 2009, the quantum for QCR will be increased from $2,000 to $4,000, and for HCR, from $3,500 to $5,500. QCR will also be extended to all qualifying children, beyond the fourth child. Clauses 35(a) and 54(a) of the Bill provide for these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second tax change is the enhancement of the Working Mother&rsquo;s Child Relief (WMCR). This relief, which is computed as a certain percentage of the qualifying mother&rsquo;s earned income, will be enhanced and is now extended to all her qualifying Singaporean children, including the fifth child and beyond.&nbsp; Working mothers can claim this relief up to 100% of their earned income for all qualifying Singaporean children. The cap for the total amount of Qualifying Child Relief or Handicapped Child Relief and the Working <p align=left>Column: 940</p>Mother's Child Relief claimable in respect of the same child by all qualifying individuals has been doubled to $50,000. Clause 54 of the Bill provides for these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third tax change is the enhancement of the Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR). The rebate of $5,000 will now be extended to the first child and $20,000 to each child beyond the fourth child. Clause 38 of the Bill provides for this change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now deal with the third group of tax changes which require amendments to the&nbsp;Act arising from our ongoing regular review of our existing tax policies and administration. Let me highlight two of these changes as the rest are either technical or relate to improvements to our tax administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, exempting selected groups of taxpayers from income tax filing under the No-Filing Service of IRAS. The No-Filing Service is an initiative where taxpayers, who are selected by IRAS based on pre-determined criteria, will receive their notices of assessment, without having to submit any income tax return.&nbsp; The selected taxpayers will not be required to file a tax return if, firstly, there are no additional sources of income (other than employment income received from employers under the auto-inclusion scheme) during the year; and secondly, the tax reliefs which they intend to claim are the same as those claimed in the previous year.&nbsp; However, they will be required to declare to IRAS if there is any inaccuracy of the information in the notice of assessment issued to them or if there has been any change in their circumstances, such as a change in their claims of tax reliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The No-Filing Service will result in benefits for approximately 300,000 taxpayers&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Government. As these selected taxpayers need not file <p align=left>Column: 941</p>their returns, others who have to do so will enjoy a faster and smoother tax filing process.&nbsp; For the Government, it will alleviate the filing load during the peak period and reduce tax administration costs such as the issuance of PIN mailers and paper returns.&nbsp; Clauses 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 and 52 effect the No-Filing Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, extending tax incentives to General Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs).&nbsp; Typically, tax incentives have been awarded to companies. However, as a general principle, we should not discriminate among the different business forms when awarding tax incentives. As business forms other than companies are becoming more prevalent and businesses often seek to structure themselves as partnerships for legitimate commercial reasons, we have decided to extend tax incentives to General Partnerships and LLPs. Nonetheless, we need to proceed carefully on opening up tax incentives to general partnerships and LLPs, because income of partnerships are taxed in the hands of the partners who can be corporate or individuals, and individuals are taxed under personal income tax schedule. Nonetheless, for a start, specific tax incentives such as writing down allowance for acquisition of intellectual property rights, aircraft leasing and further deductions for R&amp;D expenditure will be extended to General Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships, subject to conditions.&nbsp; Clause 30 effects this change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for the remaining nine legislative changes arising from our periodic review of the income tax system, I will not put Members through details of these changes. They are either technical in nature or relate to improvements in&nbsp;administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the above changes, the Income Tax Act will be enhanced and updated to better achieve our economic and social objectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 942</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.27 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the new definition of 'research and development' in section 2 of the Income Tax Act is restricted to science or technology&nbsp;&ndash; why are social sciences and humanities not included? For instance, research on consumer behaviour or even on human capital planning, which&nbsp;could be very useful in developing Singapore's economy as well,&nbsp;would not come under the definition of 'research and development' as proposed in the Bill. If the hesitance to include social sciences or humanities is due to the difficulty of ensuring that the research is legitimate, may I request&nbsp;that potential researchers seeking tax exemption&nbsp;be then&nbsp;required to seek prior authorisation from the Minister or from IRAS before embarking on the research. Sir, perhaps&nbsp;a set of guidelines can also be set out in the subsidiary legislation to establish the parameters to guide decisions on whether a particular piece of research can be tax-exempted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the new section 14Q allows for tax deduction on renovation or refurbishment works for the purposes of the person's trade, profession or business. Such tax-deductible expenditure is capped at $150,000 over&nbsp;three consecutive basis periods. Sir, indeed this will be very helpful for both new businesses and those seeking to upgrade their current premises, and I commend the new inclusion in light of the current recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the changes to the Fifth Schedule on the Working Mother's Child Relief allows a mother to claim more tax deduction for her children, up to 100% of <p align=left>Column: 943</p>her earned income. On behalf of all women in Singapore, I commend this amendment as this will indeed go a long way to giving families more financial support, while also operating as a long-term incentive and encouragement to have bigger families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I would like to respond to her points about the R&amp;D.&nbsp; If I may recap, in terms of explaining the policy intent under the revised definition of R&amp;D, previously R&amp;D referred to systematic or intensive study and this has created ambiguity for taxpayers.&nbsp; Therefore, we have this definition to cover systematic, investigative and experimental study.&nbsp; The change is not to make the definition more restrictive but, by its very nature, R&amp;D is indeed systematic, investigative and experimental.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards her point as to why we are limiting it only to the field of science and technology and not to include social sciences and humanities, let me explain that this is really in line with the importance of science and technology that we are currently attaching to our economic strategy.&nbsp; It is not unique to us.&nbsp; Major jurisdictions such as the UK and Ireland also focus their R&amp;D incentives on science and technology.&nbsp; But if I may finally recap,&nbsp;if there is research in social sciences and humanities which are undertaken to support a qualifying R&amp;D project, then we will certainly allow the expenses incurred for this supporting research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if I may make an important point as regards the spirit of handing out <p align=left>Column: 944</p>this R&amp;D tax incentive.&nbsp; It is really not the taxpayer's ability to claim the R&amp;D concession only when his R&amp;D succeeds.&nbsp; Rather, it is our policy intent that the tax concessions will help to encourage projects that are intended to have novel outcomes or to involve attempts to resolve some scientific or technological uncertainty, and that is really built into the definition of the qualifying R&amp;D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They are also useful in \"labour-capital\" partnerships, where one or more financial backers prefer to contribute money or resources while the other partner performs the actual work. The introduction of LPs will enable Singapore to better meet the diverse business needs and offer entrepreneurs and investors an additional form of business structure to choose from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Guiding principle</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In coming up with the Singapore LP structure, we took reference from the US Delaware model, the Jersey model as well as the UK model, and were mindful of the need to be both pro-business and to safeguard the interests of potential creditors and partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>General features of an LP</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to elaborate on the general features of an LP. Clause 3 of the LP Bill requires that every LP shall have at least one general partner and one limited partner at the point of registration.&nbsp; The LP and its partners must be registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.&nbsp; The general partners of an LP are, in all major aspects, in the same legal position as partners in a conventional partnership.&nbsp; They have management control and have joint and several liability for the debts of the LP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited partners' liability is limited to the extent of their investment in the LP.&nbsp; They cannot participate in management; otherwise, they would lose their limited liability protection. The First Schedule of the LP Bill sets out a list of&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 946</p>\"safe harbour activities\" which are activities that a limited partner can undertake that will not be considered nor construed as \"participation in management\". The Minister for Finance is empowered, under clause 43 of the Bill, to amend the list through subsidiary legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Flexibilities and safeguards in the LP Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited partners are not required to disclose the capital contributions made at the point of registration, and they are also allowed to withdraw their capital contributions under clause 7 of the Bill. This is because creditors would generally look towards the general partners of the LP to fulfil all the debts, liabilities and obligations of the LP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise abuse and protect the LP's other stakeholders, clause 16 of the Bill requires the name of an LP to contain the words \"limited partnership\", or the acronym \"LP\", so that the status is clear to those who transacts with it. While an LP is not required to file its accounts or have them audited, clause 27 of the Bill requires it to keep proper accounting records that will enable true and fair financial statements to be prepared and audited if deemed necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, while limited partners are allowed to withdraw their capital contribution, this is subject to a claw back of the distribution received from the LP if the general partners are bankrupt at the point of distribution, or will become so as a result of the distribution and the limited partners have knowledge of this.&nbsp; The claw back requirement under clause 7 of the Bill will only affect the distributions paid out one year prior to the bankruptcy of the general partner(s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Other provisions in the Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for consequential and related amendments to <p align=left>Column: 947</p>the Income Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act. Given that an LP is not a separate legal entity, the tax treatment of the LP for income tax and GST purposes would follow the tax treatment of general partnerships.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the creation of the LP business vehicle will increase the options available to businessmen and investors, and is consistent with our overall policy to make Singapore a conducive place for business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Employment Act (EA) is the primary legislation that sets out the <p align=left>Column: 948</p>minimum employment terms and conditions in Singapore.&nbsp; It serves a dual role.&nbsp; First, it safeguards basic employment standards, particularly for workers who are more vulnerable and need to be protected by law.&nbsp; Second, the Act regulates employment relations by establishing the basic duties of employers and workers, and providing mechanisms to settle employment disputes. &nbsp;The Act seeks to strike a balance between worker protection and labour market flexibility.&nbsp; While according workers with basic employment protection and benefits, it gives employers sufficient flexibility to manage their manpower resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been significant changes in our labour market since the Act was last amended in 1995.&nbsp; The services sector now employs more than two-thirds of the workforce in 2007, up from 61.5% of the workforce in 1997. &nbsp;Our workforce profile has also changed.&nbsp; Notably, Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) now form nearly half the resident workforce, up from 40% a decade ago.&nbsp; Outsourcing is also becoming more prevalent and with it, employment tenures have shortened.&nbsp; The number of contract workers has increased, accounting for 12% of the resident workforce currently.&nbsp; Wages have also gone up significantly since 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of these changes, it is timely to update the EA to ensure that it remains relevant and responsive to the changing labour market conditions.&nbsp; Employment protection and benefits for certain groups of vulnerable workers need to be enhanced.&nbsp; Employment standards also need to be revised to better reflect employment norms while maintaining labour market flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has worked closely with the unions and employers in the review of the EA to ensure that the amended Act balances the interests of both employees and employers.&nbsp; The amendments that I <p align=left>Column: 949</p>will be presenting today are the outcome of extensive discussions among the tripartite partners. &nbsp;As part of the consultation process, feedback from the public was also sought on the proposed changes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill, which is proposed to take effect on 1st&nbsp;January 2009, covers changes to the EA in three key areas.&nbsp; First, the coverage will be revised to keep pace with changes in the workforce profile.&nbsp; Second, we have updated the employment standards and benefits.&nbsp; Third, we will enhance penalties and enforcement powers, and rationalise administrative processes and outdated provisions. Let me now elaborate on the amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Revising coverage</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n<I>Confidential staff: No longer excluded from the Act</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will revise the coverage of the Act. &nbsp;Currently, the Employment Act covers all employees, except seamen, domestic workers, confidential staff, and employees in managerial and executive positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential staff were previously excluded to avoid conflict of interest as some of them may be dealing with sensitive personnel matters.&nbsp; Today, most confidential staff, such as secretaries and HR clerks, hold rank-and-file positions and are seldom directly involved in sensitive matters.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no reason to continue excluding them from coverage under the EA.&nbsp; Accordingly, clause 2(c) amends the definition of \"employees\" to extend the EA's coverage to the 153,000 confidential staff in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Managers and executives: Access to Labour Court for salary claims</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managers and executives are also currently not covered as they are <p align=left>Column: 950</p>generally in a better bargaining position.&nbsp; However, based on the Ministry's experience, the most common type of assistance managers and executives require is the recovery of salary claims, especially those who are more junior and paid less. They often find it costly to take up civil suits to recover salary arrears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will allow junior managers and executives earning $2,500 and below in basic monthly salary, to have access to the Labour Court for salary claims. &nbsp;With the increasing proportion of PMETs, a significant number of employees will benefit from the access to this lower-cost dispute resolution mechanism.&nbsp; Such a mechanism will also be helpful to employers by providing them with an efficient and expeditious avenue for resolving salary disputes with their PMET employees.&nbsp; This will benefit 44,000 PMETs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Non-workmen: Increase Part IV salary threshold to $2,000 per month</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV of the Employment Act provides additional employment protection and benefits for the more vulnerable employees who are engaged in manual labour or are paid lower wages, such as machine operators and cleaners.&nbsp; Currently, Part IV applies only to non-workmen earning a basic monthly salary of $1,600 and below, and all workmen regardless of salary.&nbsp; In line with the significant wage increase since the last revision of the EA in 1995, clause 11 will update the basic monthly salary threshold for non-workmen from $1,600 to $2,000, benefiting some 82,000 employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Workmen: Introduce Part IV salary threshold of $4,500 per month</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, highly paid and skilled workmen are able to negotiate for favourable employment terms without having to be protected under Part IV.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 951</p>Accordingly, after extensive consultation with the tripartite partners, we will introduce a basic monthly salary threshold of $4,500 for workmen under Part IV.&nbsp; Workmen with lower income will not be affected, and will continue to be protected under Part IV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This change will affect a relatively small proportion of workmen, making up about 0.6% of all workmen, the majority of whom are employed in&nbsp;fewer than 10 companies in the petroleum, petrochemical and aerospace industries.&nbsp; The exclusion will provide these highly skilled workmen and their employers the flexibility to offer employment packages&nbsp;that better suit their needs. &nbsp;MOM and the unions will work with employers to ensure that the affected workmen continue to be fairly treated and properly compensated when they work overtime, and on rest days.&nbsp; In this regard, my Ministry, through the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), has discussed with employers on how the concerns of affected workmen can be addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Reviewing employment standards and benefits</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I><br>\r\n</I><I>Extend paid public holidays and paid sick leave to all employees<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, this Bill will enhance employment standards and benefits, and keep pace with employment practices.&nbsp; Paid public holidays and sick leave are well-established industry norms provided by nearly all employers.&nbsp; However, the Act currently only prescribes these benefits for those employees covered under Part IV.&nbsp; Clause 28 will extend these benefits to all employees covered under the Act.&nbsp; This amendment will maintain the flexibility of employers requesting employees to work on public holidays for an extra day's wage, or substitute a public holiday with another working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 952</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Shorten the paid sick leave qualifying period</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, in line with the trend of shorter employment tenures, we have reduced the qualifying period for paid sick leave.&nbsp; Under clause 28, a new employee will be entitled to paid sick leave after&nbsp;three months of service, compared to&nbsp;six months previously.&nbsp; This is aligned with the qualifying periods for paid annual leave.&nbsp; To alleviate the cost burden on employers, sick leave entitlements for new employees will be phased-in from the start of their fourth month of service, until the completion of their sixth month of service.&nbsp; Other changes include the recognition of medical certificates from public medical institutions for paid sick leave, and provisions to enable the Minister or the Commissioner for Labour to deem an employer as having fulfilled his statutory obligation to bear medical examination fees, if he has complied with certain requirements such as the provision of specified healthcare plans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><I>Re-define part-time employment</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers have also cited the short statutory part-time working hours as a barrier to offering part-time employment.&nbsp; Although the share of part-time employment has increased from 3.4% in 1997 to 6.2% in 2007, we still lag behind many developed countries such as the Netherlands and the UK where part-time employment constitutes 36% and 23% of the total employment respectively.&nbsp; To further encourage employers to offer more part-time employment opportunities, clause 23 redefines part-time employees as those who work less than 35 hours a week, up from less than 30 hours a week.&nbsp; This takes into account public feedback that full-time employees working&nbsp;five seven-hour days should not be reclassified as part-time employees and have their employment benefits reduced.&nbsp; The amendment will benefit employees who <p align=left>Column: 953</p>require flexible working arrangements to attend to family or personal commitments and potential entrants to the workforce seeking part-time employment.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reviewing penalties and streamlining administrative processes</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Enhancing enforcement powers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have enhanced the enforcement powers and penalties under the Act to facilitate efforts to ensure compliance with the basic employment standards.&nbsp; Clause 32 provides the Commissioner and Employment Inspectors with additional powers to search and examine premises for evidence, obtain photographic and videographic evidence, and summon witnesses to furnish information, articles or documents.&nbsp; These are similar to existing enforcement powers provided under other legislations, such as the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) and the Workplace Safety and Health Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enhancing penalties</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalties, which were last revised in 1984, will be increased to be aligned with those for commensurate offences in other legislations, such as the EFMA.&nbsp; The maximum financial penalties will be increased from $1,000 to $5,000 for first-time offences, and from $2,000 to $10,000 for subsequent offences.&nbsp; The maximum composition amount will similarly be increased from $200 to $1,000 under clause 41.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, this Bill makes other technical and administrative amendments to the Act.&nbsp; The Employment Act currently allows employees to seek redress for unfair dismissal.&nbsp; To remove ambiguities on interpretation, the term \"dismiss\" is defined under clause 2(b) as a termination of employment by an employer, with or without notice, and whether on the <p align=left>Column: 954</p>grounds of misconduct or otherwise.&nbsp; This clarification on the application of the Act is important because an overly narrow interpretation of the term &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; defeats the redress mechanism for unfair dismissal.&nbsp; The employer&rsquo;s responsibility, which is that any dismissal should not be done unfairly, remains unchanged.&nbsp; MOM will continue to be stringent in assessing appeals against unfair dismissals to discourage any abuse of this avenue of redress.&nbsp; Where employers dismiss employees without notice on grounds of misconduct, they will be required to show cause for the dismissal and that due inquiry has been carried out.&nbsp; In cases where notice is given and the contractual terms of termination are complied with, the onus would be on the employees to substantiate their claims.&nbsp; They may do so, for instance, by showing that their dismissal arose from the employer&rsquo;s intent to deprive them of employment benefits they would otherwise have been entitled to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also rationalised and removed some outdated provisions.&nbsp; Clause 28 repeals Part X (Employment Exchange) and Part XI (Health, Accommodation and Medical Care), while clause 43 repeals section 123 because these provisions are no longer required.&nbsp; Similarly, clause 26 removes the outdated restriction on collective agreements in offering maternity benefits that are more favourable than those stipulated in the EA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the amendments will ensure that the Employment Act continues to be relevant and meets the changing needs of employers, workers and our labour market.&nbsp; Understandably, some employers might be concerned about the impact on business costs, particularly given the economic slowdown.&nbsp; It is worth highlighting that the amendments will benefit mainly the lower wage and vulnerable workers, who <p align=left>Column: 955</p>would feel the bite of the economic downturn more keenly.&nbsp; Moreover, many of the changes, such as the extension of public holidays and sick leave benefits to all employees, are already industry norms and should not significantly increase business costs.&nbsp; It is imperative that we set the fundamentals right in our employment framework so that our labour force will remain responsive and productive, so that we will be well-positioned&nbsp;when the economy recovers.&nbsp; SNEF and SBF were closely consulted, and we have taken into account employers&rsquo; concerns and feedback in the development of the proposals.&nbsp; The overall package of amendments balances the protection of workers with&nbsp;the need&nbsp;to maintain the flexibility of our labour market and the competitiveness of our labour force.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the enhanced employment conditions would better motivate employees, which would translate to higher productivity and greater competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I would like to thank all who have contributed to the review of the Employment Act, in particular the National Trades Union Congress, the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and the Singapore Business Federation (SBF).&nbsp; The tripartite consensus on the amendments is a testament to our strong tripartite partnership, which has brought about industrial harmony and a favourable investment climate for economic growth and job creation.&nbsp; This has benefited businesses, our workers and the economy significantly over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 956</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments to the Employment Act are long overdue.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments will provide better protection to workers in several respects.&nbsp; The scope of coverage is now wider as it covers more workmen because of&nbsp;the increase in the salary ceiling, and for the first time,&nbsp;it covers&nbsp;non-workmen.&nbsp; And&nbsp;for the first time,&nbsp;confidential staff will also be covered.&nbsp; The exclusion of confidential staff, many of whom do not earn very high pay, is no longer practical or fair as they also need the same protection as other workers.&nbsp; I am also very happy to note that junior managers and executives now have access to the Labour Court in order to enforce their salary claims.&nbsp; Hitherto, these employees have had to pursue their claims in civil court which is beyond their means and thus constituted a major obstacle for them to enforce their rights.&nbsp; Giving them access to the Labour Court is therefore equitable and fair.&nbsp; The amendments also enhance the&nbsp;sick leave provision and remove&nbsp;the&nbsp;restriction&nbsp;in collective agreements&nbsp;providing better maternity benefits&nbsp;in line with current needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this improved protection for workers has not been at the expense of business flexibility.&nbsp; The amendments will benefit employers too as better and clearer standards also mean workers&nbsp;are motivated, open to change and more productive because their interests are better taken care of.&nbsp; There are also specific areas of greater flexibility which are relevant for employers such as&nbsp;the redefinition of part-time work and a salary ceiling for workmen.&nbsp; So I hope that employers will look at these amendments in&nbsp;their entirety, as I am aware that there are some concerns among employers on the timing of these amendments considering that we are in the midst of an economic downturn.&nbsp; I urge employers to give their full support to these amendments as it will not be fair to workers to have to wait until the downturn is over and we start <p align=left>Column: 957</p>experiencing strong growth again, which may be at least a few years down the road.&nbsp; These amendments were the result of tripartite consultations and have taken into account the different needs of the economy, employers and workers, and they in fact provide very basic employment standards which every decent employer should subscribe to regardless of the economic situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now, Sir, make some specific comments and observations on the amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, a salary ceiling has been imposed on workmen earning $4,500 per month.&nbsp; About 5,000 workmen will be affected by this change.&nbsp; This means that workmen earning this pay will no longer be automatically&nbsp;entitled&nbsp;to overtime,&nbsp;rest day and public holiday pay unless these are stipulated under their contracts of service or collective agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NTUC has had extensive consultations with our unions that are likely to be most affected by this change.&nbsp; Our affected unions understand the rationale and appreciate that the amendments also provide for the increase in the salary threshold of non-workmen to $2,000 which will benefit a significantly larger number of workers.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they have also voiced some concerns which I wish to highlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workmen who currently earn more than&nbsp;$4,500&nbsp;are concerned that&nbsp;some employers&nbsp;may take advantage of the change in law and start cutting back on their overtime, rest day and public holiday pay.&nbsp; Although all the workers from our affected sectors are currently covered under collective agreements which provide for such payments, nevertheless, they are concerned that after the collective agreements expire, employers will cite the new law as the basis to <p align=left>Column: 958</p>refuse further payments under a new collective agreement.&nbsp; As this is a valid concern,&nbsp;I would like to request that MOM&nbsp;monitors the situation to ensure that employers who are in a position to pay and have no valid reasons whatsoever to cut back on these payments will not take advantage of the new law to deprive these workmen of benefits that they are currently already enjoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a move&nbsp;will create&nbsp;serious morale problems among the affected workmen most of whom are paid high wages because they are highly skilled workers and truly deserve those salaries.&nbsp; Although their number is small, nevertheless, their interest, too, deserves full attention and support, and I urge the Minister to address this concern adequately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also strongly welcome the increase in the salary threshold for non-workmen from $1,600 to $2,000 which will extend the protection of the Act&nbsp;to an additional 82,000 employees.&nbsp; This increase is necessary and timely as&nbsp;the Act's coverage has diminished because&nbsp;of the increase in salary levels.&nbsp; The Act now covers only 45% of the workforce, a situation which will deteriorate further if there is no increase and which will undermine the relevance of the Act.&nbsp; Some felt that the increase from $1,600 to $2,000 is rather modest and&nbsp;would have preferred it to be pegged to the median wage of $2,300.&nbsp; But we have taken into account employers' concerns over costs and have agreed to a limit which they are also comfortable with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our concern is that review of the salary ceiling takes such a long time.&nbsp; The last review was done in 1995, about&nbsp;13 years ago.&nbsp; We hope that the next review of the salary ceiling for both workmen and non-workmen will not take another&nbsp;13 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We urge the Minister to review the salary ceiling&nbsp;&ndash; both for workmen and non-workmen&nbsp;&ndash; regularly, at least, once every three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 959</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the redefinition of part-time work, Sir, the&nbsp;amendment has&nbsp;redefined part-time work to cover those who work less than 35 hours a week, up from those working less than 30 hours a week (the old definition).&nbsp; This redefinition is useful as it will help to promote employment of Back2Work women and also the re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; Employers will now have greater flexibility in organising work and working hours in a manner that suit their needs.&nbsp; However, one concern that has surfaced is whether some employers will take advantage of the situation and start converting&nbsp;full-time workers to part-time workers as there are some full-time workers who work less than 35 hours a week.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what safeguards will be put in place to ensure that there is no abuse of this new definition by companies, especially in those sectors where part-time work is more prevalent or where full-time workers now work less than 35 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On medical benefits, Sir, under section 89 of the Act, an employer is obliged to pay for the medical examination of his employees.&nbsp; However, the amendments allow an employer to be deemed to have fulfilled his obligation to bear the medical examination fees of his employees if the Commissioner for Labour so directs, upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions including the provision of a healthcare scheme for his employees.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to clarify under what circumstances this deeming provision will apply where an employer is considered to have complied with his legal obligation to pay for the medical examination fees of his employees.&nbsp; What kind of healthcare schemes will be considered as fulfilling this requirement?&nbsp; This clarity is important and, in my view, only healthcare schemes that are beneficial to the workers and more <p align=left>Column: 960</p>superior compared to the basic provided under the Act should qualify.&nbsp; One example of such a healthcare scheme would be the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme (PMBS)&nbsp;where the benefits are&nbsp;superior to the minimum standards of the law.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to make clear the conditions where the Commissioner will allow companies to deviate from section 89,&nbsp;and to formulate guidelines to cover this aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the new definition of what constitutes a dismissal which now covers a termination of service with or without notice whether for misconduct or otherwise.&nbsp; This is an improvement as it will provide workers with better protection against unfair dismissal as it is linked to section 14(2) of the Employment Act which provides an avenue for workers to appeal against unfair dismissals.&nbsp; In the past, we have had cases where employers argue that since they terminate the service of a worker with notice or salary in lieu, the Minister has no power to investigate into such a termination because it is with notice and it is not termed a dismissal.&nbsp; This amendment removes an ambiguity that has long existed in our law causing frustrating delays for workers seeking redress for unfair dismissals under section 14(2) of the Act, and I support it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the enhanced penalties which have not been revised for a long time and which, if left unchanged, will have little deterrent effect on errant employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to take this opportunity to urge the Ministry to exercise greater vigilance and ensure that companies comply with the minimum standards stipulated under the Act for all the employees.&nbsp; Our experience shows that there are still a number of employers who violate the Act, and the most vulnerable are the low-skilled, low-pay <p align=left>Column: 961</p>contract workers.&nbsp; There are employers who continue&nbsp;to deny them of their basic rights under the Act like sick leave and annual leave, not to mention CPF payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are victims of cheap&nbsp;sourcing, and employers make use of them as cheap labour to tender cheaply for contracts.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to exercise greater vigilance and eradicate such unscrupulous practices because we can have the best law in the world, but if the enforcement is not effective, particularly for the most vulnerable like the contract workers,&nbsp;we will have a problem.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In many countries, amendments to labour laws are agonising affairs, often resulting in industrial action or greater polarisation between the government, business and labour.&nbsp; It shows that we have a mature industrial relations system and responsible employers and trade unions that are able to look beyond their narrow interest to discuss issues objectively and reach agreement for everyone's benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.31 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, for some years, the Workers' Party&nbsp;had highlighted that the definition of \"employee\" in the Employment Act was too restrictive.&nbsp; The current definition before this amendment excluded from the Act those who were holding jobs in confidential, executive or managerial positions, even if their salaries were&nbsp;not high and they needed protection under the Act.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 962</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore welcome the broadening of the definition of&nbsp;employee to include those in confidential positions.&nbsp; We note that the&nbsp;Bill also includes those in executive or management role with a salary of up to&nbsp;$2,500 for the&nbsp;purpose of Part&nbsp;III on payment of salary.&nbsp; This will allow such employees to claim salary arrears or seek recourse for&nbsp;unfair dismissal through the Ministry of Manpower rather than to sue in court which is costly and most of them cannot afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify the scope of clause 13 on working hours for shift workers.&nbsp; Clause 13 proposes to insert a&nbsp;new&nbsp;subsection&nbsp;40(2A) to provide that an&nbsp;employee may be required to work longer than 44 hours per week, average of&nbsp;three consecutive weeks, to work on rest days and even to work more than 12 hours a day.&nbsp; The situation&nbsp;where&nbsp;this may be allowed will include work essential to the life of the community,&nbsp;defence or security.&nbsp; Sir, I can understand the need for this if a sudden crisis takes place, like where there are&nbsp;mass casualties.&nbsp; Working such prolonged hours on&nbsp;a one-off basis is understandable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the&nbsp;section is wide enough to capture a situation of non-emergency where security manpower is deployed for, say, 15 hours on a daily basis.&nbsp; Is this section needed due to manpower shortage?&nbsp; From a human factor's point of view, is this good for public security?&nbsp; Since employees are now allowed under the new amendment to continuously work for such long hours without adequate rest, in moving this amendment, did the Minister consider the long-term effect on the health of such employees?&nbsp; I also wonder&nbsp;whether this amendment contradicts the concept of work-life balance which the Government has been promoting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;</B></p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 963</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.34 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last amendment to the Employment Act which adjusted the salary ceiling for employees was in 1995.&nbsp; So for the last 13 years, the profile of our workforce has changed rapidly with the move towards a knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; The rapidly reducing coverage means that more and more employees, especially the Singaporean workers, are not covered by the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore welcome the initiative by the Government to increase the salary ceiling to $2,000, to enable a wider coverage of the Singaporean workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been extensive consultation and discussion with our union leaders on the changes.&nbsp; Most have been supportive.&nbsp; However, we do have some concerns which we would like to seek clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the proposed changes to section 35 will hence only apply to workmen whose salary does not exceed $4,500.&nbsp; Before the changes, all workmen, regardless of salary, are protected under Part IV of the Act.&nbsp; Imposing such a cap will affect perhaps less than 1%&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the Minister mentioned 0.6%&nbsp;of workmen today&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or some few thousand workers essentially coming from the petroleum, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and aerospace industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a lot of resistance from these workers when we first raised the subject with them.&nbsp; But they have eventually come to understand the rationale and the total approach that the Ministry is actually looking at the amendments.&nbsp; But, importantly, we would like to ensure that there must be fair play and fair rewards in the transition.&nbsp; What we do not want to see is the employers <p align=left>Column: 964</p>citing the law and deny them of this compensation when they actually performed overtime beyond the contractual working hours.&nbsp; So we would like the Ministry to give us an assurance that those workmen who are currently earning more than $4,500 and are expected to carry out overtime, be it on rest days or public holidays, that they must be fairly compensated for their work done.&nbsp; Some companies that we spoke to, which are already aware of these changes, do not want to make any indication to the employees as yet.&nbsp; They would like to adopt the wait-and-see attitude, and I think a lot of them are actually looking at signals coming from the Ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also ask if the cap of $4,500 will be reviewed over time, if the general salary of the workmen rises?&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also urge the Ministry to have regular reviews on the salary ceilings and all the employment terms and benefits, probably once in&nbsp;three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, on the protection of junior executives in the Employment Act.&nbsp; We have always assumed that executives and managers need not be covered under the Act as they are able to negotiate on their own terms of employment and seek redress through their own lawyers if they have claims against the employers.&nbsp; However, with the increasing proportion of new entrants joining as junior executives, we have seen many cases where they encounter difficulties, especially so during the last Asian Financial Crisis and also&nbsp;during good times when they&nbsp;are unable to make statutory claims from their employers.&nbsp; Hence, we will support the proposal to enable a manager or an executive earning less than $2,500 to have access to the&nbsp;Labour Court or claim for the unpaid salary.&nbsp;But we would also&nbsp;like to state that the salary proxy used here in this regard should not be regarded as the standard or the criterion in allowing junior managers or <p align=left>Column: 965</p>executives&nbsp;to join the rank and file unions, with limited representation, under the Industrial Relations Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Industrial Relations Act, executives and junior managers are eligible to join the rank and file unions, with limited representation, in areas such as unfair dismissal, retrenchment benefits and the breach of contract.&nbsp; The eligibility is determined by whether the person has substantial influence on industrial matters or if he has access to confidential information affecting industrial matters.&nbsp; So here&nbsp;we would like to clarify&nbsp;that the eligibility criteria, in the case of the IR Act, should&nbsp;be mutually discussed and agreed with the unions.&nbsp; Hence, the $2,500 salary proxy used in the Employment Act protection for executives should not be seen as the standard set for representation under the Industrial Relations Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, all the proposed changes will invariably lead to cost increases for businesses.&nbsp; And the timing&nbsp;has, unfortunately, raised some concerns&nbsp;among the employers.&nbsp; Earlier when we consulted the employers, the feedback given to us was that they would probably&nbsp; need some time in the transition period because they would probably need to make adjustment to the payroll system.&nbsp; They would have to work out the different formulas to actually compensate the workers where overtime is concerned.&nbsp; Today, when we engage them again, the&nbsp;scenario has changed totally.&nbsp; Overtime has been reduced in most companies over the last few weeks, and is going down very rapidly.&nbsp; In fact, a lot of companies are actually moving into shorter work week and temporary layoff and the numbers keep increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, in times like this, we would like to&nbsp;urge both&nbsp;the companies and&nbsp;workers&nbsp;to take a total approach in managing the cost.&nbsp; Companies should optimise whatever resources and support the Government is providing in areas that <p align=left>Column: 966</p>will support the training and upgrading of their workers.&nbsp; They should take the opportunity to improve the quality of the employees and&nbsp;also reposition themselves.&nbsp;We also want to urge the employees to&nbsp;exercise flexibility, which may include changes in their work patterns, taking up new&nbsp;job roles and probably taking up new skills.&nbsp;At this point in time, we would want the employers and workers to&nbsp;stay engaged, be consultative and&nbsp;transparent.&nbsp; I think this is an important time that we must&nbsp;continue to build trust. &nbsp; And these are necessary measures to stay nimble and viable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.39 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is a timely update to the Employment Act.&nbsp; Since the last substantive update to the statute in 1995, we have seen significant changes to the labour market in Singapore.&nbsp; It is therefore an opportune time to revise the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not propose to speak about the actual amendments that the Acting Minister has introduced in the Bill.&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;the other&nbsp;speakers in this House will do far better than I could.&nbsp; Instead, I will touch on some areas not addressed in the present Bill, which I hope the Acting Minister will consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But before I go into them, I think it is useful to first set into context the function and purpose of the Employment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our economy is built on capitalist principles, with the fundamental premise being that the operation of the free market should result in the most efficient, and hence best, outcome for society.&nbsp; But events over the past few months have shown that the unregulated free market <p align=left>Column: 967</p>can be a dangerous thing.&nbsp; It can lead to undesirable, even extreme, results.&nbsp; Clearly, there is a role for government in a free market, and we should not be reluctant or afraid to regulate where appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the labour market, unequal bargaining power can lead to unfair treatment and exploitation of workers.&nbsp; It is easy enough to point to employees&rsquo; freedom of contract, but that freedom can be illusory in many circumstances. This is why we need legislation like the Employment Act, to provide for workers&rsquo; rights and to protect workers against exploitation.&nbsp; And, in this regard, there should be no distinction between local and foreign workers.&nbsp; Indeed, the Employment Act itself does not make such a distinction.&nbsp; After all, the Employment Act is meant to protect workers against exploitation by unscrupulous employers.&nbsp; What does it matter, if the workers in question are foreigners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a developed society, as a civilised society, we have to be committed to protecting the rights of all workers, not just locals. Because all workers, whether local or foreign, are more than just abstract factors of production; they are human beings, flesh and blood, worthy of our protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these&nbsp;principles in mind, I now turn to my proposals for the Acting Minister&rsquo;s consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first three proposals concern the&nbsp;Labour Court. &nbsp;The Labour Court&nbsp;is empowered to inquire into and decide disputes between workers and employers, relating to the terms of the employment contract or the provisions of the Employment Act. Orders of the Labour Court are enforceable as judgments of a District Court. &nbsp;So if a worker goes before <p align=left>Column: 968</p>the Labour Court&nbsp;and wins, but the employer does not pay up, then the worker has to take out the necessary writs of execution against the employer in the District Court, to enforce the&nbsp;order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can cause the worker hardship in certain cases.&nbsp; If the dispute is over unpaid salaries, then the worker will probably be low on cash in the first place.&nbsp; Yet, he is expected to find the money to engage a lawyer to take out writs of execution against the employer.&nbsp; This cannot be right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a question of law, a worker will be entitled to recover legal costs against the employer.&nbsp; But the worker will have to put up a substantial amount of cash as an upfront deposit, either to cover the lawyer's cost&nbsp;or to the court&rsquo;s bailiff in the case of a writ of seizure and sale, or to both. &nbsp;Furthermore, this presupposes that the execution is successful&nbsp;&ndash; if not, the worker would be out-of-pocket on these legal costs which means it is a bit of a gamble on whether to take up a writ of execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases where an unscrupulous employer plays hardball with a worker and refuses to pay despite the Labour Court's&nbsp;order, a worker could be left without any real recourse despite winning an order from the Labour Court. &nbsp;In such cases, justice would have been denied to the worker. &nbsp;This undercuts the objective of empowering the Labour Court to hear and decide disputes in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my first proposal is for the Labour Court&rsquo;s powers to be expanded, in one or both of the following manners. &nbsp;Firstly, the Labour Court could be empowered to order the employer to pay the sum in question to the Labour Court in escrow&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;who will&nbsp;then in turn pay it to the worker. &nbsp;Employers are much less likely to withhold the sum in question when it is payable&nbsp;to the Labour Court, instead of the worker. &nbsp;A failure to pay within the prescribed <p align=left>Column: 969</p>period could also be made a contempt of court or an offence punishable by a fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Ministry could set up a dedicated unit to help the workers enforce the Labour Court's orders.&nbsp; This unit's&nbsp;services would be free to workers, but recoverable from employers as legal expenses, which the Ministry can then retain to fund this unit's operations.&nbsp; Access to this unit could be limited to low wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This proposal, if adopted, could result in claimants before the Labour Court&nbsp;being better off than plaintiffs in court proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would argue that this outcome&nbsp;is justifiable, on the basis that workers relying on the Labour Court are normally disadvantaged plaintiffs who merit this additional help. &nbsp;These enhancements are necessary to give teeth to the Labour Court's orders, to ensure that they do not end up being mere pieces of paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second proposal is related, and it pertains to the plight of foreign workers who have successfully won their claims before&nbsp;the Labour Court.&nbsp; I understand from the NGOs working in this area that&nbsp;a foreign worker, who is trying to enforce the order against the employer, may sometimes not be allowed to remain in Singapore. While the Ministry will normally grant a Special Pass to a foreign worker pending the resolution of his claim before the Labour Court,&nbsp;I am told that the enforcement of the resulting order is not considered as falling within the ambit of the Employment Act, and therefore&nbsp;the worker may not get his Special Pass extended, such that he can remain in Singapore to enforce the&nbsp;order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is true, then&nbsp;the foreign workers who have not found alternative employment and hence have to rely on a Special Pass to remain in Singapore would be unable to enforce the orders. &nbsp;If the</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ministry intends to retain the current system whereby foreign workers have to <p align=left>Column: 970</p>enforce orders of the Labour Court itself,&nbsp;then it should ensure that they can stay on in Singapore for a reasonable period to&nbsp;enforce their judgments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third proposal concerns the court's jurisdiction over workers' claims.&nbsp; The court may only decide upon matters arising up to one year before the date of lodging of the claim. This one-year time-bar is arguably too short, and should be extended to at least two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, especially in bad times where alternative employment could be hard to find, workers will be reluctant to lodge a claim against an employer who has shortchanged them so long as they remain in its employment.&nbsp; This is quite understandable, and such workers could be severely disadvantaged by the one-year time-bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, fixed-term employment contracts are increasingly common in Singapore.&nbsp; Many contract workers sign one-year contracts, while others sign two-year contracts.&nbsp; But this one-year time-bar means that a worker on a one-year contract, who was shortchanged from day one but&nbsp;was reluctant to make a claim until the contract finished, will have to lodge a claim on the first day after the end of the contract. This is unrealistic and unnecessarily restrictive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is especially acute for foreign workers.&nbsp; Their work passes are at the mercy of the employer, creating an even greater deterrent against complaining while they are still serving the contract. Furthermore, foreign workers are typically on two-year employment contracts and work passes. This means that if they wait until their two-year contract expires before making a claim, they will not be able to get recourse for breaches occurring during&nbsp;the first year of their contract.&nbsp; Foreign workers are therefore caught in a Catch-22: complain and see&nbsp;the current contract terminated, or keep <p align=left>Column: 971</p>silent and have no recourse for breaches in the first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, all claims must be lodged with the Labour Court&nbsp;within six months of the worker leaving employment. Contrast this with the Work Injury Compensation Act.&nbsp; Under that Act, a worker can make an accident claim within one year of the date of the accident.&nbsp; There does not seem to be a good reason why a worker who has suffered a work injury has up to one year to&nbsp;claim for compensation, whereas a worker who has been exploited by the employer only has six months to file a claim. I therefore hope that the Acting Minister would relax this six-month requirement, and increase the period to&nbsp;a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to my fourth proposal, which relates to domestic workers. This Bill extends the Employment Act to cover many more classes of workers, but continues to omit domestic workers, regardless of their nationality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue was addressed during the public consultation on the changes to the Employment Act. The Ministry's response then, was that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Given the nature of their work, it would be difficult to regulate their employment conditions (eg, hours of work, overtime, etc) under the Employment Act.&nbsp; Instead, foreign domestic workers (FDWs) are protected under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, which requires the employers to provide for the workers' well-being, safety, accommodation, and salary payments.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this response by the Ministry only addresses foreign domestic workers. But the definition of \"domestic worker\" under the Employment Act includes gardeners and drivers as well. There are also local domestic workers, some of whom are employed by cleaning agencies, whether <p align=left>Column: 972</p>on a part-time or full-time basis, to provide maid services to customers. With neither the Employment Act nor the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act applying to them, all of these workers are bereft of any statutory protection, left exposed and unprotected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as I understand it, the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act only prescribes general requirements in work passes, without specifics like in the Employment Act. In the absence of specific requirements, protection for foreign domestic workers may be weak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there are some aspects of the Employment Act which could be extended to cover foreign domestic workers, without affecting the nature of their work.&nbsp; For instance, protections governing the termination of employment can be extended to cover the termination of employment of foreign domestic workers, without affecting their ability to perform their duties. This should not be controversial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to take this opportunity to call for a compulsory rest day for foreign domestic workers. Much has been said before about this issue, and I will only add a few words. &nbsp;It is to me inconceivable that we consider ourselves a developed society, and yet we do not grant a maid even one day off a month as of right.&nbsp; Imagine that. &nbsp;We cannot find it in&nbsp;ourselves to say that the very bare minimum amount of rest that a human being should get, is one day off after working 29 or 30 days in a row. However, we try to dress that up, however we justify and rationalise the <I>status quo</I>, our failure to prescribe a mandatory rest day is wholly unacceptable and fall far short of the standard of the developed country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to my fifth and final proposal which pertains to the wages and welfare of foreign workers. During the <p align=left>Column: 973</p>public consultation exercise, there was a call for the legislation of a minimum wage. The Ministry rightly rejected this, correctly pointing out that a mandatory minimum wage would lead to rigidity in the labour market, compromise Singapore's cost competitiveness and adversely affect workers. I think that must be correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I believe that there is nevertheless room for some form of wage protection for foreign workers. The Ministry imposes a levy on foreign work pass holders, on the basis that this levy is necessary to avoid local workers being priced out and to prevent businesses from unduly favouring foreign workers over local workers as the cheaper option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many foreign workers are clearly being under-paid.&nbsp; Many foreign domestic workers receive salaries of less than $300 a month, while some non-domestic foreign workers, such as those in the shipyard and conservancy sectors, are paid daily wages as low as $14 a day, or $322 or so, a month. These figures are almost certainly far less than the economic value of their services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the levies on foreign work pass holders range from $150 to $450 a month. If the purpose of the levy is essentially to equalise the cost of employing a foreign worker, then there is no reason why at least part of the levy cannot be passed on to the worker, because the cost to the employer remains the same. This would be fairer to foreign workers, and would also help those who have incurred debts in coming to Singapore to clear their debts faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, even if the Ministry is not minded to directly pay the levy to foreign workers, it could nevertheless use the levies collected for their welfare, for instance, by funding health or repatriation insurance schemes for them. While <p align=left>Column: 974</p>employers of work pass holders are required to take out health insurance for their workers, the insurance coverage required is low and is usually inadequate for protracted hospital stays or extensive medical treatment.&nbsp; I urge the Acting Minister to consider using the levies for the benefit of the workers without whom&nbsp;there would be no levies in the very first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the coming years will test our economy and our workforce. This makes it critical that we ensure that, even as we focus on helping businesses survive the downturn, they are nevertheless required to treat workers fairly and justly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the issues that I have chosen to speak on in this speech may be&nbsp;more relevant to foreign workers than to local workers.&nbsp; I&nbsp;chose to speak on these issues, because the relationship between employers and foreign workers is often much more unequal than between employers and local workers, making foreign workers more&nbsp;vulnerable.&nbsp; In a glooming downturn, it becomes even more important to ensure that the law effectively protects foreign workers, just as it protects local workers.&nbsp; That is why I felt compelled to raise these issues in this debate, and I hope that the Acting Minister will give my proposals due consideration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.52 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, last week in Hong Kong, I met businessmen who shared their assessment of the impact of the financial tsunami.&nbsp; Among other things, Hong Kong businessmen with interests in China, especially in the Pearl River Delta, highlighted that the troubles had been exacerbated by the introduction of the new Labour Contract Law in China in January this year.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 975</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new law in China protects employees with at least 10 years' service from being dismissed, except in very specific circumstances.&nbsp; The new law also requires employers to contribute to employees' social security accounts, set standards for employees on probation and specifies severance pay in the event of retrenchment.&nbsp; On&nbsp;paper, these measures go further than what our Employment Act in Singapore provides.&nbsp; Together with minimum wages already in place, the new law in China had led to an increase in compliance costs for businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the&nbsp;labour movement in Singapore is keenly aware of the potential impact of changes for our labour laws&nbsp;on businesses.&nbsp; Therefore, while we seek to strengthen protection for workers, it is not our intention to push for changes that impose unreasonable burdens on businesses, especially in a downturn.&nbsp; Therefore, it is important to note the significant differences between labour laws in Singapore and many other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have not asked for minimum wages to be imposed.&nbsp; This is despite the downward-wage pressure faced by lower-skilled workers due to the ready access of low-skilled foreign workers.&nbsp; Instead, we have supported a more sustainable approach of supplementing wages of low-income workers through the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme and levelling up the workers through generous funding for job re-creation and skills upgrading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers in Singapore should not take this position for granted because in many other countries and even in Hong Kong, political parties have succumbed to populist sentiments to&nbsp;push for&nbsp;minimum wages so that workers can better cope with the widening income gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 976</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.55 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, our social safety system has been established for nearly 50 years and has gone through refinements.&nbsp; These refinements, eg, the introduction of Medisave and MediShield, CPF LIFE have been made after careful consideration and with a eye on the long-term needs of Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in social safety, the Singapore Government has done its part to provide subsidies for public housing, sustainable management of healthcare and advanced planning for the retirement needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp; This state of affairs should also not be taken for granted.&nbsp; In the case of China, where the social security system is at its early stage and still evolving, changes to the law have inevitably affected businesses.&nbsp; We are fortunate that in Singapore, employers' manpower costs are no longer subject to social safety needs, eg, when we refine the CPF to introduce CPF LIFE, we did not require additional funding by employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, against this backdrop, that we consider the Employment (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; While the timing is not perfect, and I think we mostly agree on that, we should test the reasonableness of the amendments in the medium to long term.&nbsp; In this regard, the Ministry of Manpower deserves praise for pushing ahead with the changes, despite the slowdown, and for applying a balanced approach in the consultation process, both with the unions as well as with the employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in discussions with union leaders, we have noted the raising of the salary ceiling for non-workmen,&nbsp;under Part IV, from $1,600 to $2,000.&nbsp; This means that more workers will be eligible for overtime payment.&nbsp; However, a concern that has <p align=left>Column: 977</p>been raised by union leaders is that employers may start to incorporate allowances into the workers' salaries so that they just marginally exceed the $2,000 threshold, and they do so in order to avoid having to pay overtime to such workers.&nbsp; In such cases, I hope to seek the MOM's assurance that it will look into the specific conditions of such cases and require the employer to act within the spirit of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, overall, the amendments can still be expected to cost the companies, and&nbsp;require some adjustments by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the challenges&nbsp;that the employers may face, I would like to request the Government's assistance in three areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,&nbsp;the enforcement to be&nbsp;done in a firm but fair manner.&nbsp; In this regard, smaller businesses may take time to understand the&nbsp;changes.&nbsp; In genuine cases where the businesses were unaware or misunderstood their new obligations, and if they are willing to make good in a timely manner, I propose that we need not overly penalise them as it is also not in the employees' interests to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Sir, I believe that the companies could have excess workers during this downturn.&nbsp; And I take the Government's assistance to encourage the companies, instead of retrenching, to send their workers and their staff for training.&nbsp; To do so, training grants could be made substantially enhanced to help companies tide over their difficulties.&nbsp; Also, we need to recognise the pressure on mid-level staff&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not only on the lower income, lower wage staff&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;whose salaries are higher.&nbsp; I hope that we would not forget them in the kind of courses that we make available for funding support and also that we should set the grant cap appropriately to recognise the different cost of programmes relevant to mid-level staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 978</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, thirdly, in line with the adjustment to the salary ceiling of Part IV, the salary cap on absentee payroll should be reviewed and possibly increased so that companies could be motivated to include more workers in their training efforts during the downturn.&nbsp; Otherwise, if companies cap the payroll to mid-level staff at the funding cap, these mid-level staff will also not be motivated to go for training.&nbsp; It will be a lose-lose situation for all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to conclude in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081118/20081118VS_181146.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the labour law provides the regulatory framework, but not total protection. Ultimately, the best welfare for the worker is to give them a good job, and the best protection for the worker is full employment. However, during difficult times, when employers face labour shortages, they will proactively improve wages and working conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the most pressing concern of the Government is how to prevent the current downturn from moving into a long and deep recession.&nbsp; We need to work out effective strategies to restore economic growth. So, I urge the Government to assist companies in overcoming rising costs and cash flow problems in order for them to remain competitive, and not resort to wage reduction or retrenchment as the solution to the problem. This way, we can better help workers keep their jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support this amendment Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, I read an interesting article on a Viking ship a few days ago. &nbsp;The Viking ship which was built in 700&nbsp;&ndash; 900 AD is considered by many as one of the ancient <p align=left>Column: 979</p>engineering&nbsp;marvels in sea faring. &nbsp;The Vikings combined both rowing and sailing in their design to take advantage of manpower and wind power, and it is important for them to balance the use of these forces to achieve maximum speed, as well as manoeuvrability.&nbsp; Among the Viking ships, the longship is the most versatile with a length of about 100 feet, a 20-foot beam, up to 60 oars, and runs on a crew of 70-80.&nbsp; These ships can carry up to 20 tons of supplies. &nbsp;To run such ships optimally, the Vikings need to harness both the manpower, as in the rowers and the wind power, effectively.&nbsp; During calm seas and strong winds, the rowers&nbsp;can actually relax a little bit.&nbsp; The captains can order them to slow down and give them more welfare, but during a stormy weather, the rowers have to work hard. &nbsp;With the sails up, in fact, the wind can overpower the rowers and capsize the ship.&nbsp; Similarly, if the rowers are not committed to their tasks and slacken, the&nbsp;ship can be capsized easily&nbsp;as well.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our looming economic storm, each enterprise is like a Viking ship trying to stay afloat and on course.&nbsp; The employees or workers are crucial crew&nbsp;to ensure the ship&nbsp;maintains its balance in this stormy sea.&nbsp; While it is important to ensure that our workers and employees are well protected and their welfare taken care of, it is even more important to ensure the ship stays afloat and sails safely through this stormy sea.&nbsp; If the ship sinks, all the crew, along with the captain, will perish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rise in support of the Bill as&nbsp;it will give the Ministry of Manpower more teeth to protect the interest of our workers against irresponsible employers, and I strongly support the provision to enhance the penalty for those who flout the&nbsp;law on the Employment Act, as stated in the amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 980</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are areas in the proposed amendments which, I feel, could be introduced at a more opportune time than now when businesses and industries are scrambling to keep themselves afloat amidst this financial storm.&nbsp; The employers are facing many cost increases in the last two years: wage increase, extension of skill development levy to include all workers, increase of medical insurance premium for their workers, rental increase, raw material increase, transportation cost increase, utility bill increase, and many more.&nbsp; It seems to me that the amendments in this&nbsp;Bill will further increase the business cost to our enterprises and erode our competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the amendments, I note that we are casting a wider coverage which means more workers will fall under the ambit of the Workmen's Compensation Act, by raising the salary threshold under the Bill in question. &nbsp;This, I feel, will invariably bring about an added cost to all employers because the insurance companies will revise the premiums as they have to cover a bigger ground.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I hope that the Minister can explain how&nbsp;the salary ceiling of $4,500 under clause 9, subsection (1) of section 33 was reached, and the threshold of other employees from $1,600 a month to $2,000 a month was derived in drawing up the amendments.&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that in Malaysia, their Employment Act has a ceiling cap of not more than $1,500 ringgit for employees.&nbsp; However, their Act was amended in 1998 to include employees earning&nbsp;$1,500 to $5,000 ringgit, but they are restricted to issues relating to wages, allowances and other cash benefits. &nbsp;What protection and assurance will there be for employers against&nbsp;employees who may try to exploit the Act for self?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another amendment that will increase the&nbsp;cost indirectly to employers is the <p align=left>Column: 981</p>revision from&nbsp;six to&nbsp;three months for an employee to qualify for sick leave. &nbsp;This, I believe, our approach is somewhat different from Malaysia and Hong Kong.&nbsp; In Malaysia, it is 14 days leave in a calendar year for those&nbsp;who have worked for less than two years, while in Hong Kong, an employee gets two days paid sick leave&nbsp;for each completed month of employment during the first 12 months.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to enlighten this House on the benefit of our approach as compared to our neighbouring countries and competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I certainly hope that the Government has taken into consideration the additional weight that these changes will add to the burden facing businesses altogether.&nbsp; The business community will look forward to the relief that the&nbsp;Government can provide, as mentioned by the Prime Minister last weekend.&nbsp; This financial storm is no ordinary storm.&nbsp; It is the perfect storm of this century for the financial industry and for&nbsp;some, they&nbsp;have&nbsp;termed it&nbsp;the \"financial tsunami\".&nbsp; There are already many ships that have fallen and sunk along with the crew.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an aircraft carrier like Lehman Brothers has capsized. &nbsp;While I support the measures taken to protect and benefit our workers, we need to be cognisant of the plight of the employers during this stormy season.&nbsp; I hope that the Government will introduce measures to keep our fleet of ships afloat, as soon as possible, before we lose more ships or crews.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the last time that a substantive revision was made to the Employment Act was in 1995, and the labour market, profile and conditions have evolved noticeably since then.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that the employment growth in Singapore slowed in the third quarter, with the job market expected to <p align=left>Column: 982</p>deteriorate further as the global economic slowdown and the financial crisis take its toll on our economy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at times like these, employees seem to be the easiest target for any cost-cutting measure.&nbsp; This is akin to the ship captains unloading their burden into the high seas in the middle of a storm.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in this case, the deck hands are the ones being thrown overboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary estimates are showing that the number of retrenchments rose to 2,000 in the third quarter, compared to just below 1,800 in the previous quarter.&nbsp; At times like these, we have to make sure that the Employment Act stays relevant and current to be able to protect workers and also maintain order in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal to revise the coverage of the Employment Act is timely as it addresses the changing employment market profile and salary scales.&nbsp; With the proposed amendments, confidential employees such as accounts assistants, human resource clerks and secretaries will no longer be left out and will be entitled to basic employment benefits and protection, equivalent to their other counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salary protection is also being proposed for junior managers and executives earning at or below the&nbsp;$2,500 monthly salary.&nbsp; As withholding their salary would be an offence, errant employers will think twice before victimising their junior staff members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the proposals to review the employment standards and benefits, I am glad to see that emphasis is being given to the well-being of workers.&nbsp; In these uncertain times, the employee's health must not be neglected nor sacrificed.&nbsp; If an employee is unwell, employers must make it easy and convenient for employees to seek medical attention, or to take medical leave and rest at home.&nbsp; Paid public holiday should also be seen as an entitlement, and not merely as a privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 983</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal to redefine part-time employees is another welcomed move as it offers employers some flexibility to hire part-timers and, hopefully, help absorb some of the increased excess labour in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments will also provide the Ministry with more teeth through enhancement of the enforcement powers of the Employment Inspectors.&nbsp; And to make sure that the \"bark\" is equivalent to the \"bite\", the penalties against the infringements will also be increased.&nbsp; Furthermore, the proposals to streamline the dispute resolution process will ensure that conflicts are resolved quickly and both employee and employer can quickly move on with neither party being dragged into long proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these proposed changes, employers must relook into the employee list to appropriately define which category employees fall into.&nbsp; And depending on the nature of the business or operations, up to 20% of the company's employees could fall within the scope covered under the Employment Act.&nbsp; With such a significant portion of the workforce affected, we need to continuously check the effectiveness of the provisions and coverage of the Employment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to make sure that the workers are getting enough protection.&nbsp; Everyone&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;including the Ministry of Manpower, the Union and&nbsp;employer&nbsp;&ndash; must work together to ensure that employers adhere to the rules and do not exploit any loopholes, or make structural changes that would unfairly exclude the employees from the protection of the Employment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to highlight another area that needs attention, and that is our term contract resident employees, which numbers about 200,000 and growing.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 984</p>These casual, contract and low wage workers are often found to be in a disadvantaged situation where they are deprived from basic statutory rights like CPF, leave entitlement and medical coverage.&nbsp; Let me ask: why is this&nbsp;so?&nbsp; Has the Employment Act been able to make a difference to improve the situation of this group of people that is growing in number?&nbsp; This is an area that has to be seriously looked at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often said that the sign of a successful nation is not how many millionaires it can create, but the extent to which it renders help to those who have not been able to progress as much as others.&nbsp; This is why I am focusing on low wage workers of which many of them are in contract employment and are trying very hard to move up&nbsp;into the economic mainstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore and, more importantly, Singaporeans have come a long way since our independence in 1965.&nbsp; We have grown and progressed together from strength to strength over the past 43 years.&nbsp; The transformation of Singapore from a backwater economy to one of the most flexible and dynamic economies in the world is an achievement not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; Indeed, it has both been an arduous, yet amazing journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we all know that 2008 is already and will be a different year.&nbsp; We know that likelihood for the employment opportunities this year will not be good and, worse, the unemployment numbers will also increase.&nbsp; We are witnessing an unprecedented phenomenon that is unfolding before our own eyes and the world economy is battered by the financial crisis.&nbsp; The job market in Singapore will not be spared.&nbsp; Hence, many workers and Singaporeans' lives will be affected by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me go into detail on the contract and casual workers.&nbsp; In 2001, <p align=left>Column: 985</p>there were only about 59,000 individuals on contract employment.&nbsp; However, as&nbsp;at June 2007, this number has increased by more than two-fold to 183,000.&nbsp; This comprises 12% of the working population.&nbsp; Cleaners, labourers and related workers constitute close to 40,000 workers.&nbsp; Industries they work in include cleaning, landscaping, construction and logistics sectors.&nbsp; They are the unsung heroes who wake up very early in the morning to clean our offices, maintain the gardens and ensure that we have clean roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through our outreach programmes at NTUC, we found out that many of them face long working hours, have low skills, and&nbsp;do not have many benefits,&nbsp;savings and&nbsp;job security.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, unfortunately, because of all these conditions, they are not interested to go for training and upgrading.&nbsp; While many benefited positively from Singapore's economy growth,&nbsp;these workers, on the contrary, actually experienced&nbsp;a drop in their salaries, and have no statutory benefits and CPF payments.&nbsp; Some employers also resort to employing cheap foreign workers to replace them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was highlighted in the Report&nbsp;for Wages&nbsp;in Singapore 2007 that among the blue-collar jobs, the lowest paid groups are the cleaners, labourers and related workers who&nbsp;were paid a median gross monthly wage at around $750 to $800. &nbsp;It was also mentioned that for the past decade, all other occupational groups enjoyed wage gains with the exception of the cleaners, labourers and related workers.&nbsp; The highest median gross monthly wages stood at approximately $6,000 for managers.&nbsp; Hence, we can see that the income disparity widens further between the lowly educated and educated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today I would like to appeal and call for a concerted national effort to help bring these disadvantaged workers and their families <p align=left>Column: 986</p>into the mainstream of our economy through concrete and active approaches that focus on self-sufficiency, advancement, assistance programmes and corporate social responsibility.&nbsp; And this includes a more significant improvement and implementation of the laws, as stipulated in the Employment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each and everyone of us can help to champion this cause through various ways. For example, end-user or service buyer companies can help influence good employment conditions when contracting third-party services through responsible outsourcing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that in today's globalised world, there is an increasing trend towards outsourcing, and responsible outsourcing can be a big challenge for many companies.&nbsp; As a result, some take risk by flouting the law as they are dealing with lowly educated, lowly skilled and vulnerable workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many positive developments have taken place.&nbsp; For example, in March this year, the Tripartite Committee on CPF and Work-Related Benefits for Low-Wage Workers (TRICOM) had unveiled a Tripartite Advisory on Responsible Outsourcing Practices to help end-user companies enhance the employment terms and conditions of employees of their service providers.&nbsp; This is a good initiative and many more have come on board.&nbsp; But the fact that such an advisory has to be released by the committee for the industry to adopt tells us many things.&nbsp; One compelling question is, why do we need the advisory if the Employment Act is in place?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp;sometimes very discouraging to hear that some companies appraised staff on how much cost savings they help to achieve for the company when awarding contracts, without looking at the quality of work rendered by the service providers.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Price is often the main determinant and <p align=left>Column: 987</p>service providers end up marking down their price in order to win the contract.&nbsp; Somehow, workers get squeezed in this vicious spiral.&nbsp; In many cases, workers suffered salary decline each time they work for a new employer as a result of his former employer losing the contract to a new service provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge all responsible service buyers to constantly check and review the contract specifications and ensure that they&nbsp;are based on performance rather than on price and headcount.&nbsp; The contract specifications should include industry-recognised service standards, trained and experienced workers, good financial standing, fair employment terms and investment in workers' training.&nbsp; Service buyers should offer longer contract tenure so that service providers are more prepared to invest in equipment and training.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, service buyers need to have&nbsp;audit and enforcement procedures to ensure service excellence and&nbsp;money&nbsp;well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach is more sustainable and will benefit the host company as workers who are taken care of, especially of their basic needs, will be motivated to perform.&nbsp; As a result, there will be less absenteeism and low turnover rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC will continue to work with the Ministries and its partners to conduct more outreach programmes to educate the workers on their rights and help them to resolve their problems at their workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will work closely together to launch a concerted effort to identify and prosecute, hopefully, companies breaking the law and crack down on them.&nbsp; It is important that we raise the awareness of employment rights and ensure that these rights are properly enforced.&nbsp; We should not allow unscrupulous employers who <p align=left>Column: 988</p>undercut honest competition and take advantage of workers who are so desperate to earn a living that they are so fearful of losing their jobs if they highlight their plights to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, we have a unique tripartite relationship between Government, employers and unions that should be harnessed to enhance the lives of all workers including the low-wage contract and casual workers.&nbsp; Everyone must play their part, both employers, employees and also the Government.&nbsp; We need to pledge to work together for a better life for all workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.17 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the amended Employment Act to be effective in the long term, I believe it ought to pass&nbsp;three tests:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;Is the amended Act robust enough to cater for the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Is it enforceable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Is it sustainable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, is the&nbsp;amended Act robust enough to cater for the workforce of the future?&nbsp; Sir, in a McKinsey interview with the CEO of Manpower Inc, one of the largest global recruitment agencies,&nbsp;several trends were observed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a global workforce that is dominated by older and more expensive workers;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; a&nbsp;stark increase in &lsquo;non-regular&rsquo; or flexible staff;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the shortened lifecycles of jobs, including hot jobs, in the IT sector, for <p align=left>Column: 989</p>example, the 'webmaster' which&nbsp;is fast disappearing, as many of us learn how to&nbsp;construct and update&nbsp;our own websites;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the poor job that most companies are doing in terms of training their workers; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the interest in part-time jobs by older&nbsp;and female staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the workforce of the future in Singapore is one that is likely to go in the same direction, if not already there.&nbsp; Our future workforce is one that will be characterised by:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more executives and other white-collar workers on site or in home offices, as a result of our&nbsp;excellent education system;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; more elderly workers, an outcome of our rapidly ageing population;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more disabled workers, a result of better education of students with special needs in our schools;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more foreign workers, due both to job preferences of locals and an overall talent crunch;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more part-timers, likely women and retirees; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more contract workers on flexible work arrangements as companies continue to adopt the strategies of workforce optimisation through outsourcing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Act must be robust enough to reflect the profile of this workforce of the future of ours.&nbsp; Specifically,&nbsp;I believe that the inclusion of junior managers and professionals in the Act for some benefits is progressive.&nbsp; However, I seek an explanation on how the salary threshold of $2,500 is derived.&nbsp; I doubt many junior managers earn less than $2,500 and some fresh university graduates in fact <p align=left>Column: 990</p>command starting salaries of more than $2,500.&nbsp; So, how is the $2,500 derived and who is the specific target group intended for coverage by the Act?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also want to commend the Ministry for the provision of the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme, which I believe is&nbsp;another right move to recognise contract and other temporary workers.&nbsp; However, the new Act is still a work-in-progress and fairly generic&nbsp;and traditional.&nbsp; I believe there is a future need for Ministry to later on further amend the Act&nbsp;to better suit the profiles of the workforce of the future, to address the specific needs of part-timers, contract workers, elderly workers, disabled workers and&nbsp;higher-salaried white-collar employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, is the amended Act enforceable?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Employment Act is the main piece of legislation governing employment practices in Singapore.&nbsp; Resources must be assured to ensure that the Ministry has the teeth to enforce the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether in economic downturns or not, there is a strong need to protect the interests of the most vulnerable employee&nbsp;&ndash; the&nbsp;lower-wage&nbsp;workgroup amongst us.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;refer to specifically three&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;namely, the elderly, the disabled and the foreign workers (including domestic helpers) who are hitherto not covered by the Employment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these vulnerable workers are likely to be the ones who will not have a voice.&nbsp; They are either too lowly educated, too afraid to lose their jobs or unable to articulate their concerns or present evidences in the labour courts.&nbsp; In an economic downturn, they are also likely to be the first to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We read in April this year a special report by journalist, Radha Basu, who wrote at length on the plight of the disabled,&nbsp;employees in our country.&nbsp; A few disabled people she spoke to rejected her <p align=left>Column: 991</p>interviews fearing that they will be fired or not be able to get a job in the future.&nbsp; From various interest groups, we have also heard&nbsp;the plight of foreign Bangladeshi Indian workers who are stranded in Singapore due to unfulfilled job promises by some employers.&nbsp; Many have taken up extensive loans in their home country in the&nbsp;hope of work in Singapore, and are now too poor to return home.&nbsp; The same can also be said of domestic helpers, local and foreign, who are&nbsp;not included in the current Employment Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we can take a leaf from Taiwan, which actually has provisions to work with the home countries to limit, in fact, the quantum of brokerage fees or loans before these workers secure work in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need more teeth to protect these vulnerable groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully&nbsp;understand that the root causes of their plights are not simple to resolve.&nbsp; But unless action is taken&nbsp;in collaboration with the other stakeholders, for example, the home countries of the foreign workers, we will risk our reputation of being a progressive country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the Minister, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Manpower are personally empathic and want to do the right thing.&nbsp; I, therefore, ahead of the Budget debate, urge that more resources be accorded to the Ministry to study, analyse, prioritise and address the top needs of these vulnerable groups&nbsp;&ndash; low-wage, elderly, disabled and foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, is the amended Act sustainable?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to also call for balance and moderation as we try to protect the needs of employees and workers in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us operate in an eco-system&nbsp;&ndash; change in one part affects another.&nbsp; As <p align=left>Column: 992</p>many of us call for more protection for the rights and welfare of employees, there is a strong need to ensure that the cost of business in human resource is moderated so that businesses can sustain and jobs are kept.&nbsp; Therein, I believe, lies the tension and challenge of ensuring that the triad of interests of (1) employer; (2) the employee and (3) the nation&nbsp;is balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the widespread introduction of the five-day work-week; generous maternity leave and childcare leave; coupled with reservist leave;&nbsp;paternity leave; compassionate leave; and in the case of some industries, the benefit of school vacations which add&nbsp;another, easily, eight weeks of leave,&nbsp;organisations are hard-pressed&nbsp;to deliver results with the same manpower.&nbsp; When companies find Singapore less than competitive, then the provisions may not be sustainable and in winning the war, we may lose the battle in keeping the jobs for the very people we care about.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the need to moderate and think of the bigger picture as together we work to adopt an employment legislation that is viable over the short and long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I want to thank&nbsp;the Minister for the proposed amendments which, I believe,&nbsp;are definitely moving in the right direction.&nbsp; I support the Bill, Sir.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.24 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by commending the proposed amendments under the Bill before the House, especially the&nbsp;amendments in dealing with unfair dismissal and allowing more workers to be eligible to be heard in the&nbsp;Labour Court.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are some areas that the Bill should be more specific about.&nbsp; I am concerned about the wages for contract workers.&nbsp; I share the same concern of Mayor Zainudin.&nbsp; Contract workers play an important part in our <p align=left>Column: 993</p>economic development.&nbsp; They are like the booster to an engine.&nbsp; Whenever the economy picks up, companies would turn to contract workers to supplement their full-time workforce to cope with increased production.&nbsp; These contract workers are not always unskilled or inexperienced hands.&nbsp; Sometimes, these are workers who have good experience except that they are not able to get full-time employment for one reason or another.&nbsp; In fact, it is not uncommon for contract workers to eventually work their way to become full-time employees.&nbsp; Presently, some of these workers have no minimum wage, no medical/hospital benefits, no insurance coverage and no CPF.&nbsp; These contract workers, most of the time, have agreed on these unfavourable terms as they need the extra cash because of financial hardship.&nbsp; Circumstances make these contract workers to fall into the temptation of accepting such job offers.&nbsp; Now with older workers joining the ranks of contract workforce, in view of the poor economic situation, we should see to it that they are not exploited because of their difficulty in seeking re-employment.&nbsp; For many years, the Manpower Ministry has been trying to resolve these employment conditions for the contract workers and has yet to give them a good employment package.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry would take this opportunity of the amendment to the Bill to enhance the employment terms for the contract workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next concern is that there should be paternity leave in the Employment Act.&nbsp; We often speak of the need to be family-oriented, and for fathers to play a greater role in minding the child and helping their wives by playing a bigger role in the family.&nbsp; Previous polls have shown us that many Singaporean women would be more willing to have more babies if their husbands could share their duties.&nbsp; In line with our mission of getting more married couples to have babies, paternity leave <p align=left>Column: 994</p>should receive as much emphasis as maternity leave.&nbsp; Pregnancy is a shared responsibility between married couples.&nbsp; We should get the men to be responsible for the parenthood at the birth of the child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me recount my personal experience.&nbsp; All my four babies were by caesarean birth due to medical conditions.&nbsp; I was in hospital for five days and needed another one week before I could really care for the baby properly.&nbsp; The best support I had was from my better half, who understood my needs and helped me to cope with the baby.&nbsp; This is especially crucial for the first baby as everything&nbsp;was for the&nbsp;first time, more consultation and support are needed.&nbsp; His presence meant much to me and the baby.&nbsp; Hence, I could have four babies.&nbsp; And I asked for&nbsp;10 days, at least, for paternity leave for our fathers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we are on the topic of babies, I wish to appeal for the Baby Bonus benefits to be extended to single parents.&nbsp; This is an issue that has created some controversy but has yet to be thoroughly explored.&nbsp; Single parents were excluded mainly because the purpose of the Baby Bonus scheme was to encourage Singaporeans to get married and have babies.&nbsp; It was emphasised that the children of single parents will not be disadvantaged as they will enjoy the same benefits as other children.&nbsp; But intentional or not, a child of a single mother will be deprived of many things from birth because the mother is denied maternity benefits that her lawfully-wed counterparts enjoy.&nbsp; Notably, the child will spend less time with his mother as compared to other children.&nbsp; The mother's spending power may be greatly compromised because she gets less paid leave on top of the fact that she does not have a husband to supplement the household income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether a mother is a single parent or not does not escape the fact that she has <p align=left>Column: 995</p>contributed to the country by helping the population to expand.&nbsp; It also does not diminish her responsibility to give the child a good upbringing so that the child becomes a useful citizen one day.&nbsp; The role of the Government is to provide a conducive environment for a parent or parents to nurture their children.&nbsp; We should ensure that every child enjoys equality right from birth, especially if it is within our means to do so.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shall now address some of the specific points that are raised by Members this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiat and Ms Denise Phua have expressed concern that the changes to increase business costs can add to employers' burden during the current economic downturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as noted by Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mrs Josephine Teo, while the Bill is intended to strengthen protection for workers under the law, it is not our intention to impose excessive burden on businesses, especially in the downturn.&nbsp; We understand the employers' concerns and have consulted Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF) and&nbsp;Singapore Business Federation (SBF) closely during the development of the proposals.&nbsp; The employers generally accept that the amendments are appropriate and necessary to ensure that the fundamentals are in place so that our labour market would be flexible and well-positioned to meet the challenges of the changing economy in the longer term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 996</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dr Lim's query on the reduction in sick leave qualifying period, the amendments were in response to the shorter employment tenure arising from an increased in the short-term employment contracts.&nbsp; Contrary to Dr Lim's observation, the qualifying period of three months would not be overly generous; in fact, some of the other countries have much shorter qualifying periods.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, we have sought to mitigate&nbsp;employers' burden by phasing in the sick leave entitlement for new employees within the fourth&nbsp;to&nbsp;sixth month of their service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to Part IV on non-workmen salary ceiling, Dr Lim has asked how the ceiling was determined.&nbsp; The new salary ceiling of $2,000 was the outcome of extensive consultations between the&nbsp;tripartite&nbsp;partners,&nbsp;taking into account&nbsp;wage trends&nbsp;over the years and the need to balance between the enhancement of worker protection and keeping wage costs competitive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Halimah that we should regularly review the salary ceiling to keep pace with the market, and we will do so in close consultation with tripartite partners.&nbsp; Employers would also benefit from the enhanced flexibility such as the redefinition of part-time employment and the imposition of a salary threshold of $4,500 for workmen under Part IV.&nbsp; In particular, as Mdm Halimah pointed out, the salary threshold for workmen was a significant step as no such ceiling existed previously under the Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Cham and Mdm Halimah have appealed for the affected workmen to be fairly treated.&nbsp; We agree, and through SNEF and SBF, my Ministry has engaged and sought the understanding from employers that they would be fair&nbsp;and reasonable in the renegotiation of the employment terms and benefits.&nbsp; The affected workmen who earned above the salary threshold also tend to be highly <p align=left>Column: 997</p>skilled and would reasonably be able to negotiate for better employment terms, even on their own merits.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we will monitor the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua asked how the $2,500 threshold for managers and executives was determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was determined also after consultation with unions and the employers.&nbsp; It will cover about 44,000 junior managers and executives.&nbsp; These are executives who generally work in the office.&nbsp; This also is a major step because previously they have never been covered under the EA.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge Members to take one step at a time.&nbsp; Let us introduce this threshold and we will review the threshold from time to time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ms Cham's point about using the $2,500 salary ceiling as a criterion for limited representation for managers and executives under the Industrial Relation (IR) Act, I would like to clarify that the two Acts are separate Acts and in the IR Act&nbsp; we need to consider many other factors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also voiced concern that employers may convert some of their existing full-time staff to part-time workers to take advantage of the redefinition of part-time employment.&nbsp; I would like to assure her that we are mindful of this and that is why we have stipulated that&nbsp;those working 35 hours or more, meaning equivalent to seven hours a day for five days a week,&nbsp;are classified as full-time.&nbsp; Furthermore, part-time work remains a small component in our labour market compared to many other countries, and therefore there is no sign of excessive abuse&nbsp;of part-timers so far.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we will monitor the situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mdm Halimah's other comment on the need for clear guidelines for waiver&nbsp;for employers to bear medical consultation <p align=left>Column: 998</p>fees, we note her concern and we will work closely with our tripartite partners in developing a set of guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Ms Cham, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Ms Denise Phua and Mr Zainudin Nordin on the need to protect the more vulnerable workers.&nbsp; In fact, many of the proposed amendments, such as the shortening of sick leave, qualifying period, are intended to benefit vulnerable workers such as contract workers.&nbsp; But I agree we need to work with our tripartite partners to reach out more effectively to such workers to help them understand better their rights under the Employment Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang raised a concern on clause 13 with regard to working hours of shift workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to clarify that these amendments are for shift workers.&nbsp; For non-shift workers, such provision is already there.&nbsp; We are just harmonising between the shift workers and non-shift workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also&nbsp;want to take this opportunity to assure Members that this provision is meant for really emergency, exceptional circumstances.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;not meant for ordinary day-to-day routines.&nbsp; So this will ensure that our workers will continue to have adequate rest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Mr Siew Kum Hong's query on domestic workers, as he has rightly pointed out&nbsp;&ndash; he has read our website and our answers&nbsp;&ndash; the domestic workers are excluded basically because the nature of the domestic work is quite different from normal work, whether they are foreign or local.&nbsp; So it would be very difficult to regulate the employment conditions.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp;foreign domestic workers are more vulnerable and therefore they are protected under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act which requires employers to provide basic welfare for the well-being of the workers.&nbsp; For local domestic workers, if they have difficulties with their employers, MOM will be happy <p align=left>Column: 999</p>to help them mediate&nbsp;and find amicable solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On rest day for FDWs (foreign domestic workers) raised by Mr Siew, MOM encourages employers&nbsp;to grant rest day for foreign domestic workers but we do not intend to legislate it at present&nbsp;because&nbsp;the nature of work differs from family to family.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;better for us to allow different families to work out practical solutions but the Act requires employers to ensure their domestic workers have adequate rest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As observed by Mr Zainudin Nordin, strong enforcement is necessary for the Act to be effective in protecting workers.&nbsp; In this regard, we have enhanced the penalties and investigative powers to deter infringements and facilitate enforcement efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are mindful of Mrs Josephine Teo's comments on the need for enforcement to be fair and calibrated.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mrs Teo that the Ministry has been proactive in educating&nbsp;employers and employees of their employment rights and obligations.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we will not hesitate to enforce against errant employers who willfully contravene employment&nbsp;standards so that workers' interests are protected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related issue, Mr Siew Kum Hong has requested&nbsp;for workers to be provided with assistance in enforcing Labour Court orders.&nbsp; Sir, the Labour Court orders are similar to Civil Court orders and should accordingly be enforced by the claimants.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Ministry may take prosecution action against employers, such as if the employers are recalcitrant or if the employees are extremely vulnerable.&nbsp; Mr Siew has also suggested allowing foreign workers to stay in Singapore to enforce their Labour Court claims.&nbsp; In general, we allow foreign workers to stay in Singapore for a short <p align=left>Column: 1000</p>period of time to allow them to enforce their claims.&nbsp; However, for complex claims that may require a longer time to resolve, the foreign workers may be asked to return to their home countries because if they stay on, they may create other problems and&nbsp;they may not have sufficient income to support themselves.&nbsp; For such cases, nevertheless, MOM will remit the monies when they are received from the employers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Topping&nbsp;up foreign workers' salaries using the levy, as suggested by Mr Siew, I think this would not make sense as it would undermine the purpose of the levy which is to regulate employers' demand for foreign workers.&nbsp; Furthermore, employers may end up paying their foreign workers even lower wages since they know that these foreign workers will be given the top-up from the levy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew has also asked for a time bar&nbsp;on employment claims to be extended.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current one-year time bar is a reasonable length of time for employees to make representation to the Commissioner for their employment claims.&nbsp; It would be&nbsp;difficult for the Labour Court to verify longstanding claims if the&nbsp;one-year time bar is extended.&nbsp; And therefore, the one-year time bar is necessary to facilitate and expedite the dispute resolution process.&nbsp; Nevertheless, those who require more time to surface their employment claims may still do so through civil claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo suggested that the Government should provide more support for training during this downturn.&nbsp; Indeed, this is what we plan to do under the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (or SPUR), as announced by the Prime Minister last Sunday.&nbsp; MOM will release more details later this week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On paternity leave proposed by Mdm Cynthia Phua, I think we have discussed this extensively in the last few sittings.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1001</p>Let me just say that we do recognise the contribution by fathers and that is why we have introduced the enhanced childcare leave for fathers as well as mothers, and we have also introduced no-pay infant care leave for fathers as well.&nbsp; I think I would not discuss this further, and would leave this for another occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in summary, as highlighted by several of the Members, the proposed amendments to the Employment Act balanced the enhancement of employment protection with measures to keep our labour market responsive and competitive.&nbsp; With the support of unions and employers, I am confident that we can create a fair, progressive and flexible labour market that&nbsp;will benefit all of us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; (Mr Gan Kim Yong).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:MONEYLENDERS BILL-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:MONEYLENDERS BILL:::1021-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

These are termed \"exempt moneylenders\" and include companies that lend&nbsp;solely to businesses or to their own staff.&nbsp; The number of exemptions given over the years has increased, standing at 188 at the end of last year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the Ministry of Law and the Registry of Moneylenders&nbsp;conducted a holistic review of the Act to see how the moneylending regime can be improved. These amendments are a result of this review. They take into consideration the feedback we had received from a public consultation on an earlier version of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in view of the comprehensive changes, the Bill repeals and re-enacts the Moneylenders Act. In general, these amendments will introduce a more flexible and progressive approach to the regulation of moneylending to keep pace with the modern credit economy, whilst taking into account the social policy on access to credit; in other words, a modern framework that serves to strike a proper balance between regulating licensed moneylenders and safeguarding the interests of borrowers. Specifically, they clarify the scope of moneylending activi<p align=left>Column: 1003</p>ties to be licensed, modernise moneylending operations, enhance protection for borrowers, tighten the regulatory framework, giving the Registrar more powers to act against errant moneylenders and introduce new measures to tackle unlicensed moneylending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now take the House through the salient features of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Clarifying the scope of moneylending</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part I of the Bill clarifies the scope of moneylending. All moneylenders who grant secured and unsecured loans to members of the public will be licensed and regulated. Some of the moneylenders previously granted exemptions but who come within&nbsp;&nbsp; the scope of moneylending will now be regulated under the new licence regime.&nbsp; In addition, the list of excluded moneylenders has been expanded to cover, for example, lenders who grant solely staff loans or lend solely to corporations, limited liability partnerships, trustees of REIT, and accredited investors within the meaning of section 4 of the Securities and Futures Act.&nbsp; Excluded moneylenders will not be required to apply for a licence or an exemption under the Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clauses 35 and 36 empower the Minister to grant or extend exemptions from any or all of the provisions of the Bill, to impose or vary conditions of exemption, and to revoke the whole or part of any exemption, where necessary, and to grant class exemptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new framework, the Minister's power of exemption will be of a residual nature, for loan activities that may not be specifically excluded but for which we have no intention to regulate, eg, loans to high net worth individuals for transactions which do not fall within the social policy concerns. The changes will <p align=left>Column: 1004</p>provide greater certainty to the industry, and remove the need for companies to apply for exemptions for lending activities which do not need to be regulated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Modernising the licensing regime</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with the new framework, the licensing regime has been modernised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owing to its origin as a piece of social legislation to regulate small operators, the current Act has tight controls on location. In recognition of the function of moneylending activities in the modern credit economy, licensed moneylenders will be allowed to operate branches. In line with allowing licensed moneylenders to operate from more than one location, clause 10 requires a person to obtain the approval of the Registrar to carry on moneylending business at any place.&nbsp; The circumstances under which the Registrar will not grant his approval, and may revoke or suspend any such approval, are also set out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Act currently imposes severe restrictions on advertising by licensed moneylenders. This is an unnecessary restriction in today's context and will be lifted under the Bill.&nbsp; With more information in the marketplace, borrowers will be able to make better-informed decisions. Nevertheless, any advertisement must be accurate and should not mislead. Hence, under clause 16, it is an offence for a licensed moneylender to knowingly or recklessly issue or publish any advertising or marketing material in any form that is false or misleading. The Registrar may issue relevant directions to regulate advertising and marketing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enhancing the Registrar of Moneylenders regulatory powers<br>\r\nand giving greater protection to borrowers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the same time, the Act gives greater protection to borrowers and <p align=left>Column: 1005</p>strengthens the regulatory framework and enforcement tools available to the Registrar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On giving borrowers greater protection, certain requirements have been sharpened. &nbsp;Clause 19 requires a licensed moneylender to inform a borrower or his agent in writing, before the grant of a loan, of the terms and conditions of the loan.&nbsp; Clause 20 requires the licensed moneylender to provide a written loan contract to the borrower, and for the contract to be explained in a language that the borrower understands.&nbsp; At the Committee stage, I am making an amendment to extend this protection to a surety, if any, which was omitted as a result of a drafting oversight. Clause 21 requires the licensed moneylender to supply statements of accounts to borrowers in accordance with the specified requirements. One such requirement will be that borrowers must be furnished a statement of account without charge at least twice a year. Clause 17 prohibits the grant of loans if the borrower had not first applied in writing to the licensed moneylender for the loan.&nbsp; This will deter unsolicited loans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 22 empowers the Minister to prescribe the types or amounts of the costs, charges and expenses that a licensed moneylender may impose in respect of every loan granted by him. Any amount other than or in excess of the permitted fees will be unenforceable and may be recovered by the borrower, as a debt or by way of set off against the loan and any interest, late interest and permitted fees payable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on enhancing the regulatory framework and enforcement tools, clause 25 gives the Registrar or an officer authorised by him the power to enter premises used or believed to be used by a moneylender to carry on business in order to inspect the premises and any book, record or other document found on the <p align=left>Column: 1006</p>premises. The moneylender will also be required to provide to the officer information or documents.&nbsp; Clause 5(4) empowers the Registrar to issue a licence with conditions and clause 26 empowers him to issue directions to a moneylender, whether licensed or exempt under the Bill, for the carrying out of the provisions of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 37 empowers the Minister to make rules for the purposes of the Bill, which may apply to any moneylender, whether licensed or exempted under the Bill.&nbsp; The rules may be general or relate to specific classes or descriptions of moneylenders, and may make different provisions for different classes or descriptions of moneylenders. Clause 23 gives the Minister the discretion to prescribe the maximum rate of interest that a licensed moneylender may charge for any loan granted. To that end, the Minister intends to prescribe rules to retain the existing interest rate caps for personal loans of $3,000 and below so as to give some protection to borrowers with small or no income.&nbsp; At the same time, for other cases where the rules do not apply, clause 23 authorises a court to re-open a moneylending transaction and give the borrower relief where the interest is excessive and the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Tackling loansharks</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, the Act introduces two further measures to counter loansharking, strengthening the slew of measures we have already put in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is this. Currently, persons who are convicted under section 33 of the Act for harassment activities which result in property damage or persons being hurt are liable to be caned.&nbsp; In contrast, the instigators of such harassment activities are not liable for caning under that section. Clause 28 re-enacts section 33, but extends the <p align=left>Column: 1007</p>punishment of caning to those who instigate or direct the harasser to commit the acts of harassment. There is no reason why those higher up the hierarchy of a loansharking syndicate should not also be similarly punished for the despicable acts of those they use to carry out their directions. They are equally, if not, more culpable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second measure is to extend the existing presumption in section 35C, whereby a person whose bank account or ATM card is used to collect debts by an unlicensed moneylender is presumed to have assisted in the conduct of the business of the unlicensed moneylender.&nbsp; Clause 14 will extend the current presumption to cover a situation where telecommunications services such as a handphone or pager line are so used. This is intended to disrupt the infrastructure of loansharking syndicates, thereby hampering their attempts to evade detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although I support the Bill, I have concerns. This Bill comes at a time when our economy is rapidly slowing down and a tight credit crunch is imminent. There will be much more moneylending activities, both legal and illegal.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill will remove restrictions on moneylenders operating from only one location, and moneylenders can now advertise.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned that this relaxation will signal that moneylending activities are now decontrolled. Small-time borrowers, who always rely on the Government to control moneylenders, may then become complacent and enter into such transactions under a false sense of security.&nbsp; Moneylenders or their agents <p align=left>Column: 1008</p>may think likewise and encourage borrowers to seal the deal. It becomes just like the financial products sold by financial institutions which have shown how vulnerable people are when it comes to money sense.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the safeguards requiring the moneylender to give the borrower or his agent a written notice of the terms and conditions which the borrower or his agent must sign and acknowledge, the difficulty is whether to allow the borrower or his agent to repudiate the acknowledgment when they claim that they were not given a chance to read or understand the terms and conditions but that they were forced to sign the acknowledgment, otherwise no loan would be granted. The proposed new rules on unsecured personal loans to the public, applicable to moneylenders, must safeguard our people from the curse of mounting debts.&nbsp; Even as interest rate caps will only be prescribed on personal loans up to a stipulated amount, there must be even more pro-active measures to protect and safeguard the interest of the vulnerable low-income, low-education group and the elderly.&nbsp; They need the financial help and the loan, but they also need financial education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Bill, all moneylenders who grant secured and unsecured loans to the public will be licensed and regulated. Arising from this&nbsp;approach, exempt moneylenders who currently operate under an exemption to grant personal loans will be licensed and regulated.&nbsp; This is a positive step forward to ensure that such institutions are well regulated and do not ultimately affect our social compact and fabric.&nbsp; As such, I urge&nbsp;the authorities keep close tabs on the lending activities of these institutions, investigate and rein them in as soon as complaints of fraudulent or malpractice&nbsp;are reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to touch on the pervading issue of illegal harassment by loansharks.&nbsp; At the last sitting on 21st October 2008, DPM Wong Kan Seng replied in writing to <p align=left>Column: 1009</p>a question from my parliamentary colleague, Mr Lim Biow Chuan.&nbsp; He mentioned that the number of illegal loanshark harassment cases is on the decline.&nbsp; Police have also taken proactive measures to tackle the problem on the ground.&nbsp; DPM Wong explained that whilst some progress is made, the problem of illegal money lending is not easy to solve.&nbsp; Loansharks evolve their <I>modus operandi</I> to elude detection and arrest, and syndicates are difficult to break down.&nbsp; He admitted that breaking down the entire organisation is a painstaking and laborious process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sincerely hope the amendments will arm the law enforcement agencies with added muscle to deal with&nbsp; the harassment.&nbsp; On my house-to-house visits, I have met some new owners of resale HDB flats and their neighbours who have been victimised by the loansharks&rsquo; runners. These innocent residents&rsquo; mental torture, their fear for the safety of their young, women and elderly alone at home and the attendant sense of helplessness are very heart-wrenching. They must not be made to suffer the default of the irresponsible borrowers by bearing the indignity of having acrylic paint splashed on their doors and windows, and graffiti in the lifts and common corridors shaming the innocent occupants of the unit and their neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;These unfortunate victims and I are heartened that tougher punishments, including caning, will be introduced to send a deterrent signal to illegal loansharks who think and behave as if they are above the law because they have succeeded in evading arrests by using runners.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the Police, with the help of the community, can continuously monitor the situation and respond quickly enough to curb illegal loansharks&rsquo; harassment tactics.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><span class=\"iw-formspub-field-label\" id=\"dcrLabel\" title=\"H20081118_18_01_KohBB\" style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 4px\"></span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Police presence at the scene&nbsp;is reassuring to these victims that the police are taking their complaints seriously and police advice on how to protect the victims against recurrence of the harassment <p align=left>Column: 1010</p>tactics would go a long way to deliver the message that the Police do care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in&nbsp;support of the Bill.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us would have heard of some \"horror\" stories pertaining to illegal moneylending and loan sharks' activities, example, spray painting of indecent words, snipe remarks and threats of all forms, including to life and limb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is indeed timely and necessary especially in the face of the global credit crunch that we are facing today.&nbsp; It serves as a social legislation as it will help to put checks and balances in place to safeguard borrowers from unscrupulous moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. It will also bring the business practices in line with the&nbsp;market practices of established financial institutions.<br>\r\n&nbsp;.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir , I have some observations and a few issues to raise:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, this Bill helps to define the term \"moneylender\" clearly.&nbsp; It excludes persons licensed, approved and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, persons who grant staff loans and corporation loans. These persons are governed by the Securities and Futures Act and this definition is important as it prevents misperception, in particular when it comes to substituting the term with more colloquial&nbsp; ones.&nbsp; Moreover, when dealing with the law, these definitions would&nbsp;certainly have to be very clear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also am in support of the stiffer penalties, which is hoped to be a deterrence.&nbsp; I also note the allowances made for&nbsp; flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1011</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clarification on&nbsp; section 5(5)C: a deposit of&nbsp; $20,000 for each place of business to be licensed&nbsp;&ndash; does this mean that&nbsp;if a person has a current existing moneylending business and he hopes to open up a new one after this Bill is passed in Parliament,&nbsp; he would&nbsp; then have to pay $20,000 each&nbsp; for both the existing as well as the new premises?&nbsp; Will the owners be exempted from this payment for the existing businesses or shops, which may have already been given prior licence before this Bill is passed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13: Publication of Lists -&nbsp;I support this move as it will provide a&nbsp;useful list of&nbsp;information for the public utilising the service.&nbsp; Of course regular interval updates will be relevant, and I would like to ask the Minister if&nbsp;the listing will be electronic or in the form of&nbsp; a hard copy register.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the use of advertising and marketing, with the more relaxed criteria that we are going to have now, I would like to suggest that the authorities come up with&nbsp;some guidelines or recommendations on the acceptable range of interest. This will certainly&nbsp;be useful to safeguard consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 21: On the required statements of accounts, loan documents and receipts, can I suggest the Ministry come up with a framework for submission&nbsp;and thus achieve standardisation of the submitted data?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 25: Pertaining to the Power to inspect&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I also would like to&nbsp;suggest that this should be done without prior information and warning, especially as we realise the potential for abuse&nbsp;and chances of \"sliding down the slippery slope\"&nbsp;with such businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 26(2): General Power to issue directions and&nbsp;service guide to assist <p align=left>Column: 1012</p>moneylenders on the process of documentation, preparation of cautionary statements, drawing up of agreements and other relevant paperwork&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;perhaps the Ministry can even consider a startup course or workshop, which may be made a prerequisite for those applying for new licences. This can serve as a platform to share and ensure understanding of the rules, especially those stipulated in section 37.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Moneylenders Bill will certainly enhance the licensing and regulation of moneylenders providing all forms of services and loans to the public. It will serve to keep a check on the industry through the&nbsp; robust licensing and regulatory regime but, at the same time, relax certain current controls to facilitate the business in&nbsp;a modern credit economy.&nbsp; Let us hope that the very colourful moneylending business we have here achieves a more regulated approach with greater respect for all concerned.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Mr Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I thank Ms Ellen Lee and Dr Fatimah Lateef&nbsp; for speaking in support of the Bill.&nbsp; They have concerns and queries which I will now address.&nbsp; Firstly, they focus on the impact these amendments will have on the moneylending industry as a whole; secondly, the proper regulating of moneylenders; thirdly, ensuring that borrowers would not be taken advantage of; and fourthly, our fight against illegal moneylending or loanshark activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Fatimah also has got some specific queries on the provisions themselves.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee is concerned that with these amendments, more people may let their guard down and borrow, perhaps, blindly from moneylenders.&nbsp; Sir, I do not expect this to happen as there are checks in place, which I will set out later.&nbsp; But, first, let me say that we should remember that people with no or low income will at certain points in time need cash quickly to meet an urgent and a genuine need.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 1013</p>other words, they too will need access to credit.&nbsp; Banks are not likely to lend to them.&nbsp; So&nbsp;some turn to moneylenders; others to pawnbrokers, others maybe to relatives and friends and, indeed, unfortunately, some also turn to unlicensed moneylenders or loansharks.&nbsp; Now, these amendments will help these people.&nbsp; Indeed, it is my hope that by establishing the moneylending industry in a modern setting, less people will resort to borrowing from loansharks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, another point is that with the global credit crunch and economic uncertainty, moneylenders will be more risk-averse and cautious in their lending.&nbsp; Any increase and demand for loans from members of the public will therefore not necessarily be matched&nbsp;by an increase in supply of loans from licensed moneylenders.&nbsp; In other words, the prudent approach in lending on the part of licensed moneylenders, which is now already the case, will likely&nbsp;continue. What is important is that the borrowers must correspondingly exercise discipline in borrowing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, even with the relaxation on advertising and locations, let us be clear,&nbsp;I think Ms Lee said whether this may lead to perception that we are decontrolling the industry.&nbsp; This is not the case.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the relaxation on advertisements, there will still be restrictions.&nbsp; As I have said, the Registrar of Moneylenders would issue directions against advertisements and marketing materials which are false or misleading or which induce the public to borrow money for inappropriate purposes or to induce them&nbsp;using unethical or unscrupulous methods.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;to set out the rules and empower the Registrar to do more in this area.&nbsp; Indeed, in the Bill itself, as I mentioned in my speech, there would be&nbsp;provisions to prohibit moneylenders from publishing any marketing or advertising materials which are false or misleading.&nbsp; So I think this should address <p align=left>Column: 1014</p>both Ms Lee and Dr Fatimah's concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, Sir, notwithstanding this opening up on&nbsp;advertisements, I do not expect that the smaller and more traditional moneylenders will want or need to advertise widely, as my understanding is that the business is generated mainly through word of mouth introductions.&nbsp; They take a conservative approach because they lend their own money.&nbsp; There may be the bigger ones who want to tap this modern setting and&nbsp;may want to advertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the Registry of Moneylenders (ROM) will monitor how this is carried out.&nbsp; So, how the advertisements are cast, I think that is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On whether occasions will proliferate, whilst moneylenders will be able to set up branches, each branch will require a fresh deposit of $20,000.&nbsp; That is a new requirement under the Bill.&nbsp; This is a query&nbsp;Dr Fatimah has.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, every place of business has to be approved by the Registrar.&nbsp; Hence, whilst there is some freeing up, it is not without restraints.&nbsp; As for existing moneylenders, they would only have to place a deposit which may take the form of a banker's guarantee when they next renew their licence.&nbsp; I think that is the point that Dr&nbsp;Fatimah made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to the next&nbsp;point, which is that the Registrar's powers have indeed been enhanced under the Act in other ways to ensure that licensed moneylenders conduct their business in a proper manner and also to safeguard borrowers' interest.&nbsp; So this should assure Ms Lee, who urges that the authorities keep close tabs on the lending activities of moneylenders.&nbsp; Indeed, as Dr&nbsp;Fatimah suggests, ROM officers can inspect the moneylenders' premises at any time without any prior notice or warning and, overall, as I have said, sentences for offences committed by licensed moneylenders have been revised upwards and brought up to date.&nbsp; So, in that sense, the <p align=left>Column: 1015</p>Registrar will have greater powers to ensure that all lending is done properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, also, there were concerns&nbsp;raised as to whether unwary borrowers would be taken advantage of.&nbsp; Well, as I have said in&nbsp;my speech, affording protection to borrowers is a key consideration of this Bill.&nbsp; I had mentioned some safeguards already in my speech which include upfront disclosure of the terms and conditions of the loan and also an issuance of a note of contract to the borrower, which is explained to him in a language that he understands.&nbsp; In fact, the note of contract will contain an advisory to the borrower&nbsp;that he is not to sign the note if the entries are not properly filled in and to repay the loan promptly in order to avoid incurring additional&nbsp;charges.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Registrar intends to require moneylenders to ask the borrower in a loan application form whether he has existing loans from other moneylenders, banks or other financial institutions.&nbsp; This would act as a check against borrowers over-extending themselves by taking multiple loans from different moneylenders and, on top of all these safeguards, moneylenders would also be prohibited from granting unsolicited loans.&nbsp; All these requirements will help ensure that the transactions between borrower and lender are properly entered into.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dr Fatimah's suggestion to set out an acceptable range of interest, let me reassure her that borrowers of small amounts, like I have said, will continue to be protected&nbsp;as there will be an interest rate cap, which will be the current one, 18% per annum for&nbsp;loans $3,000 and below.&nbsp; Now, interest rates for loans above&nbsp;$3,000 will be lifted, which is a practice in line with the market.&nbsp; So, like other financial institutions, I think we should let the market decide what is the <p align=left>Column: 1016</p>appropriate interest rate for these higher value loans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these amendments will put the moneylending industry on a firmer footing, ensuring that moneylenders conduct themselves in a fair and transparent manner.&nbsp; But I think the point to note is that borrowers themselves have to act responsibly.&nbsp; First of all, they should not give a chance to loansharks to ruin their lives by borrowing from them.&nbsp; I hope that these amendments would tip the balance for some of them to borrow from licensed moneylenders, instead of turning to loansharks.&nbsp; Secondly, if they really need to borrow money, they should not overstretch themselves in doing so.&nbsp; Thirdly, when they do so, they should seek clarification if they do not understand the terms and conditions of the loan.&nbsp; And, finally, they should make every effort to repay their loan.&nbsp; So the point is, whilst lenders must exercise prudence and responsibility in lending, borrowers should exercise discipline and restraint in borrowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this would put the relationship on the best balance.&nbsp;To further ensure prudent borrowing,&nbsp;MinLaw has been working, in consultation with MAS, to formulate rules that would provide that moneylenders who grant unsecured loans in excess of $3,000, do so only to persons who have sufficient means to repay them and to limit the quantum of the loan which they may extend, based on the borrower's income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now deal quickly with the remaining points that have been raised.&nbsp; I think Dr&nbsp;Fatimah makes an interesting suggestion that moneylenders be given assistance on documentation processes, ie, paper work; indeed, suggesting even a startup course for new moneylenders.&nbsp; Well, she will be happy to know that currently, ROM already briefs all newly-licensed moneylenders&nbsp;on their duties and responsibilities, including key provisions&nbsp;of the Moneylenders Act and also on the proper completion of the returns to ROM.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1017</p>In addition,&nbsp;ROM has been in touch with the Moneylenders Association to see if the Association can conduct courses to help moneylenders acquire skills on modern credit management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Fatimah asked how the list of licensed moneylenders would be published.&nbsp; This is actually already currently done.&nbsp; The Registry of Moneylenders&nbsp;publishes a list of licensed moneylenders in the <I>Gazette</I> as well as on its website.&nbsp; ROM will continue with this practice to facilitate easy public access and also the giving of information to those who may want to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;point that Ms Lee makes is public education.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;important.&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;continue to do that.&nbsp; Some have been done currently by MoneySense, a national programme that gives talks and issues&nbsp;materials, but I think more can certainly be done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Minister's power to prescribe different classes of licences as well as make rules to exempt classes of persons&nbsp;from the Act&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a query Dr&nbsp;Fatimah has&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;these are new provisions not found in the Act currently.&nbsp; We have inserted them to provide flexibility for future, not immediate use.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Similarly, whilst the Minister may make rules exempting different classes of persons from the Act, there are no immediate plans to do this.&nbsp; As I said, the&nbsp;power to&nbsp;exempt under the new regime is essentially a residual one.&nbsp; Over time, the Registrar will review the types of moneylenders who apply for specific exemption and evaluate whether there is a need to grant class exemptions.&nbsp; One of the advantages of class exemption is the person exempted will no longer need to apply for exemption every three years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, let me say something on loansharking, on which both Dr Fatimah and Ms Lee have expressed concerns.&nbsp; I want to thank Ms Lee for supporting the <p align=left>Column: 1018</p>proposal to extend caning to loansharks who use others to carry out harassment&nbsp;acts.&nbsp; It will remove the shield&nbsp;the loansharks have been using to carry out their clandestine activities.&nbsp; This addresses a key issue in tackling loansharking, that is, hitting at the core of the problem&nbsp;&ndash; the loansharks themselves.&nbsp; This amendment and the other one on expanding the presumption clause to cover use of handphones and pagers will strengthen the existing arsenal of weapons that was introduced since 2005 to counter the loansharking scourge.&nbsp; In this regard, penalties have been enhanced, loansharks have been detained under the Criminal Law Temporary Provisions Act,&nbsp;assets&nbsp;of the&nbsp;convicted loansharks confiscated and passports&nbsp;of loansharks cancelled.&nbsp; We also work with partners, such as HDB and SingPost, to tighten the procedures, deterring&nbsp;opportunities for exploitation by loansharks as well as the procedures for changing the address on one's identity card.&nbsp; So, we will press on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On our part, Police has kept up the pressure on loansharks through painstaking investigations, intelligence gathering and ground operations, as well as national level&nbsp;operations against syndicates.&nbsp; While the situation has shown some improvement, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and, if necessary, we will introduce further measures to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me reiterate the point I made earlier in this House, which is that loansharking in general and harassment in particular are crimes that are not easy to solve.&nbsp; I know that Police presence is reassuring&nbsp;&ndash; I think Ms Lee makes that point&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but by themselves they will not overcome this scourge.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;she points to one avenue that I think&nbsp;we can do more on, which is getting the community involved.&nbsp; So CSSP programme&nbsp;&ndash; maybe installing CCTVs&nbsp;&ndash; being the eyes and ears of Police on the ground, forming Neighbourhood Watch Groups targeted&nbsp;for <p align=left>Column: 1019</p>neighbours to&nbsp;help each other to detect and to deter loansharks would be helpful.&nbsp; I think everybody can play&nbsp;a part but, on MHA's part, on my part, we will continue to monitor as we have been doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been taking PQs on this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see whether working together we can improve the ground situation especially for our residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Ms Lee talks about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have&nbsp;residents who suffer like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think the authorities and the community&nbsp;can all work together to do more.&nbsp; But let us also monitor the impact of these amendments because, like I have said, these amendments, hopefully, will help divert some people who may turn to illegal loansharks, to turn to licensed moneylenders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered the key points raised.&nbsp; I thank both Ms Lee and Dr Fatimah&nbsp;for sharing their thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Moneylenders will certainly monitor the out-working&nbsp;of this new moneylending regime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is because the current definition of \"borrower\" includes a surety for purposes of handing to the borrower a note of the contract for the loan, that is to say, not only will the borrower receive a copy of this note, a contract, a surety, if any, will also be given this note.&nbsp; This is, as it should be, as a surety has an interest, indeed every right, in knowing what the terms of the loan/contract are.&nbsp; So, these further amendments will ensure that this is the case.&nbsp; In the same vein, these further amendments will ensure that other than the borrower, if the surety does not understand English, the terms will also be explained to him.&nbsp; Again, this will accord the same level of protection to a surety as is accorded to the borrower.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1021</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Environment Agency (NEA) regulates noise from construction sites through the Environmental Protection and Management (Control of Noise at Construction Sites) Regulations. Under the Regulations, maximum allowable noise limits for construction sites are prescribed for different time periods of the day and for different types of premises affected by the construction noise.&nbsp; For example, the night-time noise limits are stricter than the day-time noise limits, and the allowable noise level is also stricter for construction sites near to schools and hospitals.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of complaints on construction noise received by the NEA has increased from 6,160 in 2006 to 9,228 in 2007.&nbsp; For the first&nbsp;10 months of this year, 11,327 complaints were received.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons for this increase, as Dr Lam has pointed out, could be the corresponding increase in construction activity in Singapore. For instance, the number of construction sites increased from about 5,000 in 2006 to about 6,100 in 2007*.&nbsp; Another factor could be higher expectations from our public for a quieter environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet these expectations and ensure that construction activity does not unduly affect the quality of life in Singapore, NEA had in October 2007 further tightened the permissible construction noise limits during night-time and on Sundays and public holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that its regulatory controls continue to be an effective deterrent, NEA has increased the maximum fine for construction noise violations from $20,000 to $40,000 with effect from October 2007.&nbsp; NEA also takes action against errant contractors that repeatedly violate the permissible noise limits, by issuing work restriction orders to restrict the operation hours at their construction sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that NEA investigates all complaints against construction noise. Members of the public can call the NEA hotline at 1800-CALL-NEA (1800-2255-632) at any time. After a complaint is received, NEA will send officers down to the construction site to investigate the complaint, and will inform the complainant of NEA&rsquo;s findings. Contractors found to have exceeded the noise limits will be fined, with work restriction orders imposed on recalcitrant offenders. Where the noise levels are found to be within the regulated limits, NEA would still advise the contractors to limit their activities during noise-sensitive periods. For example during school examination periods, NEA would advise contractors to liaise with the nearby schools and limit their construction work during the examination period, where possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1025</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a highly urbanised and compact city with vibrant economic activities, and noise pollution cannot be eradicated completely. My Ministry and NEA will continue to work with the relevant agencies and industry stakeholders to regularly review the regulatory framework for construction noise, taking into account public concerns and feedback, and also international best practices.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>* The number of construction sites was 5,023 in 2006 and 6,098 in 2007.</p>\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:FINES ON BUS OPERATORS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:FINES ON BUS OPERATORS:::1026-->\r\n</B>\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 1025</p><b><P>FINES ON BUS OPERATORS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Objectives and adequacy of quanta-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Objectives and adequacy of quanta)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Siew Kum Hong </B>asked the Minister for Transport what is the objective of fines imposed by the Public Transport Council on bus operators for non-compliance with Quality of Service standards and whether the quanta are adequate.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October 2007, the Public Transport Council (PTC) has put in place a penalty framework to enforce its set of Quality of Service (QoS) standards for basic bus services. The penalty framework sends a strong and clear signal to the operators that they should consistently strive to do better than what the QoS standards stipulate.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalties vary with the nature of non-compliance. Broadly, an operator could fail to comply either at the level of an individual bus service, for example, services that are overcrowded, or at the level of its entire bus operation, for example accident rate and bus breakdown rate. Penalties range from $100 per day for each non-compliant bus service in the former, to $10,000 per month for each non-compliant standard in the latter. Given that there are about 260 basic bus services, the financial penalties for non-compliance can add up to a significant sum if the operators are not vigilant in their operations.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the PTC&rsquo;s recent assessment of the operators&rsquo; performance from December 2007 to May 2008, the bus operators largely met the QoS standards set but also had some instances of non-compliance. These include non-compliance with standards, such as scheduled trips operated, adherence to scheduled headways and passenger loading. As a result, financial penalties of $9,300 and $1,000 were imposed on SBS Transit and SMRT Buses respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But such instances of non-compliance do not just penalise the operators financially. As Mr Cedric Foo had noted in a report in the <I>Straits Times</I>, the operators \"carry a reputation risk in not meeting the standards\". He highlighted an important aspect of the penalty framework, which is the signalling and reputation effect, which goes beyond the direct cost of financial penalties. In this regard, I note that SBST had earlier said it was \"sorry and disappointed\" over its instance of non-compliance in the latest QoS assessment, and that it will step up efforts to improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus operators are purchasing more buses, as well as accelerating the recruitment and training of bus drivers. Regular commuters on public transport would have noticed the newer buses already plying our roads.&nbsp; Such efforts by the operators show that the penalty framework helps in inducing the operators to enhance their operations to comply with the QoS standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, the PTC will review the penalty framework as and when necessary to ensure that it remains effective.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
