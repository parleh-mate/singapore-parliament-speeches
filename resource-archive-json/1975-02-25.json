It is a  relief  to  note  that,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  prevailing world-wide  inflation  coupled\r\n\r\nwith  economic recession, we have managed to achieve  a\r\n\r\nreal growth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrate  of  about 7%. It is also reassuring to note  from\r\n\r\nthe  President's  speech  the  cautious  optimism  that\r\n\r\n\"Singapore  is likely to reverse the downtrend  in  her\r\n\r\neconomy\"  with  the prospect that we will  probably  do\r\n\r\nbetter  by  the  later  part of  this  year  than  now,\r\n\r\nprovided there is no major unexpected catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe our present well-being to our decisive will to\r\n\r\nsucceed  and hard work. It is with the able leadership,\r\n\r\nimaginative  policies  and  tough  measures  that   our\r\n\r\nGovernment has been able to- minimise our economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial   dislocations  under  the   current   recessive\r\n\r\nclimate.  Although economic growth by itself  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  generate happiness all round, the  absence\r\n\r\nof   such   growth   will   undoubtedly   create   much\r\n\r\nunhappiness.  More  hard work, unpopular  policies  and\r\n\r\ntough  measures there shall be for the continued  well-being of our society for generations to come. There  is\r\n\r\nno  question  of any of this Government's policies  and\r\n\r\nmeasures   being   swayed   by   short-term   political\r\n\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new challenges and problems ahead of us, as\r\n\r\npointed  out in the Addendum to the President's speech;\r\n\r\nand to quote the President, \"there will be much to keep\r\n\r\nHonourable  Members busy in 1975.\" One of the  pressing\r\n\r\nproblems   generated   by   our   rapid   progress   of\r\n\r\nurbanisation  and industrialisation is  that  of  urban\r\n\r\ntransportation,  in particular, peak  hour  travelling.\r\n\r\nThe  daily  traffic congestion has caused  much  social\r\n\r\nfrustration,  unnecessary  fuel  expenditure   and   an\r\n\r\nadverse  effect on business activities in  the  central\r\n\r\nbusiness  district due to a lower degree  of  mobility.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no easy and simple solution to overcome  the\r\n\r\ncomplex  problem  of  urban  transportation  which  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a major concern of all metropolitan and  public\r\n\r\npolicy  in  this  century.  The  Government  will  soon\r\n\r\nintroduce harsh traffic management measures such as the\r\n\r\npark  and  ride,  city shuttle bus and  area  licensing\r\n\r\nschemes    to    relieve   traffic   congestion.    The\r\n\r\ncomprehensive scheme with unpopular management\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmeasures, though not a new idea, is attracting  much\r\n\r\ninternational attention because few governments in  the\r\n\r\nso-called  free-world have dared to venture  into  such\r\n\r\nunpopularity     due     to    short-term     political\r\n\r\nconsiderations. Our bus service is improving,  but  the\r\n\r\nstandard   is   still   far  from   satisfactory.   The\r\n\r\nintroduction of the park and ride scheme will no  doubt\r\n\r\nrelieve  the traffic congestion in the central business\r\n\r\ndistrict. However, careful regulation or adjustment may\r\n\r\nbe  necessary to maintain a balanced set of  management\r\n\r\nmeasures to ensure, among other things, that the scheme\r\n\r\nwould  not  unnecessarily  attract  the  normal  public\r\n\r\ntransport  riders  to  opt  for  the  park   and   ride\r\n\r\nalternative,  in  which  case,  a  shift   of   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  from the central business district  to  the\r\n\r\nouter urban areas may result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another growing concern is the increasing crime rate\r\n\r\nand   the   insufficiently  staffed  police  force   as\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  the President. Although the introduction\r\n\r\nof  full-time national servicemen for the police  force\r\n\r\nwill  lessen  the  problem of  manpower  shortage,  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of our police force will depend  more  on\r\n\r\nthe  quality and maturity of the personnel  than  sheer\r\n\r\nnumbers.  It  is  imperative  to  stress  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncarefully  train our selected young national servicemen\r\n\r\nfor  police  duty. In the course of their active  duty,\r\n\r\ntheir contact with the public is unavoidable, and their\r\n\r\nability  and  tact  in handling human  situations  will\r\n\r\ndetermine  the goodwill or ill-will between the  public\r\n\r\nand the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is without doubt, to quote the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech, that \"The Police will require  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the public to be fully effective.\" As it is,\r\n\r\nthe  degree of mutual trust and cooperation between the\r\n\r\npublic  and  the police leaves much to be  desired.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt  severe  punishment must  be  meted  out  to  law\r\n\r\noffenders, but more severe punishment should  be  meted\r\n\r\nout  to the law enforcement officers who flout the  law\r\n\r\nif we are to make Singapore a safe and orderly place to\r\n\r\nlive  in. The current world economic situation has made\r\n\r\nit  very  clear  that the economic  well-being  of  any\r\n\r\ncountry depends more than ever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nbefore  on the well-being of other countries.  The\r\n\r\nreality   of   interdependence  is   obvious   and\r\n\r\nimmediate,  and  it is in this  direction,  as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be,  that the Addendum on the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  has stressed the  importance  of\r\n\r\ncooperation with our South-East Asian countries to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our common interests and  the  need  to\r\n\r\nencourage  increased  trade  with  West  Asia  and\r\n\r\nEastern  Europe. But interdependence  goes  beyond\r\n\r\neconomics to the question of food, population  and\r\n\r\njurisdiction over the seas, all of which requiring\r\n\r\nurgent attention but none of which could be solved\r\n\r\nby any nation acting alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of international goodwill as an\r\n\r\noverture  to  greater  cooperation  and  increased\r\n\r\ntrade cannot be over-emphasised if we are to truly\r\n\r\nestablish  Singapore  as  a  \"Global  City\".   Our\r\n\r\ntraders   and  those  who  have  active   business\r\n\r\ndealings with our neighbouring countries should be\r\n\r\nmade  to  realise  this, and  I  would  urge  them\r\n\r\nwherever  possible to avoid sacrificing our  long-term  international  goodwill  for  any  immediate\r\n\r\ntrading gain. Our traders should be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nconduct \"fair trade\" not only intra-nationally but\r\n\r\nalso  internationally if this tiny  City-state  of\r\n\r\nours  is  to continue to thrive under the  \"Global\r\n\r\nCity\" concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support without any\r\n\r\nreservation the Presidential address delivered  at\r\n\r\nthe  opening  of the Second Session of  the  Third\r\n\r\nParliament on 21st February, 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his address, the President pointed out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The primary duty of government is to establish a\r\n\r\nsociety  in which everyone has an equal chance  to\r\n\r\nlive,  learn, train, work and earn to the best  of\r\n\r\nhis or her ability.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  my  opinion,  this is one of the  most  urgent\r\n\r\ntasks of nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of national service following\r\n\r\nour independence has success\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfully  imbued in our youths with a sense of  self-reliance and patriotism. Our participation in  the\r\n\r\nfive-nation  defence pact and the  ASEAN  regional\r\n\r\norganisation  has contributed towards  a  peaceful\r\n\r\nand  stable  South-East Asia. In  the  foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture, I believe the ASEAN members would be  able\r\n\r\nto  continue sharing prosperity in a harmonius  co\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we in Singapore have seen an increase\r\n\r\nin  the crime rate. These unlawful activities  are\r\n\r\ncausing   a  problem  to  our  effort  in  nation-building. It is like an ugly shadow cast over  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  Unless we reduce the crime rate  to  the\r\n\r\nminimum, we would not be able to escape from being\r\n\r\nlabelled \"a paradise for criminals\", especially at\r\n\r\na time when we arc making progress in economic and\r\n\r\nother fields. As a result of a rising incidence of\r\n\r\nrobbery,  rape  and murder, kidnapping  and  drug-trafficking,  the middle income and  upper  income\r\n\r\ngroups  are exposed to threats, and not only  that\r\n\r\nbut  the safety of housewives in the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup is also threatened while they go to work  or\r\n\r\nshopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was the campaign last year to\r\n\r\nfight  crime  and  delinquency  organised  by  the\r\n\r\ndepartment responsible for the maintenance of  law\r\n\r\nand  order, my personal feeling of the results  is\r\n\r\nthat more publicity had been given to the campaign\r\n\r\nthan  the actual achievement of its objective.  As\r\n\r\ncompared with the \"Keep Singapore Clean and Green\"\r\n\r\ncampaign  in  1969, this Crime Free campaign  paid\r\n\r\nmore  attention to publicity and it has  become  a\r\n\r\nfashionable gimmick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the fact that acute shortage of\r\n\r\npolice  manpower  has  to  a large  extent  contributed\r\n\r\nto   these   unlawful  activities.  It   is   therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  consider  heavier  penalties   for   the\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  anti-social  elements.  I  fully  support\r\n\r\nthe  President's  statement  in  this  respect,  and  I\r\n\r\nsincerely  hope  that  the  officers  responsible   for\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order  well understand the  rationale  behind\r\n\r\nthe   imposition   of   heavier   penalties,   and   to\r\n\r\nexercise  their  authority to maintain  law  and  order\r\n\r\nin our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my feeling that the existence of crime in\r\n\r\nour  society  has  its root in  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  Families with a large number of  children\r\n\r\ngenerally  have  not been able  to  provide  their\r\n\r\nchildren with the good things in life, despite the\r\n\r\nsweat and toil of parents throughout their unhappy\r\n\r\nlives.  In  such an environment where parents  are\r\n\r\naway   at  work,  children  fail  to  learn  their\r\n\r\npositive  role  in the society. And  children  are\r\n\r\nvery susceptible to bad influences. In the company\r\n\r\nof   anti-social  elements  they   easily   become\r\n\r\ndelinquents.  There is no doubt that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  extend our sympathy to these unfortunate\r\n\r\nstrays. They must be properly guided to a sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  that is expected  of  them  in  an\r\n\r\norderly and healthy society. Sympathy and guidance\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding,  we must be firm  and  deal  with\r\n\r\nthem severely if they continue to defy the law and\r\n\r\nattempt to create disorder in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am also in full agreement with the\r\n\r\nPresident's statement on the need to further lower\r\n\r\nour  birth  rate  and to adhere to  the  two-child\r\n\r\nconcept. We must completely eradicate the obsolete\r\n\r\nconcept  of the different values attached to  male\r\n\r\noffsprings  and female offsprings and  to  promote\r\n\r\nthe  concept that boy or girl, two is enough. What\r\n\r\nis  important is to instill in parents the need to\r\n\r\nbring   up   quality   children   in   a   happier\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the need to revolutionize our concept\r\n\r\nof male offsprings and their values, there is also\r\n\r\na  point worthy of consideration. Perhaps to drive\r\n\r\nhome  the  point that females do not lose  out  to\r\n\r\nmales in an equal and just society, job preference\r\n\r\nmay  be  given to female applicants from  families\r\n\r\nwithout  male  siblings, provided such  applicants\r\n\r\npossess   equal  qualification  and   ability   as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  male applicants.  In  this  way\r\n\r\nparents  without male offspring might think  again\r\n\r\nbefore  enlarging  their  family  only  with   the\r\n\r\npurpose of ensuring that there is someone to carry\r\n\r\non their name.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I strongly suggest that on the one\r\n\r\nhand,  we  should  enlist  the  help  of  law   to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  the  tendency  to  rely  on  luck  and\r\n\r\ngamble;   on   the  other  hand,  we  must   adopt\r\n\r\nenlightening  incentives to upgrade human  quality\r\n\r\nso  that  every  citizen will lead a contributing,\r\n\r\nself-disciplined and meaningful life in a fair and\r\n\r\nstable society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  speak in full support on the  Motion  of\r\n\r\nThanks  to the President as moved by my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kim Keat. In moving the Motion,  he\r\n\r\nmentioned that the President in his address at the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the  Second  Session  of  this  Third\r\n\r\nParliament  on 21st February, 1975  stated  in  no\r\n\r\nuncertain terms that \"there will be much  to  keep\r\n\r\nHonourable Members busy in 1975.\" In this respect,\r\n\r\nthe President posed several problems to which Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers \"will have to tackle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many Backbenchers will be speaking on this\r\n\r\nMotion,  I  shall confine myself  to  those  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am more interested in. I am particularly\r\n\r\nexuberant  with happiness over the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident stated that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government will take measures to make it more\r\n\r\nattractive for young couples to have their parents\r\n\r\nlive  with them.

Indeed,  Confucius has  elevated  this  into\r\n\r\na   basic  ethical  principle,  and  Chinese  classical\r\n\r\nliterature  is  replete  with examples  of  outstanding\r\n\r\nacts  of  filial  piety.  In  these  circumstances   it\r\n\r\nwould  be  unworthy  of us to introduce  mercenary  con\r\n\r\nsiderations   such   as  relief   from   income   tax.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the Minister continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if this approach does not appeal to the hon. Member,\r\n\r\nmay   I   add   a  less  traditionalist  argument?   An\r\n\r\nInternational  Monetary  Fund  mission   has   recently\r\n\r\nexamined  our  tax system and has stated that  our  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs  are  overgenerous and could with advantage  be\r\n\r\nreduced.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to the Hon. Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  Minister  of  Defence, I chose  not  to  press  on\r\n\r\npersistently as economics is his homeground.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nhe  was  in  charge of our country's coffers then!  But\r\n\r\ndeep  down in my heart, I had hoped that the day  would\r\n\r\ncome when this matter would again be raised. However, I\r\n\r\ntried to appeal to the Finance Minister again this time\r\n\r\nby  the  so-called \"hook\" method. On 26th March, 1971\r\n\r\n[Vol.  30,  col. 1360], I sought exemption for  persons\r\n\r\nearning  $6,000  per  annum or  less.  Ironically,  our\r\n\r\npresent  Deputy Speaker, who was then the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState for Finance, stated that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the burden of income tax in Singapore is low because\r\n\r\nof  the  generous  personal reliefs and  the  graduated\r\n\r\nrates of tax.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on to say that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Under the Income Tax Ordinance a taxpayer is allowed\r\n\r\npersonal relief of $2,000 plus an earned income  relief\r\n\r\nof  1/5th  of his earned income up to a maximum  of\r\n\r\n$1,000. A relief of $1,000 is given in respect  of  his\r\n\r\nwife, $750 in respect of his first child, $500 each for\r\n\r\nthe second and third child . .` etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on 26th February, 1973 [Vol. 32, col. 4761,\r\n\r\nthe present Finance Minister declared that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`many Members suggested that reliefs should be given\r\n\r\nfor  the  maintenance of aged parents  and  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren  on  the grounds that the Eastern  concept  of\r\n\r\nfilial   piety  requires,  among  other  things,   that\r\n\r\nchildren should look after their parents in old age.  I\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  with  greater  urbanisation  and  more\r\n\r\nlimited   living  space,  the  Asian  family  unit   is\r\n\r\nthreatened  with disintegration and that  aged  parents\r\n\r\nmay  be left on their own when they most need care  and\r\n\r\nattention.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the Hon. Minister was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`prepared to give some tax relief as an encouragement\r\n\r\nto   taxpayers  who  look  after  their   parents   and\r\n\r\ngrandparents when they are without work or income.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a taxpayer may claim a tax deduction from his income\r\n\r\nof $300 per dependent parent or grandparent. A taxpayer\r\n\r\nmay  claim up to a maximum of two dependent parents  or\r\n\r\ngrandparents  who  are  over  55  years  of  age,   are\r\n\r\nsupported by the taxpayer and are staying in  the  same\r\n\r\nhousehold.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can imagine, Sir, that I heaved a sigh of relief\r\n\r\nat  this disclosure, even though the amount allowed was\r\n\r\nsmall  but  by  no  means  significant.  At  least,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, pleaded  with\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister to increase the tax relief to $750\r\n\r\nwhen  he pointed out on 8th March, 1973 [Vol. 32,  col.\r\n\r\n629], that \"the tax relief for a first child is $750  a\r\n\r\nyear.\"  In the 1974 Budget Statement, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance said [Vol. 33, col. 72, 4th March, 1974]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Last year when I announced the relief to taxpayers\r\n\r\nfor  supporting  parents  or  grandparents,  many  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  felt  that  the  tax  deduction  at  $300  per\r\n\r\ndependant  was  inadequate. I have  given  this  matter\r\n\r\nfurther  consideration and I am happy  to  inform  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers that the relief will now be increased from $300\r\n\r\nto  $750 per dependant. There will be no change in  the\r\n\r\nother  conditions announced last year. The increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  relief  will  also take effect from  the  year  of\r\n\r\nassessment 1975, that is, based on 1974 income.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be, Sir, that I have elaborated long\r\n\r\nenough  on  this  question of  tax  relief  granted  to\r\n\r\ntaxpayers who have parents living with them. But I must\r\n\r\nhasten  to add that I take no credit in convincing  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  grant  such  reliefs.  In   fact,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should be congratulated for this magnanimous\r\n\r\ngesture  which lays stress and encourages young couples\r\n\r\nto have their aged parents or grandparents to live with\r\n\r\nthem.  Basically,  in the Asian society,  its  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage  differs greatly from that of the West.  In  a\r\n\r\nsmall country like ours, it would be a great benefit if\r\n\r\nour young could be instilled in their tender years with\r\n\r\nsuch  good  human values like living harmoniously  with\r\n\r\ntheir grandparents and parents. In this respect, I have\r\n\r\nvisited  old  folks homes at home and abroad  and  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  conclusion that  filial  piety  must  be\r\n\r\ncherished by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nworking  parents  and passed down to  their  children's\r\n\r\nchildren if we are to build a closely knit and cohesive\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As families become smaller within the next ten years\r\n\r\nor  so  largely due to a certain measure the successful\r\n\r\nimplementation   of  family  planning,   and   if   the\r\n\r\nprojection of population growth is accurate enough,  we\r\n\r\nwould still have large families occupying HDB flats  in\r\n\r\nthe various estates. In this respect, I wonder how many\r\n\r\nfamilies would gather around for a reunion dinner  once\r\n\r\na  year.  This  annual dinner has its own significance.\r\n\r\nThe Government have a State Banquet each year, in which\r\n\r\na  select group will attend. At this function,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister and his Cabinet  colleagues\r\n\r\nplay  host.  it is refreshing for one to be invited  on\r\n\r\nsuch  an auspicious occasion in which the invitees  not\r\n\r\nonly  meet but strengthen the relationship between them\r\n\r\nand also help to establish the esprit de corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, every year the 65 Constituency CCCs and\r\n\r\nMCs  from the 174 community centres attend a rally  and\r\n\r\ndinner  to  celebrate  National Day.  Here  again,  the\r\n\r\nrelationship   between   grass-root   leadership    and\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  further strengthened. This  is  another\r\n\r\nexample of human value worth inculcating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would elaborate on this further when I come to the\r\n\r\npolicy changes in our Education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the question, Sir, of crime\r\n\r\nprevention.  I would like to touch on the  question  of\r\n\r\ngrowing  crime rates. I fully endorse the  Government's\r\n\r\nwill  to  mete out more severe punishment to  criminals\r\n\r\nand drug traffickers. In fact, I would like to call  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  impose both the  cane  and  longer\r\n\r\nperiods of imprisonment to such people as they  do  not\r\n\r\ndeserve any mercy. Therefore, the introduction of full-time  National  Service in the  police  force  is  most\r\n\r\ntimely  as there is a shortage of manpower.  It  is  my\r\n\r\nhope that there shall be police stations with the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nnecessary manpower and up-to-date facilities as well in\r\n\r\nall  the  HDB  estates,  though  the  Addendum  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Home Affairs states that four new stations\r\n\r\nwill  be  built in Toa Payoh, Paya Lebar, Orchard  Road\r\n\r\nand  Jurong Town. But whilst there are so many new  HDB\r\n\r\nflats being built, I would suggest that plans should be\r\n\r\nin  hand to construct more police stations in these new\r\n\r\nestates. We have often read in the newspapers cases  of\r\n\r\nvandalism, molest, robbery and theft, committed in  the\r\n\r\nHDB  estates especially in the lifts. As the  President\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"we must make Singapore a safe and orderly place\r\n\r\nto  live in.\" Thus I do not see any valid reason why we\r\n\r\ncannot   overcome  this  problem  because,   with   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of National Service in the  Police  Force\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  the  Community  Security  Force  of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps, more personnel could be  deployed  to\r\n\r\nmany  of  the more populated HDB estates.  This,  I  am\r\n\r\npositive, will help to reduce crime and deter these bad\r\n\r\nelements  from committing such offences as  they  would\r\n\r\nrealise  that  it is painful for them when  caught  and\r\n\r\nfound guilty of committing such an offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nis in line with our declared policy on foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nSince  the  setting up of ASEAN, member countries  have\r\n\r\ncome  closer  to each other on matters of regional  and\r\n\r\nbilateral  interest, and I can foresee that a  stronger\r\n\r\nrelationship will develop. In this respect,  I  welcome\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of  a permanent secretariat  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\nwhich  will  co-ordinate  the many  regional  economic,\r\n\r\nsocial and cultural projects to be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue vital to Singapore is sea\r\n\r\ncommunications. I have on several occasions  drawn  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House that I have received complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  the  trawlers based at Kangkar in my constituency\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the harassment and piracies encountered\r\n\r\nby  the  fishermen who risk their lives to fish in  the\r\n\r\nwaters in the South China Sea in the area near Horsburg\r\n\r\nLighthouse as well as in Southeast Asian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwaters. Several trawlers and crew together with their\r\n\r\ncatches have been captured and held to ransom by so-called pirates. The fishermen are very unhappy over\r\n\r\nthis. In this respect, I would like to urge our\r\n\r\nGovernment to have high-level discussions with ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries with a view to coordinating their efforts in\r\n\r\nkeeping the waters in Southeast Asia free of piracy so\r\n\r\nthat our fishermen can earn their bread and butter\r\n\r\nwithout fear of being pirated. Combined efforts and\r\n\r\nmore regular naval patrols will, I think, be a step\r\n\r\nforward in reducing the number of piracies, if not\r\n\r\ntotally eradicate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to the Primary Production under the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development. It is heartening  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  we are self-sufficient in fresh pork,  eggs\r\n\r\nand  poultry meats in spite of occasional shortages and\r\n\r\nhigh prices of imported raw feed materials. But what is\r\n\r\nmost  unfortunate is the fact that \"in conjunction with\r\n\r\nwater   resources  development,  pig  farms   will   be\r\n\r\nrelocated  into non-catchment areas\" in Punggol.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  more than a thousand acres of land in  Punggol\r\n\r\nhave been acquired for this particular purpose. I fully\r\n\r\nrealise  the scarcity of land in Singapore and more  so\r\n\r\nthe imperative need to preserve larger areas of land as\r\n\r\ncatchment  areas  which  are  free  of  pollutants.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  this,  the  Defence  Ministry  also  have\r\n\r\nsimilar  needs for the training of national servicemen.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whatever vacant land, especially that  which\r\n\r\nis marked for agricultural purpose, is acquired in this\r\n\r\ninstance. Apart from this, lands are also acquired  for\r\n\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land availability has become a problem for our\r\n\r\nGovernment  and I believe Singapore can  ill-afford  to\r\n\r\nhave  lands not fully utilised. Optimum utilisation  of\r\n\r\nland  available  must continue to be so,  as  Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinues to develop. Therefore, it can be adduced that\r\n\r\nland  in  Singapore is worth an inch of gold for  every\r\n\r\ninch  of  it! Within the acquired lands in Punggol  are\r\n\r\nmany  farmers,  namely, pig, poultry  and  agricultural\r\n\r\nfarmers. Most of them are poultry\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfarmers and they number several hundred families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that only a few have been\r\n\r\npromised  that  they  would not be  required  to  leave\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  majority of them have  been  served  with\r\n\r\nnotices to quit, and some have been promised that  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  getting a three-room Housing Board flat  for\r\n\r\nfree, including ex-gratia payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to make a strong plea to the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  as to whether his  Ministry  would\r\n\r\nconsider the requests of the numerous farmers who  have\r\n\r\napproached me for assistance. They maintain  that  they\r\n\r\nare  bona-fide farmers and that pig and poultry farming\r\n\r\nis  their  only means of livelihood, and  they  request\r\n\r\nthat   they  be  allowed  to  remain  where  they  are.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  state  that  they  are  prepared   to\r\n\r\nincrease  the number of pigs or poultry in their  farms\r\n\r\nto  the  minimum requirements of the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  for the simple reason that they  have  been\r\n\r\nfarming  in  the  said area since they  first  came  to\r\n\r\nPunggol. I can hear testimony to their claim as  I  was\r\n\r\nborn   and   brought  up  in  Punggol.  I   feel   that\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to this request  which  I\r\n\r\nconsider   reasonable,  provided  that  these   farmers\r\n\r\ncontinue  to maintain the required number  of  pigs  or\r\n\r\npoultry.  They have also pointed out to  me  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to move into a three-room  HDB  flat\r\n\r\ngiven  free to them as they would have no further means\r\n\r\nof  income,  and in that case how are they to  survive.\r\n\r\nThey also state that they are in the \"evening years\" of\r\n\r\ntheir lives and that their children would like to  step\r\n\r\ninto  their  shoes to continue farming as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  Another reason advanced by  them  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  had  been several outbreaks of swine  fever  and\r\n\r\npoultry  diseases  in the past few years  which  almost\r\n\r\ndrained  them of their financial resources; but  thanks\r\n\r\nto  the assistance of feed retailers and suppliers, who\r\n\r\ngave them credit terms, they were able to survive. This\r\n\r\nis part of the reason why some of the bona-fide farmers\r\n\r\nreduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntheir  stock. People seem to think that pig and poultry\r\n\r\nfarming is lucrative, but I do not think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Why\r\n\r\ndo they continue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If it is not lucrative, they will not\r\n\r\ncontinue farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Why should they not continue.

There  were  occasions,  however,  when\r\n\r\nprices had gone up and gains reaped by them. Just  like\r\n\r\nstocks  and  shares;  they go up  and  come  down.  Who\r\n\r\nsuffers? Sir, this issue has been raised in this  House\r\n\r\nmany  times.  In fact, my colleagues who are  known  as\r\n\r\n\"rural\"  MPs  are  fully aware of the farmers'  grouses\r\n\r\nlike sharp rise in prices and low prices vice-versa  of\r\n\r\nanimal/poultry  feeds as well as a  glut  in  pork  and\r\n\r\neggs. This has been an annual feature of the debate  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. That is the answer, Sir. In fact,  another\r\n\r\npoint my farmers raised is that all they require  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall plot of land, say one-half to one acre of land to\r\n\r\nenable  them  to survive. Resettling the families  does\r\n\r\nnot pose such a serious problem as having to resettle a\r\n\r\nfarmer  into HDB estates. These people lose out because\r\n\r\nthey have to sell whatever they have, for example, pigs\r\n\r\nand  poultry, the price of which would be  too  low  to\r\n\r\nsalvage,  and also not taking into account the fixtures\r\n\r\nand structures put up at\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhigh  cost.  A  major part of their lives  has  been\r\n\r\nspent  in  making them what they are today.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  maintain  that  the amount of  money  by  way  of\r\n\r\ncompensation or ex-gratia payments given to them  would\r\n\r\nnot help them in any way, nor change their way of life.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result;  to move into a HDB flat,  according  to\r\n\r\nthem, is like starting life all over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concede that in order to have potable water from\r\n\r\nthe  Kranji and Peirce reservoirs, no pollution can  be\r\n\r\nallowed in such areas, and for this reason pig farmers,\r\n\r\nespecially in these areas, must be relocated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat  being  the case, I am mindful of the  advice  the\r\n\r\nPresident made when he stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am confident that in your deliberations, you will\r\n\r\nnot  be  swayed by short-term political considerations,\r\n\r\nand  that, instead, you wilt be guided by the long-term\r\n\r\ninterests of all our people.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, would not the Hon. Minister consider that the\r\n\r\nother aspect of having substantial parcels of lands  in\r\n\r\nPunggol  leased  out  to people  or  enterprises  on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis  with  the  necessary  expertise  and\r\n\r\nfinance  would result in giving them the monopoly  over\r\n\r\nsuch  industry  and consequently create more  attendant\r\n\r\nproblems  for ourselves. I would say that  the  smaller\r\n\r\nfarms   which   are  prepared  to  meet   the   minimum\r\n\r\nrequirements  laid  down  by  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment be allowed to occupy a smaller plot of  land\r\n\r\non  Temporary  Occupation Licence basis  alongside  the\r\n\r\ncapital and labour intensive commercial farms and until\r\n\r\nsuch time when they lose out to the commercial farms. I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest to the Hon. Minister to give this\r\n\r\nproblem due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now refer to the Education system.\r\n\r\nI  note with optimism that the Education system will be\r\n\r\nrestructured by stages with the objective  of  reducing\r\n\r\neducational  wastage, improving teaching and  learning,\r\n\r\nand  increasing  the  supply of  trained  teachers  and\r\n\r\nmanpower.   Moreover,   several   measures   will    be\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what worries me is the question of supply and\r\n\r\ndemand subsequent to this change. In this respect,\r\n\r\nI  would  not hesitate to call upon the Government\r\n\r\nto  set  up  a  high-powered Committee  preferably\r\n\r\nheaded   by   a  Minister  to  cause  a   Manpower\r\n\r\nDistribution Research Unit established with a view\r\n\r\nto  studying in greater depth the various needs of\r\n\r\nmanpower in the next five or ten years or more. As\r\n\r\nI  see  it, the new Education system envisaged  is\r\n\r\nmore  technically  oriented  to  meet  our  future\r\n\r\nindustrial growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I would like to pay tribute to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education in setting aside a period known  as\r\n\r\n\"Education  for  Living.\" I view this  with  every\r\n\r\nseriousness  as  I  notice that  many  youths  are\r\n\r\neither  idle  or they do not want to work  because\r\n\r\nthey come from well-to-do families as well as from\r\n\r\nthe upper middle income group. Here parents should\r\n\r\ncheck  them  and encourage them to look  for  work\r\n\r\nrather  than  to  allow them to while  away  their\r\n\r\nprecious  time  whilst they are in  the  prime  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lives and to spend such time in the  coffee\r\n\r\nlounges,  bars or night-clubs. Parents should  not\r\n\r\npamper  their  children by giving  them  too  much\r\n\r\npocket allowance. At the same time, parents should\r\n\r\nfind  some  time  to  spend with  their  children.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Education for Living should  provide  a\r\n\r\nbasic foundation in helping to mould the character\r\n\r\nof  our students with a sense of moral values  and\r\n\r\nself-discipline  so that, when they  leave  school\r\n\r\nthey  will be of benefit to the society.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  motto which they should bear in mind  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes  - \"I serve my country and in return I enjoy\r\n\r\nthe fruits of my labour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to add that the Addendum to\r\n\r\nthe   Presidential  Address,  covering   all   the\r\n\r\nMinistries, clearly indicates the ambition of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  long-term planning  and  projections\r\n\r\nwhich,   when  ultimately  completed,  will   make\r\n\r\nSingapore a beacon of the East in which her people\r\n\r\nlive  in  peace and harmony with her  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nPresident  for the concise manner he directed  our\r\n\r\nattention  to  our present problems and  also  the\r\n\r\nmeasures the Government proposes to take in  order\r\n\r\nto  overcome  them. The President  did  not  sound\r\n\r\ndespondent nor was he in a state of euphoria  when\r\n\r\nhe  assured  us that we would fare better  towards\r\n\r\nthe  later  part of 1975. What probably  had  made\r\n\r\nthings  look  worse  than  they  really  were  was\r\n\r\nbecause we had allowed ourselves to live with  the\r\n\r\nidea  that doomsday was around the corner, so much\r\n\r\nso,   that  unscrupulous  businessmen  manipulated\r\n\r\nstocks  and  prices, and indulged in profiteering.\r\n\r\nThe  President's speech, although low-keyed, is  a\r\n\r\nrefreshing change from what we were used  to  hear\r\n\r\nin the recent past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation causes concern to each and everyone. We\r\n\r\nhave  learned to live with it by prudent  spending\r\n\r\nand reducing wastage. However, I believe we should\r\n\r\ngive  priority in tackling economic recession  and\r\n\r\nthe  loss of job opportunities. Whatever available\r\n\r\nresources there are should be utilised to  develop\r\n\r\nour  physical assets and infrastructure. The world\r\n\r\nis ever more confident that economic recovery will\r\n\r\ntake  place before 1976. It is imperative we  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  whatever spare resources we have  now  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  our  physical assets and to  equip  our\r\n\r\nmanpower  to spring back to activity at  a  higher\r\n\r\ntechnological   level.   There    is    all    the\r\n\r\njustification  now  to  draw  upon   our   foreign\r\n\r\nexchange reserves for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no less important to Singapore\r\n\r\nis  the  question  of controlling  the  growth  of\r\n\r\npopulation.  Industrialisation  had   its   origin\r\n\r\nbecause   entrepot  trade  could  not   give   job\r\n\r\nopportunities to the growing numbers entering  the\r\n\r\nemployment  market. Rapid urbanisation and  living\r\n\r\nin  high-rise  flats  also became  very  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  of limited land resources. Our population\r\n\r\ndensity  is  3,664  persons per square  kilometre,\r\n\r\nabout  the highest in the world. There are 529,200\r\n\r\nwomen in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfertile age group 15 to 44, and if every one of them is\r\n\r\nto  have only two children, our population will be four\r\n\r\nmillion  in 50 years' time. There is no doubt  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  achieve zero population growth  as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible. Land for housing, recreation, reservoirs  and\r\n\r\nother  uses  are  not  abundant and  limitless,  it  is\r\n\r\nalready  generally agreed, even by those who have  more\r\n\r\nthan  two  children, that Singapore  is  getting  over-crowded.  Therefore,  over-sized  families  should   be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged  by  suitable disincentives and  penalties.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation based on the concept of  availability\r\n\r\nof  a large reservoir of low-skilled labour should have\r\n\r\nits cut-off point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to extend pioneer industry tax\r\n\r\nexemption from five to ten years for the most deserving\r\n\r\nindustries. It is appropriate, therefore, to grant this\r\n\r\ntax  exemption on a selective basis to industries  with\r\n\r\nthe possibility of proceeding to a higher technological\r\n\r\nphase in production. The intention of the Government to\r\n\r\noffer  attractive  terms for new types  of  industries,\r\n\r\nsuch as machine tools, precision instruments and petro-chemicals, is well thought and timely. This has  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  if for no other reason than the hope for a better\r\n\r\nstandard of living through higher productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is abundantly clear that higher wages and standard\r\n\r\nof  living are not possible without higher productivity\r\n\r\nat all levels. However, all too often when the question\r\n\r\nof productivity is examined, low productivity is always\r\n\r\nblamed  on labour. There are also managements  who  are\r\n\r\ninept and inefficient, the Singapore Bus Service is one\r\n\r\nof  the many. The matter of productivity is within  the\r\n\r\nprovince of management. I could not do better  than  to\r\n\r\nquote  what the Minister for Finance said in an article\r\n\r\nin  an NTUC publication commemorating the 50th birthday\r\n\r\nof our Honourable Prime Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fairly productive labour with bad management,\r\n\r\nantiquated  machinery or the wrong choice of  goods  to\r\n\r\nproduce  will  lead  to  low  labour  productivity.  An\r\n\r\nincrease in labour\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nproductivity can result not only from better training,\r\n\r\nmore  responsibility and better health of workmen,  but\r\n\r\nalso   from   an  improvement  in  management,   modern\r\n\r\nmachinery  or  a  different  production  and  marketing\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Therefore,  the  major  aspects  of  labour\r\n\r\nproductivity are in the hands of entrepreneurs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour has yet to fully convince\r\n\r\nemployers  on  the question. The National  Productivity\r\n\r\nBoard  is  to  convene  a conference  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nquestion of productivity and wages. This is a good move\r\n\r\nto  look  forward  to.  However, the  attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Productivity Board as stated in the  Addendum\r\n\r\nto   the   Presidential  Address  that  the   \"National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Board will assist those who are  prepared\r\n\r\nto  set up productivity committees\" amply describes the\r\n\r\nfeeble  attempts of the National Productivity Board  in\r\n\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's education policy promises among\r\n\r\nother things:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) `Every pupil who completes primary education will\r\n\r\nproceed  to  post-primary education and training  of  a\r\n\r\ntype best suited to his aptitude and ability.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) `The secondary curriculum will be diversified to\r\n\r\ninclude   a   variety   of  vocational   training   and\r\n\r\napprenticeship schemes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of primary and secondary education,\r\n\r\nas I see it, is to give practical training for suitable\r\n\r\nemployment in the future for both primary and secondary\r\n\r\nschool-leavers.   The  education   that   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary pupils receive, however, should not make them\r\n\r\nrobots  merely  suited to carry out work  in  a  narrow\r\n\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a worker becomes technologically\r\n\r\nredundant,   the  Industrial  Training   Board   should\r\n\r\norganise  the  retraining programme at  the  employer's\r\n\r\nexpense  if  it  is not possible for  the  employer  to\r\n\r\nretrain the worker on the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the training of our young men for\r\n\r\ndefence of our Republic, the beneficial aspect which is\r\n\r\nrecognised  by both parents and employers is character-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to post National Servicemen to do work\r\n\r\nrelated  to  their future employment after leaving  the\r\n\r\nArmy will be welcomed by those concerned. It may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbe  worthwhile  to  consider  allowing  these  National\r\n\r\nServicemen in appropriate engineering vocations  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  task  of designing and carrying  out  civil\r\n\r\nengineering works like bridges, wharves and  piers.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this should be done on a limited scale.  After\r\n\r\nall  a soldier must train and carry out military duties\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to introduce full-time National Service\r\n\r\nfor  the  Police Force would suit some young  men,  who\r\n\r\nwould, if it were not for this scheme, be drafted  into\r\n\r\nthe  armed forces much against their liking.  The  need\r\n\r\nfor  this  new approach is apparently due  to  manpower\r\n\r\nshortage  in the Police Force. I think it is imperative\r\n\r\nto  enquire  why  the Police Force  is  not  attracting\r\n\r\nsuitable young men. Why is it that, of the hundreds  of\r\n\r\nschool  police cadets, so few have chosen a  career  in\r\n\r\nthe Force? Drafting young men into the Police Force  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  most logical solution to solving  the  police\r\n\r\nmanpower  problem. I have my doubts  that  the  reserve\r\n\r\npolice service will enlarge the law enforcing capacity.\r\n\r\nI  should like to be enlightened at an appropriate time\r\n\r\nif  these  Police national servicemen will strictly  do\r\n\r\npatrol  work, traffic control work, some boring  static\r\n\r\nwork  or some work which would not be of practical  use\r\n\r\nin their future employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant admission in the Presidential Address\r\n\r\nis  the need to keep the family all under one roof, and\r\n\r\nif I may quote from the text of the speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My Government will take measures to make it more\r\n\r\nattractive  for  young couples, to have  their  parents\r\n\r\nlive  with them. If nothing else, the grandparents help\r\n\r\nin  bringing up the children whilst father  and  mother\r\n\r\nare at work.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is a good idea and in keeping with the real Asian\r\n\r\ntradition. Urbanisation and the construction  of  small\r\n\r\nflats  have  been  one  of  the  main  causes  of   the\r\n\r\nproliferation  of  the  extended  family.  Nothing  can\r\n\r\nsubstitute the care and attention of parents. The  next\r\n\r\nbest  are  the grandparents. From the social  point  of\r\n\r\nview  the  encouragement  of  interdependence  of   the\r\n\r\nvarious generations is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not revealed what incentives would\r\n\r\nbe  offered  to those whose parents live with  them.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest for consideration the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A higher taxation allowance than what is allowed\r\n\r\nnow be given to those who truly and adequately maintain\r\n\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Priority in the allocation of bigger Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats on condition that nobody in the\r\n\r\nfamily  should request for an additional flat within  a\r\n\r\nfixed period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the several problems modern Singapore faces is\r\n\r\nurban  transportation. The problem of  controlling  the\r\n\r\nvolume of traffic entering the centre of administration\r\n\r\nand business area would have to be controlled sooner or\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public transport, in particular the bus system, is\r\n\r\nstill   inefficient  in  terms  of  routes,  frequency,\r\n\r\nreliability  and service. As and when  the  bus  system\r\n\r\nimproves, more and more measures could be introduced to\r\n\r\nencourage  people to use public transport. The  present\r\n\r\nservices provided by the Singapore Bus Service  is  far\r\n\r\nfrom being able to take any further demand on them. The\r\n\r\naddition of the shuttle service from the fringes of the\r\n\r\nCentral    Business   District   into    the    central\r\n\r\nadministration  and  business area  will  be  far  from\r\n\r\nsolving  mass transportation. For the time  being,  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  private cars for travelling will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nmaintained, though on a lower scale. Congestion in  the\r\n\r\nCBD  does  not  appear  till after  8  o'clock  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning.  In  view of this, it may not be necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  licensing scheme till  8  o'clock.  The\r\n\r\nsuggestion is 7.30 a.m. This should allow parents,  who\r\n\r\nare  presently  sending their children  to  school,  to\r\n\r\navoid  having to bear an additional expenditure  during\r\n\r\nthese hard times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus service is far from adequate to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the ordinary people. There has been  only  a\r\n\r\nslight  improvement, however. The  improvement  is  not\r\n\r\nsignificant  enough for any party involved  in  running\r\n\r\nthe system to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  given  outright compliment. The conduct of  drivers\r\n\r\nand conductors no doubt has shown marked improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondment of more than 100 Government and\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces personnel since August last year\r\n\r\nis  unprecedented though most necessary. Never  has  so\r\n\r\nmany  Government  servants been  seconded  to  serve  a\r\n\r\nprivate company. It does prove my point that there  are\r\n\r\npeople with the right calibre in the public service who\r\n\r\ncould  manage the public transportation system.  I  say\r\n\r\nwithout  reservation  that it  is  not  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest  for  the bus service to be in  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nprivate entrepreneurs. The bus service must be operated\r\n\r\nas a public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed by the Government that the Singapore\r\n\r\nBus  Service be converted into a public limited company\r\n\r\nwith Government having a shareholding when it is firmly\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happy if the House could he informed what\r\n\r\npercentage   of  the  shares  will  be  held   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Will the new SBS be run to make the highest\r\n\r\npossible  profit? What is the maximum  dividend  to  be\r\n\r\npaid to the shareholders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had proposed in the last session of this Parliament\r\n\r\nthat   there   should   be  established   a   statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation  to  run the bus service on a  co-operative\r\n\r\nbasis with the Government and other suitable parties as\r\n\r\nshareholders.  Since it is operated on  a  co-operative\r\n\r\nprinciple, profit-taking could be limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be happy if the new SBS is run with the\r\n\r\nobjective  to  serve the public interest and  that  the\r\n\r\nhighest possible re-investment is made to give the best\r\n\r\nservice to the bus-travelling public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree in principle that the Government should\r\n\r\ndiscourage the use of private cars for ordinary travel.\r\n\r\nThe  need for any family to have more than one  car  is\r\n\r\nquestioned. In the same vein, the practice of tendering\r\n\r\nfor  car registration numbers of a low order by  people\r\n\r\nin high society should not be\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nencouraged any more by the Registry of Vehicles. Social\r\n\r\nsnobbery amongst car owners is not in keeping with  the\r\n\r\nart  of graceful living. If it can be described at all,\r\r\n\r\nit  is  conspicuous  consumption and obscene-living  in\r\n\r\nstyle. Why accentuate social tension?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are examples of harmful styles\r\n\r\nfor  our  young  generation to  imitate.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nsociety  we  create. How much can we blame the  present\r\n\r\ngeneration.  First,  we must demotivate  ourselves.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in conjunction with this view, I could do\r\n\r\nno  better than to quote the Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Trades Union Congress, Mr Devan Nair:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who live and lead in the opening years of the\r\n\r\n21st  century are already in our charge today,  in  our\r\n\r\nschools, our classrooms, and our playing fields. If  we\r\n\r\ntruly love them, and desire a better world for them, we\r\n\r\nmust  motivate them for a new and better  world.  Which\r\n\r\nmeans   that   we  must  de-motivate  them   from   the\r\n\r\naberrations  and  the  insensate  hostilities  and  the\r\n\r\nantagonisms of our times.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"How do we do this?\" he asked. \"We would, in brief,\r\n\r\nhave  to  de-motivate  ourselves,  before  we  can  re-motivate our children for the future\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the Motion of the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Keat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's speech\r\n\r\nclearly  reflects that after 16 years of administration\r\n\r\nour  leadership is still preserving its usual  practice\r\n\r\nof down-to-earth pragmatism. They have not for the sake\r\n\r\nof  short term political objectives neglected the  long\r\n\r\nterm interests of the people. The policy for the coming\r\n\r\nyear not only thinks in terms of the younger generation\r\n\r\nbut  also  cares for the welfare of the aged so  as  to\r\n\r\nensure  that their livelihood in their remaining  years\r\n\r\nmay be properly protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President says that 1975 will be a busy year for\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of  Parliament. From the point  of  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  we can say that 1975 will also be a  year  in\r\n\r\nwhich  their  duties will be heavier, because  all  the\r\n\r\nimportant measures and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicies   after  the  deliberation  and   passage   of\r\n\r\nParliament will have to be implemented by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our independence, it is only a matter of 10-odd\r\n\r\nyears.  To  a country, a decade may not be too  long  a\r\n\r\ntime.  However,  we  have  been  able  to  make  marked\r\n\r\nprogress  and  achievements in  the  fields  of  socio-economy,  education, construction and others which  are\r\n\r\nnot only publicly acknowledged by all the people of our\r\n\r\ncountry  but  have  also brought  to  us  international\r\n\r\nrenown. The main reason for this is that, while in  our\r\n\r\neffort  for progress and survival, we have also at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time developed and built up a sound and efficient\r\n\r\nadministrative system with all the main departments and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  on  the  whole  able  to  match  the\r\n\r\ndetermination and policies of the leadership,  actively\r\n\r\npromoting and realising our plan for nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the juncture of transition from old to new and in\r\n\r\nour efforts for progress, particularly in recent years,\r\n\r\nsome  traditional service departments in order to  meet\r\n\r\nchanging  objective environment and  needs  have  often\r\n\r\nbeen reorganised or changed, some departments have even\r\n\r\nbeen changed to statutory boards. On the other hand, we\r\n\r\nhave   also   set   up  a  number  of   non-traditional\r\n\r\nindependent organisations. What is most obvious is that\r\n\r\nin  the  course of promoting economic development,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  under the Companies Act  set  up  some\r\n\r\ncommercial organisations in order to promote some  non-traditional  commercial and industrial  activities.  In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  these organisational changes  are  actually\r\n\r\nnecessary. However, in the course of changes there have\r\n\r\narisen some organisational aberrations and signs of ill-feeling  on  the part of the people. Under the  present\r\n\r\npublic  service and economic development system,  there\r\n\r\nseem to be the following shortcomings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Each one in his own, or minding one's own business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On   the   one  hand,  statutory  boards  and  national\r\n\r\nenterprises  registered under the  Companies  Act  have\r\n\r\nincreased in number greatly. Each statutory board has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  legally  defined  position  and  power  and  every\r\n\r\nGovernment   commercial   or  industrial   organisation\r\n\r\nregistered under the Companies Act also has its special\r\n\r\nobjectives and scope of activities. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nvarious  traditional Government departments  also  have\r\n\r\ntheir separate rights and functions. These changes to a\r\n\r\ncertain  degree  might have brought about  symptoms  of\r\n\r\ndismemberment  and  complication to our  administrative\r\n\r\nentity.  This is because when promoting their  separate\r\n\r\npolicies  these separate units seem to lack  the  basic\r\n\r\nconsciousness   for  mutual  arrangement   and   mutual\r\n\r\ncoordination  and  cooperation.  Had  there  been   any\r\n\r\ncooperation and coordination, it was mainly  accidental\r\n\r\nand  not  due  to  any  unity or  planning  in  nature.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  amidst  this trend of  each  looking  after\r\n\r\nhimself   alone,  there  are  bound   to   take   place\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of  mutual contradiction,  dislocation,\r\n\r\nwastage  and delay very often leaving with the populace\r\n\r\nthe feeling that the left hand knows not what the right\r\n\r\nhand  is  doing.  Some  obvious and  frequent  examples\r\n\r\ninclude  tackling  the  question  of  reducing  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  in the inner city; in view  of  a  lack  of\r\n\r\ncoordination of the departments concerned in respect of\r\n\r\nthe  personnel  and  the  techniques  involved  a  much\r\n\r\nconfused situation has resulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Wastage of personnel and resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Under separate administration, every organisation tries\r\n\r\nits   best  to  realise  its  objectives,  on  its  own\r\n\r\nviewpoint. This might cause contradiction and  friction\r\n\r\namong   the  departments  and  organisations  concerned\r\n\r\nunwittingly  and would inevitably lead  to  duplication\r\n\r\nand unnecessary loss and wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the usage of computers, there are up\r\n\r\nto  now at least four or five units making use of  this\r\n\r\nfacility. In view of the expensiveness of this sort  of\r\n\r\nequipment,  and in addition, shortage of  personnel  to\r\n\r\nman it, if a scheme for centralised usage is adopted by\r\n\r\njointly setting up a computer service centre, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  expenses will be reduced not only in the  initial\r\n\r\nperiod but also in the long run. And because of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  pooling of personnel and resources and  collective\r\n\r\nplanning resulting in the benefit of considered opinion\r\n\r\nthere will be more effective raising of our standard of\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the question of land. According to\r\n\r\npresent  experience, there seems  to  be  some  quarrel\r\n\r\namong some departments or organisations concerned about\r\n\r\nthe  usage of land. Under the present system,  although\r\n\r\nwe  have  in  existence the Land Office,  however  this\r\n\r\ndepartment is not the only authority that exercises the\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   state  land  and  the  power   of   land\r\n\r\nacquisition.  There are some other establishments  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Jurong Town Corporation, the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority,  Housing  and Development  Board  and  Urban\r\n\r\nRenewal  Authority Board which possess  equal  or  even\r\n\r\ngreater  statutory  power in this respect.  This  might\r\n\r\ncause  friction among the various departments and would\r\n\r\nexpose the inherent contradiction of the Government  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with land policies. In this respect,  we  must\r\n\r\nstrive  for  the realisation of comprehensive  planning\r\n\r\nand  control  in order to ensure that the limited  land\r\n\r\nmay   be   distributed  and  utilised  rationally   and\r\n\r\neffectively in the most economical and sound way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Excessive commercialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  the  course of promoting our national economy,  for\r\n\r\nvarious reasons the traditional service departments and\r\n\r\nnon.  traditional organisations have all tended towards\r\n\r\nthe target of financial self-management and sufficiency\r\n\r\nand  the  accumulation of profits, thus neglecting  the\r\n\r\nmain  task  of service to the people. If we  turn  `the\r\n\r\npages of some official annual financial reports, it may\r\n\r\nnot  be difficult to discover in them the jubilant mood\r\n\r\nin  between  the  lines in addition to the  reports  on\r\n\r\nincreasing  rates of expenditure and  profits.  With  a\r\n\r\npurely  commercial organisation, this might  not  incur\r\n\r\nany  quarrel. However, with a governmental organisation\r\n\r\nwhose  main task is to serve the people, this  kind  of\r\n\r\nphilosophical   concept  needs  to  be   reviewed   and\r\n\r\ncriticised,  Excessive  commercialisation  might  bring\r\n\r\nabout unnecessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetition  and friction among various organisations\r\n\r\nconcerned and increase the burden of the people.  There\r\n\r\nis  another indication that some Government departments\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake  of ensuring their respective  interests\r\n\r\nhave even come to levy charges on other departments. In\r\n\r\nthe  end it is only the taxpayers and the broad  masses\r\n\r\nthat suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, many Government organisations possess the\r\n\r\npower and freedom to adjust their charges, although  in\r\n\r\nthe  past few years the Budget Statements presented  by\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister to Parliament had invariably been\r\n\r\ncalled  painless ones. But, in fact, in the  course  of\r\n\r\nevery  financial year, the charges for  many  items  of\r\n\r\npublic services had been raised directly or indirectly,\r\n\r\ncausing  the burden of livelihood of the people  to  be\r\n\r\nheavier  and  heavier  year by year.  Most  departments\r\n\r\nclaim increased costs as the chief reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our Government is calling upon all the people\r\n\r\nto  tighten their belts and to concertedly overcome the\r\n\r\nthreats  of  inflation  and economic  depression,  this\r\n\r\nsolitary  reason  may not easily  be  under.  stood  or\r\n\r\naccepted  by the people. Under reasonable circumstances\r\n\r\nand  conditions, we do not possibly as a whole deny the\r\n\r\nelements  of commerce in some state organisations,  but\r\n\r\nthis  should stop appropriately where it should, so  as\r\n\r\nnot   to  spoil  the  good  relationship  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The growing practice of bureau-cratism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, various departments and organisations\r\n\r\nin  our country, in trying to meet the rapid social and\r\n\r\neconomic  developments and needs,  have  met  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of shortage of personnel. In addition, because\r\n\r\nof  the  buoyancy  of  the  commercial  and  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises  in  the private sector, capable  personnel\r\n\r\nhave  been recruited on high salaries, thus making  the\r\n\r\nproblem  more  acute  and  causing  a  high  degree  of\r\n\r\nmobility   of   various  categories  of  employees   in\r\n\r\ngovernment  organisations. This  has  resulted  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  units  not being able to reach a  standard  of\r\n\r\nstability and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesired   situation  in  respect  of  supervision   and\r\n\r\ntraining  of personnel. Under these circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of service by our country would naturally  go\r\n\r\ndown,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies fixed by the various departments are\r\n\r\nmeant  for  actual  execution.  However,  during  their\r\n\r\nimplementation,  because many civil servants  have  not\r\n\r\nreceived  adequate  training and  also  lack  a  proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the right spirit of service,  in  the\r\n\r\nend  they  have  often made the people disappointed  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  dissatisfied. In order to implement  speedily\r\n\r\nsome   important   measures,  some   departments   have\r\n\r\nauthorised  their executors the power of  ticketing  on\r\n\r\nthe  spot.  If  these executors are  well  trained  and\r\n\r\nimbued  with  sympathy,  then  they  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nexercise their authority in a fair manner in the proper\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and conditions. However,  unfortunately,\r\n\r\nmany  executors  often abuse their  power.  They  often\r\n\r\nthreaten  to ticket a person on the slightest  pretext.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no reasoning or flexibility to talk\r\n\r\nabout.  In dealing with the people, some civil servants\r\n\r\nalso often show their impatience, especially in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  those  fellow  compatriots of  lower  educational\r\n\r\nlevel their manners are even more rude. In dealing with\r\n\r\nmatters,  they  totally disregard  the  difficulty  and\r\n\r\ninconvenience  of  the  \"small\"  citizens.   Even   for\r\n\r\nordinary matters, they would cause the people  to  turn\r\n\r\nup  at  the department concerned several times to  wait\r\n\r\nfor enquiry, wasting much valuable time of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, if faced with somewhat complicated matters,\r\n\r\nsome executors usually evade their duties and resort to\r\n\r\ntheir  usual tactic of playing Tai-chi boxing, shifting\r\n\r\nthe  problem  to some other department or  saying  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  going  to  see  a certain  MP.  Even  on  an\r\n\r\nobviously   simple  matter  of  principle,  they   will\r\n\r\nlikewise push the responsibility to a third person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all these incidents that I have\r\n\r\npointed  out  are actual facts. I believe  many  fellow\r\n\r\nBackbenchers feel the same as I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is bureaucratism on the growth. If we do not\r\n\r\ndestroy  it  in  time,  if  we  do  not  rectify   this\r\n\r\nundesirable  manifestation quickly, then we  will  face\r\n\r\nthe   increasing   ill-feeling  of  the   people,   and\r\n\r\nconsequently the political confidence that  the  people\r\n\r\nhave  in  the Party in power over the past decade  will\r\n\r\ncertainly suffer unnecessary damage. During last year's\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Budget,  many Backbenchers  made  some\r\n\r\ncriticisms  on the organisational structure and  spirit\r\n\r\nof service of the Central Complaints Bureau. I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment will take positive action to deal with  this\r\n\r\nmatter to enable this organisation to shoulder the duty\r\n\r\nof supervision more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shadow of world economic depression, future\r\n\r\nconditions   will   be   more  complicated   and   more\r\n\r\nunpredictable than in the past. Therefore, the Party in\r\n\r\noffice  should  review  and reassess  its  dealings  in\r\n\r\ninternal    and    external   affairs.    The    future\r\n\r\nadministrative   slogan  should  be  anti-wastage   and\r\n\r\nimproving efficiency. Therefore, we must take practical\r\n\r\nsteps  to strengthen and promote the coordination among\r\n\r\nvarious departments and organisations so that the whole\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  system  may  continue  in  a  more\r\n\r\nrational  way. On the other hand, we should all  firmly\r\n\r\nbear in mind that the stability of a country depends on\r\n\r\nthe  close  tripartite coordination  of  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership,  the Government administrative organisation\r\n\r\nand  all  the  people. If one of the three is  missing,\r\n\r\nthen  the  development of the whole will  be  seriously\r\n\r\nhampered.  Therefore, we must oppose bureaucratism  and\r\n\r\navoid  unnecessary  political  ill-feeling.  We  should\r\n\r\nstrengthen   the   education  of  the  civil   service,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  whether one is of a  higher  rank  or\r\n\r\nlower  rank. We must establish in the civil servants  a\r\n\r\nhealthy spirit and attitude for service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  endorse most firmly the Motion of Thanks  moved  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kim Keat. The speech\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   the  President  delivered  on  behalf  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  represents a succinct statement of  policy,\r\n\r\nelaborated  in  the various addenda pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministries. The contents  of  this  combined\r\n\r\nstatement  have a comprehensive reference. Many  issues\r\n\r\nhave been touched upon and problems and tasks outlined.\r\n\r\nAs  the  President's Address will have it, with perhaps\r\n\r\ncharacteristic understatement, \"there will be  much  to\r\n\r\nkeep Honourable Members busy in 1975.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakespeare spoke of the famous Egyptian queen,\r\n\r\nCleopatra, as one whom age could not wither nor  custom\r\n\r\nstale  her infinite variety. When one views the variety\r\n\r\nof  problems  the Government-party in  power  has  been\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  since 1959; when  one  considers  the\r\n\r\nmultitude  of  issues the present Government  has  been\r\n\r\ninvolved  with  since  it  assumed  office;  when   one\r\n\r\nremembers   the   freshness  and  even   audacity   and\r\n\r\ndetermination, with which it has set about  its  tasks,\r\n\r\nthen it is not a romantic embellishment, or any kind of\r\n\r\nverbal  liberty,  to say that custom cannot  stale  the\r\n\r\ninfinite  variety of the responses which our Government\r\n\r\ncontrives  to meet all sorts of situations  it  has  to\r\n\r\nface. Indeed the changes we have brought about can only\r\n\r\nbe described as revolutionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet so many people take for granted, or have become\r\n\r\nover-accustomed to, the performance of  the  Government\r\n\r\namidst  its concern for the development of our  people.\r\n\r\nThis concern has not been characterised by sentiment or\r\n\r\nundue  emotion or incorporated in extravagantly phrased\r\n\r\npolitical  manifesto; this concern has  been  rational,\r\n\r\ncool, expressing interest in long term consequences and\r\n\r\nlasting benefits. It is in this way that the revolution\r\n\r\nthe  party-in-power  initiated 20 years  ago  has  been\r\n\r\ncontinued  and  maintained, and  this  Government  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  monitor the change and  progress  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  towards  a  more and  more  stable  and  happy\r\n\r\npolity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I suggest that the Government has presently\r\n\r\nto  be  specially watchful and jealous in  safeguarding\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards  of service and achievement that have  always\r\n\r\ncharacterised  its  actions, actions  which  have  been\r\n\r\nsupported  by  a  people described in  the  President's\r\n\r\nAddress as \"responsive to collective needs\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our community, general standards have recently\r\n\r\nfaced  the danger of some erosion - a danger  of  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  only too  well  aware.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has himself recently remarked, for example, on\r\n\r\nthe poor quality of finish in the building industry. No\r\n\r\ndoubt  where  this particular detail  is  concerned,  a\r\n\r\nsuitable response will be contrived. For we note in the\r\n\r\nAddendum   pertaining  to  the  Ministry  of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment that programmes to train and upgrade skills\r\n\r\nin the building industry are being planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect is, however, only a symptom of a more\r\n\r\ngeneral potential malaise\r\n\r\n-  namely,  the  danger  of people  succumbing  to  the\r\n\r\ntemptation  of accepting lower standards as  being  the\r\n\r\neasy  way  out, within the circumstances of  relatively\r\n\r\nhectic development. Because of rapid development, and a\r\n\r\ncomparatively  good  development  achievement  (despite\r\n\r\nadverse  world economic conditions) the temptation  has\r\n\r\nbeen  strong  to being easily satisfied with  chin-chye\r\n\r\nwork, so long as it is speedily done. The temptation to\r\n\r\ngive  in  to  an insidious complacence and  inclination\r\n\r\ntowards making short work of things have not been  easy\r\n\r\nto resist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly we must resist the tendency to tolerate\r\n\r\nlower standards. For example, those in charge of making\r\n\r\nor servicing our roads should not be satisfied with the\r\n\r\npresent standards considering how easily wear and  tear\r\n\r\naffects  road surfaces and how poorly the  patching  is\r\n\r\ndone.  For example, again, consider how so many  people\r\n\r\nget away with petty to serious infringement of the law,\r\n\r\nas  in  the  case  of  large  numbers  of  overspeeding\r\n\r\nvehicles  or  smoky  vehicles.  Again,  there  is   the\r\n\r\ncontinuing   possibility  of  improvement  that   still\r\n\r\nremains  in  respect of service at various counters  in\r\n\r\ngovernment offices or institutions that deal  with  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the most suitable\r\n\r\njuncture  to  catalogue further  illustrations  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers of lowering standards that confront us in  many\r\n\r\naspects  of  our living, and even of our  learning  and\r\n\r\nworking and training and earning and perhaps buying and\r\n\r\nselling,  and  so  forth. In fact, the opportunity  for\r\n\r\nsuch  detailed  comment will be given  to  Backbenchers\r\n\r\nvery  shortly  when Parliament goes into  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply. But the point has to be made about the possible\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the realisation of an ideal we have  talked\r\n\r\nabout  regarding  a  higher quality  of  life  for  our\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be inappropriate to mention here that\r\n\r\nquality is not equated merely with material betterment.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should remember too that, according to  the\r\n\r\nmost respectable social psychologists, people will  not\r\n\r\nwant to strive for the fulfilment of their higher needs\r\n\r\nuntil  their most basic needs like survival and freedom\r\n\r\nfrom want have been adequately assured. This freedom we\r\n\r\nhave  succeeded  in  giving the vast  majority  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  ample  assurance  of.  However,  we  must  also\r\n\r\nremember  that among us there are still  many  such  as\r\n\r\nthose who live in their one-room flats and earn just  a\r\n\r\nlittle more than enough perhaps to keep them free  from\r\n\r\nthe  fear  of physical deprivation and free  from  fear\r\n\r\nabout  the  predictability of their  incomes.  We  must\r\n\r\ncontinue to do all to ensure that the general level  of\r\n\r\nliving for these people is raised to a level where they\r\n\r\nwill  more  and  more have time and the  motivation  to\r\n\r\nthink  of a sense of belongingness, to think of wanting\r\n\r\nto relate to their neighbours and to their environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt therefore that the first business\r\n\r\nof  government is to continue to attend to what it  has\r\n\r\nalways  considered to be its basic task  -  namely,  to\r\n\r\nincrease the size of the economic cake in such a manner\r\n\r\nas to ensure (besides other things) a bigger income (in\r\n\r\nreal  terms) for those in the lower income groups.  And\r\n\r\nto supplement this with housing, hospital, recreational\r\n\r\nand  various services. Attention to other  needs  on  a\r\n\r\nmore sophisticated level of want\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfollows only when the basic task has been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this order of quality of life, the\r\n\r\nachievement  of government has been respectable.  In  a\r\n\r\nconsideration of income by house-hold heads for 1966 we\r\n\r\nfind  66.7% earned below $250 per month. For  1972,  an\r\n\r\nECAFE  survey  noted that 32% earned  below  $250.  The\r\n\r\npercentage  of those earning more than $250  rose  from\r\n\r\nroughly  just  over 30% in 1966 to just  under  70%  in\r\n\r\n1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we try to identify our population by social class\r\n\r\ngroupings an ECAFE survey tells us that just under  70%\r\n\r\nof  those surveyed in 1972 considered themselves middle\r\n\r\nand upper class by self-identification. If one reckoned\r\n\r\nby   more  objective  criteria  of  income,  education,\r\n\r\noccupation  and  housing  conditions,  distribution  by\r\n\r\nsocio-economic  status would be: about 58%  middle  and\r\n\r\nupper class, 42% lower class. This does not represent a\r\n\r\npicture  of  economic degradation and  oppression  that\r\n\r\nsome commentators have tried to convey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it does represent is a challenge to improve the\r\n\r\nconditions  of our people further, and to add  wherever\r\n\r\nwe  can  a  component that is related to the growth  of\r\n\r\ngraciousness in our community, graciousness as  may  be\r\n\r\nprincipally  discerned in a concern for the  human  and\r\n\r\nphysical  environment, and for spiritual  and  cultural\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This graciousness has nothing to do with being able\r\n\r\nto   spend   money  on  spacious  accommodation,   posh\r\n\r\nappurtenances,   and  evidence  of   luxury.   It   has\r\n\r\neverything  to  do  with regard and respect  for  right\r\n\r\nconduct which all can afford. There is fair evidence of\r\n\r\nthe lack of this regard and respect in many, especially\r\n\r\nof our young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the President's Address laments the fact that\r\n\r\na  generation is growing up that wants the good  things\r\n\r\nin  life,  but  without working to pay for  them.  This\r\n\r\nattitude  is,  of course, reprehensible.  But  to  what\r\n\r\nextent  are  the elders of our society also responsible\r\n\r\nfor  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  our  young\r\n\r\npeople.  Have we not held up money, frequently  enough,\r\n\r\nas a shining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncriterion of success, even with the consequence of  one\r\n\r\nof  our Ministers contributing for almost international\r\n\r\ncirculation the coinage \"moneytheism\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A torn bank note features in a TV slot advertising\r\n\r\nthe  advantages of family planning. In advertising  the\r\n\r\nsale  of  our official lottery, desire for property  is\r\n\r\nthe key incentive offered. Even when the races are over\r\n\r\nat  Bukit  Timah, the traffic policemen will show  more\r\n\r\nconsideration to those leaving the racecourse  than  to\r\n\r\nthe hundreds of motorists who will be held up in a long\r\n\r\njam  on  Dunearn Road for the convenience of those  who\r\n\r\nare dejectedly returning from their orgy of gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cinemas and TV shows frequently give oblique\r\n\r\nrecommendations   to   violence   for   the   sake   of\r\n\r\ncovetousness. Meanwhile our interest in finer things is\r\n\r\nexpressed  by our giving relatively almost  nothing  to\r\n\r\nthe  National Museum, which we claim will serve as  \"an\r\n\r\neducational  centre  devoted to the  art,  history  and\r\n\r\nanthropology of the peoples of this region.\" Presumably\r\n\r\nall this will come about merely by our uncharacteristic\r\n\r\nsubscription to the idea that the best things  in  life\r\n\r\nare free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore all the more refreshing to notice a\r\n\r\nrecommendation to filial virtue in the reference in the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address to intended measures \"to  make  it\r\n\r\nmore attractive for young couples to have their parents\r\n\r\nlive  with them\". The relevant paragraph even  ends  by\r\n\r\nconjuring the domestic portrait of grandma and  grandpa\r\n\r\nhelping  in  bringing  up children  whilst  father  and\r\n\r\nmother  are  at work. Oh, Mr Speaker, Sir,  would  that\r\n\r\nsuch  human touches obtrude more often in our otherwise\r\n\r\ndispassionate official statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While concern for the problems of the old represents\r\n\r\nthe most warmly human touch in the President's Address,\r\n\r\nother concerns related to the welfare of the people are\r\n\r\nexpressed,  among  which must  feature  of  course  the\r\n\r\nproblem, as the Member for Kallang has pointed out,  of\r\n\r\npublic transport.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the public transport system\r\n\r\nseems  now to be sailing on less rough waters.  At  one\r\n\r\ntime  it looked like it was going to be torpedoed.  But\r\n\r\nrescue  operations have been ably carried out. However,\r\n\r\nthe  bus service still may be likened to a vessel  that\r\n\r\nhas  been buffeted somewhat by the storm. We hope  that\r\n\r\nit  will emerge from port in a few years' time - clean,\r\n\r\ntrim and serving effectively. Indeed, this has to be so\r\n\r\nif  we  are  successfully  to  wean  away  people  from\r\n\r\nexcessive dependence on private vehicles. In 10  years'\r\n\r\ntime,  people should indeed be seen to prefer  to  take\r\n\r\npublic transport. They should indeed deem going by  bus\r\n\r\nconvenient,  pleasant  and a journey  which  affords  a\r\n\r\ncommuter time to look more often at the environs  of  a\r\n\r\nmore   attractive  Singapore.  We  should  succeed   in\r\n\r\nbringing this about by the mid 80s - otherwise our mass\r\n\r\nrapid transit system will not get off the ground. Worse\r\n\r\nstill,  we  will not have succeeded in growing  out  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a  community  of  selfish  individualistic   car\r\n\r\ndrivers who insist on their private convenience at  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of choking the city with traffic jams and choking\r\n\r\npeople with pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this particular aspect of our experience\r\n\r\nis  the  note in the President's speech that we have  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  is  prepared to  take  action  before\r\n\r\nthings  get  out  of hand. The action  that  Government\r\n\r\ntakes  has  always  to be within the  circumstances  of\r\n\r\npeople  understanding Government policy. The  important\r\n\r\nfactor   in   the   facility  with   which   Government\r\n\r\ncommunicates with the people is education,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think of education as meaning only formal\r\n\r\nschooling, then quite large numbers of our people would\r\n\r\nhave  been left out. Although our literacy rate  is  an\r\n\r\naverage of about 70%, this is composed out of about 80%\r\n\r\nfor  males and 60% for females. About 40% of our  women\r\n\r\nand   20%   of   our  men  would  lack   the   literacy\r\n\r\nqualification to understand our message if we  gave  it\r\n\r\nthrough the written word. This written word would  only\r\n\r\nreach  the younger elements of our population, many  of\r\n\r\nwhom are still in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of education, we must therefore mean\r\n\r\nalso  the  kind of non-formal means that would  include\r\n\r\nour  mass campaigns and the informal messages  that  go\r\n\r\nout  through TV, Radio, the community centres  and  the\r\n\r\ncitizens committees. This sort of education is for  the\r\n\r\ncivic  side of the development of our people.  For  the\r\n\r\nvocational  side,  or  for  the  occupational  or  even\r\n\r\nprofessional side of our people's development,  let  us\r\n\r\nexamine  the statement that says, \"The primary duty  of\r\n\r\ngovernment is to establish a society in which  everyone\r\n\r\nhas  an  equal chance to live, learn, train,  work  and\r\n\r\nearn to the best of his or her ability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities are many for our citizens to learn to\r\n\r\nlive their lives to the full, and to develop their work\r\n\r\ncapacity   to   their  best  advantage.  However,   the\r\n\r\nmotivation  for  learning, as I have witnessed  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, is almost wholly for hoped-for  material\r\n\r\ngain. Mixed with other motivating drives, like the urge\r\n\r\nfor  cultural development or for the acquisition  of  a\r\n\r\ngracious outlook, the expectation of some more material\r\n\r\nbenefit  is  not  at all reprehensible.  :But  if  this\r\n\r\nexpectation  is  about all there  is  in  the  urge  to\r\n\r\nacquire  knowledge, then we will constantly go back  to\r\n\r\nsquare one of moneytheism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One retarding factor in the way our people regard\r\n\r\neducation mainly for the material returns to education,\r\n\r\none  socially retarding factor is the almost idolatrous\r\n\r\nattitude towards paper qualifications. A certificate is\r\n\r\nlooked  upon as a written guarantee to better  economic\r\n\r\nreturns.  Not  a few who have joined the civil  service\r\n\r\nhave  sadly equated their university qualification with\r\n\r\nadministrative talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certificate syndrome represents a gross\r\n\r\nsuperstition which we should do all we can  to  dispel.\r\n\r\nWhile  qualifications are not unimportant, an appointee\r\n\r\nvindicates  the  choice of him by his employer  through\r\n\r\nwork, dedication and proven ability. It is how a person\r\n\r\nmakes  use  of  his  education  that  is  important  to\r\n\r\nsociety.  Education is not terminal.  The  end  of  one\r\n\r\nphase is the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nbeginning of another, and this goes on throughout life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the formal structure of our education\r\n\r\nsystem  -  necessarily so- the idea that  education  is\r\n\r\nterminal   and  even  final  takes  root  too   easily.\r\n\r\nThroughout   all   the  streaming   and   phasing   and\r\n\r\nlabyrinthine  ways of our education  system  one  point\r\n\r\nshould  constantly  be stressed  -  and  that  is  that\r\n\r\nschooling  ends,  but education goes  on.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese proverb that goes roughly like this: \"Ten years\r\n\r\nto  grow a tree; a hundred years to grow a man\".  [Shih\r\n\r\nnien  hsu  mu,  pai nien hsu jen.] it is good  that  we\r\n\r\nconstantly bear this wisdom in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to support the Motion of Thanks moved by the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Keat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to rise in support\r\n\r\nof the Motion moved by the Member for Kim Keat to thank\r\n\r\nthe  President  for his speech. Since  independence  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  actively  engaged in  industrialisation  in\r\n\r\norder  to  meet the economic problems of  our  country.\r\n\r\nToday the whole world has been affected by the economic\r\n\r\nrecession  and  naturally we  have  also  suffered  the\r\n\r\neffects of this recession. But we are fortunate in that\r\n\r\nwe  have  managed to achieve a 7% growth  rate  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy   last  year.  This  is  the  result   of   the\r\n\r\nenlightened leadership of our Government and  the  hard\r\n\r\nwork  of  our people. Had it not been for the foresight\r\n\r\nand  drive of our Government, the situation today would\r\n\r\nhave been a very difficult one indeed. A new era and  a\r\n\r\nnew   situation  require  new  policies  to  meet   new\r\n\r\nproblems.  In order to promote the economic development\r\n\r\nof  our  country so that we can meet the recession,  we\r\n\r\nhave to extend the period for tax exemption relief from\r\n\r\nfive  to ten years. This is indeed correct. It is  only\r\n\r\nby  doing  this that we can promote the most  deserving\r\n\r\ntypes of new industries. But in taking this measure  we\r\n\r\nshould not overlook the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting small-scale and medium-scale industries  which\r\n\r\nare  also full of potential. We should do our  best  to\r\n\r\nhelp  these  industries to develop so that we  will  be\r\n\r\nable to achieve economic recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present Employment Act\r\n\r\nstipulates  that youths of 14 to 16 years  must  obtain\r\n\r\nthe  permission of the Commissioner for  Labour  before\r\n\r\nthey  can  be employed in a factory. This is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  their safety and health are protected. But  facts\r\n\r\ntell  us that a social problem has been created.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  have stopped schooling and with nothing to do tend\r\n\r\nto waste their time on the streets. Very often they mix\r\n\r\nwith  the wrong company and commit crimes; and this  is\r\n\r\nhow  juvenile  delinquency comes about. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour intends to amend the legislation  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  This  is the correct  thing  to  do.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this will help to reduce the rate of  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency and also increase the supply of our labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about 45% of our people are now\r\n\r\nliving in Housing Board flats and the demand for  these\r\n\r\nflats  is  increasing all the time. However, there  are\r\n\r\nmany  people living in these flats who do not know  one\r\n\r\nanother.  This  is especially so in the case  of  young\r\n\r\nworking  couples. The Government is trying to encourage\r\n\r\nyoung couples to live with their parents. This will not\r\n\r\nonly  solve the problem of the old people but  it  will\r\n\r\nalso provide the opportunity for working parents to get\r\n\r\nsomebody  to look after their children. This will  also\r\n\r\nhelp the people to cultivate the virtue of filial piety\r\n\r\nand  encourage  the  development of traditionally  good\r\n\r\nfamily concepts. This will help to reduce crimes in our\r\n\r\nHousing Board estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the task of the Police Force is to\r\n\r\nensure  the  safety of our people and  to  act  against\r\n\r\ncrime. This task is sacred as it protects the lives and\r\n\r\nproperty of our people. But all along the Police  Force\r\n\r\nhas been undermanned. Its task is indeed very\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ndifficult  because  with increasing  urbanisation  the\r\n\r\ncrime rate rises. In the recent past, without the  help\r\n\r\nof the CSF National Servicemen the situation would have\r\n\r\nbeen  much  worse. Therefore, the policy to take  full-time  National Servicemen into the Police  Force  is  a\r\n\r\nwise  one. Undoubtedly this will increase the  strength\r\n\r\nof  the  Police Force in combating crimes which are  on\r\n\r\nthe increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of my constituents, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  the  staff of the Queenstown Police Station  for\r\n\r\ntheir  good  work  in preserving law and  order  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency and for speedily solving a number of crime\r\n\r\ncases  in  the area. They have also acted  in  time  to\r\n\r\nsmash a newly formed secret society in my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Motion standing\r\n\r\nin the name of the Member for Kim Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech last Friday evening, the President\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  great  effect of  external  events  on\r\n\r\nSingapore when he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided there is no war and another oil embargo or\r\n\r\nother  major catastrophe, Singaporeans will  adjust  to\r\n\r\nslower growth rates.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External events led to the establishment and the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore. It is not my intention  today\r\n\r\nto provide hon. Members with a tourist-guide history of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The proximity of the Raffles  Professor  of\r\n\r\nHistory,  the Member for Alexandra, on my  left,  is  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  for  which hon. Members  will  no  doubt  be\r\n\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it cannot be doubted that conditions in the\r\n\r\n19th  century in China, India and elsewhere  in  South-east  Asia  persuaded  our forefathers  that  Singapore\r\n\r\noffered  greater  opportunities for a better  life  for\r\n\r\nthemselves and their families. They, and those who came\r\n\r\nafter them, created what we have in Singapore today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic can take just pride in our achievements\r\n\r\nwhen   we   compare  ourselves  with  other   countries\r\n\r\npossessing vaster land areas, larger populations and an\r\n\r\nabundance of natural resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world today, especially in the last 18 months,\r\n\r\nhas become an even more interdependent one. There is no\r\n\r\nescape from the effects of inflation and recession,  of\r\n\r\nmounting  unemployment and in many cases of terror  and\r\n\r\nviolence   visited   upon   the   innocent   and    the\r\n\r\nunsuspecting.   In   fact,   Singapore   has   suffered\r\n\r\nrelatively  little  from these afflictions  considering\r\n\r\nhow exposed a country we are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed because, firstly, traditionally we are\r\n\r\nan  entrepot port. Secondly, we are also a  centre  for\r\n\r\ntransport  and communications. Thirdly, since  the  PAP\r\n\r\nformed  the  government in 1959  we  have  embarked  on\r\n\r\nbecoming  a manufacturing centre, selling our wares  to\r\n\r\nthe  world. Fourthly, since the decision to do  so  was\r\n\r\ntaken  in  1968  we are well on the way to  becoming  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre. And now we are aiming  to  become  a\r\n\r\nbrains centre as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these developments result in the increasing\r\n\r\ninteraction  of  Singapore with other  countries.  What\r\n\r\nhappens   in   these  countries  must   inevitably   be\r\n\r\ntransmitted to us. Not all external developments affect\r\n\r\nus  adversely. In fact, the reverse often is the  case.\r\n\r\nWhen  other countries prosper, so do we. However,  when\r\n\r\nthey  suffer  high oil prices, high rates of  interest,\r\n\r\nlow   commodity  prices  and  a  slowdown  of  economic\r\n\r\nactivity,  we in turn suffer with them. To  put  it  in\r\n\r\nanother  way, when the world has the flu we can  hardly\r\n\r\nhope to escape from catching a cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to what extent we suffer does depend on\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic has interactions not only economically\r\n\r\nbut  also  politically with other  countries.  In  some\r\n\r\ninstances,  the  two  do  not  go  hand  in  hand.  The\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asian  political  scene  has  changed   very\r\n\r\ndramatically  in the last few years. The  American  and\r\n\r\nWestern\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmilitary  presence is diminishing. It is in the  nature\r\n\r\nof   power  politics  that  other  powers,  greater  or\r\n\r\nsmaller,  will seek to establish positions of influence\r\n\r\nsince  hegemony  is  not possible.  The  President  has\r\n\r\nreferred to the important role that ASEAN can  play  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  stability and peace in the region,  by  not\r\n\r\npermitting   external  powers  to  exploit  differences\r\n\r\nbetween  the  five  of  us:  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines, Singapore and Thailand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country is not only affected by external economic\r\n\r\nand  political developments. It is likewise exposed  to\r\n\r\nsocial  and  cultural influences from abroad,  such  as\r\n\r\nlong hair, high heel boots, broad belts, jeans and  the\r\n\r\nlike - I refer only to men's fashions since we have  at\r\n\r\nthe  present  time, no lady hon. Members. We  are  also\r\n\r\nexposed to the international traffic in drugs which  is\r\n\r\nmore pernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot shut our doors and windows upon the\r\n\r\noutside  world, for that would be the  end  of  us.  We\r\n\r\ncannot isolate ourselves. To survive and to progress we\r\n\r\nhave  to  keep  our minds open; we have to  learn  from\r\n\r\nothers, to adapt and to modernize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people reject modernization because they equate\r\n\r\nit  with  westernization.  However,  we  can  modernize\r\n\r\nwithout sacrificing our Asian identity. Some years ago,\r\n\r\nthe Professor of Malay Studies, Dr Syed Hussein Alatas,\r\n\r\nexplained  to  me the difference between modernization,\r\n\r\nwhich he applauded, and westernization, about which  he\r\n\r\nwas  suspicious. Said the Professor: `To  have  running\r\n\r\nwater  in your home is modernization. But to install  a\r\n\r\nlong-bath  and then stand in it to have a shower,  that\r\n\r\nis westernization.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to confine my remarks today about our\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans,  on how to  equip  them  with  the\r\n\r\nproper values to survive, progress and enjoy life in  a\r\n\r\nworld   that   has   become  increasingly   tough   and\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Education, the\r\n\r\nPresident   referred  to  the  restructuring   of   the\r\n\r\neducational system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  need  for in-service courses  to  familiarise\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers with the philosophy of the  new\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had so many changes in the system of\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore that perhaps we ought to declare\r\n\r\na  moratorium to see what structure we have got  before\r\n\r\nfurther  restructuring. However, other Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  such  as  my  colleagues from  Moulmein,  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah,  Paya Lebar and Jurong are more  familiar  and\r\n\r\ncompetent to deal with the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, however, with the values that our\r\n\r\nchildren are growing up with. What kind of values  will\r\n\r\nthey possess at the end of a six- or now perhaps seven-year primary school education? If I may say my piece, I\r\n\r\nam  in  favour of seven years. What will our children's\r\n\r\nperception  be  at  the end of another  four  years  of\r\n\r\nsecondary school and then, if they make the grade, of a\r\n\r\nfurther two years Pre-University schooling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not touch on university education which is\r\n\r\ndifferent in nature and concept and generates  problems\r\n\r\nof a different kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We became a sovereign state less than ten years ago.\r\n\r\nWe  are  literally a nation without a history,  without\r\n\r\nmemories,  such  as the Chinese, Japanese  and  Koreans\r\n\r\nhave  of each other, or the English, French and German,\r\n\r\nto  take another example. So, despite the existence  of\r\n\r\nthe  largest British naval base outside of the  British\r\n\r\nIsles   in  Singapore  and  its  fall  and  Singapore's\r\n\r\nmilitary occupation by the Japanese Imperial Forces for\r\n\r\nthree  and a half years. there were still people a  few\r\n\r\nyears ago, parents of young Singaporeans, who asked why\r\n\r\nwe needed the Singapore Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore perturbed by the decision of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  to  scrap  history  from   the\r\n\r\ncurriculum. Not because I used to teach the subject,  I\r\n\r\nno   longer  do,  but  because  I  believe  that  every\r\n\r\nSingapore  child  must know what  are  his  roots,  the\r\n\r\nantiquity and cultural\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nrichness  of the lands whence his forefathers came.  He\r\n\r\nwill  want to know how his parents and himself came  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  Singapore  and why it is a multiracial  society\r\n\r\nwith four official languages. As he or she rides in the\r\n\r\nNTUC  bus  he should know who were Raffles,  Balestier,\r\n\r\nBoon  Keng, Hong Lim or Kuo Chuan. He must know himself\r\n\r\nand be able to identify with Singapore. This, alas,  is\r\n\r\ngone when the retrograde step of abolishing history  in\r\n\r\nschools was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing against the new subject \"Education for\r\n\r\nLiving\"  which  my friend, the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nfor  Education, who sits in front of me made  available\r\n\r\nto  me. It is taught in the mother tongue of the  child\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a good thing. However, it appears  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncourse  in  community-living and is  not  designed  for\r\n\r\nnation-building.  It  is therefore  no  substitute  for\r\n\r\nhistory.   Both  could  be  included  in   the   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum:  the one to give our children the  cultural\r\n\r\nballast  which  our leaders so often  talk  about,  the\r\n\r\nother  to engender the civic consciousness to ease  the\r\n\r\nstrains  and  stresses of living in  a  congested  city\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young and ourselves as well, not so young, are\r\n\r\nconstantly  reminded  that  nobody  owes  Singapore   a\r\n\r\nliving.  Each and every one has to earn his keep.  That\r\n\r\nis  fine. Only by facing up to this hard fact  of  life\r\n\r\nand sharpening our competitive edge can we survive in a\r\n\r\nvery tough world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But life is not just a ratrace. Let us leave that\r\n\r\nrace  to  the rats.

I  recall  a  story  from  my\r\n\r\nchildhood  that  the  head of a household  fashioned  a\r\n\r\nwooden  bowl for his aged father to use as the old  man\r\n\r\nkept  breaking the ordinary rice bowl. One day he found\r\n\r\nhis  young  son chipping away at a piece of wood.  When\r\n\r\nquestioned the little boy replied that he was making  a\r\n\r\nwooden  bowl for his father to use when he  became  old\r\n\r\nlike grandfather. The father, thus shamed, gave the old\r\n\r\nman ordinary rice bowls to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to carry on, but we in Singapore are a\r\n\r\nsingular example of a nation state - modernizing, Asian\r\n\r\nand multiracial. Our economic problems and those of the\r\n\r\nrest  of the world notwithstanding, let us keep it that\r\n\r\nway for our children. And let us try to pass on to them\r\n\r\nsomething  of that \"graciousness\" referred  to  in  the\r\n\r\nAddendum on the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where else but in Singapore can we find an ethnic\r\n\r\nIndian,   born   in  India,  educated   in   Singapore,\r\n\r\npossessing  a  Science degree from  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (a  Master's degree in Marine  Biology)  and\r\n\r\nwriting beautiful love poems to his ethnic Chinese wife\r\n\r\nin an English language magazine? I do not\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\npropose to read out his poems today but, in view of the\r\n\r\nforthcoming  visit of our Foreign Minister  to  Peking,\r\n\r\nperhaps  Mr Speaker and hon. Members will bear with  me\r\n\r\nif I read three lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the east, where there is sunrise\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind must turn for the beginning\r\n\r\nof the world, in which only love matters.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">(Chandran Nair, Her World, February 1975, p. 27)</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poems are published in a local women's magazine.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps appropriate, considering that 1975  has\r\n\r\nbeen  designated United Nation's International  Women's\r\n\r\nYear. I hope that the additional fact that this is also\r\n\r\nthe  Year  of the Rabbit, which does not stop  at  two,\r\n\r\nwill  not  create any special problems for our Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I wish to express my\r\n\r\nthanks  and  support to the President for  his  Address\r\n\r\nlast Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Address to this\r\n\r\nHouse,  the  President  has made  an  analysis  of  the\r\n\r\nposition  of Singapore. This analysis is both  incisive\r\n\r\nand  easy to understand. It points out the crux of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  and it enables Singaporeans to understand  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  in  the  various Government ministries.  More\r\n\r\nimportant, Sir, the President has painted an optimistic\r\n\r\nforecast  of our economic prospects, and this  is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging  and  meaningful to Singaporeans  who  have\r\n\r\nmade their sacrifices in the national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a disordered world economic structure and under\r\n\r\nthe  influence  of  economic recession  and  inflation,\r\n\r\nother  countries  have  been  adversely  affected,  but\r\n\r\nSingapore's  growth  rate has been  comparatively  much\r\n\r\nbetter. Notwithstanding all this, we have taken several\r\n\r\nmeasures  to contain inflation so that our people  will\r\n\r\nnot  suffer  any  more hardship. As  a  result,  credit\r\n\r\nsqueeze   was  imposed  but  this  has  also  adversely\r\n\r\naffected our commerce and industries. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for us to be able to implement  with  proper\r\n\r\nflexibility  and  strategy  the  various  measures   to\r\n\r\ncounter inflation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  recession  for the interest of all the  people.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that under the enlightened leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and with the cooperation of peoples  of  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life,  all problems will be  solved  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.  As our President has said, in the second  half\r\n\r\nof the year our economy will turn for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch on education. Education is\r\n\r\na  matter  which requires a hundred years  of  planning\r\n\r\naccording  to  a  saying.  Every  country  regards  the\r\n\r\neducation  of  its  citizens  as  a  matter  of   prime\r\n\r\nimportance.  Every year we set aside  a  large  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  in  our Budget for expenditure on education.  It\r\n\r\nshows  how  much  importance the Government  attach  to\r\n\r\neducation. Furthermore, the civic organisations equally\r\n\r\nare attaching greater importance to education. We still\r\n\r\nhave   Boards  of  Directors  in  the  Government-aided\r\n\r\nschools.  These  schools are run on contributions  from\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public, and when they are affected  by\r\n\r\nurban  renewal,  then the school boards  will  have  to\r\n\r\nraise money to rebuild their schools elsewhere. This is\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  that  we  should  continue  to  encourage.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the various civic organisations also  have\r\n\r\nscholarships,  bursaries and study loans  available  to\r\n\r\nour  student  population. These,  together  with  those\r\n\r\navailable from the Government sources, Singaporeans can\r\n\r\nenjoy  equal opportunities in education. No matter  how\r\n\r\npoor  a student may be. he will be given an opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  higher education, so long as he is hardworking and\r\n\r\ntalented. In this way, we are able to make the best use\r\n\r\nof our only resource, that is our human resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, times are changing and so must our Education\r\n\r\nsystem change to adapt to the changing times. From  the\r\n\r\nAddendum  on the Ministry of Education, we are informed\r\n\r\nthat the outmoded legislation on education will undergo\r\n\r\nan  overhaul. We hope that in the process  of  amending\r\n\r\nthe legislation on Education, the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nwill  seek  the  views  of  the  people  concerned   or\r\n\r\ninterested in education, particularly the teachers'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nunions,  so that the new Education Act will be able  to\r\n\r\nmeet the present needs of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next major restructure of the Education system is\r\n\r\nthe   conversion   of  the  present  six-year   primary\r\n\r\neducation to a seven-year primary education,  with  the\r\n\r\nprovison to allow the brighter students to complete  in\r\n\r\nsix  years. The aim is correct and proper and, that is,\r\n\r\nto remove the fear among our primary school children of\r\n\r\nexaminations and to give them an opportunity to develop\r\n\r\nintellectually  and to make learning  more  interesting\r\n\r\nand  pleasant. There is a general concern among parents\r\n\r\non  the  question of how to assess the children  for  a\r\n\r\nseven-year or a six-year education. Furthermore,  there\r\n\r\nis  also  the question of restreaming. How  should  the\r\n\r\nstreaming  be  done in the secondary  stage?  If  there\r\n\r\nshould be any erroneous assessment or restreaming, will\r\n\r\nit be possible for a student to change from the science\r\n\r\nstream  to  the academic stream, or from  the  academic\r\n\r\nstream to the technical stream, so that our talents are\r\n\r\nnot   misused  or  wasted?  I  hope  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation   will,   in  preparing  this   restructuring\r\n\r\nprogramme, also give parents the opportunity  to  clear\r\n\r\ntheir  doubts or misgivings. This is something which  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Motion in the name of the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Keat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Kim Keat expressing our thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident  for  his  speech  at  the  opening  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament.  In  his speech and in  the  Addendum,  the\r\n\r\nPresident has touched upon matters relating to Defence,\r\n\r\nFinance,  Foreign  Affairs, Education,  Communications,\r\n\r\nCulture  and  others.  He has  indicated  much  in  the\r\n\r\nAddendum to show that we want to build a more just  and\r\n\r\nfair  society.  This policy speech forms the  blueprint\r\n\r\nfor  our nation building. This speech is also what  all\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are interested in our welfare and  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding should pay attention to.\r\n\r\n                     \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on Finance touched upon the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision to extend the  five  years'\r\n\r\ntax  concession to pioneer industries to ten years\r\n\r\nin   order   to   encourage   more   petrochemical\r\n\r\nindustries and other industries in order  to  draw\r\n\r\nlarge sums of investment into Singapore, and  also\r\n\r\nto encourage the education and training of skilled\r\n\r\nworkers. Therefore, these various concessions  are\r\n\r\nvery good indeed. I hope this concessionary policy\r\n\r\nwill   be   able  to  attract  more  international\r\n\r\ninvestments  into  Singapore  so  as  to   promote\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic development and bring  about\r\n\r\nmore  employment opportunities for the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on Education, mention is made of\r\n\r\nthe changes in the Education system. For instance,\r\n\r\nprimary school education will be extended to seven\r\n\r\nyears.  Those  students with  good  results  could\r\n\r\ncomplete their primary education in six years, and\r\n\r\nthe Primary\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSchool  Leaving  Examination  will  be  a  grading\r\n\r\nexercise  and not a kind of examination to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  one has passed or not. This will be  some\r\n\r\nsort  of  an  encouragement to the primary  school\r\n\r\npupils and will arouse their interest in learning.\r\n\r\nChanging the Education system to suit the  child's\r\n\r\nability  is  good  as  it  provides  him  with  an\r\n\r\neducation  that  will  suit his  aptitude  and  so\r\n\r\nassures  him of a better chance of getting  a  job\r\n\r\nafter completing his primary school education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
