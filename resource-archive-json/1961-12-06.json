P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when\r\n\r\nthe adjournment was taken last night, I was on the\r\n\r\nquestion of citizenship and Singapore citizens. To put\r\n\r\nthe matter in its proper perspective, perhaps you\r\n\r\nmight allow me to go into the question of Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship and how Singapore citizenship is acquired,\r\n\r\nbecause one of the difficulties that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore are facing over the question of merger is\r\n\r\nwhat will happen to them as Singapore citizens when\r\n\r\nthese so-called constitutional arrangements have been\r\n\r\neffected. It is not only an important constitutional\r\n\r\nissue, but even more important from the public point\r\n\r\nof view, it seems to be an emotional issue. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit is only fair that this question is completely and\r\n\r\nfully ventilated in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand Singapore citizenship. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, it is possible to acquire it under four heads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) You become a Singapore citizen by birth;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) You become a Singapore citizen by descent;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) You become a Singapore citizen by registration; and\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) You become a Singapore citizen by naturalization.\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Once a person has acquired Singapore citizenship under\r\n\r\nany  of  these categories, he is a Singapore  citizen,\r\n\r\nand  so  far  as  he is concerned and so  long  as  he\r\n\r\nremains  a Singapore citizen, he has absolutely  equal\r\n\r\nrights.  Singapore citizens all have absolutely  equal\r\n\r\nrights  one  with  the other. There is  absolutely  no\r\n\r\nquestion  that  there  is  any  difference  between  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen by birth and a Singapore citizen  by\r\n\r\nregistration, descent, or naturalization.  There  is\r\n\r\nonly  one difference between these four categories  of\r\n\r\ncitizens.  First, Mr Speaker. Sir, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasize  the word \"categories\" of citizens  and  not\r\n\r\n\"classes\"  of  citizens. They  are  not  \"classes\"  of\r\n\r\ncitizens,  but \"categories\" of citizens, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  manner  in which citizenship is acquired.  Having\r\n\r\nacquired  it, they are equal and the same in the  eyes\r\n\r\nof the law, constitutionally or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise. But there is one important distinction\r\n\r\nbetween a citizen by birth and a citizen by descent on\r\n\r\nthe one hand, and a citizen by registration and a\r\n\r\ncitizen by naturalization on the other. Whereas it\r\n\r\nwould be impossible for the Government to deprive a\r\n\r\ncitizen by birth or by descent of his citizenship, it\r\n\r\nwould be possible for the Government to deprive a\r\n\r\ncitizen by naturalization or by registration if the\r\n\r\ncitizen in these latter categories should behave\r\n\r\nhimself in a manner contrary to the interests of the\r\n\r\nState. That is not a provision peculiar to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt is a provision which every civilised country has in\r\n\r\nits laws, because it is only right that when a person\r\n\r\nis given the privilege of becoming a citizen of a\r\n\r\nState, he should continue to behave in a manner which\r\n\r\nwill not be to the detriment of the State. Therefore,\r\n\r\nquite rightly, every civilised State has reserved unto\r\n\r\nitself the right to deprive a citizen by naturalization\r\n\r\nor by registration of his citizenship if he should\r\n\r\nmisbehave. That, Mr Speaker, Sir, does not make him a\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizen nor a third-class citizen. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am a Singapore citizen by registration,\r\n\r\nhaving been born in the Federation. I do not, for one\r\n\r\nmoment, consider myself a second-class citizen. My\r\n\r\nstatus in the eyes of the law and so far as my rights\r\n\r\nare concerned are absolutely co-equal with those of a\r\n\r\nperson born in Singapore or of a person whose parent\r\n\r\nwas a Singapore citizen and who was born outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having sketched that, Mr Speaker, then the question\r\n\r\narises  whether  amongst Singapore citizens  themselves\r\n\r\nthere is inequality. There is absolutely no inequality.\r\n\r\nIf  anybody in Singapore is putting out the proposition\r\n\r\nthat   although  there  are  different  categories   of\r\n\r\ncitizens by virtue of the fact that there are different\r\n\r\ncategories   of  citizenship,  therefore,   there   are\r\n\r\ndifferent  classes of citizenship, that is an  absolute\r\n\r\nlie  calculated  to do a great deal of emotional  harm,\r\n\r\nand the motives behind putting out such a proposition\r\n\r\ncannot be strictly honourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these constitutional arrangements go through,\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremain Singapore citizens, and there can be no question\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  going to be a second class citizen.  I  am\r\n\r\nabsolutely convinced of that. My category is  the  same\r\n\r\nas  the category of citizens who were born in China  or\r\n\r\nIndia  or  Ceylon or any other part of the  world,  and\r\n\r\nwho, by virtue of adequate residence in Singapore,  has\r\n\r\nacquired  citizenship by registration. What happens  to\r\n\r\nme  and  to  people like me who were not  born  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation but outside the Federation, say,  in  China,\r\n\r\nor  India or Ceylon or any other part of the world, is\r\n\r\nthis -  that  we will all remain Singapore citizens  and\r\n\r\nexercise  our  rights  as  Singapore  citizens  in  any\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangements that will have been arrived\r\n\r\nat  between  the  Federation Government and  ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat  will  then be the net result so far as  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship is concerned after -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - merger, as the Minister for Finance likes\r\n\r\nto  call  it?  Mr  Speaker, Sir, as I  understand  the\r\n\r\nposition, it will be this, that when the State Assembly\r\n\r\nelections are conducted, I will be allowed a vote;  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the Federal elections are conducted - and for  that\r\n\r\npurpose, I take it, if it is going to be 15 seats,  the\r\n\r\nisland  of  Singapore will be divided into 15 electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions, or wards as the case may be - and if I  should\r\n\r\nso  desire,  I can offer myself for election.  What  is\r\n\r\nmore,  I  can vote for myself, if I choose to stand  in\r\n\r\nthe  ward where my name appears on the register.  Where\r\n\r\nthen  does  the proposition propounded by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis come in about second-class citizenship? If the\r\n\r\nproposition  is  that  a Singapore  citizen  becomes  a\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizen by virtue of the fact that  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed to vote in the Federation or to stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  in the Federation, and if that and that  only\r\n\r\nis   the  reason  for  stating  the  proposition   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  are  second-class  citizens,  then\r\n\r\nmight  I suggest to the Barisan Sosialis, if they  look\r\n\r\nat it from the Federation point of view, that a Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen could equally say then that because he  is  not\r\n\r\nallowed to stand for election in Singapore or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  vote  in  Singapore, he himself is a second-class\r\n\r\ncitizen.  The  proposition  is  too  absurd   to   be\r\n\r\ncontemplated.  Why then do we labour the  point  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  citizen is inferior  to  the  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen?  Can  it be that my friend, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  has a complex about himself?  Has  he  a\r\n\r\ncomplex  that  a Singapore citizen is inferior  to  a\r\n\r\nFederal  citizen? Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself have  no\r\n\r\nsuch  complex. I feel that I am equal to the  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen,  if not superior. And why should I not  feel\r\n\r\nit if I am so inclined to feel it? I do not think the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister is going to object  to  my\r\n\r\nthinking  that  I  am  superior  and  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship is superior to Federal citizenship. It is\r\n\r\na matter of opinion and I am entitled to mine. But if\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis  propounds  as  a  fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizenship  is   inferior   to   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship, that, Mr Speaker, Sir, is not true.  It\r\n\r\nis not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rung up this morning by a number of people.\r\n\r\nThey  said,  \"We  were very glad you  clarified  this\r\n\r\npoint because we were in doubt.\" A further point  was\r\n\r\nasked  of  me:  can a Singapore citizen  sit  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament? I said, \"Surely you have read the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper; surely it has all been explained.\" It is\r\n\r\namazing,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the amount of  ignorance\r\n\r\nthere is in Singapore about these matters, and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this ignorance, a lot of misunderstandings\r\n\r\nare  current.  I  said, \"Of course, if  you  feel  so\r\n\r\ninclined,  if you wish to stand for election  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament, you will be entitled to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing in the White Paper which I can  see\r\n\r\nwhich  goes  against  it.  In  fact,  if  I  remember\r\n\r\nrightly,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  an  express\r\n\r\nstatement to that effect. In paragraph 14, page 4  of\r\n\r\nPaper Cmd. 33 of 1961, it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore citizens will vote in Singapore for\r\n\r\ntheir   representatives   to   the   new   Federation\r\n\r\nParliament and the citizens of the present Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  will  vote in the present Federation  for\r\n\r\ntheir  representatives to the  same  new  Federation\r\n\r\nParliament.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom  that  paragraph it seems  to  me  obvious  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  will  vote  and  can  stand   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in respect of the 15 constituencies  which\r\n\r\nwill   send  their  representatives  to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament. Even from that point of view, there is no\r\n\r\nquestion of a second-class citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further question was raised whether the words\r\n\r\n\"Federal  national\" have been introduced  into  these\r\n\r\nproceedings with a view to confusing the  issues  and\r\n\r\nthat  a  Federal  national is not  really  a  Federal\r\n\r\nnational;  he  might  be  a  British  subject,   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  being a British subject it  is  something\r\n\r\nderogatory. I think it was the Member for  Anson  who\r\n\r\ntook  the view that a Federal national really equates\r\n\r\nto  a British subject. Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper says is this. A Singapore citizen and  a\r\n\r\nFederal  citizen will both become Federal  nationals.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment the phrase \"Federal national\" is  not\r\n\r\nknown  to  the  Constitution  of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. I take it that it will be necessary to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution to give the phrase a place  in  the\r\n\r\nstatute. I take it that it will be done. Once that is\r\n\r\ndone,   then  the  term  \"Federal  national\"  has   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional significance, and under the Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution,   a   Federal  national   will   be   a\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  citizen and not a British subject.  The\r\n\r\nBritish  are wise people. They amended their  British\r\n\r\nNationality Laws - I think it was in 1947  or  1948;  I\r\n\r\ncannot  remember  the exact date - because,  in  their\r\n\r\nwisdom, they knew that the term \"British subject\" was\r\n\r\nnot  viewed  with favour by people in the  Dominions,\r\n\r\nand therefore they devised an arrangement under their\r\n\r\nBritish  Nationality  Laws and coined  a  new  phrase\r\n\r\n\"Commonwealth  citizen\". So that a  Federal  national\r\n\r\nwill   become   a   Commonwealth   citizen.   Now   a\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  citizen  will  have  the  status  of  a\r\n\r\nBritish  subject.  Therefore, the  Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nargued  that  if  he  has the  status  of  a  British\r\n\r\nsubject,  he  is then a British subject.  With  great\r\n\r\nrespect  to the Member for Anson - he is my  senior  in\r\n\r\nmany  ways - I  beg  to disagree with him.  Having  the\r\n\r\nstatus of a British subject does not necessarily mean\r\n\r\nthat you are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  British subject. What it means is this, that if  you\r\n\r\nshould  happen to be in Great Britain, then having  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of a British subject would entitle you  to  all\r\n\r\nthe  privileges that a British subject would  enjoy  in\r\n\r\nthe  British Isles. That is all it means, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may make my point clearer and bring it home to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson. Recently we have  read  in  the\r\n\r\npapers that Japanese nationals will be given the status\r\n\r\nof  South  Africans in South Africa when  they  are  in\r\n\r\nSouth  Africa. I ask the Member for Anson, does he,  in\r\n\r\nall  seriousness, advance the argument that because  of\r\n\r\nthis  that Japanese nationals will become south African\r\n\r\nsubjects? I think the Japanese people will be the first\r\n\r\nto  disavow  it.  What  it merely  means  is  this.  If\r\n\r\nJapanese nationals have been given by the South African\r\n\r\nGovernment in their wisdom the status of South Africans\r\n\r\nin  South  Africa, it merely means that they  can  ride\r\n\r\nwith  the  whites in their buses; and if  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nwant it that way, they are welcome to it. Why should we\r\n\r\nobject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand from the papers that the People's\r\n\r\nRepublic of China has applied for that status. Both the\r\n\r\nextreme  Right  and the extreme Left in Asia  want  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  South Africans, and if they  want  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, who are we to say that it is a derogatory\r\n\r\nstatus? But the curious position is this. We have heard\r\n\r\na  lot  about the Afro-Asian conferences. It is  a  bit\r\n\r\npeculiar  when two nations in Asia - one on  the  extreme\r\n\r\nRight and the other on the extreme Left - should seek the\r\n\r\nstatus  of South Africans. So it is difficult  to  know\r\n\r\nwhere  we  are in this modern world. The extreme  Right\r\n\r\nand the extreme Left want to ride in the same bus as  a\r\n\r\nSouth  African, but they do not want to ride with their\r\n\r\nblack brothers. So when we talk about Socialism and the\r\n\r\nextreme Right, I, as one who does not subscribe to  any\r\n\r\nsuch   particular  political  philosophy,  am   a   bit\r\n\r\nconfused. But that is only by the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, let us not say that a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen is a second-class citizen. Let us not\r\n\r\neven go one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter and say third-class citizens. This category  was\r\n\r\nintroduced yesterday. The point was made that a Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen  is a first-class citizen, a Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nis a second-class citizen. Yesterday the point was made\r\n\r\nthat  there  are third-class citizens.  The  point  and\r\n\r\npurpose  of  that  statement was to draw  a  difference\r\n\r\nbetween   Singapore   citizens   by   birth   and    by\r\n\r\nregistration. According to some Members of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  it  seems that citizens by registration  are\r\n\r\nthird-class  citizens,  and in that  category  is  your\r\n\r\nhumble servant. I do not accept that statement.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  true. It is not right. I would like Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis to quote chapter and verse because  I\r\n\r\nam personally vitally interested in that issue, because\r\n\r\nif  any  constitutional arrangement arrived at  by  the\r\n\r\nHon, the  Prime  Minister with  the  Federation  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister were to make me into a third-class citizen,  I\r\n\r\nwould be the first to object to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

There are other important issues to be discussed\r\n\r\nand  I  hope  I  am  confining myself strictly  to  the\r\n\r\namendment. I will have something more to say  when  the\r\n\r\nmain motion is debated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the adjournment yesterday, I was fumbling around\r\n\r\nwith  the Wartawan to find a statement made by Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  to  the effect that he and  his  Party  were\r\n\r\nwilling to go to the people of Singapore to explain  to\r\n\r\nthem  the whole position and obtain their support.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  is  a tall statement for anyone to make. For  one\r\n\r\nperson  to  say  that  he can convince  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  envy him if he can do that.  But  if  he\r\n\r\nexercises that power in the right direction, he will do\r\n\r\na  power  of  good for this country and  I  have  every\r\n\r\nconfidence that his intention is to do a power of  good\r\n\r\nto this country. But to put the record clear and right,\r\n\r\nlet me quote him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are fully aware of the difficulties that face us in\r\n\r\nour struggle for Malayan unity.

You see,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhow  difficult it is to get a point across. How can the\r\n\r\npeople in the coffee-shops understand anything when the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, who is himself a trained lawyer,  and\r\n\r\nI  myself - I  hope that I can say that I  am  a  trained\r\n\r\nlawyer - used  to  the use of words, are  trying  to  put\r\n\r\nwords   together   in  a  manner  which   people   will\r\n\r\nunderstand?

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have already told  the  House\r\n\r\nthat at the moment the phrase \"Federal national\" is not\r\n\r\nknown  to the Federal Constitution - at least I have  not\r\n\r\nseen  it  in  the Federal Constitution. As  this  is  a\r\n\r\nphrase  coined  as  a  result of  these  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements, it will therefore become necessary - I have\r\n\r\ntold the House; I may be wrong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Surely it must\r\n\r\nbe so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - it will become necessary to amend the\r\n\r\nFederal Constitution. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  must  know  all this. Let us  not  look  at  the\r\n\r\nFederal Constitution as something which is going to  be\r\n\r\nstatic.   It  follows  the  will  of  the  people.   No\r\n\r\nconstitution is static. It moves with the will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  if the will of the people  is  that  this\r\n\r\nConstitution is to be amended, it will be amended;  and\r\n\r\nit  will  be amended to this effect, that wherever  the\r\n\r\nphrase  \"Federal citizen\" appears, the phrase  \"Federal\r\n\r\nnational\" shall be substituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is only my suggestion. They might amend it in some\r\n\r\nother  way.  But  certainly the  Constitution  must  be\r\n\r\namended  to carry with it the conception of  a  Federal\r\n\r\nnational  and  to  give it statutory effect  and  legal\r\n\r\nconcept.  That  must  be  done.  I  cannot,  therefore,\r\n\r\nunderstand the Member for Anson saying that because the\r\n\r\nConstitution  now  does not have  the  phrase  \"Federal\r\n\r\nnational\",  how  can  Singapore  citizens  sit  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Assembly? If this Constitution is  amended  to\r\n\r\nbring  in the phrase \"Federal national\", and because  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen is a Federal national, therefore,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of the fact that he is a Federal national, he is\r\n\r\nentitled to sit in the Federal Parliament. Surely it is\r\n\r\na  simple  proposition. I would have thought  that  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Anson  would  have  been  the  first   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  it. If he cannot understand  it,  how  much\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  it is going to be for persons  in  the\r\n\r\ncoffee-shops  to  understand  it.  And  I  beg  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, if they are serious in these constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements - and  they are of vital importance  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry - that they put this across to the people.

What  does  the\r\n\r\nMember for Upper Serangoon mean by that? If you  are  a\r\n\r\nsocialist, you are a socialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And I thought that one of the basic tenets\r\n\r\nof socialism is that once you are a true socialist, you\r\n\r\ncease  to  be  a  Chinese  or an  Indian.  You  are  an\r\n\r\ninternationalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, that is not true after the\r\n\r\n22nd Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not know about this Congress. My\r\n\r\ntheory  is  that  way back one of the basic  tenets  of\r\n\r\nsocialism  is the international creed. Once you  are  a\r\n\r\nsocialist, you have no race, no creed, no country.  Why\r\n\r\ntalk  about the Chinese? Mr Speaker, Sir, a  socialist\r\n\r\nis  not  a chauvinist. And if a socialist talks like  a\r\n\r\nchauvinist, what does one make of him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is just one last thing I wish\r\n\r\nto  state.  The  proposals  before  the  House  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  merger and the other allied motions  that\r\n\r\nare  being  discussed  are in the nature  of  temporary\r\n\r\nmeasures.  They have not reached any form of  finality.\r\n\r\nIt is just an immediate step to something which we want\r\n\r\nin the future. With that intent and purpose, that seems\r\n\r\nto  be  the position. I give notice now that  when  the\r\n\r\nproper  time  comes,  Mr  Speaker,  I  shall  move  an\r\n\r\namendment to item 3 on the Order Paper, under the  name\r\n\r\nof   the  Hon, the  Prime  Minister -  White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nReunification of Singapore and Federation of Malaya:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House, accepts the heads of agreement set\r\n\r\nout in'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

There  are  two parts  to  his  amendment.\r\n\r\nFirst,  that Singapore should merge with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  as  the  twelfth State;  second,  that  all\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens   should   automatically    become\r\n\r\nFederation citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first deal with the first limb of the\r\n\r\namendment - that Singapore should be the twelfth State of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation? Let me refer him to a joint  statement\r\n\r\nissued  on  16th  September  this  year  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of the Federation of Malaya and myself.  That\r\n\r\nstatement said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The two Prime Ministers are satisfied that all\r\n\r\nlegitimate local and special interests of the people in\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories can and will be safeguarded  with\r\n\r\nthe   merger  of  Singapore  as  a  State  within   the\r\n\r\nFederation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  want  to  emphasise  these words,  Sir -  \"merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a State within the Federation\". These  are\r\n\r\nnot  casual  words uttered at Press Conferences  or  in\r\n\r\nconversations. These are words carefully  chosen  after\r\n\r\nscrutiny  by officials of both sides. They  carry  with\r\n\r\nthem  the full import of their ordinary meaning.  There\r\n\r\ncan  be no doubt whatsoever that Singapore will be  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth  State  of the new Federation. I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether there is any special virtue in being the  12th,\r\n\r\n13th, 14th or 15th State, but I can assure hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat  if  it  is the number 13 that they  are  against,\r\n\r\nperhaps  for  some unhappy connotation of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and so on, I shall ensure that we shall  take\r\n\r\npride of place before the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable play over the word\r\n\r\n\"merger\".  Members of the Opposition have  for  various\r\n\r\nreasons  alleged  that the proposals contained  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 do not constitute a merger\r\n\r\nof  Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. There  was\r\n\r\nsome  talk of complete merger like Penang and  Malacca.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan  Sosialis talked of it. Others  talked  of\r\n\r\nabsolute  merger, whatever that may mean. It is  useful\r\n\r\nto  note the title of the Memorandum which contains the\r\n\r\nHeads of Agreement agreed to between the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation and ourselves. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'MEMORANDUM SETTING OUT HEADS OF AGREEMENT FOR A MERGER BETWEEN THE FEDERATION OF MALAYA AND SINGAPORE'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Not  what I said, Sir, but what the Tunku and I jointly\r\n\r\nsaid.  The joint statement issued in London at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the  Tunku's first series of discussions  with  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the United Kingdom - I am quoting  now\r\n\r\nfrom the official communique - says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister [U.K. and Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nMinisters] took note with satisfaction of the heads  of\r\n\r\nagreement  recently negotiated between the  Governments\r\n\r\nof  Malaya and Singapore for merging Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Three   Ministers   of   the   Federation   of   Malaya\r\n\r\nGovernment - the   Prime  Minister,  the   Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, and the Finance Minister - and the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the  United  Kingdom  together  with  the\r\n\r\nSecretaries  of State, for Commonwealth Relations,  for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies, and for Defence - one Scots man and  three\r\n\r\nEnglishmen - have described these heads of  agreement  as\r\n\r\nmerging Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. Sir, I\r\n\r\ndid  not  take the liberty of bringing in  the  Shorter\r\n\r\nOxford  Dictionary  into  this  Chamber,  but  I  trust\r\n\r\nMembers  will  believe me when I say that my  secretary\r\n\r\nhas accurately copied the definition of \"merger\" in the\r\n\r\nShorter  Oxford  Dictionary. \"Merger\", it  says,  means\r\n\r\n\"combine or to merge.\" And the word \"merge\" is  defined\r\n\r\nas  \"to  cause  something to lose its own character  or\r\n\r\nidentity in something else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right. They shall both\r\n\r\nlose   their   identity  for  Pan-Malayan  purpose   as\r\n\r\nnationals  of the new Federation. It is no use  shaking\r\n\r\nheads. I have documents written from the pen with green\r\n\r\nink  of  the  former Chief Minister  of  Singapore  who\r\n\r\nreferred  to \"nationals\" of Singapore. We learned  from\r\n\r\nhim, Sir, as we learn from everybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is part of the problems of the Communists that\r\n\r\nthey have to find metaphysical arguments to explain why\r\n\r\na merger is not a merger. They have agreed to merger on\r\n\r\nprinciple. For years, since 1945, they have agreed with\r\n\r\nus  on  this in their written documents, which we  have\r\n\r\npublished  from  time to time and will  republish.  But\r\n\r\nthey cannot afford to admit that the heads of agreement\r\n\r\ncontained  in this Command Paper are a merger  without,\r\n\r\nat  the same time, having to accept them and having  to\r\n\r\nland  themselves  in an impossible  position.  For  the\r\n\r\nfurtherance  of  the Communist cause, it  would  be  an\r\n\r\nimpossible position. But not for the furtherance of the\r\n\r\nsocialist democratic cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on the other side, particularly Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, have termed these conditions  as  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type of merger. Merger requires\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo parties to an agreement. The proposals contained in\r\n\r\nthis  White Paper are no more the P.A.P. type than  the\r\n\r\nTunku's  type of merger. If it were all purely  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthere  would have been a different White Paper.  If  it\r\n\r\nwere  all  purely Tunku, there would also have  been  a\r\n\r\nvery  different  White  Paper.  But  this  White  Paper\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  widest  consensus  of  opinion   after\r\n\r\nthorough  and frank discussions. It represents  how  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  merger can be achieved with the least possible\r\n\r\nupset for either side. I have waded through 12 days  of\r\n\r\nthis  merger  debate and I have not heard  anybody  nor\r\n\r\nread anybody having the temerity to call this the Tunku\r\n\r\ntype of merger and then set out to tear it to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is not responsible to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Sir, how kind, courteous,\r\n\r\ncorrect  and proper! But may I suggest that  when  they\r\n\r\ntalk  of feudalistic leaders and so on, obviously  they\r\n\r\nare not inhibited by these considerations in this House\r\n\r\nor  outside?  I will say that whatever the follies  and\r\n\r\nthe errors of the Barisan Sosialis, they not understand\r\n\r\nthe realities of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government is a democratic and\r\n\r\ntolerant  Government.  More important,  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   also   a  democratic   and   tolerant\r\n\r\nGovernment. But more important from the Communist point\r\n\r\nof  view,  the  Barisan Sosialis  and  their  Communist\r\n\r\nfriends  understand that the P.A.P. Government  has  no\r\n\r\nCongo-seasoned troops to deal with any emergency  which\r\n\r\nthey can create. But the Federation Government has.  We\r\n\r\nhave  only got 817 soldiers in the S.I.R. to  back  our\r\n\r\nwill.   And   from  the  point  of  view  of   Leninist\r\n\r\nrevolution,, it is an easy Government  to  deal  with.\r\n\r\nThere are only 817 soldiers under the joint control  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs and the U.K. Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had occasion to describe the Member for Nee\r\n\r\nSoon, as one of the most intelligent of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> One of the brightest Barisan stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is one of the brightest stars.\r\n\r\nHe  showed his brightness when he called the  Tunku  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber \"a statesman\". Sir, the smiling, friendly\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Federation of Malaya is what  the\r\n\r\nMalays call him, \"Papa Kemerdekaan\". The Member for Nee\r\n\r\nSoon   obviously  understands  that   the   Tunku   has\r\n\r\nsufficient  battalions  of troops  and  jungle  bashing\r\n\r\npolicemen  to  ensure  that the people  of  Malaya  can\r\n\r\nafford to relax, smile and laugh, despite the venom and\r\n\r\nthe frustration of the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khrushchev from time to time beats up Albania. Instead of taking on Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese, he takes up General Hoxha and the Albanians. He abuses, castigates and threatens Albania. But the whole world knows that what he wants to do is to abuse, castigate and threaten, not small Albania, but big China. Unfortunately for Mr Khrushchev, big China takes no notice of him. So like Mr Khrushchev, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, I am sorry to hear, are still taking the  old\r\n\r\nRussian line instead of getting modern and catching  up\r\n\r\nwith  the Chinese line. The Barisan Sosialis have  gone\r\n\r\non abusing the proposals in Cmd. Paper 33 as the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntype  merger. Sir, we do not mind being little  Albania\r\n\r\nfor brave men from the Barisan Sosialis - revolutionaries\r\n\r\nwho  talk  fiercely of dealing with the  gentle  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment in Singapore, while they coo about statesmen\r\n\r\nin  Kuala Lumpur, hoping thereby that the statesmen  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  may be kind to them when  the  time  for\r\n\r\nfinal  settlement  comes. But I  wonder,  Sir,  whether\r\n\r\nmerely  a few sweet words with no supporting action  to\r\n\r\nprove   the  sincerity  of  those  words  will  deceive\r\n\r\nanybody, either in Singapore or in Kuala Lumpur. I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the  Member for Queenstown,  who  I  hope  will\r\n\r\ninform  the  Member for Nee Soon, that  the  people  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur are as knowledgeable of the ways  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  as the people in Singapore. The leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis may find this out to their  great\r\n\r\ncost when the day for reckoning comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You hope so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have expected Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis to spout the Communist  line  and\r\n\r\nsay that whatever we propose is phoney. I even expected\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson to appeal in the name of decency,\r\n\r\nfrom  human beings to human beings, not to corrupt  the\r\n\r\nword  \"merger\".  He used the word \"corrupt\".  A  sacred\r\n\r\nword,  said he. And it is. It is the political  battle-cry that has kept the nationalists, the Communists, and\r\n\r\nall the other anti-colonialists together all these long\r\n\r\nyears.  He  said that we corrupted that  word  when  we\r\n\r\ndescribed  it, not I, Sir, the Tunku and I - \"China\"  and\r\n\r\n\"Albania\"  - described these heads of  agreement  for  a\r\n\r\nmerger  between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\nBut  these are people who are not particularly  precise\r\n\r\nwith     their    use    of    words.    The    Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - sometimes, but not always. Only  sometimes  is\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson  not  precise.  Usually  he  is\r\n\r\nprecise, Sir,I remember once we were entertained to an\r\n\r\nextremely scholarly treatise on the meaning of \"on  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of\"  or  \"after  consultation  with\"  in   this\r\n\r\nChamber.  You  will remember, Sir,  that  we  were  all\r\n\r\nrefreshed  in our knowledge of the law as a  result  of\r\n\r\nit.  But when people get abusive, after they have  lost\r\n\r\nthe argument, they cease to be precise about the use of\r\n\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was disappointed to hear the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  yesterday. He always tries to be precise  in  his\r\n\r\nwords, lie spent a great deal of time yesterday arguing\r\n\r\nthat  the  merger is not a merger. Sir, I cannot  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him. It is not for me to tell him the meaning  of\r\n\r\nmeaning.  He  has  no  doubt  read  a  scholarly   book\r\n\r\nentitled,  \"The meaning of meaning\". A  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nclear  thinking  is  necessary over  this  very  simple\r\n\r\nsubject.  The  book  is so common and  sensible  as  to\r\n\r\nbecome  quite erudite. The Member for Farrer Park  will\r\n\r\nrecall,  in  \"Alice  through the looking  glass\",  what\r\n\r\nHumpty Dumpty said to Alice. \"When I use a word,\"  said\r\n\r\nHumpty Dumpty in a rather scornful tone, \"it means just\r\n\r\nwhat  I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.\" \"The\r\n\r\nquestion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis,\"  said  Alice [That is me] \"whether  you  can  make\r\n\r\nwords  mean  so  many different things.\" \"The  question\r\n\r\nis,\"  said Humpty Dumpty, \"which is to be master.  That\r\n\r\nis all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I first started the study of law some years\r\n\r\nago,  the  first  few  lessons  I  had  to  study  were\r\n\r\nentitled,  \"Language and the Law\". A brilliant  teacher\r\n\r\nexpounded   to   me  with  considerable  lucidity   the\r\n\r\nimportance of being precise in the terms we use.  These\r\n\r\nlessons, for the benefit of the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nand the Member for Anson, were later published. I think\r\n\r\nit was contemporaneously published in the Law Quarterly\r\n\r\nReview,  \"Language and the Law\" - Glanville L.  Williams,\r\n\r\n1945,  Law  Q.R.  The  first  lesson  was  devoted   to\r\n\r\nexplaining  that  any  word  can  have  three  possible\r\n\r\nmeanings. First, the speaker using the word intends  it\r\n\r\nto  mean.  Second, what the meaning which the  listener\r\n\r\nhearing  it  interprets it to mean. Third, the  meaning\r\n\r\ncommonly or widely accepted of the word by the majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  Sir,  let us take  this  simple  word\r\n\r\n\"peace\". When Mr Khrushchev talks of \"world peace\", he\r\n\r\nmeans  a  situation in which his enemies in the Western\r\n\r\nworld  are  slowly  crumbling and  decaying  under  the\r\n\r\npressure  of Soviet technological and economic  advance\r\n\r\nand the pressure of Soviet propaganda, and with all the\r\n\r\npresent neutral countries joining or slowly won over to\r\n\r\nhis  Communist camp. When President Kennedy  hears  Mr\r\n\r\nKhrushchev talk of \"world peace\", he understands  peace\r\n\r\ndifferently. To him, peace means a situation where  the\r\n\r\ncapitalist world is naturally expanding by the  process\r\n\r\nof  free competition based on the inter-play of selfish\r\n\r\nindividual  motives,  and  a  situation  in  which  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  are  contained in a tight concord  of  pro-Western  and  anti-Communist allies, and from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime  satellite countries like Hungary and Poland break\r\n\r\nout   in   successful  revolts  against   the   Russian\r\n\r\ntyrannical masters. So that a simple word like \"peace\",\r\n\r\nwhen  Khrushchev  says  it, means  to  him  one  thing.\r\n\r\nKennedy listening to it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediately thinks of another, and the majority of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the world understand it quite  differently.\r\n\r\nWhen  they think of peace, they want a situation  where\r\n\r\nthe  diabolical  and ruthless process of  struggle  and\r\n\r\nattrition  between  the Communist and  the  Capitalists\r\n\r\nworlds,  where  one system is intent on destroying  the\r\n\r\nother, ceases, and human ingenuity and intelligence ate\r\n\r\nspent  on  fruitful research to make life  happier  and\r\n\r\nmore meaningful for everyone without fear of war or the\r\n\r\nthreat of war. So Mr Speaker, Sir, a simple word  like\r\n\r\n\"peace\" can mean three different things:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To Mr Khrushchev when he uses it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To Mr Kennedy when he hears Mr Khrushchev use it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To the vast majority of mankind who understand it\r\n\r\nto mean what it ordinarily mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, Sir, as the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nused  the  word  \"merger\". When he said  it,  he  meant\r\n\r\nmerger like Penang or Malacca, Johore or Perak, or  any\r\n\r\none  of  the  other  11 States in the  Federation.  Any\r\n\r\nvariation  from  these  terms  giving  Singapore   more\r\n\r\nreserved  powers and preserving the rights of Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   who   are   otherwise  not   qualified   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  under  the  laws  of  citizenship  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   and,  at  the  same  time,   giving   them\r\n\r\nautomatically the nationality of the new Federation, he\r\n\r\ndoes not understand that to be merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis first talked of merger,\r\n\r\nthey  meant merger like Penang and Malacca. Since  then\r\n\r\nthey  discovered what happened in Penang  and  Malacca,\r\n\r\nand they have added the second rider to their amendment\r\n\r\nabout  automatic  conversion of Singapore  citizens  to\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens. What the Barisan Sosialis, in  fact,\r\n\r\nsay,  on  behalf of their Communist backroom  boys,  is\r\n\r\nthat they want merger like Penang and Malacca, and then\r\n\r\njust in case that should be acceptable to the Tunku and\r\n\r\nhis Government, they ask for automatic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconversion;  and in case automatic conversion  is  also\r\n\r\nacceptable, they ask for something else; until finally,\r\n\r\nimpossible  terms are asked, the Tunku refuses,  merger\r\n\r\nis   frustrated,  and  the  Communists  carry  on  with\r\n\r\nSingapore, with the Singapore Government to deal  with,\r\n\r\nin  other  words,  only 817 S.I.R. soldiers  under  the\r\n\r\njoint control of the wicked colonialists and us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we used the word \"merger\", we did not intend\r\n\r\nto  give  any special meaning to it. We have used  this\r\n\r\nword  in the widely and commonly understood meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe word -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Take-over bid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Take over?

But  dealing with the backroom  boys  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, when we say we cannot have a twelfth\r\n\r\nState  like  the other 11 States, they say, \"Ah,  well,\r\n\r\nsince we can't have that, then we ask for it,\" and they\r\n\r\nimmediately  put  in an amendment - twelfth  State  and\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion.

The   Tunku\r\n\r\nunderstands  the  uneasiness  of  the  Malays  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  with regard to the taking  in  of  slightly\r\n\r\nover  one million Chinese from Singapore, and absorbing\r\n\r\nthem  into  the  new Federation, and more particularly,\r\n\r\nbecause of the Press reports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  organised  misbehaviour by Chinese school  students\r\n\r\nand  Chinese workers from time to time, thereby  making\r\n\r\nthe  rural Malays apprehensive of becoming engulfed and\r\n\r\nswamped  by the addition of more Chinese from Singapore\r\n\r\ninto the Federation of Malaya. This is nothing new.  We\r\n\r\nhave  analysed  it all in our 4th Anniversary  Souvenir\r\n\r\nnumber,  which I heard the Member for Queenstown  react\r\n\r\nwith  gusto and endorse with great approval.  Here  are\r\n\r\nthe honest unpleasant truths, Sir. So from time to time\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  has  gone  out of his  way  to  stress  the\r\n\r\ndifferences   of  the  conditions  of  merger   between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation and those  of  the  other\r\n\r\nStates of the Federation. It is not for me to say  why,\r\n\r\nbut  I  would  suggest that perhaps in this  way  Malay\r\n\r\nfears  can  be  lessened or allayed. The  words  \"close\r\n\r\nassociation between Singapore and the Federation\". Sir,\r\n\r\nby   whatever   name,  whether  we   call   it   \"close\r\n\r\nassociation\", \"complete merger\", \"absolute merger\", all\r\n\r\nmust  agree that the proposals contained in Paper  Cmd.\r\n\r\n33  mean  that  the British flag will be  removed  from\r\n\r\nSingapore,  other than for the bases (where there  will\r\n\r\nbe special arrangements made), and we shall, in future,\r\n\r\nfly the flag of the new Federation, play the anthem  of\r\n\r\nthe  new Federation, and display the symbols of the new\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizens wherever born, whether they were\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore or China or India, will, as nationals\r\n\r\nof  the  new  Federation,  vote  in  Singapore  for  15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives direct to the Central Parliament of the\r\n\r\nnew Federation, just as the present Federation citizens\r\n\r\nwill, also as nationals of the new Federation, vote  in\r\n\r\nthe present Federation for their representatives to the\r\n\r\nsame    Parliament;    and    there    together,    the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people from Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  will deliberate on policy, legislation  and\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of all the people of the whole of the  new\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me ask the Member for Farrer Park this\r\n\r\nmetaphysical  question, a very simple little  exercise:\r\n\r\nAt  what  point does close association become so  close\r\n\r\nthat  it becomes complete merger? And conversely,  when\r\n\r\nis complete merger made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  so  complete by the reservation to  the  State  of\r\n\r\nlarge  powers  of  education, labour,  social  welfare,\r\n\r\nhealth and other matters as proposed for Singapore,  so\r\n\r\nas  to  make  a merger a close association?  These  are\r\n\r\nwitch  words, Mr Speaker, Sir. Whatever anybody  likes\r\n\r\nto  call them, one thing is quite clear. The Communists\r\n\r\nunderstand  these arrangements will thwart their  plot.\r\n\r\nTheir  plot  is  to  use Singapore  as  a  base  for  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  ideological  and propaganda  offensive  and,\r\n\r\nultimately, as the Tunku has said, a military offensive\r\n\r\nagainst  the Federation, and then we will get a genuine\r\n\r\nCommunist  merger, not of Singapore with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya,  but  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya  into\r\n\r\nSingapore. As long as the merger proposals defeat their\r\n\r\ninterests, we must expect them to oppose them  although\r\n\r\nthey may be in the interests of the people. So I say to\r\n\r\nthe  House, let us not use words as Humpty Dumpty  uses\r\n\r\nthem, to make them mean what Humpty Dumpty intends them\r\n\r\nto mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!

Let me draw attention - his  attention\r\n\r\nin  particular - to a few points on which I hope he  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to enlighten us whether he persists in  these\r\n\r\nallegations.  First,  all citizens  of  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nautomatically,   as  Federation  nationals,   vote   15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  direct to the Parliament  of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation. Sir, anyone of these 15 representatives, as\r\n\r\nnationals of the new Federation representing the people\r\n\r\nof the new Federation from Singapore in Parliament, can\r\n\r\nbecome  a  Minister  of  the  Government  of  the   new\r\n\r\nFederation. According to the Constitution  of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation,  there  is  nothing  to  stop  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen, by virtue of automatically becoming a national\r\n\r\nof the new Federation, from becoming the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  new Federation of Malaysia. This is so whether\r\n\r\nhe  is  a  Singapore  citizen born in  Singapore  or  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen born in China, India or elsewhere and\r\n\r\nwho has acquired Singapore citizenship by registration.\r\n\r\nI  am  making statements which are advisely made. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  make  these things in my capacity as  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsignatories to this Command Paper. This is the  natural\r\n\r\ninterpretation to be spelt out of the Command Paper.  I\r\n\r\ngive the Member for Anson my categorical assurance that\r\n\r\nwe  shall  see  enshrined in it that  he,  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  born here - or even as malicious rumour  has  it\r\n\r\nthat  he was not born here but in Baghdad - has the right\r\n\r\nto be the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir.

I  do not want to anticipate events,  but  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that it will not be long when we will have  to\r\n\r\namend our Singapore citizenship laws to be on par  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  citizenship laws,  otherwise  one  can\r\n\r\nbecome a Federal national easier via Singapore than via\r\n\r\nthe Federation, and then a little bit of blackmarketing\r\n\r\nmay go on. I would suggest that that must be so, and it\r\n\r\nis  the  logical significance if I may spell out  these\r\n\r\nthings from paragraph 14 of the White Paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All Singapore citizens will keep their citizenship\r\n\r\nand   automatically  become  nationals  of  the  larger\r\n\r\nFederation.

Whatever it is,  that  will\r\n\r\ncontinue;  there  will be rights of  association,  Pan-Malayan or Pan-Malaysian parties, trade unions, and so\r\n\r\non. I do not like to raise hopes unduly, Sir, because I\r\n\r\nlooked up a man who could read the stars and he told me\r\n\r\nthat  when the Tunku finally retires - according  to  his\r\n\r\nreading of the stars, and he also read the Red Star of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan very carefully - Tun Abdul Razak is likely to\r\n\r\nbe  the  Prime Minister of Malaysia.

Now   certain\r\n\r\ncategories  of  officers, as in  the  P  &  T,  Police,\r\n\r\nPrisons - I  am sorry to be so morbid, Sir, but  in  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  things they go to the Central Budget;  they\r\n\r\nwill appear in the Federal List. Some of these officers\r\n\r\nhave  already  served 20 or 30 years in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nfor that part of their service, their pension liability\r\n\r\nwill have to be borne by the Singapore reserves. Future\r\n\r\nservice  will have to be borne by the Malayan  reserves\r\n\r\nor  Pan-Malaysian reserves. And I am told this is quite\r\n\r\na delicate exercise in the mathematics of actuarial -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actuarial science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Actuarial science.

In my estimation, in fact, the end result  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be keeping more than three-quarters,  at\r\n\r\nleast  three-quarters. You will see  in  the  letter  I\r\n\r\nmentioned more than three-quarters. How much more  than\r\n\r\nthree-quarters we do not know, because of  the  pension\r\n\r\nliability and other things.

That has been calculated\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry of Finance at about $12  million,  if\r\n\r\nonly Singapore and the Federation come in, or about $10\r\n\r\nmillion, perhaps less, (maybe $8 million) if the Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories also come in, because then they  will  have\r\n\r\nto  share the load.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we had anticipated that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwould  continue  to  raise a  false  alarm.  They  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to do it over citizenship. It is our  duty  as\r\n\r\nthe  Government - and I hope we will be helped by Members\r\n\r\neven  of  the Opposition, who have principles by  which\r\n\r\nthey  stand  and  who  believe  that  this  must  be  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  step forward towards our destiny to  a  more\r\n\r\nstable and prosperous society - to defend, to explain and\r\n\r\nto continue explaining until every lie has been bared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in precise and clear terms, the White Paper\r\n\r\nexplains  that  no  Singapore  citizen  will  lose  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights. Li addition, he will  acquire  new\r\n\r\nrights  as a national of the new Federation.  I  repeat\r\n\r\nthis again, because I think it bears repetition for the\r\n\r\npurposes of the record. Among those rights will be  the\r\n\r\nright to elect representatives direct to the Federation\r\n\r\nParliament;  the right to carry the same  passport  and\r\n\r\nenjoy   the  same  rights  and  privileges  under   the\r\n\r\nConstitution; and to be subject, of course, to the same\r\n\r\nduties and responsibilities for instance, conscription,\r\n\r\ntaxes and so on. These rights and duties are set out in\r\n\r\nmany sections of the Federation Constitution, beginning\r\n\r\nwith Article 8, which emphasises that all citizens  are\r\n\r\nequal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to labour the\r\n\r\npoint, but I think hon.

Under Singapore laws,\r\n\r\nand  under  the  provisions agreed to  in  the  Command\r\n\r\nPaper,  Sessional Paper 31 of 1956, a Singapore Citizen\r\n\r\ncan,  for varied reasons, be he an opium smuggler or  a\r\n\r\nsmuggler  of a less apparent commodity than  opium,  be\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  to show cause why his citizenship  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  questioned  and so on.

There  are\r\n\r\nseveral   other  sections,  Sir,  hut  these  are   the\r\n\r\nimportant  ones which set out the rights and duties  of\r\n\r\nnationals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have discussed the question of citizenship,\r\n\r\nnationality,   and  the  representation  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nMembers  in the Central Federation Parliament with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime  Minister  and  his  colleagues.  Our\r\n\r\nrespective  arguments and view-points were recorded  in\r\n\r\nan  exchange  of  letters which  were  tabled  on  24th\r\n\r\nNovember,  Friday.  May I, Sir, draw  he  attention  of\r\n\r\nMembers  to certain relevant portions thereof? This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly important when considering the proposition  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow put forward by the Barisan Sosialis,  namely,\r\n\r\nthat all Singapore citizens should automatically become\r\n\r\nFederation citizens. They make this demand in the  full\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  it is completely unacceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and that it cannot be supported  either  by\r\n\r\nlogic,  reason  or precedent in the Federation.  First,\r\n\r\nmay  I read what the Federation Prime Minister said  in\r\n\r\nhis  letter of 13th November, in the second  and  third\r\n\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to emphasise that it cannot be assumed\r\n\r\nthat  the  analogy of Penang or Malacca is  necessarily\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  the status of Singapore in a merger  with\r\n\r\nthe   Federation.   Article  22   of   the   Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution makes provision for a merger of new states\r\n\r\non terms which do not necessarily have to follow Penang\r\n\r\nand   Malacca  which  were  already  members   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation when the 1957 Constitution came into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stricter citizenship laws of the other States\r\n\r\nwere  applied to Singapore, Singapore would be entitled\r\n\r\nto not more than twelve seats, since less persons would\r\n\r\nbe   eligible  for  citizenship  and  consequently  for\r\n\r\nfranchise,  quite apart from the question of  weightage\r\n\r\nfor rural areas.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May  I  just  pause there and explain  this,  Sir?  The\r\n\r\nFederation's point of view is quite simple. Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  were special. They were part of the Federation\r\n\r\nalready. People born in Penang and Malacca were already\r\n\r\nFederation  citizen  by virtue of  the  1952  Agreement\r\n\r\nbefore   the  coming  into  being  of  the  independent\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya.  That  is  the  first   point.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  if we were to follow the laws of  Johore  or\r\n\r\nPerak,  either  the  Federated  Malay  States  or   the\r\n\r\nUnfederated  Malay States, then however generously  you\r\n\r\ninterpret  these  rules and so on, their  appraisal  is\r\n\r\nthat we would not be entitled to more than 12 seats  at\r\n\r\nthe  maximum. Finally, they go on to say that in regard\r\n\r\nto  the  distribution  of seats in  the  whole  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  as  such - as in other  countries  where  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system  is practised - by  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthings and by the circumstances of geography, there  is\r\n\r\nmore  representation per 10,000 of  population  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  than  in  the city areas. In  the  urban  areas,\r\n\r\npeople  are  concentrated together. One  representative\r\n\r\ncan  cover one square mile, or even half a square mile.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Kreta Ayer, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance,  has a constituency,  I  think,\r\n\r\nwhich  does  not run to more than even  half  a  square\r\n\r\nmile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Thirty acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He has as many people to look\r\n\r\nafter  as  the Member for Sembawang or the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChua Chu Kang, who constantly complains of the enormous\r\n\r\ndistances he has to travel. On the average, it has been\r\n\r\nworked out, I think, at about 30,000 per representative\r\n\r\nin  the urban area and 20,000 per representative in the\r\n\r\nrural  area, because the man in the rural area  has  to\r\n\r\ncover  enormous  distances.  If  that  is  taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration, then it will definitely be less than  12\r\n\r\nby  any calculation. That is the Federation's point  of\r\n\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I then read my letter to the Federation Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the 11th November, setting forth our  point\r\n\r\nof view? Third paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If merger were completely on the basis of Penang,\r\n\r\nthen  the  citizenship laws of the  present  Federation\r\n\r\nwhich  applied in Penang will apply to Singapore. About\r\n\r\n284,000 representing those born in Singapore out of the\r\n\r\n624,000  Singapore citizens would automatically qualify\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship of the present Federation. This  would\r\n\r\nentitle  Singapore  to send 14 representatives  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Federation Legislature. This is comparable  to\r\n\r\nthe  14  seats  to which Johore's 291,230 citizens  are\r\n\r\nentitled.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johore has 291,000 - 14 seats. We say that if Penang\r\n\r\nterms  apply, we will have 284,000. These are the  more\r\n\r\nimportant parts, Sir. How did we come to the figure 15?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The remaining 340,000 Singapore citizens who were not\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore would have to apply for citizenship\r\n\r\nunder  the  present citizenship laws of the  Federation\r\n\r\nwhich  require, inter alia, a residential qualification\r\n\r\nand a knowledge of the Malay language. On the basis  of\r\n\r\nthe   numbers  in  the  other  States  in  the  present\r\n\r\nFederation  who  have  qualified  by  application   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship in this way, over two-thirds i.e. more than\r\n\r\n230,000 will lose their present citizenship.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is really the crux of the problem. Because of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  citizenship  laws  in  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  if we now apply the Federation citizenship\r\n\r\nJaws,  there  are 340,000 Singapore citizens  who  will\r\n\r\nhave  to re-apply. If we study the statistics of people\r\n\r\nin  the Federation who were not born there and who  had\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napply,  then we will know fairly accurately what  would\r\n\r\nhappen  in  Singapore. What happened is that about  one\r\n\r\nout  of  three was successful in their application.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  out of the 340,000, our  calculation  is\r\n\r\nthat 110,000 will qualify and 230,000 will not qualify.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the crux of the matter. If we listen  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis - or if we were foolish enough to listen\r\n\r\nto  them - take them at their face value and ask for  the\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca type of merger, there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nconfused  and  riotous position in  Singapore,  because\r\n\r\n340,000  people  will have to re-apply,  two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nwhom  will  not succeed. Therefore, we have arrived  at\r\n\r\nthe  provision which I later explained in  the  letter.\r\n\r\nMay I continue with the letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the other hand, the claim that Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nshould  automatically  become Federation  citizens  and\r\n\r\nthereby increase the representation Singapore would  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to,  was and still is, in the  view  of  your\r\n\r\nGovernment, too absurd to merit serious consideration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite simply what they told us. First, the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  say,  \"We  want  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically to convert.\" A man comes here from  India\r\n\r\nfor  two years. He would never have been entitled  even\r\n\r\nto  make the application, and so is disqualified on the\r\n\r\nface   of   the   application  because  of   inadequate\r\n\r\nresidence. He then becomes a Singapore citizen  because\r\n\r\nour  laws  are  different. He says, \"I  want  to  be  a\r\n\r\nFederation citizen now.\" Not only do we want that,  but\r\n\r\nwe  then  say,  \"Well, now, that entitles  us  to  more\r\n\r\nrepresentation.\"  This, in the view of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, is unacceptable and is known to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  It  must be obviously so,  Sir,  unless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wishes to lose the confidence  of  its  own\r\n\r\nelectorate there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merger on either of these terms would be unrealistic.\r\n\r\nHowever,  you  have  agreed that all present  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens will keep their citizenship rights and  become\r\n\r\nFederal  nationals,  provided  this  is  not  then  put\r\n\r\nforward  as a reason for an increase in the  number  of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives for Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the operative clause, Sir, - \"provided this is\r\n\r\nnot then put forward as a reason for an increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  representatives for Singapore.\" It is as simple  as\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, without discourtesy to the Chair,\r\n\r\nmay   I  take  off  my  jacket  because  of  the   air-conditioning? I must say, for the benefit  of  Members,\r\n\r\nthat I did attempt to get the City Engineer to maintain\r\n\r\npressure in the Assembly but not for the whole  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  area,  but  he  explained  to  me  that  it   was\r\n\r\nimpossible to maintain pressure for the Assembly  alone\r\n\r\nwithout at the same time opening the whole of the  City\r\n\r\narea.  Everybody  would then open their  taps  and  the\r\n\r\npressure would fall down, and that would affect the air\r\n\r\nconditioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to my subject, may I say that this is the\r\n\r\ncore of the problem? If we went in like Penang, and  if\r\n\r\nwhat  happened in Penang and Malacca happened here,  we\r\n\r\nwould have 284,000 automatically qualified amongst whom\r\n\r\nwould be quite a number of Members from this House, not\r\n\r\nincluding  the Member for Queenstown or the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson,  because they were not born in  Singapore,  or\r\n\r\nthe Member for Pasir Panjang or the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were born in China. They would  have  to\r\n\r\nreapply. That is another problem for them. But we  say,\r\n\r\n\"All  will keep their Singapore citizenship.  All  will\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal  nationals and be equal  to  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens who also become Federal nationals.\" As far  as\r\n\r\nnational rights are concerned, they are equal. The only\r\n\r\ndifference is in the voting, because these 230,000 - two-thirds  of  the 340,000 - who were not born in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not have qualified. The Federation does not  want\r\n\r\nthem just to go across the Causeway and start voting in\r\n\r\nJohore, thereby increasing their representation  there,\r\n\r\nbecause they would not have qualified in any case.  But\r\n\r\nwe  say,  \"No.  We have allowed them to  qualify  under\r\n\r\nSingapore  laws\". The Federation says. \"Well,  that  is\r\n\r\nyour  business,  but  we are not giving  you  increased\r\n\r\nrepresentation as a result of allowing you to let  them\r\n\r\nkeep  Singapore citizenship and becoming  automatically\r\n\r\nFederation  nationals.\" It is a simple case of  saying,\r\n\r\n\"Here is the Singapore cake. How do you share it,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  it is among 624,000 citizens of 624,000  minus\r\n\r\n230,000 who will not qualify, that is not our business.\r\n\r\nBut you are not going to get a bigger cake just because\r\n\r\nyou  say you have more citizens, because they would not\r\n\r\nhave qualified in the Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My government estimated that on a merger like Penang,\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be entitled to 19 seats  in  view  of\r\n\r\nPerak's 450,000 voters entitling Perak to 19 seats.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain this, Sir. 284,000 born here; from the\r\n\r\nfigures   in  the  Federation  of  one  out  of   three\r\n\r\nqualifying, we can calculate that 110,000 will qualify.\r\n\r\n110,000 plus 284,000 makes 394,000; let us round it off\r\n\r\nat 400,000. Let us say that between now and Merger Day,\r\n\r\neverybody  suddenly takes an interest in  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage and learns very hard, and the percentage  will\r\n\r\nincrease,  not  one in three as in the Federation,  but\r\n\r\nsay,  50,000  more will qualify; make it 450,000;  that\r\n\r\nwould  entitle us to 19 seats. Perak - 450,000.  I  must\r\n\r\nmake  this point. This is our argument which the  Tunku\r\n\r\ndoes  not  accept, as you will see in  his  reply.  His\r\n\r\npoint is that Perak - 450,000 is spread over a very large\r\n\r\narea, and we have to compute ourselves on the basis  of\r\n\r\nthe  urban  areas - Penang, Kuala Lumpur,  Johore  Bahru,\r\n\r\nIpoh,  Malacca - not the rural areas like  Perak.  But,\r\n\r\nanyway, our contention is 19 seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I go on to the next paragraph but one:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, we have agreed that Singapore would keep\r\n\r\nmore  than  three-quarters  of  her  revenue  for   the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  her  responsibilities on  education  and\r\n\r\nlabour,  social  welfare,  health  and  all  the  other\r\n\r\nmatters set out as state or concurrent responsibilities\r\n\r\nin  the  schedule  annexed to our  memorandum,  and  he\r\n\r\nentitled to 15 seats in the Central Parliament  of  the\r\n\r\nnew Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement has precedents in constitutional\r\n\r\npractice.  Northern Ireland, though part of the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  retains certain autonomous powers.  In  return\r\n\r\nfor this, though Northern Ireland would he entitled  to\r\n\r\n16  seats on the basis of electoral strength,  she  has\r\n\r\nonly  12 because she retains autonomous powers.  Should\r\n\r\nin  the  future Singapore surrender some or all of  her\r\n\r\nautonomous  powers  and state revenue  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  question  of  representation  can  he\r\n\r\nreviewed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have sold nobody out. We have bought nobody\r\n\r\nfrom  the Tunku. All we have done is to try and find  a\r\n\r\nway  out  of  the  anomaly that  has  been  created  by\r\n\r\ndifferent  citizenship laws. And  even  more  important\r\n\r\nthan  different citizenship laws, a fact that everybody\r\n\r\nknows,  if you want trouble - not this little boycott  of\r\n\r\nthe  examinations,  a  manifestly  reasonable  academic\r\n\r\nproblem of taking the examinations has already  led  to\r\n\r\ntwo   motions   in   this  Chamber,   one   beleaguered\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  and  the  Serjeant  at   Arms\r\n\r\ngreatly  imperilled by being asked to undertake  duties\r\n\r\nwhich  he  had not bargained for when he undertook  his\r\n\r\noffice.  But  can anybody in his right mind  doubt  the\r\n\r\nopening we will give to misunderstanding and trouble if\r\n\r\nwe say education goes to the Federation? $120 million a\r\n\r\nyear  is  spent  on  education alone. Annual  recurrent\r\n\r\nteachers'  salaries, books, this, that and  the  other,\r\n\r\n$90  million; building new schools $30 million. We hand\r\n\r\nover $120 million to the Federation Government and say,\r\n\r\n\"Implement the Rahman Talib Report.\" Then I  say  quite\r\n\r\nobviously we are not only ham-handed, but we deserve to\r\n\r\nbe  in  trouble because obviously we do not  understand\r\n\r\nour  own problems. Does anybody in his right mind  - and\r\n\r\nalready some people are questioning whether one  Member\r\n\r\nopposite  is  in his right mind - believe  that  you  can\r\n\r\nstand  up  in  Singapore  and  tell  the  people  here,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the Chinese-educated, that they  have  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  Rahman  Talib  Report?  Only  one-third\r\n\r\ninstruction   to  be  in  the  mother   language;   the\r\n\r\nvernacular;  there will be no more public  examinations\r\n\r\nin Chinese; any school which does not comply with those\r\n\r\nrules  ceases  to  get grants in aid. In  other  words,\r\n\r\nChinese  High  School, Chung Cheng, Nanyang  University\r\n\r\natrophy,  shrink  and die away. No more  bursaries  for\r\n\r\nstudents  in  Nanyang or Chung Cheng  for  their  post-secondary examinations, studies and so on. And they say\r\n\r\nwe have sold out the people, Sir!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time will come, Sir, when we shall put these\r\n\r\nthings  to  the test. We understand these  problems.  I\r\n\r\ngive myself no credit, Sir, for understanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  problems  a little better than  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  because he started getting  interested  in\r\n\r\nthese problems only since about February 1959, when  he\r\n\r\nsaw  the  P.A.P. flash and the circle.  We  have  been\r\n\r\nliving  with these problems for years. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  remembers well what happened. In 1954 and  1955,\r\n\r\nhe  became  the Chief Minister. I used to  see  him  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the students. I saw both sides, Sir,I saw  a\r\n\r\nChief Minister really trying his level best to do  what\r\n\r\nhe  could to resolve the matter. I saw kids bright  and\r\n\r\nintelligent and able organisers, but with chaps at  the\r\n\r\nrear to see that they did not settle these matters. The\r\n\r\nMember for Anson knew that. It is not the kids who  did\r\n\r\nnot want to settle. It is the chaps who were behind the\r\n\r\nkids, it  is like the Hock Lee problem. He  went  down\r\n\r\nthere, and so did I. I was advising the Hock Lee Union.\r\n\r\nHe  was there trying to resolve the dispute between the\r\n\r\nemployer  and the union. He ate a bowl of kway-teow  on\r\n\r\nthe  spot  to  the delectation of the photographer.  He\r\n\r\nthought it was settled, and he went back, and so did I.\r\n\r\nI  thought  it  was settled too. We went  back  and  we\r\n\r\ndiscovered  it  was not settled. It was not  the  Union\r\n\r\nCommittee  that decided. He saw the Union Committee.  I\r\n\r\nhate  to  say  this,  but I do not think  it  was  just\r\n\r\nbecause of his persuasive powers, but because it was  a\r\n\r\nreasonable settlement. They accepted. We then  departed\r\n\r\nbelieving the problem was over. Four days later,  there\r\n\r\nwere  riots in Singapore because the real chaps  behind\r\n\r\nwho made the decisions did not want a settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with the 4:2 and 3:3 systems. We have been\r\n\r\nthrough  all  that.  That is  why  we  never  made  the\r\n\r\ndecision. The Government did not make the decision  4:2\r\n\r\nor   3:3, it  was  the  Chinese  educational  experts\r\n\r\nthemselves - the school management committees and  school\r\n\r\nprincipals - who decided on 4:2. So you see  the  problem\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists when they have  not  got  a  united\r\n\r\nfront.  Supposing we had decided on 4:2, then we  would\r\n\r\nhave  had  Mr  Ko  Teck Kin on behalf  of  the  school\r\n\r\nmanagement  committees and Mr So  and  So.  All  these\r\n\r\nhidden  men  keep quiet, and virulent  words  would  be\r\n\r\nuttered via manifestly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoderate,  reasonable merchants who are  obviously  not\r\n\r\ninterested in politics but only interested in  commerce\r\n\r\nand the education of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time it is different and it will continue to\r\n\r\nbe  different so long as this Government is in  office.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  were going through all that, we were doing  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit of computation as to what would happen  one\r\n\r\nof  these days if we had to be responsible.

I  saw  it  from  a\r\n\r\nringside view. I was with the Committee of Human Rights\r\n\r\nspeaking  at  Beauty Park. I do not  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Havelock was there. Has he  gone  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation yet? I am not sure whether he has left  for\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. But I think he will remember  that  we\r\n\r\nwent up there and railed against the colonialists. They\r\n\r\nwere still in charge, and there were no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nThe  Chief  Secretary gave the orders.  Mind  you,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  agreed,  and  that  was  his  greatest\r\n\r\nmistake. That night, Sir, I saw the preview of what was\r\n\r\ncoming.  We  finished the meeting at seven  o'clock.  I\r\n\r\ncame  down  Bukit Timah Road and I saw the police  line\r\n\r\nup, and so did the parents. They just lined up to watch\r\n\r\ntheir  own children in anxiety and these little  picket\r\n\r\nboys   playing  bandits.  It  is  very  exciting,  this\r\n\r\nbusiness of putting on handkerchiefs.

So let\r\n\r\nus  not  make  our job more difficult.

Sir, I am\r\n\r\nlooking forward to seeing the Member for Anson,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  should not take away the fire and the  light\r\n\r\nfrom the Member for Queenstown. He should be given  one\r\n\r\non  his  own with the Member for Kreta Ayer,  and  then\r\n\r\nperhaps the Member for Anson on some other occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of these proposals in Paper Cmd. 33 of\r\n\r\n1961 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is farcical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, you can take part in the\r\n\r\nforum.

We answer them  and\r\n\r\nthen his Party think out new ones and he comes back and\r\n\r\nasks us some more - as we have seen, Sir, on one occasion\r\n\r\nwhen they agreed to a motion to be debated. If only  we\r\n\r\nwere  allowed to say, \"Proceed now and debate,\"  as  on\r\n\r\nThursday  if  we  had  to discuss  the  Chinese  school\r\n\r\nstudents and the pickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It was a surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, there was no surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To distract attention from the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As I understand parliamentary democracy and  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system, one of its most vital  features  is\r\n\r\nthe  open confrontation. [Interruption] Yes, true.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson is absolutely a past master  in  the\r\n\r\ngame.  As when a witness is in the box on oath  and  he\r\n\r\ntells a lie, he is literally torn to strips. But if the\r\n\r\nwitness  just reads a long statement from the dock  and\r\n\r\nrefuses to answer questions, you know what it is worth.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a waste of time. Anybody can draft a 7\ufffd-hour\r\n\r\nspeech. In fact, I was aghast at the lack of ingenuity,\r\n\r\nthe  lack of material and the lack of flair in the  7\ufffd-hour speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hi-fi record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nmay  be interested in this because it has something  to\r\n\r\ndo with his future. The Minister of the Interior of the\r\n\r\nFederation was playing golf with me the other day -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think there was an attempt by\r\n\r\nsome  Member - I do not remember who it was - to give  that\r\n\r\nstory to this Assembly and I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is a different story. It has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with the conduct of the Member. All  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  said was that he admired the  7\ufffd-hour\r\n\r\nspeech;  that Krishna Menon, when he was in the  United\r\n\r\nNations, made a seven-hour speech; and that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown had beaten him by half an hour. And  he\r\n\r\nalso said that Krishna Menon was being recalled. But  I\r\n\r\nwill  say this for Krishna Menon. When he talks, it  is\r\n\r\nKrishna Menon who is talking. Everybody knows that.  He\r\n\r\ndoes  not just read his scripts. There is the touch  of\r\n\r\nthe artist. When the Member for Anson talks, I have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  whatsoever that it is the Member for  Anson  who\r\n\r\ntalks.  Sometimes, to the discomfiture of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  boys,  they keep on asking  him  for  advice.\r\n\r\nBecause, after all,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are  moments when, in the name of  humanity  and\r\n\r\nhuman beings, he comes right down to the core and says,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  that is fair. I will vote for it.  I  will  not\r\n\r\ncondone.\" And he voted for the motion. He takes no line\r\n\r\nfrom  anybody. We know that. That is why we never blame\r\n\r\nhim  for the Public Daily-Rated Employees Union strike.\r\n\r\nWe  knew  he  was  not  involved in  it.  That  is  the\r\n\r\npoint - the open confrontation. The Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nis  an exponent of democracy as it is understood by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. The Member for Farrer Park has  also\r\n\r\nlearnt  a  little bit from colonial days.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nthink he must be quite experienced by now, having  seen\r\n\r\ndifferent  ages come to pass. I can assure  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  the moment this debate  is  over,  the\r\n\r\ninvitation  is  on  the table. He  can  have  his  nine\r\n\r\nquestions  answered,  and more.  We  also  have  a  few\r\n\r\nquestions to ask him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, it is futile to have all these long\r\n\r\nspeeches.  The  Members just read them. These  speeches\r\n\r\njust  have no meaning. You give the answer and they  go\r\n\r\nhome   to  think  of  something  new  and  ask  another\r\n\r\nquestion. So we say, have the questioner there; we give\r\n\r\nthe  answer, and at the same time we ask the questioner\r\n\r\nanother question. So we mutually ask questions of  each\r\n\r\nother  to elucidate the matter. I can assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown - he can ask for advice from  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson - that  in  the process  of  cross-examination\r\n\r\nnothing  is  more serious than to tell a  lie,  because\r\n\r\nwhen  they ask you for one false premise, you are drawn\r\n\r\nrelentlessly down to an absurd conclusion, and  finally\r\n\r\nthe  House burst out in laughter. This time the witness\r\n\r\nwill not be joining in the laughter because it will  be\r\n\r\nat  his  expense. Sir, I look forward very  much - and  I\r\n\r\nhope too will other Members of this House - to listening\r\n\r\nin  to this exciting forum that is to come on the  nine\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is now a convenient time to suspend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you please, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will take this Chair again at 5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>4.49 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, we are ready to discuss, to\r\n\r\nexplain and to show that every one of the proposals  in\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd.  33  of 1961 is just, fair and  reasonable.\r\n\r\nThose  who make fantastic allegations of a sell-out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore rights to the Federation of Malaya should  do\r\n\r\nwell to ask themselves whether the people would believe\r\n\r\nthat a government which is contemplating a sell-out  of\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the people would act in the way  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing.  First, we have published the agreement  between\r\n\r\nus and the Federation Government as soon as it is ready\r\n\r\nand  before  the Tunku left for London on the  16th  of\r\n\r\nNovember. We wanted to give ample time to everyone  for\r\n\r\na  full  debate on every point. Second, we are  willing\r\n\r\nand ready to explain the reasons for every one of these\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  everybody  and  every  association   of\r\n\r\ncitizens genuinely interested in and concerned over the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  the  people of Malaya, and  to  give  these\r\n\r\nexplanations in any language at any convenient time and\r\n\r\nplace.  I  may  add here, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce is arranging a meeting  of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of their member associations and  their\r\n\r\nguilds   in  order  to  seek  clarification  of  points\r\n\r\nconnected with education, multi-lingualism, citizenship\r\n\r\nand trade. And I will be happy - I have already indicated\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is happy -  to attend to  give  all\r\n\r\nelucidation  and  answer  all  questions  that  anybody\r\n\r\nwishes  to  raise. Sir, I will not be  organising  this\r\n\r\nmeeting.

As I have explained, I am greatly indebted to\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson because I did not understand  why\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  moved the  first  limb  of  the\r\n\r\namendment, \"genuine merger as a twelfth state\", because\r\n\r\nthey were asking for something which was already in the\r\n\r\nproposals. But when the Member for Anson read  out  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech,  then  I  understood\r\n\r\nhim - whatever we say cannot be done, they then ask  for,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, and they misread this part. So  they\r\n\r\nask  for a twelfth State, not knowing that is what they\r\n\r\nare getting, much to their discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we are prepared to put all or any one of these\r\n\r\nproposals before the people for them to decide on. Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  ask  the Barisan Sosialis and their  Communist\r\n\r\nmentors:  if there is a sell-out, what is the  sell-out\r\n\r\nin return for? What is the price?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To keep you in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is the price we are accused\r\n\r\nof  in  return. This is how this scheme came  about - the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister would  be\r\n\r\nresigning  and  a new Prime Minister and  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister would be installed. They were fully aware that\r\n\r\nonly  in  May  this year, after Hong  Lim,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment was quite prepared to resign and return  the\r\n\r\nmandate to the people. At that time, Sir, we saw no way\r\n\r\nout of the economic, social and political problems;  no\r\n\r\nprospect  of merger and no Common Market in sight,  for\r\n\r\nwithout  merger and without a Common Market, we  cannot\r\n\r\nresolve these problems. We cannot meet the expectations\r\n\r\nof  the people for jobs, houses, welfare benefits,  and\r\n\r\nso many of the other wants which they kept on repeating\r\n\r\nas  we  went  canvassing in Hong Lim. It just  was  not\r\n\r\npossible. \"Why have I not got a house?\" \"Why have I not\r\n\r\ngot  a flat?\" \"Why have I not got a job?\" There was  no\r\n\r\nanswer.  The  reason  was that economic  expansion  was\r\n\r\nbeing constricted by competition between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation for capital development. At that  time,\r\n\r\nthey - the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers now in the Barisan Sosialis -  wanted us to carry\r\n\r\non  in  office. You will recall the Press statement  by\r\n\r\nthe so-called Left-wing unions - \"Duty to the people, and\r\n\r\nso  on;  we must carry on.\" Shortly after Hong Lim,  we\r\n\r\nhad  a  Party meeting, and they told us, \"We must carry\r\n\r\non.  Ignore the people of Hong Lirn. That was  no  real\r\n\r\nverdict;  no true expression of the people  who  really\r\n\r\ncounted.\"  Moreover,  the  Member  for  Queenstown,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  my  former  Parliamentary  Secretary   (the\r\n\r\nMember  for Upper Serangoon) - the two of them added,  if\r\n\r\nMao  Tse-tung had to stand for election in  China  with\r\n\r\nall  the  food  shortage in the communes, Mao  Tse-tung\r\n\r\nwould lose his deposit. That is the truth; the absolute\r\n\r\nand utter truth!

He\r\n\r\nsaid that, after all, what mattered was not whether the\r\n\r\npeople  thought we were doing good or not, but whether,\r\n\r\nin  fact, we were doing good to the people or not, and,\r\n\r\nin his view, we were. So we should carry\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have something to fight for, a worthwhile task\r\n\r\nto  fulfil  on  behalf of the people of  Singapore,  to\r\n\r\nbring  Singapore into reunification with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  to  a  more stable and prosperous  society,\r\n\r\nwhere  we  see  prospects  of  expanding  our  economy,\r\n\r\ncreating  more  jobs, more homes, and more  prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut  when we have this, they want us to resign. Do they\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the people have such short memories?  Do\r\n\r\nthey  believe  that the people cannot see  through  the\r\n\r\nsudden   twists  and  the  roundabout  turns   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists in the Barisan Sosialis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They will not forget you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You will remember, Sir, that in\r\n\r\nSeptember  this  year, the Leader of the  House,  in  a\r\n\r\nletter  to  Members who are leaders of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  in  this House (amongst them  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown),  asked them to state their Parties'  views\r\n\r\non  merger.  In  his  reply the Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nstated  that  Singapore  should  be  merged  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  as  the  twelfth  State,  like  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca.  Sir,  I  emphasise the working  words,  \"like\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca\". He wrote them on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  Yet he is now asking  that,  unlike\r\n\r\nPenang  and Malacca, Singapore should not abide by  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws of the Federation of Malaya, but  that\r\n\r\nthere should be automatic conversion. As the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson said - I was not fortunate enough to listen to  him\r\n\r\nbut  I sought confirmation of it in the reports on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing day - the Barisan Sosialis demand for  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  like Penang and Malacca was a great mistake.  I\r\n\r\nventure to suggest that their ghost writers were driven\r\n\r\nto  this predicament by their being forced to say  that\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  complete merger when, in fact,  the  last\r\n\r\nthing they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  is  merger in any shape or form, until of course,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a Communist government in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, or the Communist government in Singapore  could\r\n\r\ncapture the Federation of Malaya. But having said  that\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  complete merger, they then - as  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nsaid  in  his  Parliament on the 16th October - \"ask  for\r\n\r\nimpossible  terms\" (these were the Tunku's  words),  so\r\n\r\nthat  merger can be frustrated. And if this demand  for\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion were unexpectedly agreed to  by  a\r\n\r\ngenerous  Federation  Parliament, then  the  Communists\r\n\r\nwould  oppose merger on some other ground.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  trouble is this: it is difficult to get the people\r\n\r\nto  oppose merger on the ground that merger is not good\r\n\r\nfor  the Communists. So they have to get the people  to\r\n\r\noppose  merger  by  falsely alleging  that  the  merger\r\n\r\nproposals  are  bad for the people.  These  are  united\r\n\r\nfront  dialectics.  If you admit  to  the  people  that\r\n\r\nmerger is bad for the Communists, then the people  will\r\n\r\nsay, \"So what? Is it good for me [the people]?\" And you\r\n\r\nshow  them  that  it is. And they tell the  Communists,\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is too bad for you. Why be a Communist?\" They\r\n\r\nunderstand that, Sir, in the same way as this  4:2  and\r\n\r\n3:3  education systems. We did not win the battle.  The\r\n\r\npeople  did. They were unable to bamboozle  the  people\r\n\r\ninto believing that the 4:2 system was bad, and so they\r\n\r\nfailed.  It is too bad for the Communists. Why? Because\r\n\r\nthey  wanted to create trouble on any issue. The people\r\n\r\ndid  not  believe it. They lost. Hence, their  constant\r\n\r\nsearch  for  an issue ostensibly unconnected  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists round which to rally - it is quite obvious  to\r\n\r\nall Members of the House -  the Chinese in particular  to\r\n\r\noppose  merger in any shape or form.

But let\r\n\r\nme  say that it is because of their open communal  line\r\n\r\nthat  they have naturally provoked some dangerous  talk\r\n\r\nby Malay Assemblymen about bringing out the parang pan\r\n\r\nfang  and  the  kris.  Who has provoked  this?  We  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Or  the  Barisan  Sosialis  by  their  own\r\n\r\ncommunal  slant? But I say to them that  theirs  is  an\r\n\r\nalmost   impossible  task.  The  Chinese,  the  Indian-speaking  and  the  English-speaking  sections  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore know in their heart of hearts  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  want merger on the basis  of  Penang  or\r\n\r\nMalacca.  The reasons are obvious. If those  conditions\r\n\r\napply,  230,000  will  lose  their  citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nbecause   they  cannot  qualify  under  the  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws. Everybody - not just the  230,000 - will\r\n\r\nlose  the  present status which he enjoys. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmore   appropriate  word  would  be  \"privilege\"   - free\r\n\r\ncompetition between all races in the civil service,  in\r\n\r\ntrade,  commerce, industry, and in nearly all walks  of\r\n\r\nlife  in Singapore. This is a free area. Seven  out  of\r\n\r\nour  nine  Permanent  Secretaries have  come  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Three  out of our five local  Judges  have\r\n\r\ncome  from  the Federation. Seven out of nine Ministers\r\n\r\nhave  come  from the Federation. Do the Barisan  really\r\n\r\nseriously  suggest  that the people  in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens want to go in on the basis of Penang\r\n\r\nand Malacca? Honestly, do they believe it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Member for Queenstown's ghost writers has\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Sinn  Fein movement  in  Ireland.  I\r\n\r\nthought  this is for them an unfortunate example.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  trouble  with  young and  inexperienced  ghost\r\n\r\nwriters. It is because there was complete merger at the\r\n\r\nbeginning between Ireland and England, with no reserved\r\n\r\npowers   for  Ireland,  that  the  Sinn  Fein  movement\r\n\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under compulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am told that when the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  spent his years in college, he was  a  good\r\n\r\nrugger player, a good chess player, and a good athlete.\r\n\r\nHe  once  ran the 440 yards and won it. But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  he  was a good student of history.  He  has  his\r\n\r\nfacts wrong. He does not understand these things. It is\r\n\r\nbecause   complete  merger  at  present  may  lead   to\r\n\r\nunhappiness and a Sinn Fein movement that the Tunku has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  give  Singapore  larger  powers  of   local\r\n\r\nautonomy,  like Northern Ireland. Had these  powers  of\r\n\r\nlocal  autonomy  been  given to Southern  Ireland, the\r\n\r\nhistory of Eire might well have been different. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the people who want to create  Sinn  Fein\r\n\r\ntrouble  are  the  Communists in the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThey  are suggesting that we should hand over education\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation Government and implement the Rahman\r\n\r\nTalib   Report   in  Singapore, with  all   its   full\r\n\r\nconsequences  on  Chinese middle  schools  and  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.

But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, let me mention the relevance. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown was asking, in his 7\ufffd-hour speech, for\r\n\r\ncomplete merger in which education goes to the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  am  questioning the sincerity  of  that\r\n\r\nbecause  I have pointed out that the men who manipulate\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis are manipulating these  agitators\r\n\r\nin  the Chinese schools. On the one hand, he, on behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists, says education goes to the centre.\r\n\r\nOn   the  other  hand,  while  education  is  still  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, they are causing trouble long before it goes\r\n\r\nto  the  centre. Does anybody in his right  mind  doubt\r\n\r\nwhat  would  happen if this Government  says  education\r\n\r\ngoes to the centre, in defiance or in complete oblivion\r\n\r\nof  the  wishes,  the feelings and  sentiments  of  the\r\n\r\npeople?  The  Barisan Sosialis say this. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  when there is a meeting of parents, the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Tampines Committee Member turned up.  I  tried\r\n\r\nto  find out whether he has a son. My first information\r\n\r\nis  that  the man is not married. Because of the  Tommy\r\n\r\nKoh incident, I have asked to make quite sure. Maybe he\r\n\r\nhas a wife whom we do not know of and has a son whom we\r\n\r\ndo  not  know of. So we are checking up first. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  he is mentioning this. It is an unpleasant subject\r\n\r\nto  the  Member  for  Queenstown because  truth  is  an\r\n\r\nunpleasant  thing  to those who are  hypocritical.  The\r\n\r\nsimple  proposition - and this is the truth  that  I  am\r\n\r\nreciting  now - has been agreed by the school principals,\r\n\r\nmanagement committees and the Ministry of Education. It\r\n\r\nis not a Government edict, Sir. It is their choice - 4:2.\r\n\r\nAll  those  who  want  to  take  the  Government  Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary  II Examination at the end of six years  must\r\n\r\npass  the  Government Secondary IV at the end  of  four\r\n\r\nyears. It is a very simple proposition. Before you take\r\n\r\nyour  M.A., you first get your B.A. Then they  cause  a\r\n\r\nboycott because they do not want to take the B.A.  They\r\n\r\njust  want  to  take the M.A. Pass  or  fail  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter! It gets so complicated, Sir, that I do not know\r\n\r\nhow they argue themselves out of this proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were in the united front - I do not want to be\r\n\r\nimmodest  in saying this - at least we kept our arguments\r\n\r\nto  reality and logic. We paid some attention to  logic\r\n\r\nand  reason and sanity, because we refused to join them\r\n\r\nin  anything which was illogical and unreasonable.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan stars are different.

They  are  trying to get  the  Chinese  middle\r\n\r\nschools  and students excited over the proposition,  as\r\n\r\nabsurd as saying that students should be allowed to  go\r\n\r\nto  Nanyang  University before  they  pass  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle III Examination. But nobody has suggested  that.\r\n\r\nObviously that is absurd. If you do not pass the Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle  III, how can you go to Nanyang University?  But\r\n\r\nthey  say,  if  you do not pass the School Certificate,\r\n\r\nnever  mind,  you  still  go  on  and  take  the  Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary III examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order.

I think I remember the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens did endeavour to debate the  4:2  and\r\n\r\n3:3  systems. I permitted him to mention the matter  in\r\n\r\npassing.  But  I  stopped him when he  was  going  into\r\n\r\ndetails  on  the merits and demerits of these  systems.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think the Prime Minister has got as far as\r\n\r\nthat yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to go into details,\r\n\r\npartly  because  I  am  not fully acquainted  with  the\r\n\r\ndetails.  We  left  this  to  the  Chinese  educational\r\n\r\nexperts  to decide. And they decided it this way.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  reason  why,  when the students  were  running\r\n\r\naround, some of the experts were locked up in the class-rooms  and the principals could not get out. They  were\r\n\r\nbeleaguered and there was no Assembly to help them  out\r\n\r\nwith resolutions, sad to say, Sir. The trouble over the\r\n\r\nboycott has stopped for the time being. But I say this,\r\n\r\nin  connection  not  with Chinese  education  but  with\r\n\r\nmerger  and the Communist attempt to frustrate  merger,\r\n\r\nthat we would be unwise to assume that the Communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  decided  not to use the students any  more  as  a\r\n\r\nsource  of  mischief and disorder in their  attempt  to\r\n\r\nprevent  merger.  Therefore, I say to this  House  that\r\n\r\nwhen the Government is forbearing to the point of being\r\n\r\naccused  of  weakness, let them  remember  that  it  is\r\n\r\nalways better to be accused of being too tolerant,  too\r\n\r\ngentle, than to lend the slightest shred of credence to\r\n\r\nthe  accusation that we use brutality, like the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill - brutality, atrocity. I saw them, Sir. As\r\n\r\nI  said,  they used tear gas - a very foolish thing -  and\r\n\r\nbatons,  not to beat the students, hut just to disperse\r\n\r\nthem.  And they came down in marching columns from  the\r\n\r\nChinese  High  School  to  Newton  Circus  singing.   A\r\n\r\nmemorable  evening!  That day Mr Chew  Swee  Kee  died\r\n\r\npolitically,  because, to thousands of Chinese  parents\r\n\r\nwhose  children  were in Chung Cheng and  Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchools  and who did not understand what this  was  all\r\n\r\nabout,  their innocent children were being flushed  out\r\n\r\nin   defence  of  Chinese  culture,  civilisation   and\r\n\r\nlanguage.  So  that was what they were  there  for.  In\r\n\r\ndefence  of  Chinese  culture, civilisation,  language;\r\n\r\nMalay  culture, civilisation, language; Indian culture,\r\n\r\ncivilisation,  language; English  culture  or  English-speaking and so on and so forth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> P.A.P. culture!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They have no culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That coming from the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson,  Sir,  I  feel  a  bit  sorry  because  he  must\r\n\r\nunderstand.

This is the way to a  red  blood-bath\r\n\r\nwhich  neither  the Communists nor the  Government  can\r\n\r\nstop. This is what happened in Ceylon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Singhalese  versus Tamils.

So let  us  not  start  these\r\n\r\nthings.  The  attitude of the Government towards  these\r\n\r\nmatters   must   obviously  be  simple  and   obviously\r\n\r\nreasonable.  There is no reason at all  to  be  excited\r\n\r\nabout  the  future  of Chinese education,  language  or\r\n\r\nculture. Education in our merger proposals is a subject\r\n\r\nreserved for the State, and there will be the financial\r\n\r\nprovision  to  make  this  a  reality - genuine  reserved\r\n\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 4:2 system, as I have said, has been agreed\r\n\r\nto  between  the principals, management committees  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education. It is not our wish to impose\r\n\r\nany  change on the Chinese educational system,  or  the\r\n\r\nMalay  educational  system or  the  Indian  educational\r\n\r\nsystem,  even if it is a change for the better,  unless\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese educational world or the Malay educational\r\n\r\nworld  themselves desire the change. In  this  way,  we\r\n\r\nshall watch the Communists run around in vain trying to\r\n\r\nfind a rallying point in the Chinese schools from which\r\n\r\nto mount an assault on the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members of the Barisan Sosialis are keen\r\n\r\nbridge players. I am told by the Member for Jalan Besar\r\n\r\nthat while the Barisan Sosialis were in the doldrums in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  months  staying  at  the  Canning  Rise\r\n\r\nAssemblymen's Hostel, reading the news of our  progress\r\n\r\ntowards  merger,  they used to while  away  their  time\r\n\r\nplaying  bridge, day and night At a later  date,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold  that  it degenerated into poker, Sir. But  bridge\r\n\r\nwas  what  they started with - an intellectual exercise,\r\n\r\nSir.  Therefore, I say they will appreciate this little\r\n\r\nmetaphor.  We will call merger trumps. They  raise  the\r\n\r\nbid   on  merger's  trumps.  Our  merger  partner,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, raise the bid  higher.  Finally\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis call a grand slam  for  merger's\r\n\r\ntrumps.  They  say they want complete  merger  with  no\r\n\r\nreserved powers. They want more merger than we do. Sir,\r\n\r\nin our hand we hold 7, 8, 9,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10  cards  of  merger trumps.

He has two assets, from their\r\n\r\npoint  of  view,  Sir.  A  strong  voice  and  a  total\r\n\r\ndisregard  for  reason, logic and good  sense.  He  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to the citizenship and nationality  proposals\r\n\r\nagreed to between the Tunku and his colleagues and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government as a form of apartheid in which he\r\n\r\nwildly   alleges  that  Singapore  citizens   will   be\r\n\r\nsegregated from Federation citizens. Nothing,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nmore  remote from the truth. The Tunku has said,  \"More\r\n\r\nup  than  down.\"  We believe it is the other  way.  But\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  is,  does he believe a  Government  which\r\n\r\nallows,  in  constitutional  theory,  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown to be eligible to be Prime Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole of the Federation of Malaysia? And he calls  that\r\n\r\napartheid!  Dr  Malan agreed that  the  Cape  coloured\r\n\r\npersons  and  the  Zulus can become Prime  Minister  of\r\n\r\nSouth  Africa. And he says that is apartheid! What  are\r\n\r\nwe  talking about? Sir, he has read too many  different\r\n\r\nspeeches  written  by  too  many  ghost  writers.   The\r\n\r\narguments  they put forward for him to read  are  often\r\n\r\ncontradictory.  First, he asked, in  writing  (this  is\r\n\r\nvery  important, because otherwise, he will say,  \"When\r\n\r\ndid I say these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings?\"),  for  merger  with Singapore  as  a  twelfth\r\n\r\nState,  like  Penang and Malacca. Then he rejected  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of citizenship which applied in Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca and wanted automatic conversion even though  he\r\n\r\nadmitted that the rules for Singapore citizenship  were\r\n\r\nquite  different, they being freer and easier than  the\r\n\r\nrules for Federation citizenship.

This  led  me  to\r\n\r\nbelieve,  since both these papers had exactly the  same\r\n\r\nthing,  word  for  word, character for character,  that\r\n\r\nthere  was already a prepared Chinese text handed over.\r\n\r\nI went through the whole lot.

That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Queenstown said, Sir. And  yet  on\r\n\r\nthe  20th of October, when I asked him publicly in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers to say, since he believed that all Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  would  qualify  under Federation  citizenship\r\n\r\nlaws, whether he would accept the citizenship laws that\r\n\r\napplied in Penang and Malacca.

Assure them that  they\r\n\r\nwill  qualify.\" I do not tell the people that,  because\r\n\r\ncalculating the figures in the Federation, I know  that\r\n\r\n230,000   would   be  disqualified.  The   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown says, \"No, they will all qualify.\" But  when\r\n\r\nwe  asked them to say in writing, \"Yes, we accept  it,\"\r\n\r\nthey  kept  quiet. Sir, instead, he has come back  here\r\n\r\nand  repeated the claim for automatic conversion, which\r\n\r\nhe  knows is completely unacceptable, and he has  tried\r\n\r\nto  laugh  off the different residential qualifications\r\n\r\nrequired  by the Federation citizenship laws by  saying\r\n\r\nthat  only  a  few European civilians and ex-servicemen\r\n\r\nwould  be  involved. I think I am right in saying  that\r\n\r\nbecause I interjected at that point. I was here then. I\r\n\r\nasked  him whether he was aware that a large number  of\r\n\r\nIndians,  as  British Commonwealth  citizens - or  rather\r\n\r\nCommonwealth citizens (I think the British have decided\r\n\r\nto  be more discreet these days) - are allowed to acquire\r\n\r\nand  have acquired Singapore citizenship after only two\r\n\r\nyears' residence -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What place?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Here. Over 50,000 such persons,\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of whom are Indians, have  qualified  in\r\n\r\nthis   way   and  would  be  disenfranchised   on   the\r\n\r\nresidential qualifications alone, if we had  merger  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  Penang and Malacca.  They  include  the\r\n\r\n10,000  City Council Indian workers, and others in  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base, Army, R.E.M.E. Workshops and Air Ministry.\r\n\r\nOf this 50,000 the majority are Indians, and only 1,000\r\n\r\nor  2,000,  at  the  most 3,000 are Europeans.  And  he\r\n\r\nlaughed  it off. I think this is food for thought.  Let\r\n\r\nme  do  the  computation for him. I think  one  of  his\r\n\r\nadvisers,   Mr   James   Puthucheary,   is   a    good\r\n\r\nstatistician. He might confirm this for the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  I rely on my colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.   624,000   voters  in  Singapore,   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens - Malay-educated,  approximately  15  per  cent;\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated,  approximately 10 per  cent;  Indian-educated,  another 10 per cent. That is  35  per  cent.\r\n\r\nThey  are  solidly ranged against all these nonsensical\r\n\r\nproposals that the Barisan are spouting for. If we take\r\n\r\nthe  latest figures on the English-educated, every year\r\n\r\nsince  the last revision it has gone up; it is  now  12\r\n\r\nper  cent.  So  it  is  now 37 per  cent.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis can be quite sure that they start off with  37\r\n\r\nper  cent  saying \"No\" to them. So you  see,  it  is  a\r\n\r\npretty tough proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said they had 2,000 students attending the\r\n\r\nmeeting,  mass rally, procession or victory march.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  papers  said 4,000. So let  us  be  fair.  The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times said 2,000 but I also read  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh and they said 4,000.\r\n\r\n4,000  students out of a total of nearly 50,000  middle\r\n\r\nschool  students. That is a minority  of  8  per  cent,\r\n\r\nwhich,  in this year of excitement, they can  mount  on\r\n\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I view the future with a reasonable degree of\r\n\r\nequanimity,  provided - this is an important  proviso - we\r\n\r\ndo  not give any excuse for raising communal fears  and\r\n\r\ntensions. I would beseech the Malay Assemblymen in this\r\n\r\nHouse not even unwittingly to help the Barisan in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaying  this line. It is a natural thing to react  and\r\n\r\ntalk of parang panjang and the kris, but it is not wise\r\n\r\nbecause  what they say in this House, by  the  time  it\r\n\r\nreaches  the coffee-shops (which the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark has talked about) is completely distorted and they\r\n\r\nsay  that  what  the Member for Geylang Serai  and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan promised was the kris  and\r\n\r\nthe  parang  panjang on the day of merger.  A  complete\r\n\r\ndistortion  would have gone out. Tensions would  mount.\r\n\r\nSo  I  say  the  less talk of this the better.  If  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   want  to  play  this  line,  they  take   the\r\n\r\nconsequences  upon themselves. I say neither  wittingly\r\n\r\nnor unwittingly should we give them any excuse to mount\r\n\r\nthis. We know the Member for Geylang Serai did not  say\r\n\r\nthat.  What  he said was, if they persisted  in  saying\r\n\r\nthis,  then  in the end the result would be the  parang\r\n\r\npan  lang.  A  fair  remark.  The  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan said there was also the kris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have a volatile situation, Sir. For no rhyme or\r\n\r\nreason,  all of a sudden people think that somebody  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  attack another body, and the whole situation\r\n\r\nsuddenly gets tense. It is a curious thing that  before\r\n\r\nthe  ARTIS  case  was  even announced,  half  the  town\r\n\r\nalready knew of it. Not a word had been uttered; nobody\r\n\r\nhad  been yet arrested; tension had mounted by word  of\r\n\r\nmouth because, on communal issues, you can arouse fears\r\n\r\nso quickly and so intensely that it just is not true. I\r\n\r\nsay, as responsible political leaders, however provoked\r\n\r\nwe  may  be, let the Barisan alone play this  dangerous\r\n\r\nline -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - for anyway, they are in a\r\n\r\ndangerous position. God bless them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I add that any Singapore citizen who goes to\r\n\r\nreside in the Federation and would like to give up  his\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship  and,  together  with  it,   his\r\n\r\nspecial  rights,  State rights in  Singapore,  and  his\r\n\r\neducation, housing, social welfare benefits and so  on,\r\n\r\ncan do so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  apply for citizenship of the Federation. If he can\r\n\r\npass  the rules for citizenship, including the language\r\n\r\ntest,  he  can  convert his Singapore citizenship  into\r\n\r\nFederation  citizenship. But there are 320,000  present\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens who will be unable, either  because\r\n\r\nof   the  residential  qualification  or  the  language\r\n\r\nqualification,  to  satisfy the Federation  citizenship\r\n\r\nrules. They can travel freely throughout the new Federation  and enjoy equal rights and protection under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  as  nationals of the new Federation  even\r\n\r\nthough  they do not convert their Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nto  Federation  citizenship because  they  cannot  pass\r\n\r\nthese tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a point worthwhile mentioning, not\r\n\r\nbecause the Members concerned are necessarily concerned\r\n\r\nonly for themselves. This is one of the reasons why the\r\n\r\nCommunists   lay   such  great  stress   on   automatic\r\n\r\nconversion.  By  way of example, Sir, the  Members  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  Thomson, Pasir Panjang and  Moulmein  were\r\n\r\nnot  born in Singapore. The Members for Queens-town and\r\n\r\nThomson were born in the Federation, and the other  two\r\n\r\nwere born in China. Under Penang and Malacca conditions\r\n\r\nof merger, they would have to re-apply for registration\r\n\r\nas  citizens.  They  know  very  well,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government does not give citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nto  Communists, pro-Communists, or conscious stooges of\r\n\r\nthe  Communists,  and that if they  are  to  apply  for\r\n\r\nregistration  as Federal citizens they will  never  get\r\n\r\nit.  There are quite a number in this category, and not\r\n\r\njust the four hon. Gentlemen I have mentioned. You will\r\n\r\nrecall, Sir, that one of the demands they made  on  2nd\r\n\r\nJune for supporting us in the Anson by-election was  to\r\n\r\ngive citizenship rights to anti-colonialists, like  Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan  and a few others. But  they  did  not\r\n\r\nmention   that   these   anti-colonialists   were   not\r\n\r\nnationalists  but  Communists,  and  we  did  not  give\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights to them. They are worried for  these\r\n\r\npeople.  They  have neither Singapore  citizenship  nor\r\n\r\nFederation citizenship, and they are not going  to  get\r\n\r\nFederation nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  their own selfish interest, to ensure that the few\r\n\r\nwho have Singapore citizenship can run for election  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation in case they cannot win in Singapore, or\r\n\r\nin  case they have not enough of what they call \"kakis\"\r\n\r\nin the Federation, they have mistakenly first asked for\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger like Penang and Malacca,  not  knowing\r\n\r\nthat,  in  effect, they were selling out the rights  of\r\n\r\nover 230,000 Singapore citizens who would be completely\r\n\r\ndisenfranchised  by  the  application  of  Penang   and\r\n\r\nMalacca conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very few people in Singapore change their\r\n\r\nresidence to the Federation, and over 99.9 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore are not Communists;  and  of\r\n\r\nthose who move to the Federation nearly all can qualify\r\n\r\nunder the Federation citizenship laws to vote there for\r\n\r\nFederal   State   elections  and   Central   Parliament\r\n\r\nelections  if  they  can  satisfy  the  residence   and\r\n\r\nlanguage test. But the Communists who apply will not be\r\n\r\ngiven  that  right, and they know that.  Only  they - and\r\n\r\nunfortunately  there are many of them  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - are anxious about the condition that they have\r\n\r\nto  register  for Federation citizenship, because  they\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Federation Government  will  not  give\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights  to  the  Communists  or   pro-Communists or even conscious stooges of Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told that the term \"national of the\r\n\r\nnew  Federation\"  means absolutely  nothing.  You  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  the  Member for  Anson  raised  certain\r\n\r\nquestions arising out of the term \"national of the  new\r\n\r\nFederation\".  I said then that I would  ask  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  to  advise us  on  this  question  of\r\n\r\nnationality.  I  have done this and I have  tabled  his\r\n\r\nopinion  for the benefit of all Members of this  House.\r\n\r\nSir, one of the advisers of the Member for Queenstown - I\r\n\r\nthink  he has two in the Party - is only a semi-qualified\r\n\r\nperson.  He  has only passed certain parts of  the  law\r\n\r\nexaminations. I do not know It may be. But  if  he  has\r\n\r\nsuch  an  adviser, naturally he came to the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  since there is no such term as \"Federal national\"\r\n\r\nin  the present Constitution, then, therefore, the term\r\n\r\n\"national\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans nothing. Sir, this half LL.B. - because he has only\r\n\r\nhalf  an LL.B. - went through this Constitution and said,\r\n\r\n\"No  'national'. Therefore this means nothing.\"  Surely\r\n\r\ndo   they  expect  the  people  to  believe  all  this?\r\n\r\nObviously I do not know, Sir,I was in the chamber  and\r\n\r\nexplanations  were  going on  between  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  and the Member for Anson. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  was slightly  unclear  about  these\r\n\r\nproposals, probably no doubt through constant  meetings\r\n\r\nwith the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You are very interested!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> However, Sir, I am glad that the\r\n\r\nignorance  of  the Member for Anson is not  responsible\r\n\r\nfar the lack of lucidity which is usually very apparent\r\n\r\nin his legal arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they believe that all these proposals in Cmd. Paper\r\n\r\n33   of   1961,  which  hears  the  signature  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation's  Prime Minister, mean  nothing,  that  the\r\n\r\nConstitution will remain like this and we just send  up\r\n\r\nthe  15  representatives voted by us?  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson - I quote him as an authority - negotiated the  first\r\n\r\ntalks  in  Singapore.  He  worked  out  his  heads   of\r\n\r\nagreement.  He knew that once they were agreed  to,  it\r\n\r\nmeans that the parliamentary draftsman would step in to\r\n\r\nspell  it  out  and  enshrine it in  the  Constitution.\r\n\r\nSurely  that  must follow. I repeat once more:  if  for\r\n\r\ndomestic  and internal purposes, a man wants to  change\r\n\r\nhis  rights  of  Singapore  citizenship  to  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship  or  vice-versa, be can  do  so  under  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  or internal State laws of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.   But   for  national   and   international\r\n\r\npurposes,   it   is   unnecessary,  because   he   will\r\n\r\nautomatically  become a national of the new  Federation\r\n\r\nand whether he changes from Singapore to the Federation\r\n\r\nor  vice  versa,  he  is still a national  of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation  with  no right added or subtracted  by  his\r\n\r\nconversion.  There  is  nothing  to  support  the  wild\r\n\r\nallegation that a Singapore citizen will be  a  second-class citizen or will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsegregated from Federation citizens. It is just one  of\r\n\r\nthose  Barisan Sosialis lines intended to  confuse  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to labour the explanations the\r\n\r\nState   Advocate-General  has  given  in  his   written\r\n\r\nopinion,  but for the purposes of the record,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to refer to them - photo-engraved copies have  been\r\n\r\ncirculated to all Members of this House - and if there is\r\n\r\nany further point that requires elucidation, I am quite\r\n\r\nhappy to refer the matter to the S.A.G. As I have said,\r\n\r\nLawyer though I may be, it is not my business to be the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  legal  adviser.  On  these  matters   the\r\n\r\nConstitution lays down who is to advise the Government,\r\n\r\nand if the Government is asked for further elucidation,\r\n\r\neither in or outside this Chamber, we shall be only too\r\n\r\nhappy to ask the S.A.G. to clarify. But I would like to\r\n\r\nparaphrase, if I may, because I am told by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture that the language used in the  opinion  is\r\n\r\ntoo legalistic and formalistic to be readily understood\r\n\r\nby  the  majority of people. I would like to paraphrase\r\n\r\nit  in simple language without altering the meaning  or\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of what the S.A.G. has written.  It  simply\r\n\r\nmeans that the terms \"citizen\" and \"national\" have  the\r\n\r\nsame  meaning. The word \"citizen\" is usually used  with\r\n\r\nreference  to  a  person's domestic or internal  rights\r\n\r\nwithin  a  country and the term \"national\"  is  usually\r\n\r\nused  with reference to a man's international  standing\r\n\r\nand  status.  I would like to add that we could  easily\r\n\r\ncall all present Singapore citizens, together with  the\r\n\r\npresent  Federation  Citizens,  citizens  of  the   new\r\n\r\nFederation  instead of nationals of the new  Federation\r\n\r\nwithout  any  change  in the meaning  or  the  content.\r\n\r\nCalling a man a citizen or a national cannot add to  or\r\n\r\nsubtract  from the rights of citizens or  nationals  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Federation by whichever term they are called.\r\n\r\nThese rights have been agreed to in paragraph 14 of the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  and  they will be  so  enshrined  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the new Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first merdeka talks in 1956, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  secured  the  agreement  of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation - I am now quoting from Cmd. 31 of 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexure  D - \"Heads of agreement between the  Government\r\n\r\nof the United Kingdom and the Government of Singapore\".\r\n\r\nThese  provisions  were set out from  the  pen  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson arid were agreed to by all members  of\r\n\r\nthe All-Party Delegation, including myself and Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong, the then Member for Bukit Timah.

I think he will\r\n\r\nnow recall that the term \"national\" was used to mean at\r\n\r\nthe same time \"citizen\" - he nods in agreement, and I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to have that recorded, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The nod?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is an important thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Subsequently,  when\r\n\r\nwe  came  into  this Chamber in the  last  Assembly  to\r\n\r\nimplement  these proposals - this was one  of  the  terms\r\n\r\nwhich  were agreed to in the first Constitutional talks\r\n\r\nin  1956, not the second one, because we inherited this\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Member for Anson when he led the  first  one\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and when we translated them I did not know why, who or\r\n\r\nwhat,  but  the Member for Cairnhill then as the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   introduced  a  Citizenship  Bill  presumably\r\n\r\nbecause (I am not giving any secrets away) I think what\r\n\r\nhappened  was  they  just copied the  Federation  Bill.\r\n\r\nSince the Federation called them \"citizens\", they  just\r\n\r\nchanged \"nationality\" to \"citizen\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> While we were asking for independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, not because of independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not when I was called the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I see.

I am indebted to the Member for  Anson  for\r\n\r\nhaving  reinforced  my  point.  When  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill changed it to \"citizens\", nobody said it  was\r\n\r\na  sell-out.

The    Chinese\r\n\r\ncharacters, unfortunately, by translation, have not the\r\n\r\nsame connotations as the English terms for the word. To\r\n\r\nany  English-speaking  man,  particularly  one  who  is\r\n\r\nfamiliar with legal language, one talks of nationality,\r\n\r\nnever  of citizenship. The first question that is asked\r\n\r\nwhen  you enter any country and immigration forms  have\r\n\r\nto  be filled up is. \"Nationality?\". When you apply for\r\n\r\na  Singapore  passport  or a Federation  passport,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  asked, \"Nationality?\". But  unfortunately\r\n\r\nwhen  it is translated into Chinese, the original, more\r\n\r\ncommonly used term for \"citizen\" is translated Kung Min,\r\n\r\nmeaning   public,  people,  citizen.   And   the   word\r\n\r\n\"nationality\", Kuo Min, meaning country, people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am genuinely grateful to the Member for Anson for\r\n\r\nhaving  been helpful in this matter, in convincing  the\r\n\r\npeople that the terms \"citizen\" and \"national\" mean the\r\n\r\nsame,  and  that further, in the English language,  the\r\n\r\nterm   more  commonly  used  is  \"national\",  and   not\r\n\r\n\"citizen\". This is the problem which has now arisen out\r\n\r\nof the interpretation of Kung Min and Kuo Min, and we may\r\n\r\nhave  to  spend  quite some time and  I  welcome  every\r\n\r\nopportunity  we have to do every conceivable  thing  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  all  people  that  they  are  not   losing\r\n\r\nanything.  They are keeping their Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nand  they  become automatically nationals  of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation. They can vote for their representatives  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Parliament. They have all the  rights  of\r\n\r\nnationals, anywhere in Malaya or Malaysia. If they want\r\n\r\nto  go  to  the  Federation  and  take  part  in  State\r\n\r\nelections there, they can qualify under the State  laws\r\n\r\nthere or the Federation citizenship laws there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point that must constantly worry the Communist\r\n\r\nbackroom  boys of the Barisan Sosialis is that whatever\r\n\r\nhap, pens, or whichever way you combine and permute the\r\n\r\nconditions for merger, after merger security will be in\r\n\r\nthe hands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a  strong Central Government, and their opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  subversive activities will be severely  conscribed\r\n\r\nand  confined. The Member for Queenstown has, on behalf\r\n\r\nof  his Communist friends, denied that they are worried\r\n\r\nabout this and has claimed that they are quite happy to\r\n\r\ngo  to gaol. Sir, I know of no sane man being happy  to\r\n\r\ngo  to gaol, but I know of chaps who are not afraid  to\r\n\r\ngo  to gaol. I quite believe there are some - I know  of\r\n\r\nsome in the Barisan Sosialis - who are not afraid. But I\r\n\r\nalso  know of some who are very afraid. That is another\r\n\r\nmatter. They say they are not afraid to go to gaol, but\r\n\r\nare  happy to go to gaol. Then, on the other hand, they\r\n\r\nget  it  in  writing that the only proposal for  merger\r\n\r\nwhich  is  acceptable to the Barisan Sosialis  is  that\r\n\r\nwhich  is  stated  in  writing,  a  confederation  with\r\n\r\ninternal  security  not in the  hands  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. Then they are happy. They do not mind, Sir,\r\n\r\nabout foreign affairs or defence. Even if you say, \"$90\r\n\r\nmillion\", they say, \"Make it $190 million. Tunku,  take\r\n\r\nit.  Provided  I can run around here in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nbuild  a  little  ant-hill.\" You  know,  all  the  ants\r\n\r\nforegather, and the rain comes and dries up the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if merger means that security has to come under\r\n\r\nthe control of the Federation Government, I say it does\r\n\r\nin  any  government  with a federal  constitution;  any\r\n\r\ngovernment they can think of. One of their advisers  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  student,  half  LL.B.  He  can  look  up  the\r\n\r\nConstitutions  of Australia, New Zealand,  Canada,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States. In a federal constitution, security  is\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of the centre, not in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nouter  region,  because if you leave security  ii:  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the outer region, then things begin to happen\r\n\r\nthere.  It is as simple as that. Because of this,  they\r\n\r\nask   for  impossible  conditions,  such  as  automatic\r\n\r\nConversion. They know it is not possible, and they say,\r\n\r\n\"Ah,  that  is what we must ask for.\" They misread  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech about  it  not  being\r\n\r\npossible  to  do these things as a twelfth  State  like\r\n\r\nPenang and Malacca. They suddenly forgot to read, \"as a\r\n\r\ntwelfth State\" and they say, \"Ah, it is not possible to\r\n\r\nbe  a twelfth State. Right, ask to be a twelfth State.\"\r\n\r\nBut we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give it to them - the honour  of  being  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth  State. Sir, this is their dilemma. In  a  7\ufffd-hour  speech - which I do not intend to equal-the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown asked for complete merger as a  twelfth\r\n\r\nState.  He  never once mentioned that he is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nasking for education and labour to be controlled by the\r\n\r\nCentral Federation Government. He knows, and even  more\r\n\r\nso  do his backgroom boys, the Communists, Sir. I  mean\r\n\r\nthe  real ones, not the Member for Queenstown. He  told\r\n\r\nme  he  just wanted to make use of them. \"Why not  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  them?\" He also told the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nThere  is  proof of that, and that is why he has  never\r\n\r\ndared to deny that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Don't twist!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You either say you make use of the\r\n\r\nCommunists, or you do not say it.

I am quite prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown's explanation now  that  he\r\n\r\nreally  did not mean to make use of them, but  what  he\r\n\r\nreally meant was that he was going to collaborate  with\r\n\r\nthem.  That  is another matter, Sir. He  can  give  his\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are talking about you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Me? I have no intention of\r\n\r\ncollaborating with them on a Communist united front. My\r\n\r\nintention, Sir, was to collaborate with them on a\r\n\r\ngenuine nationalist, anti-colonial front against the\r\n\r\nBritish. So long as we were out to down the British,\r\n\r\nanybody that said, \"I join you to down the British,\", I\r\n\r\nwould say, \"Yes.\" The Tunku surely did not down the\r\n\r\nCommunists until after he had got independence. He went\r\n\r\nto Baling with the Member for Anson, chit-chatted with\r\n\r\nChin Peng, came to know of him, and came back. But he\r\n\r\ndid not really go for them. When he got in-dependence\r\n\r\nand when the issue was not \"How do we get rid of the\r\n\r\nBritish?\", but \"What do we do with Malaya?\", then we\r\n\r\nparted company. I will not go in to join with them on\r\n\r\nabolishing the Internal Security Council, and full\r\n\r\ninternal self-government which is going to lead to an\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore. We saw through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  that, and we are not that simple. We got  them  to\r\n\r\nsign  on  the  dotted  line  when  they  came  out   of\r\n\r\nprison - Lim  Ching Siong, Fong Swee Suan, and Sanderason\r\n\r\nWoodhull.  And the objective was merger. From  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  Sir, we must remind them of this document.  They\r\n\r\nalways  find these things unpleasant. They  spent  2\ufffd\r\n\r\nyears  of peaceful solitude and concentration and  came\r\n\r\nto  the  correct conclusion that merger was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThen  they  came  out. Night meetings, too  much  night\r\n\r\nlife,  and they came to the wrong conclusions - that  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council should be  abolished  as  a\r\n\r\nfirst step to an independent Singapore. What can we do,\r\n\r\nSir?  All I can say is, it is a pity that in the  midst\r\n\r\nof  their freedom and all this night life, they did not\r\n\r\nbetake  themselves to a quiet place  and  think  things\r\n\r\nout.  If  only  they had pondered over  some  of  these\r\n\r\nthings - I  and  my colleague, the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\ntold  Mr James Puthucheary - they would never have  made\r\n\r\nthe  grievous miscalculations that they had  made.  The\r\n\r\nMost Honourable the Earl of Selkirk, U.K. Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThings came to such a state, Sir, that in a crisis they\r\n\r\nwere  more  pally with the U.K. Commissioner than  they\r\n\r\nwere with us. I said there was something wrong. I could\r\n\r\nnot  believe  it. At that time I found it difficult  of\r\n\r\nexplanation.  [Interruption] No. They  happened  to  be\r\n\r\ntrue, unfortunately. But there are certain other things\r\n\r\nwhich  have  transpired and which perhaps they  may  be\r\n\r\nable to guess at, but we are not going to tell them  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage - how  these  things  happen  and  why  they\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You are talking in riddles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We knew the answer earlier, Sir.\r\n\r\nThat is their trouble. But I will say this before we\r\n\r\nfinish off with the Chinese education problem. They\r\n\r\nknow that the last thing the Singapore Chinese want is\r\n\r\nthe Rahman Talib Report to be implemented. There is a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of unhappiness and misunderstanding - some\r\n\r\nof it deliberately created, and some of it genuine - over\r\n\r\nthis. That is the last thing any Singapore government\r\n\r\nshould do. But they come to this Chamber, demand\r\n\r\ncomplete merger, and say. \"Yes, [by implication] let\r\n\r\nthe Central Government take charge of education.\" And\r\n\r\nthese are the same men, in the same breath uttering and\r\n\r\nconstantly uttering the direst of threats and abuses\r\n\r\nagainst the Rahman Talib Report, both in Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe Federation. They have only one company. They do not\r\n\r\nform a limited company here and a limited company in\r\n\r\nthe Federation. They have one limited company for the\r\n\r\nwhole of Malaya and Singapore. They say one thing in\r\n\r\nthe Federation and another thing in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the purposes of the record, I just want to\r\n\r\nread through this, that the Rahman Talib Report means\r\n\r\nthat Chinese middle schools should teach only for one-third of their school-time in the mother tongue, and\r\n\r\nthat public government examinations should only be in\r\n\r\nMalay and English. These are the very points the\r\n\r\nCommunists are encouraging people to get excited about\r\n\r\nagainst the Rahman Talib Report. They come into this\r\n\r\nHouse and, through the voice of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, say. \"Hand over education to the centre\",\r\n\r\nin order that there can be real trouble then and merger\r\n\r\ncan be frustrated. We are not concerned with their\r\n\r\nhysterics as they find the net of merger and a solidly\r\n\r\nunited Malayan nationalist movement relentlessly\r\n\r\nclosing in on them. The people of Singapore can read,\r\n\r\ncan understand, and can discuss their rights and their\r\n\r\nfuture for themselves, and decide that the proposals\r\n\r\nwhich we have tabled are fair, just and in their best\r\n\r\ninterests. The Singapore citizen will keep his\r\n\r\ncitizenship; he will lose nothing. Instead he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill get something more - the status of a national of\r\n\r\nthe new Federation. This status will bring with it all\r\n\r\nthe rights and privileges written iii the Constitution\r\n\r\nof the new Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already explained simply that the only\r\n\r\nchange which involves all Singapore citizens is a\r\n\r\nchange for the better. Instead of the words \"British\r\n\r\npassport\" and \"British subject\" appearing on the\r\n\r\npassport carried by the present citizens of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere will appear the words \"Federation of Malaysia\r\n\r\npassport\" and \"Federation of Malaysia national\". Yet to\r\n\r\nthe jaundiced eye of the Communists, Sir, this is a\r\n\r\nretrograde step. They want the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil abolished. They want the British flag still\r\n\r\nhere. They have come to an agreement with the U.K.\r\n\r\nCommissioner to leave the bases alone. They can still\r\n\r\ncarry British passports.

If winning means\r\n\r\nthat they win on behalf of the Communists, they just\r\n\r\ncannot win. They will not be allowed to win by the very\r\n\r\nnature of things. If you want to win, you have to win\r\n\r\non your own behalf as a democrat, whether you are a\r\n\r\nLeft-wing or a Right-wing. That is another matter. But\r\n\r\nbe your own separate movement, not an adjunct of the\r\n\r\nCommunist movement. Do not rely on the strength of the\r\n\r\nCommunist organisation to provide you with the mass\r\n\r\nsupport. We did not, Sir.

They did not. 3.000-odd solidly voted  in\r\n\r\nAnson  in  spite of the treachery of eight  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwho  came  out  on  the eve of the poll  to  shake  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the public in the P.A.P. 3,000 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You did not get in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, maybe.

In  the  end, and  the  time  is  fast\r\n\r\napproaching,  the  line is drawn.  The  P.A.P. is  all\r\n\r\nright. Win or lose, we are still all right. That is the\r\n\r\nbeauty  of  the situation.

What  kind of people  are  they?  An\r\n\r\naverage  sensible man asks himself that. They claim  to\r\n\r\nbe  anti-colonialists, and yet they are suggesting that\r\n\r\nwe   should  continue  to  use  British  passports,  as\r\n\r\ncolonial subjects of Britain, in preference  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  an  independent  Federation  passport,  as\r\n\r\nnationals   of  an  independent  nation.

They say this is a sell-out. Sell-out to whom? The British? The Federation? To us? What\r\n\r\nare  they  talking about? Can the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nexplain  why,  by his proposals, he prefers  a  British\r\n\r\npassport to the Federation of Malaya passport?  He  has\r\n\r\nseen it all published in the Chinese Press; he reads it\r\n\r\nstudiously, like me too. He prefers to carry a  British\r\n\r\npassport, and he says he is an anti-colonialist. It  is\r\n\r\na funny kind of anti-colonialism that insists on having\r\n\r\nthe  colonialists  there all the  time.  When  we  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look,   shake   them  off.  Let  us   be   independent\r\n\r\nnationals.\" He says, \"No.\" He may not know the  answer.\r\n\r\nThese are tricky questions for him, because he does not\r\n\r\nknow  the real answer. The real answer is that  if  you\r\n\r\nstrike  out the British, then the colonialists are  out\r\n\r\nof  the  ring.  Then you have to fight the nationalists\r\n\r\nand openly say that you are fighting them. Then you are\r\n\r\nin trouble when you fight them. It is one thing dealing\r\n\r\nwith  a  dying  British regime.  It  is  another  thing\r\n\r\ndealing with a virile nationalist regime. Those are the\r\n\r\nimponderables which the Member for Queenstown  did  not\r\n\r\ncalculate  carefully when he made his bid on merger  as\r\n\r\ntrumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these proposals are in the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople.

He said the trouble was that it was easier to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  reactionaries like the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand  his S.P.A. than with us in the P.A.P. He said this\r\n\r\nin  the  C.P.A.

He openly told the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill That he preferred to deal with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He did not pose so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ah!

So  long  as  you  are  democratic,   we   are\r\n\r\ndemocratic.\" I will tell them what is the  problem.  We\r\n\r\nhave  the  advantage of knowing them, and knowing  them\r\n\r\nwell. We have good reasons to know them well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the old united front days, when we fought the\r\n\r\nBritish  for  the common objective of independence, we\r\n\r\nused  to  work  together. We got to  know  their  modus\r\n\r\noperandi.  We watched the conjurer from the  backstage,\r\n\r\nnot  from the front stage, Sir. We took out the top hat\r\n\r\nand they slipped in the rabbit, as I have explained. We\r\n\r\npulled the rabbit out - applause from the multitude!  At\r\n\r\nother times, Sir, they allowed themselves to be tied up\r\n\r\nand locked up and put in a big suitcase. After a decent\r\n\r\ninterval - two  and a half years - we  unlocked  the\r\n\r\nsuitcase and they came out free men. But in the process\r\n\r\nwe  learned how they worked their tricks. We  know  how\r\n\r\nthe props are used and where they are used. The trouble\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member for Queenstown is - and this  goes  for\r\n\r\nquite a number of his Barisan Sosialis boys who are not\r\n\r\nCommunists, there are quite a few of them who  are  not\r\n\r\nCommunists who are running around with them - is that he\r\n\r\nhas  never had the experience of this gruelling process\r\n\r\nof working the united front with the Communists. It may\r\n\r\nhe  that  one of these days, through lack of experience\r\n\r\nand over-excitement, as I have said, instead of pulling\r\n\r\nout  a  rabbit,  he will pull out a serpent  which  may\r\n\r\nmortally bite him, to the discomfiture of his Communist\r\n\r\nprops. That is why their ghost writers were watching so\r\n\r\nanxiously  in this Chamber when the Member for  Queenstown   was  performing  for  them.  Often  their  faces\r\n\r\nbetrayed their utter dismay as he bungled the role that\r\n\r\nhe   was  asked  to  play.  He  read  out  their  lines\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  Sir. But often he got the stage  directions\r\n\r\nwrong. For instance, instead of staring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat us fiercely in the eyes denouncing us as he read his\r\n\r\nheavy  lines of abuse and denunciation, written against\r\n\r\nus,  he  joined  us  in  mirth  and  merriment  at  the\r\n\r\nabsurdity  of it all. Here was their great  moment - like\r\n\r\nHamlet,  Sir, \"To be or not to be.\" - And the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  broke into uncontrollable  mirth.  You  can\r\n\r\nimagine  the dismay of the directors! They wrote  three\r\n\r\nred lines: Look fiercely. Stare them in the eyes -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is where you are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hamlet broke down and laughed Sir!\r\n\r\nIt  was  absurd.  But, in fact, he has very  little  to\r\n\r\nlaugh  about, because there is a fundamental difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the united front we worked together  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in the years between the formation  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  the attainment of independence of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nand   the  present  united  front  between  some   non-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis and the majority  of\r\n\r\npro-Communists  and  Communists.  Let  me  explain  the\r\n\r\ndifference to him. In our united front from  the  years\r\n\r\n1954   to   1957,  it  was  the  classic  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nmovement. The enemy was the Right force. The enemy  was\r\n\r\nthe British. Everybody who was against the British,  be\r\n\r\nhe a nationalist or a Communist, got together to oppose\r\n\r\nthe British colonial system. That is the classic united\r\n\r\nfront.  The  common enemy was the British imperialists.\r\n\r\nThe  people  of Malaya - nationalists, Communists,  anti-Communists, pro-Communists - sank their differences  and\r\n\r\ngot together to fight a common enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned just now, even the Tunku did\r\n\r\nnot  fight  the  Communists until he got  independence.\r\n\r\nThen  he  had to fight them, because after Merdeka  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  wanted to fight on for a Communist  Malaya.\r\n\r\nHe  did not want a Communist Malaya. That is the point.\r\n\r\nIf  we  wanted a Communist Singapore, the way to travel\r\n\r\nthat road is with the Barisan; abolish the I.S.C., next\r\n\r\nstep  independence,  next step all irretrievably  lost.\r\n\r\nLet  me tell the Member for Queenstown, even in his own\r\n\r\nselfish  interests, if he travels that  road,  assuming\r\n\r\nthat that road can succeed, he will not succeed,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir.  Because he cannot control the forces  that\r\n\r\ncarry him there. But we can. We went with them up to  a\r\n\r\npoint,  and the point was fight the British. The moment\r\n\r\nthey  change the enemy and say fight the Tunku, we  say\r\n\r\nwe  do nothing of the sort. He is a nationalist and  we\r\n\r\nare  nationalists. He is Right, we are Left. But on one\r\n\r\nthing  we  are agreed - no Communist Malaya.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nmerger.  I  see  he  is more pensive these  days,  Sir.\r\n\r\n[Laughter].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. For a moment, I thought the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was  thinking of the Speaker, because  he  is\r\n\r\nsupposed to look at the Speaker and not at Members  who\r\n\r\nare perhaps weary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely, Sir, maybe it did not soak\r\n\r\ninto  him so. May I just point out the difference?  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, on the other hand, have embarked on a\r\n\r\ndifferent  proposition. The common enemy is  no  longer\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism. It is the nationalists they intend\r\n\r\nto   fight,  not  the  British.  Theirs  is  an   anti-nationalist, not an anti-colonialist united front. When\r\n\r\nthey  say all progressive forces should unite to  fight\r\n\r\nthe   reactionary  and  feudalistic   forces   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation, what they really mean is that all those  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  Communism should combine to down the  Malay\r\n\r\nnationalists   who   rally  round  U.M.N.O. and   the\r\n\r\nleadership of Tunku Abdul Rahman. Let me tell him where\r\n\r\nwe  stand.  We  the  non-Communists support  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nbecause   he  represents  the  genuine  will   of   the\r\n\r\nnationalists   in  Malaya.  Differences  in   political\r\n\r\npolicy, political philosophy and economic policy  there\r\n\r\nare and always will be between a Party of non-Communist\r\n\r\nSocialists - the P.A.P.  - and what the Tunku has called  a\r\n\r\nparty  of  the Right in U.M.N.O. and Alliance  Parties.\r\n\r\nBut on the nationalist issue - perhaps I should say on  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue - of whether we should have a  national\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Malaya or a Communist Malaya,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in  declaring which side we  stand  on.  We\r\n\r\nstand  on the side of the nationalist Malayans  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  prevent  the  Communists  from  undermining   our\r\n\r\nsociety and the independence of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir.

It  is  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  different proposition fighting the  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists.  He has joined hands with the  Communists\r\n\r\nnot  to hammer somebody who is dying and on the way out\r\n\r\n- British  colonialism and British governors - but  he  is\r\n\r\nbeing  foolhardy enough to try and take on  the  virile\r\n\r\npolitical  forces that Malayan nationalism  represents.\r\n\r\nIt  is a hazardous gamble that he has embarked on,  and\r\n\r\nthe  least  that  we can wish him,  Sir,  is  that  his\r\n\r\npainful  experience  should  be  over  as  quickly   as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Member for Queenstown, and particularly the Member\r\n\r\nfor Nee Soon, Sir, - he is a more intelligent man -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But we have had a lengthy debate over  the\r\n\r\nlast  10 to 12 days on that, and the amendment to  that,\r\n\r\nmerely because, in my view, the problem had not been put\r\n\r\nin its proper perspective. Because of that, an amendment\r\n\r\nhad been moved and, in our view, moved not bona fide but\r\n\r\nwith  a  political intent, in the sense that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  had used the word \"political\", and therefore\r\n\r\nwe opposed the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the Front benches on the\r\n\r\nOpposition  feel that the ultimate goal is  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  I  use the word \"complete\", Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  word  \"merger\"  in  itself  should   mean\r\n\r\n\"complete  merger\". But there has been such  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nconfusion over the use of the words \"complete  merger\",\r\n\r\n\"partial  merger\",  \"P.A.P. merger\",  \"phoney  merger\",\r\n\r\n\"genuine merger\", that the word \"merger\" has become  so\r\n\r\nconfused that it has taken on a peculiar meaning of its\r\n\r\nown  over  the last 12 days, so that I think  we  might\r\n\r\nspeak  of  \"complete merger' in the sense of a complete\r\n\r\nintegration of Singapore with the Federation, as in the\r\n\r\nsense  that  Johore or Perak or Selangor is  integrated\r\n\r\nwith the Federation. It is in that sense that \"complete\r\n\r\nmerger\" will be used by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the position is that all the\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties are committed to ultimate merger  or\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger, or whatever you may like to call  it,\r\n\r\nthen  the question arises: what is the opportune moment\r\n\r\nto  bring  about  such  a  merger?  That  would  depend\r\n\r\nentirely  upon  the  Government of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the Federation. If both Governments  are\r\n\r\nagreed  that  there should be a complete  merger,  then\r\n\r\ncomplete merger will take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But if both Governments do not agree upon a\r\n\r\ncomplete merger do we then say, \"Let the time come, let\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  arise  when complete  merger  can  be\r\n\r\neffected.\" Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it would be\r\n\r\nwrong if both the Governments took that line, because I\r\n\r\nfeel  that the longer the situation is kept  as  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday,  the  longer the time it takes  for  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  to  be  effected, the more difficult  will  the\r\n\r\nsituation become.

It  is  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, that I welcome  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on  the  reunification  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make this point very clear. In my opinion, the proposals before the House are not a merger in the sense that I have thought\r\n\r\nmerger  was. The Prime Minister has mentioned that  the\r\n\r\nword \"merger\" could mean this. If he says it means that\r\n\r\nto  him, it is not for me to deny it. But to me, and to\r\n\r\nquite  a lot of people in Singapore, merger means quite\r\n\r\na  different thing. May I respectfully suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  that,  in so far  as  this  particular\r\n\r\nproblem is concerned, it is not what the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  feels  what merger is but what the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  feel  what  merger is  that  really  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem?   Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  to  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, merger means Singapore coming together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya in the sense  that  Johore,\r\n\r\nSelangor   and  Perak  are  merged  in  and  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Although  the policy  of  the  S.P.A. was\r\n\r\nultimately committed to merger, the S.P.A. felt that in\r\n\r\nthe  present  context of Singapore and in  the  present\r\n\r\ncontext of feelings in the Federation, a merger was not\r\n\r\npossible.   Therefore,  we  propounded  the   political\r\n\r\nphilosophy  that,  for the moment, the  most  desirable\r\n\r\nobjective  for Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwas  to  come  together in some  sort  of  a  political\r\n\r\nassociation. We call this a confederation  under  which\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens would remain Singapore citizens  and\r\n\r\nFederal   citizens   would  remain  Federal   citizens.\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  voluntarily  give  up  some  of   its\r\n\r\nsovereignty  to the Federal Parliament. On that  basis,\r\n\r\nwe  run a confederation Government, with local autonomy\r\n\r\nin  all matters of which the Singapore Government  felt\r\n\r\nit  should  retain  control.  In  that  connection,  we\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  inclusion of the Bornean  territories  in\r\n\r\nthis  confederation, in order to make it not  only  one\r\n\r\npolitical unit but also a larger economic unit  within'\r\n\r\nwhich this confederation could work and survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition of the Government set Out in its White\r\n\r\nPaper,  Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest, is not a merger,\r\n\r\nnor  is  it, in my opinion, a confederation.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmixture  of  the  two. But I think it does  not  really\r\n\r\nmatter whether it is a merger, a confederation of  what\r\n\r\nsort of political title one can give to this particular\r\n\r\nWhite Paper. But the point is that it has been possible\r\n\r\nfor   the   Federation  Government  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to come to some agreement which is a working\r\n\r\npossibility   and  which  will,  at  the   moment,   be\r\n\r\nacceptable  to the people of the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand,  I  think,  to a large majority of the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  On that basis, we welcome the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals. I do not wish to enlarge on the contents  of\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper. I think the contents  of  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper - all  the  emotional aspects of  it  and  all  the\r\n\r\naspects  to which there was opposition from the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - have been adequately dealt with in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the amendment which we have been discussing  over\r\n\r\nthe last 10 or 12 days. Therefore, I do not propose  to\r\n\r\ndeal with that matter in great detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emotional aspect of citizenship, namely, whether a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen is a first-class citizen or a second-class  citizen and whether a Singapore citizen  equates\r\n\r\nto  a  Federal  citizen, has been, I think,  adequately\r\n\r\ndealt  with.  The Hon. the Prime Minister has  supplied\r\n\r\nall the answers, which I think should alleviate all the\r\n\r\nfears  on  that aspect. Therefore, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not  propose personally to dwell  on  the\r\n\r\ncontents of the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to put this debate in proper focus, I said, when I was speaking on the amendment, that I would move an amendment to item 3.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment would merely mean that the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals were \"an immediate practical step towards the\r\n\r\nideal goal of complete merger\". I think the Parties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - and   by   Parties  I  mean   the   political\r\n\r\nParties - are  committed to complete  merger.  There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  no dispute in this House on that. In my own view,\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper that is now being placed  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractical  proposition. As an immediate practical  step\r\n\r\ntowards  the ideal goal of complete merger,  I  welcome\r\n\r\nthe White Paper proposals. It is on that basis that  we\r\n\r\nhave  objected  to  the amendment  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and  that we now support the  main  motion,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  all the allied motions  which  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing discussed by this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to take up much\r\n\r\ntime  moving this amendment. We have a very  heavy  day\r\n\r\nahead tomorrow, and I do not wish to speak very much. I\r\n\r\nthink  Members  opposite  the  Opposition  benches  and\r\n\r\nbehind  the Front bench Opposition would like to  speak\r\n\r\nmore  about  this  and get further  clarification.  For\r\n\r\nmyself,  I  feel that the question of a  grant  of  $90\r\n\r\nmillion, which was troubling the Member for Anson,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  adequately discussed. So far as I was  concerned,\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, I had no qualms about that, because\r\n\r\nI knew that under these arrangements, certain Singapore\r\n\r\nservices  would become Federal services. It  is  hardly\r\n\r\nright  that the Federation was going to pay  for  these\r\n\r\nservices out of its own Budget. It must come out of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Budget. Therefore, it is necessary, from  the\r\n\r\nbudgetary  point  of view, that monies  from  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould be transferred to the Federal budget in order to\r\n\r\ncover  the Federal services. As to the balance  of  the\r\n\r\n$12  million, the Prime Minister has said  that  it  is\r\n\r\npossibly for the defence of the country, which, at  the\r\n\r\nmoment, is undertaken by Great Britain without cost  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, I think the two points which were\r\n\r\nworrying  the  House, or some part of  the  House - i.e.,\r\n\r\ncitizenship and the $90 million grant being made by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government to the Federation Government - have\r\n\r\nbeen  adequately  answered. So, Mr Deputy  Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nwill  not take up very much more the time of the  House\r\n\r\nexcept formally to move the amendment to item 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After \"That\" in line I to insert the words \"as an\r\n\r\nimmediate  practical step towards  the  ideal  goal  of\r\n\r\ncomplete merger\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  have here typed copies of the amendment which I  now\r\n\r\nhand to the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of amendment handed in to the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I have indicated, the question on the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Member for Farrer Park will  not\r\n\r\nnow be proposed by the Chair. Firstly, it could not  be\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the Chair because the main motion  [i.e.,\r\n\r\nitem  3]  has  not yet been moved. Secondly,  the  idea\r\n\r\nbehind  Members  being  given an  indication  what  the\r\n\r\namendment  is to enable them from now on to debate  the\r\n\r\nimplications of that amendment, so that at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe debate, I shall take, firstly, the vote on item  1;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  I will call upon the Prime Minister  or  any\r\n\r\nMinister to move the motion shown in item 3. When  that\r\n\r\nis   moved  simpliciter,  I  shall  put  the  amendment\r\n\r\nsimpliciter  to  the  House  for  a  vote.  After   the\r\n\r\namendment  has been disposed of, I shall put the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's motion, as amended, as the case may  be,  to\r\n\r\nthe  House  simpliciter for a vote. That  is  when  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  will end. There will be no vote  today  on\r\n\r\nitem 5. I trust that is clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I had better explain a little further. The\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker has drawn my attention to the fact  that\r\n\r\nperhaps Members do not appreciate that the debate  from\r\n\r\nnow on must be on merger, but other than the aspect  of\r\n\r\nmerger which has already been debated, by reason of the\r\n\r\namendment  which  has  been moved  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  to item 1, and which has now been  disposed\r\n\r\nof.  There  must not be any repetition of the arguments\r\n\r\nwhich  have  already been advanced on the questions  of\r\n\r\nmerger  and  citizens  automatically  becoming  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens on Merger Day. I trust that is clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I wish to express regret for the  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the Minister for Labour. I think the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill not have moved this motion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif it has not lost its faith in the future. It wants to\r\n\r\ntrap the people. It has been inconsistent. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I have reason to say that the P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\nnot  tabling this motion for its prestige but that  it\r\n\r\nhas   other   motives.  This  is  because  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has been arrogant in its attitude. It  often\r\n\r\nsays  that its Party leaders are the most clever people\r\n\r\nin the world. They have not consulted the people on any\r\n\r\nbig question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of merger between Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation, the P.A.P. has boasted about it. We\r\n\r\nalways hear the Government say that the P.A.P. has full\r\n\r\nauthority  to  deal  with  the  merger  question.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has always been saying that it has a mandate\r\n\r\nfor  merger from the people in the general election  of\r\n\r\n1959.  In fact, the merger which was supported  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  in 1959 is not the same as the one now proposed\r\n\r\nby the Government. The Government says that it has full\r\n\r\nauthority  to deal with the merger question.  Then  why\r\n\r\ndoes  it want our support? Perhaps it has realised that\r\n\r\nits merger is a phoney merger, and one that is intended\r\n\r\nto sell out the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have had quite enough\r\n\r\nof  the allegation that this is a sell-out merger or  a\r\n\r\nphoney  merger. We have dealt with that.  If  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember wishes just to say that in passing, well, say it\r\n\r\nin passing, but do not go into further details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\nintention  in  saying it is to prove  that  the  motion\r\n\r\nproposed by the Government is superfluous. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government tries to place the responsibility  on\r\n\r\nthis  House.  It wants to stifle the people  before  it\r\n\r\ndoes these things. Then it can have the excuse that the\r\n\r\nHouse have supported its motion.\r\n\r\nThat is its motive for tabling the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that I am duty bound to\r\n\r\nadvise  the Government that if it realises the mistakes\r\n\r\nit  has made, then it should rectify them. The Chairman\r\n\r\nof  our Party, the Barisan Sosialis, has said that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should realise its mistakes and mend its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nways.  In  short,  my colleagues and I  cannot  support\r\n\r\nthese  weak principles of merger. The Chairman  of  our\r\n\r\nParty  has  also said that we must judge the Government\r\n\r\nby its acts and not by its words. Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has been in power for two years, but what it has\r\n\r\ndone has disappointed us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the freedom-loving\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore have their own correct  stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  This motion is intended to lay down a trap  on\r\n\r\nour way to merger. It is an obstacle in our way to true\r\n\r\nmerger.  That  is  why I regret that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  should have tabled this motion.  The  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nraised  this  motion because it has lost faith  in  its\r\n\r\nfuture. The discontentment of the people has spread all\r\n\r\nover  Singapore. Because of this, the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas  come to the House asking for support of its merger\r\n\r\nproposals. Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is not right for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to use undemocratic methods to try  and\r\n\r\nmaintain its position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order.

Those  are  the\r\n\r\nonly  two points. If the hon.

Although we have\r\n\r\nautonomy in labour and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation,  we  say that this type  of  autonomy  is  a\r\n\r\ndeception,    because   without   political    backing,\r\n\r\neverything is deceit. What I want to say is very short.\r\n\r\nI want to illustrate and explain that if the Government\r\n\r\nsays that employees and strikers are made use of by the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  they can be arrested, therefore,  this\r\n\r\ntype of autonomy is not reliable. Therefore, I say this\r\n\r\nmerger  is phoney and deceives the people. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  since I cannot talk in great detail, my criticism\r\n\r\non autonomy in labour and education ends here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that autonomy in education is also\r\n\r\nnot  true  at  all. If they say that  the  schools  are\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  Communists  or  that  there  are   pro-Communists  in  the  schools, then the  Government  can\r\n\r\nclose  them. This is a political question. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they can point out which teacher is a  Communist\r\n\r\nagent  or  a  pro-Communist and arrest him.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education  is not  reliable.  I  want  to\r\n\r\nillustrate this with an example. Autonomy in labour and\r\n\r\neducation is just like fishing by the sea-side. If  the\r\n\r\nfish  are attracted by the worm and they take  a  bite,\r\n\r\nthey are hooked. If the people of Singapore are treated\r\n\r\nas fish by the Singapore Government and they think that\r\n\r\nautonomy  in labour and education is good,  then  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that the P.A.P. proposals on merger are a  bait.\r\n\r\nBut  I believe the people are very clear in their minds\r\n\r\nand they will not fall into the trap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to a speech\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Prime Minister to show  that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nsupport   the  P.A.P. type  of  merger.  In  a   Press\r\n\r\nconference, he referred to our powers and rights  after\r\n\r\nmerger.  This  has convinced us more not to  trust  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type  of merger. On 12th November a publication\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh: to the effect  that\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister stated that Singapore citizens enjoy\r\n\r\nprivileges  in  Singapore and that Federation  citizens\r\n\r\nenjoy privileges in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If I allow the Member to carry on\r\n\r\nin  this strain, we are going right back to the  debate\r\n\r\non  citizenship. I think we have had a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nargument for and against Singapore citizenship, Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens  automatically becoming Federal  citizens.  So\r\n\r\nthis  line  of argument is repeating an argument  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  advanced, I think - I cannot remember  exactly\r\n\r\nwhich day it was - about eight days ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe difficulty now is this. We feel that it is a phoney\r\n\r\nmerger, but they say that it is a true merger.  I  want\r\n\r\nto  prove that it is a phoney merger. Therefore, I must\r\n\r\nquote some examples to prove that. But since you do not\r\n\r\npermit me to quote an example, I will not say any more.\r\n\r\nI have some opinion on this type of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Member does not\r\n\r\nthink  I am stopping her unnecessarily. We have already\r\n\r\ndebated  a merger as against a genuine merger. I  think\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  many speeches from  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition saying that the merger which is suggested in\r\n\r\nthe White Paper is not a genuine merger. The suggestion\r\n\r\nis  that  it  is a phoney merger. We have debated  that\r\n\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  still hear the Government saying that the PAP, type\r\n\r\nof merger is beneficial to the people and that it is  a\r\n\r\ntrue  merger.  But  my opinion of the  P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger is this. There are three characteristics in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The  first is deceit. If they  cannot  deceive,\r\n\r\nthen  they will threaten. If they cannot threaten, then\r\n\r\nthey  will  try  to manoeuvre. These  are  their  three\r\n\r\ncharacteristics. I have already said -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now conversing\r\n\r\nwith  lady Members opposite. I think if she just  looks\r\n\r\nat the Speaker, he will be very pleased. He will listen\r\n\r\nto her as carefully as he can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo not want to speak any more because a lot has already\r\n\r\nbeen  said.  There may be more speeches on  the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. The P.A.P. type\r\n\r\nof  merger  is not a good one and is not beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthe  people.

They  are  not\r\n\r\nelected  because  they are clever  or  they  can  speak\r\n\r\neloquently  for  so many hours, but  because  they  can\r\n\r\nexpress  the views of the people.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  representatives   are\r\n\r\nelected  not because they can do everything but because\r\n\r\nthey can loyally and honestly speak in the interest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  the  people.

The  Government  should\r\n\r\npatiently  listen  to  the  views  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I do not see any reason why this will  do  any\r\n\r\nharm  to the question of merger. We ought to know  that\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation have been separated for 16\r\n\r\nyears and there are many complicated problems after the\r\n\r\nseparation which deserve our careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We received the White Paper less than a month ago.

On\r\n\r\nthis  question,  the  Party in  power  should  be  more\r\n\r\ndemocratic.  We do not mean to say, as alleged  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, that we have not prepared the texts of  our\r\n\r\nspeeches.  The  question  is  this:  Since  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, as the chief spokesman of the Government, has\r\n\r\nspoken   at   length   for  the   Government,   we   as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people should express our  views\r\n\r\non his speech. If we ask for an adjournment in order to\r\n\r\nmodify  our speeches to accord with the wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then there is nothing wrong in that. This  can\r\n\r\nonly make this House a more democratic body and reflect\r\n\r\nthe  people's  views.  I want to  tell  the  Government\r\n\r\nBenchers  that  their  rough  behaviour  will  make   a\r\n\r\nlaughing  stock of the parliamentary democratic  system\r\n\r\nand  bring  about serious consequences to  it.

Let me make myself very clear. I\r\n\r\nthink  hon. Members will recollect that when the debate\r\n\r\non the amendment was entered upon, and we had had about\r\n\r\ntwo  speakers. I did make a suggestion that all Members\r\n\r\nbe  asked  to  make  only  one  speech  to  cover  that\r\n\r\nparticular amendment and all matters affecting  merger.\r\n\r\nAn  agreement was reached by Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nthat that should be done. But it was the Leader of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  who  did not agree. The result was that  Members\r\n\r\nconfined  themselves  as much  as  they  could  to  the\r\n\r\namendment. That, of course, lets in the principle  that\r\n\r\nonce  Members have spoken on the amendment, they  could\r\n\r\nspeak  again  on the main motion. And when  they  speak\r\n\r\nagain  on  the main motion, it is then that they  could\r\n\r\nrange  over  the three motions I have mentioned,  which\r\n\r\nnow appear in items 1, 3 and 5. That is the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have spoken on the amendment are now at\r\n\r\nliberty to speak again on items 1, 3 and 5 in so far as\r\n\r\nthey touch on merger, and so long as they do not repeat\r\n\r\ntheir   arguments  and  are  relevant  to  the  motion,\r\n\r\nexcluding  the  topic we have already  disposed  of  by\r\n\r\nreason of the amendment.

You said you would leave  it  to\r\n\r\nMembers of the House, if necessary, to pull the  Member\r\n\r\nspeaking up. During the course of this 12-day debate, a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of energy has been spent and  words\r\n\r\nhave  been uttered during which speakers on both  sides\r\n\r\nhave ranged very widely over all questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I quite agree that is so. And that is why\r\n\r\nthe  job of the Chair now is to see that Members do not\r\n\r\nrepeat  themselves. I already had  one  speech  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Stamford where I had to pull  her  up  and\r\n\r\nperhaps cut out half or possibly three-quarters of  her\r\n\r\nspeech. From now on, it will be the job of the Chair to\r\n\r\nsee  that  Members  do not repeat themselves.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  have  already got a 17-page speech  ready - not\r\n\r\nthat  I want to consult anybody, but I think it is  not\r\n\r\nfair to go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point is that everybody knows\r\n\r\nthat  we are coming to these two motions, and that they\r\n\r\nwill  be debated today. We have debated this topic over\r\n\r\nthe  last 12 days. When the Member for Hong Lim  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the pillar of democracy, for 12 days the  pillar\r\n\r\nof  democracy had been allowed to stand where they  are\r\n\r\nand everybody who has anything to say can say so today.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you do  ensure,  as  you  have\r\n\r\nindicated, that there will be no repetition, then I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure that what has to be said today on the topics\r\n\r\nunder  discussion for tonight can be said.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson has already indicated that he has got a  17-page speech\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it is quite a change from a 52-page speech. So I say\r\n\r\nthere is no reason for the contention that just because\r\n\r\nwe  have lifted Standing Orders for tonight, as we have\r\n\r\ndone  on many other occasions, the pillars of democracy\r\n\r\nare  crumbling or that they will crumble.  But  if  the\r\n\r\ntruth  must  be told, Sir, it is quite clear  why  some\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition,  especially  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  are anxious for a postponement.  Because  we\r\n\r\nknow, Sir, that there have been frantic telephone calls\r\n\r\nas  the  speeches  tare  not  ready.

I\r\n\r\nthink  arguments  that are just being thrown  backwards\r\n\r\nand  .forwards  will get us nowhere. I cannot  see  any\r\n\r\nfurther  argument that could be advanced for or against\r\n\r\nthe  postponement of the debate or the  adjournment  of\r\n\r\nthe  debate. I ask Members to cut their speeches short.\r\n\r\nPerhaps leaders of each Party should decide that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  one or two Members of their Party speaking.\r\n\r\nThen let us take a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is the point, Sir. One Member has\r\n\r\nsaid that he has his speech ready. That is why, because\r\n\r\npeople from outside have not got their line laid  down,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  their men here want an adjournment.  But  I\r\n\r\nsay,  as  Members of this Assembly, every Member  after\r\n\r\nthese 12 days should know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexactly  where he stands and what he wants to say.

The  fact  that\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders  do  allow  such  things  is   nothing\r\n\r\nirregular. It serves as an indication that democracy is\r\n\r\nnot  threatened.

But it would appear now that\r\n\r\nwe,  in  fact,  want  to work the parliamentary  system\r\n\r\nsmoothly and effectively. And it is the Government that\r\n\r\nwants  to overwork the parliamentary system and thereby\r\n\r\nmake  it  unworkable.

Sir, I have  no  doubt  every\r\n\r\nMember on the Government Front Bench is fully aware  of\r\n\r\nthis.  Therefore, today when we suggest that we adjourn\r\n\r\nnow, it does not mean that we are weaklings or that  we\r\n\r\nare  afraid  to  sit here and debate the  issues  until\r\n\r\nperhaps 6 a.m. or 2.30 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is this: we are also not\r\n\r\nincapable of making speeches without a written  script.\r\n\r\nWe  are  quite prepared, Sir, if the Government Members\r\n\r\nare,  to  take them on a debate without any  script - the\r\n\r\nthirteen  of us - anywhere they say, provided  they  do\r\n\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> One other point which I want to make\r\n\r\nincidentally, Sir, is that we support the motion  moved\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Anson to adjourn now,  because  the\r\n\r\nissues  we are debating are very serious. Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\nnot talking about whether the Prime Minister should get\r\n\r\na  Tun  or  a  Dato from the Federation Government.

Today  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nspoke  for  four hours. Tomorrow, the daily papers  are\r\n\r\nall  covered  with his speeches. In the  words  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, all that they seek to do is this.\r\n\r\nBecause  we  have been debating for seven days  on  the\r\n\r\namendment and we have been ranging over the other items\r\n\r\nin  the  Order Paper, we have nothing more to  say.  We\r\n\r\nwill  then debate for another hour or two hours,  close\r\n\r\nthe  debate,  and there will be no more  discussion  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  Briefly, it simply means, Sir, that  they  are\r\n\r\nscared to let us continue the debate on the merger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I say this to them. If they are people who\r\n\r\nwant to work the Parliamentary system, if they want  to\r\n\r\nuphold   the  niceties  or  concepts  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  then I say, have the guts to  adjourn  this\r\n\r\ndebate  now. Let us debate the issues before us  coolly\r\n\r\nand  calmly  - not just for the information  of  the  51\r\n\r\nMembers  or  for  your information, Sir,  but  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation of the people of Singapore - in an atmosphere\r\n\r\nwhich would be conducive to the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to say that this is not a question of\r\n\r\nhaving a debate tonight between the P.A.P. Members  and\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis Members. I assure you, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nif  it  is  a  question of just the 26 Members  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and 13 Barisan Sosialis Members, and nobody else\r\n\r\nis  expected  to  work, we say,  fair  enough,  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to take them on for 24 hours or 48  hours  or\r\n\r\nwhatever they want. I have no doubt, Sir, that even the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  would be the first  to  go  to  sleep,\r\n\r\nbecause  I and the Prime Minister had attended meetings\r\n\r\nand  I have seen him leaving the meetings earlier  than\r\n\r\nI.  Therefore, I say this is not the question.  We  are\r\n\r\npeople who, in fact, are not accustomed to go round the\r\n\r\nclock for a meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Too much night life, that is the\r\n\r\ntrouble!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We have been accused of being night-birds.\r\n\r\nBut  it  would  appear  now, Sir, that  the  Government\r\n\r\nMembers,  led  by  the  Hon, the  Prime  Minister,  are\r\n\r\nperhaps trying to follow us as night-birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to conclude by saying this. If it is a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  just the Government Members debating  the\r\n\r\nissue with the Barisan Sosialis Members, then it is all\r\n\r\nwell  and good.

The argument is\r\n\r\nthat  if  this motion goes on, then there will  not  be\r\n\r\ntime to complete the Budget and the other items on  the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper before Christmas. And I like my Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nother  legislative chambers, there are certain stricter\r\n\r\nrules.  You  yourself  have mentioned  the  rules,  the\r\n\r\npowers,  the  devices which this House can exercise  to\r\n\r\ncut things down to the bone and cut away all the forth.\r\n\r\nBut  we have been lenient. We want to go on till  half-past two tomorrow. It does not matter. We will sit here\r\n\r\nwith patience, with tolerance and with forbearance. And\r\n\r\nhear  this out too. One thing I do not doubt of Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis is that  they,  having  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  the  P.A.P. mill, can  go  through  this  and\r\n\r\nsurvive.  The  Members from the United  People's  Party\r\n\r\ntoo.  I have not the slightest doubt that parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy will not come to grief just because you  have\r\n\r\nto  sit  up all night. Say what they have to say,  with\r\n\r\nthe  help of whatever ghost writers they can rustle up - and  they have rustled up quite a few. We shall  listen\r\n\r\nto  it patiently and carefully and rebut every material\r\n\r\npoint  made. I do not promise that we will rebut  every\r\n\r\nfrivolous  and  irrelevant point. But they  will  find,\r\n\r\nlike  the Member for Queenstown, that there is somebody\r\n\r\nalways  in this Chamber who has taken down the material\r\n\r\npoint  in  order that it shall not be lost by  default.\r\n\r\nEvery  material point made in the debate that  must  be\r\n\r\nanswered will be answered. I promise them that. I  say,\r\n\r\nlet  us  go on with the debate. They are not afraid  of\r\n\r\nsitting up late. Neither are we. They want to do  their\r\n\r\nduty by the people. They have made up their minds. They\r\n\r\nsaid  they  were never consulted. The Member for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon has the audacity to suggest that he is  going\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsult. Just as we want to start debating, to wind  up\r\n\r\nthe  debate,  he now says that he wants to consult  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Upper Serangoon. What has he been  doing  in\r\n\r\nthe last three weeks with his meet-the-people sessions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Does he seriously suggest that he\r\n\r\nis  going to change his mind? Only the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nseriously suggests that, and I believe him.  I  say  to\r\n\r\nhim,  I am prepared to sit down with him till the early\r\n\r\nhours  of  the  morning - night-bird  he  may  not   be,\r\n\r\nthough - to  explain every conceivable item on this.  Let\r\n\r\nme  say this. The debate is not over after the vote  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber. This is what the former Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah,  the Secretary-General of the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nwith whom I was quaffing beer, said, Sir. Just before I\r\n\r\ncame  in here, he was having a whispering session  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson before he made his speech. I've\r\n\r\ngot   the  Member  for  Tanglin  and  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  as  witnesses to  all  these  proceedings.\r\n\r\nReal,  earnest  consultation, Sir. And the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson told me, just to alarm me -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is this relevant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know what is coming out. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has got into the mood of wandering  and\r\n\r\nwandering  and  suddenly coming to the  point.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthose are very good tactics. I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is this, Sir. To alarm me and\r\n\r\nalarm  the poor Lady from Mountbatten, he said  loudly,\r\n\r\n\"Telegram from Chin Peng.\" And the poor Member from -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I say, in the name of\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  it  is  important  that  there  should   be\r\n\r\nforbearance, tolerance and good humour in the midst  of\r\n\r\nadversity.  That  is  important. Forbearance  and  good\r\n\r\nhumour -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I quite agree about forbearance,\r\n\r\ngood  humour - but at the right time.

I  say to  them,  if  they  are  as\r\n\r\ndemocratic as we are, there are the rules. Let us  play\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  rules.  Sit  through  midnight   to\r\n\r\nsunrise, and down to sunset. We will listen to it  all - trivial, relevant, or irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to say that whatever we say from this\r\n\r\nside  of  the  House  is not just for  Members  on  the\r\n\r\nopposite side to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has made\r\n\r\nthat  point.

In  the  name  of   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  let  us abide by the rules. These  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  are  Queensberry rules. There is  the  referee,\r\n\r\nalbeit without a gun, Sir. But we have the Serjeant  at\r\n\r\nArms with a ceremonial sword. I say, play according  to\r\n\r\nthe  rules  because that is in their best interest.  If\r\n\r\nthey  should go outside the rules, as I say, it is  not\r\n\r\nme that they have to contend with or collide with. I am\r\n\r\nonly  the penultimate authority. Penultimate means next\r\n\r\nto the ultimate. They know the ultimate. So let us play\r\n\r\naccording to the rules.

Two\r\n\r\nSaturdays  we have lost. The Member for Queenstown,  as\r\n\r\nusual,  in an abrupt manner, did not want to speak   to\r\n\r\nme,  Sir, in this Chamber after you had left.  He  only\r\n\r\nspeaks to me when you, are here, Sir. And he said no -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

May\r\n\r\nI  say  that  those  who stay behind, probably  without\r\n\r\ninvolving   the   name   of  parliamentary   democracy,\r\n\r\nunderstand  that it means, be amongst other  things,  a\r\n\r\ncertain  degree-of tolerance, forbearance  and  playing\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  rules.  The  dilemma  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members are in is this: playing according  to\r\n\r\nthe  rules,  they  know they are  going  to  lose,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  Deep down the bottom of  their  hearts,\r\n\r\nthey  know it. By leaving this Chamber in mock protest,\r\n\r\nthey   have   admitted   that  they   cannot   win   by\r\n\r\nconstitutional processes. They wanted us  to  make  the\r\n\r\nfirst  mistake - to  do something unconstitutional;  use\r\n\r\nforce;   beat  up  students  or,  as  Mr  S.  Woodhull\r\n\r\nsuggested  in the presence of the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nand  the  Member for Cairnhill a few days  ago  in  the\r\n\r\nC.P.A.  Room, \"Swipe us!\" The Minister for Culture  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance said, \"No.\"  Sorry,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  Member  for  Mountbatten   does   not\r\n\r\nunderstand the meaning of \"Swipe us!\" What in a  rather\r\n\r\nexhilarating  mood,  which I was told  was  induced  by\r\n\r\nseveral glasses of beer without a proper meal -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is getting away from the motion.  Perhaps  he\r\n\r\nwill  excuse the Speaker because he has not had a glass\r\n\r\nof beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point that he made by\r\n\r\nimplication is that playing according to the  rules  he\r\n\r\nis  going  to lose. The whole of the Barisan side,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the  C.P. outfit, the trade union  movements\r\n\r\nunder    their   control,   schoolboys'   associations,\r\n\r\nUniversity  or Socialist Club, Political Science  Club,\r\n\r\nold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboys'  associations - they cannot win  according  to  the\r\n\r\nrules,  because,  in the nature of  things,  people  en\r\n\r\nmasse,  given the opportunity to express their will  by\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot,  will not be so easily  bamboozled  and\r\n\r\nintimidated.  One  of  the  first  things  they  should\r\n\r\nremember -  when I hope my voice will be  heard  outside\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber - is that playing according  to  the  rules\r\n\r\nmeans  playing  according to the  rules  right  to  the\r\n\r\nbitter   end - constitutional,  according   to   Standing\r\n\r\nOrders,  according to established democratic  procedure\r\n\r\nand  practice. But I give this one bouquet,  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  able,  for  a diversity of reasons,  to  get  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  on their side and thereby  slightly\r\n\r\nconfuse  the  situation. If they had gone out  just  by\r\n\r\nthemselves,  people would have said, \"Ah, well.\"  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  saying  this of hon. Members in this House.  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  what the coffee-shop people, to whom the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer Park has from time to time referred,  would\r\n\r\nsay - inexperienced,   impetuous  and   often   wrong - and\r\n\r\n\"walking  out\"  to  them may be  a  little  gesture  of\r\n\r\ndefiance and protest. What is the meaning of that in  a\r\n\r\nsituation such as this? For nearly three weeks we  have\r\n\r\nsat through every tirade, every tedious repetition.  We\r\n\r\nmade no protest. The Speaker did, and when he did,  the\r\n\r\nActing  Leader of the House, the Minister for  Culture,\r\n\r\nwent  into  the Speaker's Chambers and said,  \"Let  the\r\n\r\ndebate continue.\" That was Thursday last week. \"Let the\r\n\r\ndebate continue. Let everybody have his say.\" What  did\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson say? He wanted the whole of  what\r\n\r\ntranspired  in the Speaker's Chambers to be secret  and\r\n\r\nconfidential. Why? Because it is not in his  interests.\r\n\r\nBecause in Chambers, he agreed with the Speaker  (am  I\r\n\r\nright?) that the proceedings should be cut short,  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  getting tedious, too long;  Judges  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation were getting restive; dates for trials  were\r\n\r\nbeing  postponed. What is the trouble about? They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given every opportunity to say what they want  to\r\n\r\nsay, and they will have every opportunity till dawn  or\r\n\r\nnoon tomorrow to say whatever more they wish to say. Do\r\n\r\nthey  seriously believe that anybody in Singapore would\r\n\r\nlisten  to  their  argument that, given  more  time  to\r\n\r\ncollect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  views  of the people, according to the Member  for\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon, they might change their  minds.  They\r\n\r\nhad committed themselves beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple proposition before us is: Is what we are\r\n\r\ndoing, first, unconstitutional? The answer is no. It is\r\n\r\nin accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  Standing  Orders, in accordance with parliamentary\r\n\r\npractice  and tradition. We have tomorrow to begin  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Budget. Without the Budget  we  cannot\r\n\r\nspend   next   year's   expenses;  annually   recurrent\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure cannot be spent. That  is  part\r\n\r\nof   the   democratic   practice   and   constitutional\r\n\r\nrequirement.  We  have given them the full  lease,  the\r\n\r\nfull  run.  We are prepared to give them from  10  p.m.\r\n\r\ntonight till 2.30 tomorrow to talk their heads off.  We\r\n\r\nare  prepared to listen to them. We will make notes and\r\n\r\nanswer them. If they had been men of substance, if they\r\n\r\nhad really not only wanted to play for time but had the\r\n\r\nability  to  play for time according to  the  rules,  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  suggested to them that the way  to  do  it\r\n\r\nwould have been to get their performer - the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - here  to talk for 7\ufffd hours  on  his  own,\r\n\r\nwithout  a script, to be relevant, consistent,  to  the\r\n\r\npoint, and play for time, right till 2.30 p.m., when we\r\n\r\nmust  discuss the Budget. There is nothing  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthem  from  doing that. We offered them from 7.30  p.m.\r\n\r\ntonight to 2.30 p.m. tomorrow - 19 hours - and they could\r\n\r\nnot  fill it up. That is all. They wanted more time for\r\n\r\nmore  clever  pieces to be written  by  people  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  Room,  in the Headquarters  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  in  little cubicles elsewhere  in  town.  We\r\n\r\nwanted their performers here to fill up those 19 hours.\r\n\r\nWe  wanted to listen to them, what they are capable  of\r\n\r\non  their  own. And what are they capable of  on  their\r\n\r\nown?  Just a walk-out. Fair enough. They abjured  their\r\n\r\nrights   as  legislators  to  play  according  to   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic rules of this Assembly to argue it out. They\r\n\r\nlost  the  argument. Like piqued children, they  picked\r\n\r\nthemselves  up. In the case of the Member for  Anson - he\r\n\r\nmust always be special - he picked up a very big book and\r\n\r\nwalked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Talk till the cows come  home.  Be\r\n\r\nreasonable till the cows come home, till the cocks crow\r\n\r\nin  the morning. Unfortunately for the Communists - as  I\r\n\r\nwas  explaining over a glass of beer to the  Secretary-General  of  the Barisan Sosialis - they have picked  out\r\n\r\nthe  weakest  elements in the P.A.P. and thereby  saved\r\n\r\nourselves a lot of trouble. Now it is their problem  to\r\n\r\ndefend  these weak elements. I said to him, \"God  bless\r\n\r\nyou,\"  in Chinese and he looked at me fiercely  in  the\r\n\r\neye  and said. \"We are not superstitious.\" Well, I wish\r\n\r\nhim  well.  But I say this to him. We know  he  has  13\r\n\r\nchaps   to   talk  through.  Typewriters   were   going\r\n\r\nfuriously. I got the dear Lady from Mountbatten to bear\r\n\r\nwitness.  She  and I heard it. The Member  for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nalso  heard  it.  I  drew  his  attention  to  it.  The\r\n\r\ntypewriters were going furiously, Sir. Do they  believe\r\n\r\nthat   by  walking  out,  parliamentary  democracy   is\r\n\r\ndestroyed?  The Member for Stamford has applied  for  a\r\n\r\nmass  meeting at Colombo Court. I think it is within  a\r\n\r\ntwo-mile  radius  of this Assembly. Therefore,  if  she\r\n\r\nholds  it, it might be deemed to be an intimidation  of\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber.  But  as far as we  the  Government  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, we agree. Sunday mass meeting, by all means.\r\n\r\nTypewriters  go. \"Sell-out\" to Nanyang Siang  Pau  and\r\n\r\nSin  Chew Jit Poh - I say to them, publish by all  means.\r\n\r\nBut  I say, \"Look, at your own peril.\" These are things\r\n\r\nwhich are noted down in Kuala Lumpur because publishing\r\n\r\nlicences  are  concurrent things.  Sir,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment is accustomed to sophisticated city life and\r\n\r\nwe allow these things. But the good country folk in the\r\n\r\nFederation  do  not like this kind of  talk  and  funny\r\n\r\narticles. And I say these papers carry their own risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long and short of it is this. By being patient and\r\n\r\nforbearing  and  by talking peace, we have  shown  that\r\n\r\nthey have given up.

If  they  were\r\n\r\nmade of the quality of the men who led the North Korean\r\n\r\ndelegation  to Panmunjon, I say we would be  here  till\r\n\r\nthe  cows come home on New Year's Night, 1962. They are\r\n\r\nunequal  to  their  jobs. Let North Korea  know  it.  I\r\n\r\nadmired them for the way they took on the Americans and\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations. They talked them round the  clock,\r\n\r\nbackwards and forwards, in and out, and they came  back\r\n\r\nfresh, calm, collected and polite. I congratulated  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis on  the  good\r\n\r\nhumour  with which he drank beer, laughed and  bantered\r\n\r\nas  he  talked of old times. We talked a lot about  old\r\n\r\ntimes  until the Member for Thomson rushed in and said,\r\n\r\n\"Telegram  from Chin Peng.\" It proved one  thing.  They\r\n\r\nare  not  capable of playing according to the rules.  I\r\n\r\nsay  to them. \"Well, you play outside the rules at your\r\n\r\nown peril.\" We are only interested in playing according\r\n\r\nto the rules, laws and regulations made by this Chamber\r\n\r\nto see that the Queensberry Rules are observed. If they\r\n\r\nplay outside them, they do so at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not believe anybody\r\n\r\nwants to drag out a Panmunjon.

We\r\n\r\nconsider that the motion is very, very important as  it\r\n\r\naffects  the welfare and livelihood of each  and  every\r\n\r\none of us in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate on the amendment proposed by the leader of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis unfortunately took 12  days.  It\r\n\r\nneed not have taken such a long time had the Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  and the  P.A.P. not  found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to indulge in party politics on a matter that\r\n\r\nis  of  vital importance to the country. I must  repeat\r\n\r\nhere  what  I  said  the  other  day - and  it  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned  again - that what has been agreed between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments is not merger. In fact, if I point out\r\n\r\nfrom the wording of the motions before the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse, hon.

Paper 33 of 1961 are not agreements for\r\n\r\nmerger. In the first motion in the name of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour, the word \"merger\" is mentioned. If I may be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  read from the fourth last  line  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... declares that the first objective of all true\r\n\r\npatriots  of Malaya is to achieve the reunification  of\r\n\r\nthese two territories in a merger of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Whereas in the wording of the third motion in the  name\r\n\r\nof the Prime Minister, the words used are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...agreed to between the Governments of the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation of Malaya  as  a  working\r\n\r\nbasis for a reunification of the two territories.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  word  \"merger\"  is left out in the  third  motion.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is clear that the agreements reached  and\r\n\r\nset  out in Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961 are not for a merger.\r\n\r\nThey  are indeed a step towards merger, and because  it\r\n\r\nis  a  step  towards  merger  we  welcome  it.  But  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Member for Farrer Park, wants  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  very  clear - that  is why he  will  be  moving  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  third motion - that  the  agreements\r\n\r\nreached  and set out in Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961 are  just\r\n\r\n\"the   immediate  practical  step  towards  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger\".  That is the wording and I am not speaking  on\r\n\r\nthe amendment just yet, Sir. That is clear, Sir,I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government will accept the amendment of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park when it is moved at the proper time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Minister?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> In reply, Sir.

The details, terms and conditions  of  such  a\r\n\r\nmerger  can  be  the  subject of  debate  and  even  of\r\n\r\nconsiderable disagreement. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  principle nobody has publicly dared to say that  he\r\n\r\nopposes  merger.

Now we are back  to  the\r\n\r\noriginal  motion.  Let him and his  Communist  backroom\r\n\r\nboys  carefully calculate before they take the vote  on\r\n\r\nthe   division.  Unfortunately,  they  have  left   the\r\n\r\nChamber. This motion seeks agreement in broad principle\r\n\r\nto  merger  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  If  they want to ask for terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nabout  automatic conversion from Singapore  citizenship\r\n\r\nand so on, let them argue on the motion standing in the\r\n\r\nname  of the Prime Minister asking the House to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  heads of agreement set out in the White Paper Cmd.\r\n\r\n33  of 1961. But on this, let there be no equivocation.\r\n\r\nEither they are for or against merger in principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown has always\r\n\r\nbeen  the  rugger forward, always full of  the  \"charge\r\n\r\nforward\" spirit. But I am afraid he is not here in this\r\n\r\nChamber  to  listen to this. In his innocence,  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen carried away by the enthusiastic words and phrases\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists of the prospect of easy victory  in\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with  them.  When  he  started  on  this\r\n\r\nhazardous  gamble, he was unaware of  the  great  peril\r\n\r\nthat  lies  in  his  path. He and his  colleagues  have\r\n\r\nstruck  out for themselves. He has formed a  Party  the\r\n\r\nconstitution of which is such as to make him completely\r\n\r\na  prisoner  of  the  Communists.  They  control  their\r\n\r\nCommunist cadres in the branches who, by their activist\r\n\r\nmethods, control the members of the branches. From  the\r\n\r\nbranches  they  control  him in the  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee by having a majority of the pro-Communists in\r\n\r\nthe Executive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown lacks the\r\n\r\npolitical experience which the Member for Hong Lim has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever his shortcomings, the Member for Hong  Lim  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  dope  to be taken for a ride by the Communists.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  formed his Party - the United People's Party - he\r\n\r\nensured  that the Communists would not capture him  and\r\n\r\nhis Party. He has used his invaluable experience in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  improve  on  the safeguards  in  his  Party\r\n\r\nConstitution  by  copying and improving  on  the  cadre\r\n\r\ncontrol system of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In the case of the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim,  Sir,  he has never denied  that  there  are\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  Singapore  and  that  some   tried   to\r\n\r\npenetrate into his Party. Being an experienced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunited  front worker in the P.A.P., he remained  silent\r\n\r\nall  through  this  debate. When my  colleagues  and  I\r\n\r\nexplained  how  the  Communists  are  manipulating  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and  Partai  Ra'ayat,  and  planting\r\n\r\ncadres  in  the Workers' Party and trying to  penetrate\r\n\r\ninto the U.P.P., the Barisan Sosialis said there are no\r\n\r\nCommunists, the Partai Ra'ayat denied it all,  and  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Workers' Party, the Member for  Anson,\r\n\r\nwanted  to know who they are. But the Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  People's Party, the Member for Hong Lim, wisely\r\n\r\nremained  silent.  He  was a  member  of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council. He knows what this is all about.  He\r\n\r\nwas  a  member of the Cabinet then. When the paper  was\r\n\r\npresented by the Deputy Prime Minister - it was tabled in this House sometime  this year - the Member for Hong Lim  was  fully aware  of  what was going on in Singapore.  He  is  not going  to  deny that there are no Communists. In  fact, only last week, Mr Speaker, be told me and some of  my colleagues  in  the  Government  to  expose   all   the Communists   and  their  manoeuvres  in   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  He  drew a line between the  Communists  and\r\n\r\nhimself.  Very wisely, unlike the Member for Anson,  he\r\n\r\nhas steered clear of the Communist united front of .the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. He knows well that the red  star  of\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan   Sosialis  is  a  dire  peril.   However\r\n\r\npersuasive  Mr Lim Ching Siong and his  other  friends\r\n\r\nmay  be, I am prepared to bet that the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLin  is too experienced to get his people involved when\r\n\r\nasked  to  go  for a ride in a car which  he  knows  is\r\n\r\nheading for the cliff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Nee Soon\r\n\r\nhas  already insured himself against the day  when  the\r\n\r\nTunku will have to do something about the Communists in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  has referred to the  Tunku  in  glowing\r\n\r\nterms  as  a  statesman, doubtless in the fervent  hope\r\n\r\nthat,  by so doing, he is paying a premium for  getting\r\n\r\nhis name scratched out from the little black book which\r\n\r\nthey  keep  in  Kuala  Lumpur.  Of  all  the  colourful\r\n\r\nadmissions  of the Barisan Sosialis, I think  the  most\r\n\r\nvivid  was  that of my old colleague, Mr S.  Woodhull,\r\n\r\nwhen in a moment of frankness in a conversation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  C.P.A.  Room  last  week  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, who asked him why he  looked  so\r\n\r\ngloomy, he asked, \"What is there to be cheerful about?\"\r\n\r\nHe  likened  their  position to that  of  the  Zenkuren\r\n\r\nBuddhist  who was holding on to the edge of a cliff  by\r\n\r\nthe skin of his teeth, and who was asked what he had to\r\n\r\nsay  for  himself.  If he chose to  say  something  and\r\n\r\nopened his mouth, utter disaster would befall him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has on several occasions\r\n\r\nin  the past referred to the forces at work in the open\r\n\r\npolitical  arena in Malaya - the nationalist  Right,  the\r\n\r\nopportunist   Right,  the  democratic  Left   and   the\r\n\r\nCommunist Left. Each one force has its own interests to\r\n\r\nadvance.  Each one force has its own ideas  of  how  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the life of the people of Malaya. But although\r\n\r\nnot  in  the open arena, the British and the  Communist\r\n\r\nunderground  play  a considerable role  in  influencing\r\n\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the curious things which have taken place in\r\n\r\nthe  last few months is the apparent parley between the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Left  and the British, leading  to  cocktail\r\n\r\nparties  and  tea  parties  for  the  so-called   great\r\n\r\nleaders - Lim   Ching  Siong,  Fong  Swee   Suan,   James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary,  S.  Woodhull - by the Most  Honourable  the\r\n\r\nEarl  of Selkirk, U.K. Commissioner for Singapore.  One\r\n\r\nof  the points of understanding they have reached, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  that the British bases, which are vital for British\r\n\r\ncommitments to S.E.A.T.O., should be left alone.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  how  the  British were able  to  seduce  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  into agreeing to this line, but  agreed  to\r\n\r\nthis  they certainly have. Only recently, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\n(I  hope  I  am  not  repeating, but  this  is  factual information), Mr Woodhull, at a general meeting of the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base  Labour  Union,  steadfastly  defended  the\r\n\r\nretention of these bases - this was reported in the daily\r\n\r\nPress - as  necessary  in the interests  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Quite  rightly he  pointed  out  that  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  bases contributed 20 per cent of the earnings\r\n\r\nto the economy of Singapore. Can it be that the British\r\n\r\nwere   aware   that   the  Federation   and   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments  were getting together on merger  and  that\r\n\r\nthe time would come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsoon  when  they  (the British), faced  with  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  merger and  the  abandonment  of\r\n\r\nthese  bases,  were prepared  to  play  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunisis  and get them to believe that  perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  could  take power provided the  eases  were\r\n\r\nleft untouched?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in London Mr Macmillan could have said to\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku, as the Prime Minister has just  said,\r\n\r\nthat  since  the  Communists  in  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nagreed that the bases should be left intact,  why\r\n\r\nshould the nationalist Right, like the Tunku,  or\r\n\r\nthe  nationalist Left, like the PAP.  Government,\r\n\r\nbe  more  anticolonialistic than the  Communists?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  this whole sorry tale of the  Garden  of\r\n\r\nEden  Hall, besides drawing the Cornniunists into\r\n\r\nthe  open  where they could be devoured by  lions\r\n\r\nand tigers, is also a gambit to get a counter  to\r\n\r\nplay  against the Federation Government  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government on the question of the bases\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, right up to now,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  Tunku  has  on  several  occasions\r\n\r\npressed the point of not having S.E.A.T.O. bases\r\n\r\nin   the   territory  of  the   new   independent\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaysia,  the  Communists   have\r\n\r\nstrangely  been silent and tacitly acquiesced  in\r\n\r\nthe continuance of the\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O. bases.  So  by  a  strange  twist  of\r\n\r\nBritish diplomacy and the right-about turn of the\r\n\r\nyoung   and  inexperienced  open-front  Communist\r\n\r\nLeft,  the Communists are now in a false position\r\n\r\nwhich is rapidly becoming untenable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That, whereas it has always been\r\n\r\nthe  avowed  objective  of  all  nationalists  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  to achieve the reunification of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation of Malaya and to remove  the\r\n\r\nartificial  division created by  the  British  by\r\n\r\ntheir  policy  of \"divide and rule\",  this  House\r\n\r\naffirms and declares that the first objective  of\r\n\r\nall  true  patriots of Malaya is to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  these  two  territories  in  a\r\n\r\nmerger  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 33; No, Nil; Absent, 18.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly agreed to.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     Ayes.
