Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, yesterday I quoted from the testimony\r\n\r\nof  three  gentlemen  closely  connected  with  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. in  answer to the Barisan's challenge  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  the  Government  allegation  that   the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. is Communist controlled is false or  true.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the evidence from three S.A.T.U. leaders\r\n\r\nwho  are  far  more  knowledgeable  about  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nunions than any of these eight gentlemen here.  So,\r\n\r\nI  hope,  Sir,  after this they will  at  least  be\r\n\r\nclever enough not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  provoked by our allegation  that  they  are\r\n\r\nCommunists. The best thing is to keep quiet,  which\r\n\r\nthe  former gentlemen did, and not try to challenge\r\n\r\nus  to try to prove they are Communists. Again  our\r\n\r\nallegation  that  S.A.T.U. unions  are   Communist\r\n\r\ncontrolled is not a bogey. It is a fact. Mr  James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary,  Mr Woodhull and Mr  Lim  Shee  Ping\r\n\r\nsaid so. If that is so and if there is evidence  to\r\n\r\nprove    that   S.A.T.U. unions   are   Communist\r\n\r\ncontrolled, then it is quite clear that in  banning\r\n\r\nthe  S.A.T.U. unions, we are not banning  ordinary\r\n\r\ntrade  unions,  but  we are banning  the  Communist\r\n\r\ncontrolled outfit out to damage our economy and our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Probably, Sir, they will keep on  denying\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  Communists. And  that  is  a  good\r\n\r\nCommunist. Because, Sir, in the Communist  book  of\r\n\r\nmanual, they are expected and ordered that \"if  you\r\n\r\nare  a good Communist you must deny that you are  a\r\n\r\nCommunist\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a different connotation in a debate in\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly, Vol. 16,  25th  January,\r\n\r\n1962,  col.  707, there was a debate on  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  issue.  I had occasion then, Sir,  to  quote\r\n\r\nfrom Lenin's advice to Communists. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary [for a good Communist] to agree\r\n\r\nto any and every sacrifice and even, if need be, to\r\n\r\nresort to all sorts of strategems, manoeuvres,  and\r\n\r\nillegal methods, to evasions and subterfuges...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Subterfuges\" means lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in order to penetrate the trade unions, to\r\n\r\nremain  in them, and to carry on Communist work  in\r\n\r\nthem at all costs.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when hon. Members keep on denying that\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. trade union Communists are Communist, they\r\n\r\nare  being good Communists. Lenin said so. You must\r\n\r\ndeny that you are a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I hope they will be intelligent\r\n\r\nenough  not  to deny that the S.A.T.U. unions  are\r\n\r\nCommunist controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having shown the S.A.T.U. unions are\r\n\r\nCommunist controlled, then it is quite obvious  why\r\n\r\nwe have to take action against them and closed them\r\n\r\ndown; not because of their trade union\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstruggle.  In  so  far as trade  unions  fight  for\r\n\r\ngenuine economic issues, the Government have always\r\n\r\nsupported  them. But in so far as trade unions  are\r\n\r\nmisused  for  political and  Communist  ends,  then\r\n\r\nthose  leaders  and  those  unions  will  get  into\r\n\r\ntrouble with the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a book called Lenin on Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  and  Revolution. The Communist unions  must\r\n\r\nfollow  the  advice and strategy of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nleaders. They make it quite clear, once a Communist\r\n\r\ngets into a trade union, what he should do with the\r\n\r\ntrade  union.  That  is  what  the  Communists   in\r\n\r\nSingapore are doing. Lenin makes it quite clear and\r\n\r\nI quote from this book, Lenin on Trade Unions, what\r\n\r\na  Communist should do in a trade union; not  fight\r\n\r\nfor the welfare of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. He must use it for armed violence, violent\r\n\r\nuprising. And it says. Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Armed uprising is the highest method of\r\n\r\npolitical struggle for a Communist. For its success\r\n\r\na  broad  development of all sides  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement is necessary.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, if Communists get into trade unions,\r\n\r\nthey  must  use trade unions for an armed  uprising\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the highest form of political  struggle.\r\n\r\nTherefore, is the Government wrong in taking action\r\n\r\nagainst  the Communists in trade unions?  They  are\r\n\r\nopenly  committed by their own strategy,  by  their\r\n\r\nown  theory,  by  their own ideology,  to  misusing\r\n\r\ntrade unions for the purposes of Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This is most important and relevant in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Communists are advised  that  there\r\n\r\nare  times when trade unions should be used to make\r\n\r\nlife  more miserable for the workers. It is  stated\r\n\r\nso quite clearly. Here, Sir, is another quotation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot and will not in every way promote the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of the situation of the workers  under\r\n\r\nexisting conditions. We struggle only for  such  an\r\n\r\nimprovement of the situation of the workers as will\r\n\r\nincrease   their   ability  to   lead   the   class\r\n\r\nstruggle.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Which  means you only fight for the workers if  the\r\n\r\nfight can increase the prospects for Communists  to\r\n\r\nsucceed and for Communism to win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There were times when Lenin declared that the\r\n\r\nworsening  of  the condition of the  workers  under\r\n\r\ncapitalism helps the revolutionary \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmovement and there were also times when  he\r\n\r\nsaid the improvement of the workers' lot hurts  the\r\n\r\nrevolutionary movement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now understand why during the last one\r\n\r\nyear,   the  S.A.T.U. union  leaders  deliberately\r\n\r\nworked  for a situation where nearly 1,800  workers\r\n\r\nwere   out   of  job.  Why  did  they  deliberately\r\n\r\nfrustrate our industrial development plan?  Because\r\n\r\nthey must increase the misery of the workers. These\r\n\r\nare  Lenin's  words. And these gentlemen,  Woodhull\r\n\r\nand Puthucheary, have said so. These are controlled\r\n\r\nby Communists --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

He has time and again  said  he  has\r\n\r\nevidence   to  show  that  S.A.T.U. is   Communist\r\n\r\ninspired.  Why  have the P.A.P. arrested  people?\r\n\r\nThey have arrested hundreds of people and they have\r\n\r\nbanned  all sorts of organisations. But  have  they\r\n\r\nproduced  these people in court to prove that  they\r\n\r\nare Communists? Since you say that our country is a\r\n\r\ncountry  of the rule of law, why do they  not  take\r\n\r\nthem  to  court and try them? Because there  is  no\r\n\r\nevidence. That is the crux of the question. They do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the evidence. Therefore, they  dare  not\r\n\r\ntake  them  to court for an open trial. That  shows\r\n\r\nthey  cannot solve this question. I am not prepared\r\n\r\nto rebut the rubbish talk --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Woodhull, rubbish?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): --- by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this question involves labour. What I want to point out is that the P.A.P., after their five-year term of office, are now in their second term of office. In words they say they are for the interests of the workers. But are they really for the interests of the workers? The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsay  they  want to induce foreign capital  to  come\r\n\r\nhere.  Now what is the basis of attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis is to ask the people to starve; they\r\n\r\ncannot   strike.  And  the  inducement  to  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital would have to be based on the starvation of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  This was spoken by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance;  it  is not rubbish. In 1960 the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance said that the P.A.P. did not agree that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should rely only on foreign  capital  or\r\n\r\nhelp  the foreign capitalists; we do not depend  on\r\n\r\nthem. Is this rubbish? If so, then the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance was talking rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they blame the workers for the absence of\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists,  this  is  not  a  pro-labour\r\n\r\nattitude because they ask the workers not to resist\r\n\r\nthe    exploitation    of   foreign    capitalists.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] You are talking rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the P.A.P. said that we have a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney invested abroad. Why do we not withdraw  this\r\n\r\nmoney  to  build more factories in our country  for\r\n\r\nimproving  the livelihood of our people? They  said\r\n\r\nthis  was because of the past colonial regime.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  they came to power, what happened?  Did  they\r\n\r\nwithdraw our capital from abroad in order to  build\r\n\r\nfactories here? What are the facts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point them out. In 1958-59 our investments\r\n\r\nabroad amounted to $135 million. This was increased\r\n\r\nto  $320  million in 1961, and it  has  since  been\r\n\r\nincreasing.  These figures were given by  them,  as\r\n\r\nthey  had  invested our money abroad. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  they  are  begging for  money,  like  a  son\r\n\r\nbegging  from his father. They are begging  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors to invest in Singapore. At the same time,\r\n\r\nthey  want to suppress the workers, without wanting\r\n\r\nto  improve their living conditions. They  have  to\r\n\r\nmortgage our property to the World Bank for  loans,\r\n\r\npayable   with  interest  which  comes   from   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.  Is  this  the  way  to  safeguard   the\r\n\r\ninterests   of  the  workers  and  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  The people of Singapore  will  one  day\r\n\r\nrealise whether the P.A.P. do really look after the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers. Likewise, under its  pro-labour policy, the P.A.P. made a lot of promises to\r\n\r\nthe  workers. They said that once they  formed  the\r\n\r\ngovernment   they  would  unify  the  trade   union\r\n\r\nmovement. But five years after coming to power, has\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement been unified?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the Trade Union Congress, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   himself  reorganised  the   T.U.C. and\r\n\r\nestablished   a   Secretariat.   But   after    the\r\n\r\nreorganisation,  the P.A.P. did not  recognise  the\r\n\r\nlegal  status  of this Secretariat  of  the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nAfter the Trade Unions Bill was passed, it was  not\r\n\r\nassented to by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

It shows that the  P.A.P. has  no\r\n\r\nreal  intention to look after the interests of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. In the past the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has\r\n\r\nnever withheld his assent to a Bill except upon the\r\n\r\nrequest of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking on another point. The P.A.P. said that\r\n\r\nthey wanted to set up an Arbitration Court to solve\r\n\r\ntrade  disputes. In the past the P.A.P. guaranteed\r\n\r\nthat  only P.A.P. unions had the right to  refer  a\r\n\r\ndispute  to  the Arbitration Court. But  after  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came to power, what happened? An Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt was actually set up, but for what purpose? It\r\n\r\nwas   made  into  an  instrument  to  promote   the\r\n\r\ninterests of P.A.P. unions, because the Court  only\r\n\r\nagreed  to  arbitrate  in  disputes  that  had  the\r\n\r\nconsent of both the management and the workers. But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Minister for Labour had the  right  to\r\n\r\nrefer  any  dispute  to the Arbitration  Court.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  the P.A.P. Minister can  negate  the\r\n\r\nright  of  the workers to strike and to  refer  the\r\n\r\ndispute  to the Arbitration Court. The Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Arbitration Court was appointed by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinister.  All  these facts prove that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncannot look after the interests of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two years the disputes that were\r\n\r\nresolved by the Arbitration Court only led  to  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of P.A.P.-controlled unions. It also  led\r\n\r\nto   the   strengthening  of  the   management   in\r\n\r\nexploiting   the   workers.   [Interruption]   This\r\n\r\nArbitration Court of yours is intended  to  control\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions,  and  you  are  acting  as  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. boss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the P.A.P.'s term of office, they likewise\r\n\r\nbanned four confederations of trade unions. This is\r\n\r\na fact, which goes to show that the P.A.P. are anti-worker.   [Interruption]   You   can   only    talk\r\n\r\n\"Communist\". You cannot talk anything  else.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what type of mouth you have.

Since the mass\r\n\r\narrests  on  2nd February, workers in this  country\r\n\r\ncan  see  clearly that the P.A.P. are more keen  in\r\n\r\npursuing  an  anti-labour reactionary policy.  They\r\n\r\ntalk of not putting on the dirty gloves of the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock  regime and of wanting an open  argument.\r\n\r\nFacts have proved that the P.A.P. dare not have  an\r\n\r\nopen argument. They have put on the dirty gloves of\r\n\r\nthe  Lim  Yew Hock regime. Why should they ban  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions? Why should they arrest trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radio, television, and the Press are under\r\n\r\nthe  control  of the P.A.P. On the 8th  of  October\r\n\r\nthey   also   arrested  trade  union  leaders   and\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.   Civic  organisations   under   false\r\n\r\ndemocracy  have been undermined by the  P.A.P.,  on\r\n\r\nthe  pretext  that these organisations  have  taken\r\n\r\npart  in  Communist  united  front  activities.  If\r\n\r\nunited front activities are illegal, how is it that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. also carry out such activities with the\r\n\r\nimperialists  and  the Federation Government?  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.    Government   banned    these    resisting\r\n\r\norganisations  and  cancelled the  registration  of\r\n\r\nseven trade unions just to satisfy their desire  to\r\n\r\nretaliate when the people booed the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAll  these facts are well known to the people.  But\r\n\r\nthe  leaders and the organisations themselves  were\r\n\r\nnot  banned  for  taking part in  Communist  united\r\n\r\nfront  activities.  At  the time  the  seven  trade\r\n\r\nunions participated in the mass rally sponsored  by\r\n\r\nthe Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the question  of\r\n\r\nthe  blood  debt, was there any riot in Singapore?\r\n\r\nNo,  there  was  not. The police announced  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  the mass rally was orderly,  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. cannot deny that.

These trade unions did not want to be led by the P.A.P. by the nose. They would not support the P.A.P. in their Malaysia intrigue. As a result, the P.A.P. banned them and arrested the leaders. But in banning these trade unions, the P.A.P. never\r\n\r\nconsidered the consequences that the workers  would\r\n\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They completely disregarded the question of the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the workers.

On\r\n\r\nthe   other  hand,  the  Government's  achievements\r\n\r\nconcretely  show that the malicious allegations  by\r\n\r\nthe Barisan have no foundation. The achievements of\r\n\r\nthe  Government since June 1959 will  clearly  bear\r\n\r\nthis  out. This could only have been brought  about\r\n\r\nby our enlightened labour policy and our open stand\r\n\r\non the side of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following facts will show how the workers of\r\n\r\nSingapore have benefited considerably in  the  form\r\n\r\nof   monetary   wages  and  fringe  benefits.   The\r\n\r\nenergetic enforcement of the labour laws brought in\r\n\r\na   sum   of   $450,288.21   from   employers   for\r\n\r\ndistribution to the workers in the form of  arrears\r\n\r\nof  wages  for overtime, holiday pay, rest-day  pay\r\n\r\nand   annual  leave  pay.  The  Labour  Court,   in\r\n\r\naddition,  recovered a total sum of $483,065.89  in\r\n\r\nrespect of legal claims\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  workers  and  a further $50,000  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\ndomestic servants by way of conciliatory action. In\r\n\r\nthe  field of conciliation, out of a total of 4,393\r\n\r\ndisputes,  3,390  were amicably settled,  402  were\r\n\r\nreferred  to  other authorities, and 476  were  not\r\n\r\npursued  further by the complainants.  Out  of  326\r\n\r\nstrikes  and  lockouts, only 7 were outstanding  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of November 1963. The conciliation service\r\n\r\nwas  also  responsible for the  conclusion  of  237\r\n\r\ncollective agreements. The Arbitration Courts  have\r\n\r\nmade   106  awards  and  certified  647  collective\r\n\r\nagreements  involving a total of  103,300  workers.\r\n\r\nThese  agreements and awards have certainly brought\r\n\r\nenhanced terms and conditions of employment to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  They say that we have denied the  workers\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to organise themselves. In May 1959\r\n\r\nbefore  the  P.A.P.  Government  took  office,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unions  in existence  was  226  with  a\r\n\r\nmembership of only 134,650. The number of unions at\r\n\r\nthe end of November 1963 was 111 but the number  of\r\n\r\nmembers was 147,188 as against 134,650 in May  1959\r\n\r\n- an  increase of 13,000. What more convincing proof\r\n\r\ndoes the Barisan require? Their allegations founder\r\n\r\non  these  facts.  They  further  allege  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment attempts to control the unions but  they\r\n\r\ncannot substantiate their statement. What have they\r\n\r\nto say about the unions catering for the workers in\r\n\r\nthe armed services - the Singapore General Printing\r\n\r\nWorkers  Union and a few others?

The next year's Estimates for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture  consist of a lot of unnecessary  items\r\n\r\nbecause  under  the  tyranny  of  the  P.A.P. the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Culture  has  long  ago   become   a\r\n\r\nmonopolised   organisation   for   its   propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery. It has been used to mesmerise the people\r\n\r\nand  inculcate  pro-colonial ideas into  them.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has betrayed the people. They  have\r\n\r\nbeen   suppressed  in  their  pursuit  of   healthy\r\n\r\nliterature and culture. Mr Deputy Speaker, in  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech,  the  Government\r\n\r\nclaim that culture has flourished under their rule.\r\n\r\nThey  are only praising themselves. In the past  4\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears of P.A.P. rule, only three literary magazines\r\n\r\nhave  been published. Those that were not  approved\r\n\r\nfor   publication  numbered  thousands.  Even   the\r\n\r\nUniversity magazines on studies and dramatics  were\r\n\r\nalso  banned.  On  16th October. 1962,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  approved  an  amendment  Bill  to   the\r\n\r\nUndesirable  Publications Ordinance. By  using  the\r\n\r\npower given them in the Bill, the P.A.P. have  been\r\n\r\nmaking  use  of it to prevent the people's  culture\r\n\r\nfrom  developing.  So  in the  end  only  very  few\r\n\r\npublications were allowed and the P.A.P. restricted\r\n\r\nthe  publication of private newspapers. This  is  a\r\n\r\nfact  and  everybody knows it. Not  long  ago,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. also cancelled the registration of more than\r\n\r\nten  publications  in the two Universities  without\r\n\r\nany reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the reign of the P.A.P., a number of\r\n\r\nyellow literature publications\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  banned.

The people\r\n\r\ncan now see through clearly the P.A.P.'s policy  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the Ministry of Culture. For  instance,\r\n\r\ncertain  films  which have a low taste  and  sexual\r\n\r\nappeal have been passed by the Board. There  was  a\r\n\r\nfilm  whose title was \"Love and Desire\". This is  a\r\n\r\nfilthy  film of very low taste. Yet this  film  was\r\n\r\npassed  by  the Board of Film Censors.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this film \"Love and  Desire\"  is  a\r\n\r\nfilthy  film.  Such a dirty film has been  approved\r\n\r\nfor screening by the Ministry of Culture.

Many  of the concerts  put  up  by  the\r\n\r\nschools  and  civic organisations  were  prohibited\r\n\r\nfrom being broadcast over the radio and telecast on\r\n\r\ntelevision.  This goes to show that  they  are  the\r\n\r\nrunning dogs of the British imperialists. They  are\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the British imperialists. The  people\r\n\r\nwill  not  forget  how  the  Government,  by  their\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the broadcasting station, have made  it\r\n\r\ntheir  instrument to further the interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make use of broadcasting as an instrument\r\n\r\nto improve the standard of education of the people.\r\n\r\nThis  is  necessary in order to  inculcate  in  the\r\n\r\npeople  a high sense of morality and improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of  education. Radio and  television  can\r\n\r\nplay  a  great  part  in this respect.  Since  this\r\n\r\ninstrument is now virtually a P.A.P. monopoly,  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  such large sums of  money  for  this\r\n\r\ndepartment is a waste of public funds. It is  evil.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we have moved an amendment to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  sum  provided  for radio and  television.  The\r\n\r\nwhole  set-up gives the people the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe department is only a branch of the Voice of the\r\n\r\nU.S.I.S.  The literature issued by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  is no different from that issued from  the\r\n\r\nAnglo-American imperialists. \"Television Singapura\"\r\n\r\nhas almost become T.V. America. Radio Singapore has\r\n\r\nalmost  become  Radio  America.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  cannot be a suitable Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\nAll  he  can  do  is to shout \"Communist\"  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  whenever he opens his mouth.  Other  than\r\n\r\nthat,  he  cannot talk of anything  else.  He  says\r\n\r\ntoday  that  the  Barisan Sosialis is  a  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  That  is  an  insult  to  this  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly. To describe us as Communists or our Party\r\n\r\nas   a   Communist  Party  is  an  insult  to   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.

Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore  the Member for Tampines got up to speak,  I\r\n\r\nshouted  across the Floor that the first  thing  he\r\n\r\nwas  going  to say was \"Radio P.A.P.\" Sure  enough.\r\n\r\nSir, he said that the people are very depressed  by\r\n\r\nwhat  they hear over Radio Singapore and Television\r\n\r\nSingapura.  The  people  are  not  depressed.   The\r\n\r\nBarisan  are depressed. Every time television  goes\r\n\r\non  the air, the news comes out, the truth is told,\r\n\r\nand  the people understand. The 13 Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  then  vanish.  Sir,  may  I,  in  this\r\n\r\nconnection,   ask  the  gentlemen,  because   their\r\n\r\nadopted  country  is Jakarta, who  gives  a  fairer\r\n\r\nreport?  Is  it Radio Jakarta or Radio  Singapore'?\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have the Monitoring Digest for  Wednesday,\r\n\r\n11th  December, 1963, which reports the  debate  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`10th December, Jakarta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Party, the Barisan Sosialis of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  has tabled a proposal in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAssembly that Singapore and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso-called  Malaysian Government should contact  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government to settle present differences\r\n\r\nfor their common interests..'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair enough, Sir. First, the report was\r\n\r\nonly three paragraphs amounting to no more than 150\r\n\r\nwords.  Radio  Singapore  on  the  same  day   gave\r\n\r\nsomething  like  200  to 250 words.  That  is  fair\r\n\r\nenough.  Secondly, Radio Jakarta in  reporting  the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the Assembly, reported nothing about\r\n\r\nthe  Government  speeches,  but  only  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  speeches.  But even  worse,  Sir,  unlike\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore  whose report is  accurate,  Radio\r\n\r\nJakarta, their adopted country, concluded by saying\r\n\r\n- and  I  hope the gentlemen will take good note  of\r\n\r\nthis,  and  tell Radio Jakarta to  be  a  bit  more\r\n\r\nfactual about their reporting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The leader of the Barisan Sosialis, Dr Lee Siew\r\n\r\nChoh,  said that the difficulties suffered  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore resulted from the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  everybody knows that Dr Lee  Siew  Choh  has\r\n\r\nvanished.  And  here  was Radio  Jakarta  reporting\r\n\r\nthem,  ignoring them, and saying that Dr Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh  is  still their leader in the Assembly.  Sir,\r\n\r\neither they are sending incorrect reports or  Radio\r\n\r\nJakarta  has so great a contempt for them  that  it\r\n\r\nthinks  it  is  not  worth while  mentioning  their\r\n\r\npresent  leader  because the leader  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nhere.  Sir, this is a good example. Whatever  might\r\n\r\nbe  said  of  Radio  Singapore,  it  gives  greater\r\n\r\ncoverage  for  them and it reports  accurately  and\r\n\r\nfaithfully. But the radio of their adopted  country\r\n\r\ngives,  firstly, an incorrect report, a very  brief\r\n\r\nreport  and  insults them. Yet they  support  their\r\n\r\nadopted country. Sir, let them, therefore, not come\r\n\r\naround  here denouncing Radio Singapore.  They  are\r\n\r\nrepeating old speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points they made was this. They said\r\n\r\nthat  under  the  P.A.P.  Government  healthy   and\r\n\r\nrecreative reading has been suppressed. We ask  the\r\n\r\nseven of them, the eight of them - if this gentleman\r\n\r\never comes back to this Assembly - this. Please give\r\n\r\nus  a  list of healthy reading matter. I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure,  Sir,  that  if  it  is  not  Communist,  not\r\n\r\nsubversive, we will order it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore  this Assembly debate is over, I  hope  they\r\n\r\nwill  give us a list of what they consider  healthy\r\n\r\nreading  matter  - the  titles,  the  authors,   the\r\n\r\npublishers, and where they can be obtained.

But I hope it will not be a list that  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  recommended  for  the  work  of   the\r\n\r\nunderground  and Communist organisations,  such  as\r\n\r\npolitical  reports, Stalin's talks,  Li  Shao-Chi's\r\n\r\nTraining   in   Discipline  for  the  Organisation,\r\n\r\neditorials  of  the  Freedom  News  which  we  have\r\n\r\nsuppressed,  further books for  acquiring  a  basic\r\n\r\nknowledge of Marxism and Leninism, \"The history  of\r\n\r\nthe  Russian Communist Party\" - which is now  out  of\r\n\r\ndate,  Sir,  because since then I think they  enjoy\r\n\r\nreading the history of the Chinese Communist  Party\r\n\r\n- the basis of Leninism and \"On Political Parties\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only valid point that they made and\r\n\r\nwhich  I  can  say without insulting  them  was  in\r\n\r\nregard to the number of non-English books. I am not\r\n\r\nreferring  only  to Chinese books.  By  non-English\r\n\r\nbooks,  I refer to Malay, Tamil and Chinese  books.\r\n\r\nThese  gentlemen  are  only interested  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nbooks.  It  is  quite  true that  in  the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary, the number of non-English books is not  as\r\n\r\nnumerous as it should be, but I would like to point\r\n\r\nout  to  them  that since the P.A.P. took  over  in\r\n\r\n1959,  the number of books in Chinese lent  out  in\r\n\r\n1959  was 18,000. The present figure is 113,000  - a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase. Similarly, there  were  only\r\n\r\n1,000  hooks  in  Malay in 1959; there  are  31,000\r\n\r\nbooks in Malay now. In Tamil, there were only 4,000\r\n\r\nbooks; today there are 23,000 books. In 1963  alone\r\n\r\nwe  have purchased over 25,000 books in Chinese for\r\n\r\nthe  National  Library. One of the difficulties  is\r\n\r\nthe  availability of non-English books, because  we\r\n\r\ncan  get books in English from all over the  world,\r\n\r\ncheaply and in adequate numbers. Many of them  come\r\n\r\nto  us  as  gifts, but some of the books  in  other\r\n\r\nlanguages are not as numerous. I know that is  what\r\n\r\nthe  gentlemen  opposite are  hoping  I  will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  what about Mao Tse-tung's works,  Stalin's,\r\n\r\nMarx's,  Lenin's?\" Sir, those which  are  available\r\n\r\n- [Interruption]  If they do not want  those  books,\r\n\r\nthen  I  am  quite prepared for them to give  me  a\r\n\r\nlist.

Will they? No!  What \r\n\r\nthey  have  is  anti-revolutionary.  There  is   no\r\n\r\nrevolution in Singapore. What revolution  we  refer\r\n\r\nto   is  bloody  and  violent.  We  have  no   such\r\n\r\nrevolution in Singapore. There is peaceful,  social\r\n\r\nevolution  here.  We are charged with  broadcasting\r\n\r\nanti-revolutionary  material.   Is   Radio   Peking\r\n\r\nprepared to allow Radio Kuomintang to broadcast  to\r\n\r\nthe people of China? Will they allow that? No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is the duty of the Government to\r\n\r\nexplain to the people what kind of society they are\r\n\r\nin.  They should be kept informed of what is  going\r\n\r\non  in  Singapore. They charge that we do not  give\r\n\r\nthem  coverage over the radio on their speeches.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we will be failing in our duty if we do  not\r\n\r\nbroadcast their speeches, but they contain  nothing\r\n\r\nbut  repetitions. No quality, no substance.

How can we say that  we  could\r\n\r\ninculcate  in  their heads the Communist  ideology?\r\n\r\nAnyone  with common sense will not say such things.\r\n\r\nBut  the  P.A.P. have been all along talking  about\r\n\r\nthe Communists and creating a Communist bogey. They\r\n\r\nare  accustomed  to use the term  \"Communist\"  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they fall into the trap  of  describing\r\n\r\nthese classes as inculcating Communist ideas in the\r\n\r\nyoung children, which is very absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you can see that the textbooks used by these\r\n\r\nclasses  were  printed by some  of  the  publishing\r\n\r\nfirms  in Singapore. I will enumerate some of them.\r\n\r\n[Mr Koo Young held up a Chinese textbook.] This is\r\n\r\na  textbook  on general knowledge entitled,  Go  to\r\n\r\nSchool  in  the  Morning. This book says,  \"in  the\r\n\r\nmorning,  go to school\". And it has been  described\r\n\r\nby  them as Communist ideology! Another book is  an\r\n\r\narithmetic  book, about figures, from one  to  ten;\r\n\r\nand  this  has  also  been  described  by  them  as\r\n\r\nCommunist ideology. There was another book full  of\r\n\r\npictures,  and they also call it a Communist  book.\r\n\r\nIt  is an English textbook entitled My Book of ABC.\r\n\r\nYou  may  investigate, and if you have any evidence\r\n\r\nyou can bring it to Court. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  lesson in this book reads \"A-Apple,  Arrow\".\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  just  look  at   this   book.\r\n\r\n[Indication]  Is it a Communist book? The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Social Affairs can look at it. Perhaps he will\r\n\r\nsay that the apple is an apple imported from China,\r\n\r\nand  that when the children look at it they  become\r\n\r\nCommunist. What a funny reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been thinking why the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. said this is Communist, that is  Communist;\r\n\r\neven  a  book  on A, B, C, can become  a  Communist\r\n\r\nliterature  book. Perhaps our Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  can  supply some material to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture so that when the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nattends the United Nations General Assembly he  can\r\n\r\ntell  the  U.S.  President, Mr  Johnson,  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, children from four to six years old  are\r\n\r\nreceiving  Communist  indoctrination.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nU.S.   President   will  say,  \"Good,   good,   Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam. Your discovery is splendid,  excellent.\r\n\r\nI  will  order  the Pentagon to give you  a  title,\r\n\r\nDoctor  of  Anti-Communist\". Perhaps  this  is  his\r\n\r\nreason.  But we must warn the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nif  this news were to lead to the belief among  the\r\n\r\nAmericans  that  children  in  Singapore  are  also\r\n\r\nCommunists, the people in Singapore have all become\r\n\r\nCommunists,  I  am afraid the U.S.  President  will\r\n\r\nsend  a  plane to bomb Singapore because  he  fears\r\n\r\nthat there are many Communists in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a Communist? This is what they call a\r\n\r\nCommunist.  They are entirely irrational  in  their\r\n\r\nargument.  The Minister for Education, in  debating\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech,  mentioned\r\n\r\nthis.  If  you  do not believe, we  can  produce  a\r\n\r\nletter.  The letter from the Registrar of Societies\r\n\r\ndid   contain  such  statements,  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nclasses were used to propagate Communist ideas. All\r\n\r\nthese statements are false. The real reason is that\r\n\r\nthey are afraid that we are helping the farmers  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  by  opening  these  kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses.  We  are helping to solve  their  problem.\r\n\r\nThese  classes have very large attendances, whereas\r\n\r\nthe  Government classes have been all empty. We are\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the children so as  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nhouseholders to go to work.

The notice  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  Branch are recruiting students  for  the\r\n\r\nadult classes and list the vacancies in the various\r\n\r\nclasses; 40 vacancies for the kindergarten classes,\r\n\r\n40 vacancies for first-year primary. Why the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nBranch can run such classes, and why not Communist?\r\n\r\nBecause  the classes are run on Fascist  education?\r\n\r\nWhy  should the Minister for Labour talk about  the\r\n\r\nChinese,  saying that you allow only the  officials\r\n\r\nto light a big fire, whereas you prevent the common\r\n\r\npeople  from lighting a lamp? I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Culture whether he  admits  this\r\n\r\nfact. If he wants to deny, of course, he can do so.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would advise him not to talk about children\r\n\r\nof  four  and  six being inculcated with  Communist\r\n\r\nideology. It is a ridiculous allegation.

The\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Societies  wrote  to  them  in  this\r\n\r\nconnection.  Mr Speaker, just now the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson has shown to us books which he claims  were\r\n\r\nused  by these kindergarten classes. But what about\r\n\r\nthose  books  in the curriculum? Can  they  exhibit\r\n\r\nother   books  which  are  being  used   in   these\r\n\r\nkindergarten classes, for instance, anti-Government\r\n\r\nsongs, anti-Prime Minister songs, Communist songs?\r\n\r\nNot  a  word about these.

The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  especially those living  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  in  congested  attap  dwellings,  pay  great\r\n\r\nattention  to this question of fires. We  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  will  not think we are  trying  to  pull\r\n\r\ntheir  legs.  But these people are  not  like  them\r\n\r\nliving   in  new  air-conditioned  flats.  If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment are sincere in wishing to solve problems\r\n\r\n- as the Prime Minister has said he is very glad  to\r\n\r\nhear criticisms from the Opposition as well as from\r\n\r\nhis  own  Back-benchers - it is our duty to  put  up\r\n\r\nsuggestions in this House. Here I have some figures\r\n\r\nto  show that this is a question which is receiving\r\n\r\nmuch attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Fire Brigade Department's recent\r\n\r\nReport,   in  1962  there  were  1,776   fires   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The losses incurred amounted  to  about\r\n\r\n$859,000.  One  example is Siglap. In  1963,  there\r\n\r\nhave been 2,882 fires. It means that there has been\r\n\r\nan  increase  in  the number of  fires  this  year.\r\n\r\nLosses amounting to $755,000 have been incurred  in\r\n\r\n1963. Of course, this includes the fires that  took\r\n\r\nplace in Lorong 21 and Lorongs 5 to 9, Geylang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a few points. I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will pay attention to this.  The  first\r\n\r\nquestion  is  whether  these fires  have  a  direct\r\n\r\nbearing on the water rationing. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Social  Affairs  will give  a  reply  to  this\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the causes of the\r\n\r\nfires.  As  far  as  I know from  the  Government's\r\n\r\nreport,  no explanation or reasons have been  given\r\n\r\nfor  the  causes  of  these fires,  but  there  are\r\n\r\nrumours circulating that they have some bearing  on\r\n\r\nthe  landlords'  desire to evict the  occupiers  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lands. There are rumours that certain people\r\n\r\nwere  so  hard up that they burned their houses  to\r\n\r\nachieve their purposes. Some people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that  it was due to Communist activities,  and\r\n\r\nthere are other rumours. There have been such fires\r\n\r\nin Lorong 29 and Lorongs 3 to 11, Geylang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is on the coordination between\r\n\r\nthe  Fire  Brigade Department and  the  rural  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  branches.  I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nassure us that in future more fire stations will be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  the  rural areas which are crowded  with\r\n\r\nattap houses. But there are two difficulties to  be\r\n\r\nfaced.  One  is  the  question  of  equipment   and\r\n\r\nsupplies.   Many  fire  stations   are   short   of\r\n\r\nequipment.  Without the necessary  equipment,  they\r\n\r\nare  of  no use even if there is water. I hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will provide more and better  equipment\r\n\r\nto  the  various fire stations and give them better\r\n\r\ntraining.  The  second point is in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nfunds  available. In the past, the  voluntary  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade corps formed by the rural people themselves\r\n\r\nwere  supported  by  the farmers  living  in  those\r\n\r\nareas.  But the Government did not seem to want  to\r\n\r\ngive a single cent. The people on watch took turns,\r\n\r\nand  some  of  them stayed awake overnight.  While\r\n\r\nthey  were  on duty, they had to pay for their  own\r\n\r\nfood and other expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give a reply to my\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member opposite spoke for five\r\n\r\nminutes.

They make use of all these points to  attack\r\n\r\nthe  Government.

I can reveal all this to you  to\r\n\r\nprove  whether they are really the stooges  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  I  think they are not politicians  but\r\n\r\nstooges  of the Communists. They are not  Communist\r\n\r\nmembers themselves, but they are Communist stooges.\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Shee Ping is my friend. I have known  him\r\n\r\nfrom  my school days. He is also one of the Central\r\n\r\nExecutive members of the Barisan Sosialis. He said,\r\n\r\n\"The   Communist   activities   in   Malaysia   are\r\n\r\nincompatible  with their objectives. Now  Communism\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  is  not a bogey.  The  Barisan  have\r\n\r\nbecome  the stooges of the Communists and yet  they\r\n\r\ndo   not  realise  it.\"  If  they  can  rebut   the\r\n\r\nstatements of their ex-leaders, then I can say that\r\n\r\nthey  are  clever.

Victims of the Lorong  21,  Geylang,\r\n\r\nfire which occurred on the 29th October, 1963, have\r\n\r\nreceived  $40 each. The last payment of the  fourth\r\n\r\ninstalment to the victims of Lorongs 5 and 9  fires\r\n\r\nhave  been  paid today. That is the  position,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the families who have lost their\r\n\r\npossessions as a result of both the fires have been\r\n\r\npaid a rent subsidy of $7 each, but the maximum for\r\n\r\neach  family is $35 per month for a period of three\r\n\r\nmonths  irrespective  of whether  the  family  want\r\n\r\nflats from the Housing Board or other accommodation\r\n\r\nfor which they have to pay rent. The victims of the\r\n\r\nLorong  21  fire were also given a tin of condensed\r\n\r\nmilk  per  person  from stocks of food  which  were\r\n\r\ndonated by the public who were in sympathy with the\r\n\r\nsufferings of these victims. For the victims of the\r\n\r\nfire  at  Lorongs 5 to 9, donations in the form  of\r\n\r\ncondensed milk, rice and noodles were received\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the public and these were distributed to  the\r\n\r\nvictims.  Each person was given a tin of  condensed\r\n\r\nmilk,  three  katties  of rice  and  one  pound  of\r\n\r\nnoodles. Clothing donated by members of the  public\r\n\r\nwas  also distributed to the victims of both  fires\r\n\r\nat  Lorong  21  and at Lorongs 5 to 9.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the amount of $40 given to  each  of\r\n\r\nthose   victims   is   from  the   Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment, $5 from the Lee Foundation and $30 from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Council of Social Services. The fire\r\n\r\nvictims at Lorong 21 involved 82 families and those\r\n\r\nat Lorong 9 involved 179 families or 1,001 persons.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I am glad to state  here\r\n\r\nthat  as  a result of the efforts and work  carried\r\n\r\nout by members of the Social Welfare Department and\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board, these victims of the  fire  at\r\n\r\nLorongs  5  to 9 have been given houses  within  24\r\n\r\nhours.

Mr Deputy Speaker,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalways say that the question of education is a very\r\n\r\nemotional  one  and  can stir up  the  emotions  of\r\n\r\npeople  very  easily. The P.A.P. are always  making\r\n\r\nuse   of  educational  issues  to  stir  up  public\r\n\r\nemotions.  I  shall make an adequate reply  to  his\r\n\r\nallegation  of chauvinism and Communism  later  on.\r\n\r\nNow  I  wish to deal with the figures given by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education in his speech. He has  said\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. has implemented the six-year  free\r\n\r\nprimary  education for a few years.  He  also  says\r\n\r\nthat there are 460,000 students receiving education\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. He also says that these children are\r\n\r\nwell-dressed and well-fed before they go to  school\r\n\r\nand that this standard is very high in Singapore. I\r\n\r\ndo not know how he can bring in this matter of well\r\n\r\n-dressed   and  well-fed  children  into  education,\r\n\r\nunless  education  means eating  and  dressing  and\r\n\r\nnothing  more than that. I dealt with the  question\r\n\r\nof  education on Tuesday. In my speech I said  that\r\n\r\nthe  question of education cannot be explained away\r\n\r\nby figures and slogans. Education should be made to\r\n\r\nnurture  our  future generation.  The  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  education managed by the  P.A.P. will  go\r\n\r\ntowards the fostering of a better generation. If he\r\n\r\nwants to talk about figures and figures alone,  and\r\n\r\nshout  slogans  and slogans alone, then  I  say  to\r\n\r\neverybody in Singapore and to our future generation\r\n\r\nthat   it  is  useless,  and  even  to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsupporters it will be useless. What we want to know\r\n\r\nis  the quality of education.

Please  give  me time to speak  without  any\r\n\r\ninterruption. Nobody can ever deny  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact  that some children, who are unable to go  for\r\n\r\nfurther  education,  fall into  bad  company  after\r\n\r\nleaving  school. In Malay schools, Chinese schools,\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools, there are many children who  have\r\n\r\nleft  school and who are unable to find  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nthey  have no future and no outlet. Is this  not  a\r\n\r\npoint which should be taken up by the Government in\r\n\r\nthe review of the education structure? The Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education in his speech on Tuesday, the 10th of\r\n\r\nthis month, said, in the last four and a half years\r\n\r\nthe  Government has pushed forward a  programme  of\r\n\r\nschool  buildings, thereby providing  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  children of various races to go to school.

We proceed with the debate. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  continued  - \"to  a  certain  degree  the\r\n\r\nCommunists are successful, in that they are able to\r\n\r\ninstigate the children against the Government\".  He\r\n\r\ncontinued,   \"these  political  opportunists   will\r\n\r\nresort  to  all  ways  and means  to  make  use  of\r\n\r\neducational  issues  to cover  up  their  insidious\r\n\r\nactivities  of  a political nature\".  This  is  the\r\n\r\npoint  I have raised just now. On his speech, which\r\n\r\nis   supposed  to  deal  with  education,  he   has\r\n\r\nmentioned    Communist   activities    more    than\r\n\r\neducational matters. I do not know how  far  he  is\r\n\r\ntrue  in  making  this allegation.  Perhaps  he  is\r\n\r\nmaking  an allegation about his own senior officer,\r\n\r\nMr  Lee  Kuan  Yew.  If  there  is  anybody  using\r\n\r\neducational  issues for their insidious objectives,\r\n\r\nhe  is  none other than Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I believe\r\n\r\nwe  are not so absent-minded in this connection. In\r\n\r\n1954,  1955  and  1956, there were  camping-ins  in\r\n\r\nvarious  Chinese schools. Mr Lee Kuan Yew at  that\r\n\r\ntime  was the legal adviser to the Singapore Middle\r\n\r\nSchools' Students' Union. He was fighting very hard\r\n\r\nfor the Chinese school students against the Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock  regime  and  the colonial masters  for  their\r\n\r\naction  against Chinese education,  and  for  their\r\n\r\naction  in  forcing  the children  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  to  become  soldiers for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nnational  registration.  So  if  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  should  now  turn  round  and  say  that\r\n\r\neducational  issues are being used  by  people  for\r\n\r\npolitical purposes, then that person is none  other\r\n\r\nthan Mr Lee Kuan Yew, our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the Member should be at\r\n\r\nleast  courteous enough to refer to  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nand     Parliamentary    Secretaries    by    their\r\n\r\ndesignations.

The true cause is mentioned in  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Minister. He said that the  colonial\r\n\r\nregime    was    not   interested   in   education,\r\n\r\nparticularly Chinese education, in Singapore.  That\r\n\r\nis  why the Chinese themselves had to take it  upon\r\n\r\nthemselves  to build schools to educate  their  own\r\n\r\nchildren. When employment avenues opened up for the\r\n\r\nEnglish  school  students, then the  school-leavers\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Chinese  stream were despondent  because\r\n\r\nthey felt that they were not wanted by society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of order.

But they  are\r\n\r\nunable to convince the people of whatever they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question of Communists in the\r\n\r\nfield  of  education  does not actually  exist.  It \r\n\r\nexists  in  name only. If there is any  unrest  and \r\n\r\ndiscontent, it is because the P.A.P., to a  certain \r\n\r\ndegree,  are perpetuating the educational  policies \r\n\r\nof the colonial masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, the 10th of December, I spoke very\r\n\r\nclearly  on five points. I believe that if  we  put\r\n\r\naside our party affiliations for the time being and\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  matter  from the purely  educational\r\n\r\npoint  of view, then we can examine the educational\r\n\r\npolicies of the P.A.P. and realise that what I have\r\n\r\nsaid is true.

They even go  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\nsmearing  the students. Now, how are they going  to\r\n\r\nexplain  the position of the merchants who  support\r\n\r\nand finance Chinese education?

They talk about chauvinism.  This\r\n\r\nallegation  about chauvinistic feelings can  easily\r\n\r\nstir  up the emotional feelings of other races  and\r\n\r\neven  give rise to misunderstanding. This is a very\r\n\r\ndangerous game to play. We warn the P.A.P. now that\r\n\r\nif,  as  a  result of what they have done and  what\r\n\r\nthey  are doing, there is any racial riot  - as  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has said, a riot  like  the  Maria\r\n\r\nHertogh  riot  - then  they  should  be  held  fully\r\n\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education says that the\r\n\r\ndirectors  of  the Chinese schools are chauvinistic \r\n\r\nin  their outlook. In the same way, they smear  the \r\n\r\nSchool Management Committees as organisations which \r\n\r\nrun  schools  on  a  commercial basis.  Both  these \r\n\r\nallegations  are equally insulting  to  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned.  I am talking of facts. I am not  trying\r\n\r\nto  stir  up  any feelings or sour up relationships\r\n\r\nbetween people. Mr Speaker, we urge the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\ngive  equal  treatment  to  the  four  streams   of\r\n\r\neducation in the real sense of the term. I  believe\r\n\r\nthat   if  the  P.A.P. can  actually  give   equal\r\n\r\ntreatment to the four streams of education, then we\r\n\r\nwill support them to the fullest extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of encouraging the learning of\r\n\r\nthe  national  language and the  assistance  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven to our Malay brothers for higher education, I\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  are in full support of  this  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy.

In\r\n\r\nsome schools, at the beginning there were about  10\r\n\r\nclasses,  but  now  there are  only  two  or  three\r\n\r\nclasses left. Formerly, there were about 30  to  40\r\n\r\nstudents  in each class, but now you can only  find\r\n\r\nabout  8  to  10 students in each class.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened? Why has this happened? Is it because  the\r\n\r\npeople   are   unwilling  to  learn  the   national\r\n\r\nlanguage? Or is it because they joined the  classes\r\n\r\nonly for a short while and then left? It is because\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have not got a comprehensive  plan  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  learning of the national  language.\r\n\r\nMany  people joined these classes with  high  hopes\r\n\r\nbut   because  they  were  unable  to  obtain  good\r\n\r\nresults,   they  were  discouraged  and  left   the\r\n\r\nclasses.  This  is  a very good  example  of  their\r\n\r\nfailure  to  promote  the  study  of  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the aid to be given to our Malay brothers for\r\n\r\nhigher  education,  we  are accused  of  having  no\r\n\r\ninterest  in this matter. We are now bringing  this\r\n\r\nup  to show that we are really interested in it. In\r\n\r\nour Budget, we see under subheads 16 and 17 of Head\r\n\r\n40  that  the aid to be given to Malay students  at\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Polytechnic  and  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational Institute by way of bursaries  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced  in  terms  of money. Bursaries  and  other\r\n\r\nforms of assistance to students at the Universities\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and Malaya have also  been  reduced.\r\n\r\nBursaries  for  the Singapore Polytechnic  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Vocational Institute have  been  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom  $50,000  for  1963 to $20,000  for  1964.  In\r\n\r\nrespect   of   students  at  the  Universities   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaya, the amount has been  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom  $50,000 in 1963 to $40,000 in 1964.  We  draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Government to this point  and\r\n\r\nthese  figures.  We  hope  that  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary   to   the  Minister  for  Education   in\r\n\r\nparticular will pay attention to this. We just want\r\n\r\nto  know why these reductions have been made. Is it\r\n\r\nbecause the Malay students in the universities  and\r\n\r\nthe Polytechnic have, after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfive  years of P.A.P. aid, left the institutes  and\r\n\r\nthe  aid  has therefore got to be reduced? Or  what\r\n\r\nother reasons have they got?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, nobody can ever deny that education is\r\n\r\na  national matter and that it must not be used to \r\n\r\nserve the interests of a Party, nor should it be allowed  \r\n\r\nto  be  made use of to  achieve  political ends.

If   the  People's  \r\n\r\nAction  Party  try  to  control education,  then  the  \r\n\r\nconsequences  will  be  very grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already pointed out certain facts to show\r\n\r\nthat   the   P.A.P. are  trying  to  control   and\r\n\r\nmonopolise  education  for  their  own   ends   and\r\n\r\nobjectives. My facts have now been proved and  they\r\n\r\nwill continue to be proved in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to bring out more facts and\r\n\r\nexamples to supplement what I have said a few  days \r\n\r\nago.  At the 8th Executive Council meeting  of  the \r\n\r\nSingapore Chinese Teachers' Union the P.A.P.'s  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary to to the ex-Minister  for \r\n\r\nEducation,  who is now the Political  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, instigated some  teachers  to\r\n\r\ncapture  the  leadership of  the  Union.  For  what\r\n\r\nreasons?  The  reasons are that  the  7th  and  8th\r\n\r\nExecutive  Council  members exposed  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy   of   the   P.A.P.  Some  teachers,   under\r\n\r\nintimidation, coercion and inducement, carried  out\r\n\r\ninstructions  to  capture  the  leadership  and  so\r\n\r\noverthrow the Executive Council led by Mr Lim Seck\r\n\r\nKian. The ex-Parliamentary Secretary hunted that if\r\n\r\nthey were successful in overthrowing the leadership\r\n\r\nthey  would be promoted. As a result, many  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers became principals of schools. Many  school\r\n\r\nclerks    were   promoted   to   become   teachers.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] If you want me to produce  evidence,\r\n\r\nI might expose your evil deeds and weaknesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Will it do  any\r\n\r\ngood  to  the  P.A.P.? Will it do any good  to  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  education  itself?  The  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  are  worried. They  are  in  a  state  of\r\n\r\nanxiety. Whenever they explain their lessons,  they\r\n\r\nmust be careful lest they say something which might\r\n\r\nlead  to  their dismissal. If they are not able  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the work of educating our pupils  in  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  atmosphere and without fear and  anxiety,\r\n\r\nhow  is  it possible for them to educate our future\r\n\r\ngeneration   in  a  better  way  of  life?   Graver\r\n\r\nsituations  have arisen. In order  to  control  the\r\n\r\neducational  institutions, the P.A.P. have  sacked\r\n\r\nall  those who do not support them in the field  of\r\n\r\neducation.  But  the  P.A.P. dare  not  sack  these\r\n\r\npeople  themselves. On the other hand,  they  force\r\n\r\ninnocent   people,  like  members  of  the   School\r\n\r\nManagement  Committee, to do the work of dismissing\r\n\r\ntheir  political opponents and all those whom  they\r\n\r\ndo  not like. Of course, the P.A.P. can do whatever\r\n\r\nthey  like at the present moment. These people dare\r\n\r\nnot  oppose  them. It is really  too  mean  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  do this. Instead of asking  the  School\r\n\r\nManagement Committee to sack the teachers whom they\r\n\r\ndo  not  like,  why do they not sack  the  teachers\r\n\r\nthemselves?

Not only do they not praise some of the\r\n\r\nliteracy classes run by others, but they also  want\r\n\r\nto   obstruct  other  people  from  running   their\r\n\r\nliteracy classes. We have this to ask the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can they solve our illiteracy problem by\r\n\r\nmonopolising  this campaign for the eradication  of\r\n\r\nilliteracy? After having been in office for so many\r\n\r\nyears,  what results have they achieved in the  way\r\n\r\nof  eradicating  illiteracy?  If  the  campaign  is\r\n\r\nhelped by other people or organisations, I am  sure\r\n\r\nthe  number of illiterate people will become  fewer\r\n\r\nand fewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the new slogan\r\n\r\nwhich  has been brought forward by the P.A.P.  This\r\n\r\nis  to raise the standard of teaching of the second\r\n\r\nand third languages in the schools. I have said  in\r\n\r\nthe past that this slogan is good. But we call upon\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  carry  out  this  programme  in  a\r\n\r\npractical way. They must achieve results.  We  urge\r\n\r\nupon  the P.A.P. to find ways and means of  how  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  standard of teaching of the second  and\r\n\r\nthird languages. The period devoted to the teaching\r\n\r\nof  geography,  history, science,  mathematics  and\r\n\r\nother technical subjects is becoming less and less.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to reduce this period further in\r\n\r\norder  to  increase the period for the teaching  of\r\n\r\nthe second and third languages. The children in the\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools  have  also  fewer   hours   in\r\n\r\nlearning  their mother tongue. They have  only  one\r\n\r\nhour  a  day  to  learn their  mother  tongue.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot further reduce the period for the\r\n\r\nteaching of the mother tongue in order to teach the\r\n\r\nsecond and third languages. How then are the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  raise  the standard of these second  and  third\r\n\r\nlanguages? Are they prepared to curtail  the  hours\r\n\r\nof  teaching,  or do they propose to turn  all  the\r\n\r\ntextbooks   on  history,  geography,  science   and\r\n\r\nmathematics into English textbooks in the Malay and\r\n\r\nTamil  schools?  If it is so, I  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nraising  of  the standard of the second  and  third\r\n\r\nlanguages   will  be  tantamount  to  raising   the\r\n\r\nstandard of English only. This will result  in  the\r\n\r\nlowering  of  the standard of the other  vernacular\r\n\r\nlanguages.  I  hope the Minister will  pay  careful\r\n\r\nattention to this point. If they really have a good\r\n\r\neducational  programme which is not detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe   teaching  of  the  mother  tongue  and  other\r\n\r\nsubjects  like  science and  mathematics,  then  in\r\n\r\nprinciple it is good to raise the standard  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond and third languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I were to join the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthen  I  would  be  forced  to  shout.  \"Communist, \r\n\r\nCommunist!\" all the time.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Opportunist!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They only know how\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  life.

All  but one of the Members of the  Barisan \r\n\r\nSosialis   are   Chinese.  The   Barisan   Sosialis \r\n\r\npreviously   entrusted  the   question   of   Malay\r\n\r\neducation  to  the  Party  Rakyat  who  are   their\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and  comrades-in-arms. Since  they  had\r\n\r\nentrusted  the  Party Rakyat  to  fight  for  Malay\r\n\r\neducation  that  was  why  the  Party  Rakyat   had\r\n\r\ninstigated the Malay children in the Geylang  Craft\r\n\r\nCentre  to  go  on  strike. But  let  me  say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that it is better to keep quiet,  so\r\n\r\nthat people cannot judge whether they are stupid or\r\n\r\nclever,  than  to  speak and show  ignorance  on  a\r\n\r\ncertain subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the students in the Geylang Craft Centre\r\n\r\ngo  on  strike?

Our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjective  is to fight so that all schools  in  the\r\n\r\nfour language streams will get equal treatment. But\r\n\r\nunfortunately there are people who use  educational\r\n\r\nproblems  in a very peculiar way. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nstress  in  this  Assembly that in the  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  there is no one except  the  P.A.P. who\r\n\r\nhave  improved Malay education. Malay schools  have\r\n\r\nbeen  built  for the past hundred years, especially\r\n\r\nin  the  colonial days but there is  not  a  single\r\n\r\nMalay  secondary  school. It  was  only  after  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came to power that a Malay secondary school\r\n\r\nwas  built.  There are now two of them.  With  this\r\n\r\nproof,  is  the allegation made by the Member  just\r\n\r\nnow  true,  that  the Government  have  disregarded\r\n\r\nMalay  education? This is just a move so that  they\r\n\r\ncan win over the Malay votes because their comrades\r\n\r\nin Party Rakyat failed to win even a single seat in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly. The candidate who lost in Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nhas  run  away  to Indonesia and is supporting  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States of Kalimantan Utara. Are  these  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  men who want to fight for the destiny  of\r\n\r\nour  people and defend the fate of our nation?  But\r\n\r\nwhen  we face confrontation, these people run  away\r\n\r\nto  the  enemy? As the Malay proverb goes: \"If  the\r\n\r\nhouse is on fire, all the rats will run away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I on the Government side am\r\n\r\nresponsible for the national language campaign. But \r\n\r\nlet me remind them that it is the responsibility of \r\n\r\nevery citizen to urge members of the public to join \r\n\r\nthe  schools and classes which are sponsored by the \r\n\r\nAdult Education Board. But in most cases there  are\r\n\r\nelements  that obstruct and hinder the people  from\r\n\r\njoining  these  classes, so that now these  classes\r\n\r\nare  dwindling.  Who  are to  blame?  If  they  are\r\n\r\nsincere, come forward. It is in this Assembly  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  provided $3 per hour  to  give  to\r\n\r\nteachers who teach the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single Member from the Opposition\r\n\r\nwanting  to  speak  the national  language  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. The teachers are paid. Now they  want  to\r\n\r\nspeak  about  others.  Let  them  cut  their   coat\r\n\r\naccording to their cloth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to bursaries being cut, it already\r\n\r\nhappened  the last time in this Assembly  when  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. was in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition. The U.M.N.O. said that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas  treating  the  Malays like step-children  with\r\n\r\nregard to education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount allocated is sufficient and adequate,\r\n\r\nbecause the Malay secondary schools have been built\r\n\r\nduring  the time the P.A.P. are in power.  Only  in\r\n\r\n1960  was  it  possible to build a Malay  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  and  there  is no single student  that  has\r\n\r\npassed  out  from that school this year. Therefore,\r\n\r\nif  we  are  to  follow  the development  in  Malay\r\n\r\neducation, let us not speak about matters which  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  know of, lest others should laugh  at  us,\r\n\r\njust  like the Malay folk-lore that says about  the\r\n\r\nstupid man jumping with a pumpkin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Members of the Barisan Sosialis want to\r\n\r\nclean  themselves of the allegation of  communalism\r\n\r\nand  so  forth, it is better for them not to  speak\r\n\r\nabout communalism. You are the ones who set fire to\r\n\r\nthe  thing  and then you accuse others  of  setting\r\n\r\nfire  to  it. The carcass of an elephant cannot  be\r\n\r\nhidden by a coconut husk. It is clear to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that the incidents in the past  prove\r\n\r\nthat   Members   of  the  Barisan   Sosialis   used\r\n\r\ncommunalism.  They used communalism  for  elections\r\n\r\nand  other  issues. Therefore, there  is  no  Malay\r\n\r\nMember who represents the Barisan Sosialis in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  These are facts. We treat all  as  equal\r\n\r\nand  we  safeguard  the rights of  all  communities\r\n\r\nMalays, Indians, Eurasians. Look at us. Because  we\r\n\r\nfight for equal rights and equal treatment for all,\r\n\r\nwe  are  therefore  chosen by the  people.  We  are\r\n\r\nmembers   of   all  communities.   In   the   Malay\r\n\r\nconstituencies  like the Southern Islands,  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai and Kampong Kembangan, which previously  were\r\n\r\nfortified  places of U.M.N.O., we  won  over  them,\r\n\r\nbecause    we   do   not   differentiate    between\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  if  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about  communalism, we should reply  to  that\r\n\r\nallegation and accuse them that they are  the  ones\r\n\r\nwho are communalistic. Let us refer to the speeches\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Opposition Members from the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  during those years that they  have  been\r\n\r\nhere. Let us check what they have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

We always put forward our\r\n\r\nconstructive suggestions and it is the  P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nthe  Back benches who interrupt and accuse us.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  the real persons who do not  want  our\r\n\r\nconstructive suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the speech by the Minister, he has said\r\n\r\nthat  in  Singapore equal treatment  for  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams of education has been achieved and  he  has\r\n\r\ngiven  certain  figures to show that the  so-called\r\n\r\n\"lies\"  about  the  Left-wing  P.A.P.  Government's\r\n\r\ndestruction of Chinese education are unfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that this allegation is wrong, he has\r\n\r\nused  the  figures of students and  schools.  These\r\n\r\nfigures,  of  course, are only those favourable  to\r\n\r\nthem. The Minister dare not give the other side  of\r\n\r\nthe  picture  because it will go to show  that  his\r\n\r\npolicy is not really giving equal treatment to all.\r\n\r\nIf  it is really true that there is equal treatment\r\n\r\nfor  all four streams of education, I will ask  him\r\n\r\nto  produce  figures  of  the  last  few  years  of\r\n\r\nstudents   in   the   four   streams   of   schools\r\n\r\nrespectively, and show in which stream  the  number\r\n\r\nof students has increased faster; show which stream\r\n\r\nof education has been fostered and developed faster\r\n\r\nthan  the others. He dare not give us such figures.\r\n\r\nHe   has   mentioned  Government  Chinese   Primary\r\n\r\nSchools. How is it that he dare not give us figures\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  numbers  of  Government  English\r\n\r\nschools, Malay schools, and other schools to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserve  as a comparison? How is it that he dare  not\r\n\r\ngive us such figures? And he dare not also disclose\r\n\r\nhow  many schools have been closed down under  such\r\n\r\npretexts  as unhygienic conditions in such schools.\r\n\r\nHow  many such schools have been closed during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the past few years? He dare not tell  us\r\n\r\nthe  figures of these schools. As a result  of  his\r\n\r\npolicy, teachers, principals and others were sacked\r\n\r\nand  schools  dissolved on the pretext  that  their\r\n\r\nactivities  were  detrimental  to  the  State   and\r\n\r\nendangered  the  security of  the  State.  This  is\r\n\r\nsuppression  and, not a true education  policy.  I\r\n\r\nhope  if there is any equality in education,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  equality all round and  not  just  one-sided. The figures given should show both sides  of\r\n\r\nthe  story and not just one side. He says  that  in\r\n\r\nGovernment Chinese Primary Schools, more than  half\r\n\r\nof  them  are integrated schools. If these  schools\r\n\r\ncan  really  bring  students of various  races  and\r\n\r\nenable them to live harmoniously together, then  we\r\n\r\nwill welcome them. We will be glad about it. But is\r\n\r\nthis  the  case? It is not. The P.A.P. are  turning\r\n\r\nChinese schools into English schools and integrated\r\n\r\nschools into English schools. They are also  making\r\n\r\nstudents from schools other than English to  become\r\n\r\nEnglish school students. And English has been  used\r\n\r\nas  the main stream of education. Other streams  of\r\n\r\neducation  are not well looked after. Most  of  the\r\n\r\nadministrative staff are English-educated too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the policy of integrated schools, it is\r\n\r\nalways the English schools which are being used  as\r\n\r\nthe    pivot.   There   are   only   English/Malay,\r\n\r\nEnglish/Chinese   and   English/Tamil    integrated\r\n\r\nschools.  In  the integrated schools built  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, we can see that they have resulted from\r\n\r\nthe  dissolution of certain Chinese  schools.  When\r\n\r\nsuch  Chinese  schools  were dissolved,  they  were\r\n\r\nintegrated into English schools. These are their so-called integrated schools. These are the facts. The\r\n\r\nsimple picture is this. I would be taking up a  lot\r\n\r\nof  time  if  I were to mention other examples  and\r\n\r\nenumerate more facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on Malay education, a Member from the\r\n\r\nGovernment side said that the P.A.P. have,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of their office,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt a good number of Malay schools. He said  this\r\n\r\nsituation  had  never existed  under  the  colonial\r\n\r\nregime. He also claimed that they had achieved more\r\n\r\nthan  had  been achieved in the past. The  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that under the P.A.P. rule two Malay  schools\r\n\r\nwere  created. He said \"created\". He said  this  in\r\n\r\norder  to  praise the achievements of his education\r\n\r\npolicy.  I would say that Malay education  was  not\r\n\r\nallowed to develop in the past because it was under\r\n\r\nthe suppression and control of a colonial power. If\r\n\r\nthere are Malay schools today, it is the result  of\r\n\r\nthe  fight by the Malay community itself. From  the\r\n\r\ntalks  given  by  Malay  educationists,  they  have\r\n\r\nclaimed  this  because they  have  all  along  been\r\n\r\ninsisting on having more Malay schools built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A.

The Government benches have  accused\r\n\r\nus  of  rousing up racial feelings.  Who  is  doing\r\n\r\nthis? The P.A.P. have been telling the Chinese that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis wants  to  collaborate  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  which is anti-Chinese,  and  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  is anti-Chinese. Now, this  has  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the horse's own mouth. It came from the  last\r\n\r\nMember  who  spoke. This kind of talk  will  create\r\n\r\ndisquieting   racial  feelings,  disturbances   and\r\n\r\ndisharmony. There are Malay Members in our Party as\r\n\r\nwell.  If  the Government had not resorted  to  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. and other repressive measures,  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  had  many more Malay brothers among our  rank\r\n\r\nand  file.  But  since  so many  of  us  have  been\r\n\r\narrested   and   suppressed  all   along   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the result is that we  are  left  with\r\n\r\nmembers on our side who are mainly Chinese. This is\r\n\r\nthe  result  of Government's repressive action.  We\r\n\r\neven  have Malays in our Central Executive Council.\r\n\r\nThis  is a fact the Government cannot deny. We have\r\n\r\nall  along been concerned with Malay education.  We\r\n\r\nhope   that   Malay  education  will  develop   and\r\n\r\nflourish,  and that it will take its place  in  our\r\n\r\nstream  of education. We regret very much  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  colonialism and imperialism have  curbed\r\n\r\nMalay  education with the result that the  progress\r\n\r\nof Malay education has been retarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the P.A.P.

Ever\r\n\r\nsince the P.A.P. came to power, the number of Tamil-\r\n\r\neducated students has remained at the static figure\r\n\r\nof  between  1,300 and 1,500 students. Why  do  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not take further steps  to  help  Tamil\r\n\r\neducation? There are more Tamil students in English\r\n\r\nschools  than  there are Tamil  students  in  Tamil\r\n\r\nschools. The number is many times more. It  may  be\r\n\r\nabout ten-fold. Why is there such a phenomenon?  It\r\n\r\nis   because  the  P.A.P.  Government  have   never\r\n\r\nseriously  tried to understand the difficulties  of\r\n\r\nTamil  education in the past. They have never tried\r\n\r\nto develop Tamil education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates from Tamil schools find it difficult to\r\n\r\nobtain  employment. Tamil schools find it difficult\r\n\r\nto  get  support  from  the Government,  the  Tamil\r\n\r\ncommunity, and the public as a whole. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel   the  Government  should  not  ignore   Tamil\r\n\r\neducation.  We  feel that the Government  have  not\r\n\r\ntaken  proper measures to look after the  education\r\n\r\nof  the  Tamil community in the last few years.  As\r\n\r\ndisclosed  by  the  Minister  for  Education,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment have set up a Committee of Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nTamil  Education. According to the reports  in  the\r\n\r\nPress,  there  is an inquiry into the Umar  Pulavar\r\n\r\nTamil High School to find out what the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation should do in order to raise the  standard\r\n\r\nof  teaching  in this school and other  matters.  I\r\n\r\nhope that after this investigation, the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nbe able to help Tamil education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also hope that the Party in power will not\r\n\r\nallege that because we have raised this matter,  we\r\n\r\nwant  the  support of the Tamil community.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have the interest of Tamil education  at\r\n\r\nheart, they should have raised the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few days we have been debating\r\n\r\nthe  question of printing official documents in all\r\n\r\nthe four official languages. We find it regrettable\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister for Labour should blame  us  for\r\n\r\nnot  having been educated in English. This is their\r\n\r\nattitude.   This  is  a  question  of   fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciples. It is a question of whether the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare really sincere in their desire to have equality\r\n\r\nof  treatment for all the four languages.  Do  they\r\n\r\nrecognise this principle or not? They put the blame\r\n\r\non  us  by  saying  that we did not  try  to  learn\r\n\r\nEnglish  in the past. It is a question of  adopting\r\n\r\nthe  principle of having documents printed  in  all\r\n\r\nthe  four languages. Nothing more than that.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  Government  have not been really  implementing\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of giving equal treatment to  all  the\r\n\r\nfour language streams, many parents have sent their\r\n\r\nchildren  to English schools. I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  do  something more to help implement the policy\r\n\r\nof  equality of treatment for all the four  streams\r\n\r\nof  education.  Before the P.A.P.

Why is it not  repealed?\r\n\r\nIf   the   Government   are   really   sincere   in\r\n\r\nimplementing  their new education  policy,  why  do\r\n\r\nthey  not  repeal  laws  made  under  the  colonial\r\n\r\nregime? Furthermore, in the programme of education,\r\n\r\nwe  notice that the curriculum and textbooks  still\r\n\r\nsmack  of  colonialism and colonial ideas.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agree  that  the  existence   of   such\r\n\r\ntextbooks  and curricula is wrong, then  they  must\r\n\r\ntake  steps to remove them and improve upon it.  If\r\n\r\nthey  say  that  the Communists are trying  to  use\r\n\r\nkindergarten   classes   to   indoctrinate   school\r\n\r\nchildren,  then  in  the whole education  structure\r\n\r\nthis system of enslavement should be removed in the\r\n\r\nfirst place. Why do they not direct their attention\r\n\r\nto  this aspect? The point now is whether they want\r\n\r\nto  eradicate colonial colour from our  educational\r\n\r\nstructure or not. There is no question of Communist\r\n\r\nmanipulation of schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. make use of the Communist\r\n\r\nbogey  for  one objective, and that is to  try  and \r\n\r\ncover  up their failures in implementing the policy \r\n\r\nof equal treatment of the four educational streams. \r\n\r\nIn  covering up their mistakes on this aspect, they \r\n\r\nput  the  blame on the Communists saying that  they\r\n\r\ntry  to destroy Chinese education, to instigate the\r\n\r\nstudents into going on strike, and so on.  But  one\r\n\r\nof  the Members opposite said that the decrease  in\r\n\r\nthe student enrolment in Chinese schools is not due\r\n\r\nto the \"strike\" of students. I hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member  who  has  said this  will  not  remain\r\n\r\nsilent.

The P.A.P. have all along\r\n\r\nbeen trying to gain control of the two universities\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Before the P.A.P. can achieve  their\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  Nanyang University, they  have  made\r\n\r\ncertain allegations which are sheer nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in moving his motion of\r\n\r\nthanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, said \r\n\r\nthat  because of financial problems, there are many \r\n\r\ndifficulties  besetting  the  University.  If   the \r\n\r\ndifficulties are not solved within five years, then \r\n\r\nNanyang  University will become the  University  of\r\n\r\nYenan. Now let me refute him on this point. Here is\r\n\r\na  newspaper which reports that Dr Sreenivasan, an\r\n\r\nexpert  in  education,  and  who  is  the  ex-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore said in a\r\n\r\nletter to the Prime Minister that --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, can we have the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the  newspaper and  the  source  of  this\r\n\r\ninformation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

I will just\r\n\r\ngive  you the main points now. As a matter of fact,\r\n\r\nif financial control is in the hands of the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthey   will  abuse  such  control  and  they   will\r\n\r\ninterfere with the autonomy of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says, it is likely that\r\n\r\nNanyang  University will become  Yenan  University. \r\n\r\nBut  that  is  very  ridiculous.  Actually  Nanyang \r\n\r\nUniversity is using textbooks written and published \r\n\r\nin  America. How can it be said that it will become \r\n\r\nYenan  University? In fact, the staff  come  mostly\r\n\r\nfrom  places other than Yenan and Communist  China.\r\n\r\nUnder  these  circumstances, how can you  say  that\r\n\r\nNantah  will ever become Yenan University? This  is\r\n\r\nridiculous. We know that the Government will always\r\n\r\ntry  to make use of preposterous excuses to further\r\n\r\ntheir   cause.  We  have  a  suspicion   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  trying to take  further  steps  to\r\n\r\nsuppress Nanyang University by refusing the permits\r\n\r\nof  some  members  of  the  staff  of  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity to extend their stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go further into the question of autonomy\r\n\r\nin  education.  The  P.A.P. have  all  along  been\r\n\r\nboasting about autonomy in education. But the facts\r\n\r\nhave shown that there is no autonomy in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they want to take steps against any school  or\r\n\r\nany educational organisation, all that they have to\r\n\r\ndo  is to brand these people as Communists, and the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  will then take  police  action\r\n\r\nagainst  them.  This  is the game  they  play  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  autonomy in education. If  they  really\r\n\r\nwant  to  give us autonomy in education, then  when\r\n\r\nthe   Central   Government   arrest   persons    in\r\n\r\neducational  circles, what should  the  P.A.P. do?\r\n\r\nThey  should speak on behalf and in defence of  the\r\n\r\npersons arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have already stated very clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the greatest crisis existing in the field  of\r\n\r\neducation is that the P.A.P. are making use of  the\r\n\r\nState  machinery  and  political  powers  to  bring\r\n\r\npolitics into the schools in Singapore, and to take\r\n\r\naction  against those who do not agree  with  them.\r\n\r\nThey  take  steps to dismiss teachers  who  do  not\r\n\r\nagree with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

That is  the\r\n\r\nend of my speech, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I just wish\r\n\r\nto  answer some of the points that have been raised\r\n\r\nby the various speakers in the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson alleged just now that many\r\n\r\nof  the  students  can  only attend  six  years  of\r\n\r\nprimary education and that thereafter they have  to\r\n\r\nleave  school  with no opportunity  to  proceed  to\r\n\r\nsecondary  education.  Sir,  I  think  this  is   a\r\n\r\nfalsehood which must be corrected. Any student  who\r\n\r\npasses his primary school-leaving examination  will\r\n\r\nbe given a place in a secondary school and even for\r\n\r\nthose  who  fail  in  their primary  school-leaving\r\n\r\nexamination, a place will be found for  them  in  a\r\n\r\nvocational  school  where  they  will  receive  two\r\n\r\nfurther years of education with a vocational bias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations have also been made that many of the\r\n\r\nsecondary school-leavers cannot find jobs, and  for\r\n\r\nthis I will give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  reasons.

Much has been said about the  Government\r\n\r\ninterfering   in   academic  freedom   at   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  Government  are\r\n\r\nall  for  genuine academic freedom and the  genuine\r\n\r\npursuit  of  knowledge and truth. But the  kind  of\r\n\r\nacademic   freedom   the   pro-Communist    Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  students are asking for is the  freedom\r\n\r\nto recruit, preach and train their cadres for anti-\r\n\r\nnational activities and to undermine the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem. Where is the academic freedom when  in  May\r\n\r\n1961   the   pro-Communist  students   in   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   demanded   the   expulsion   of    six\r\n\r\nundergraduates who dared to defy their  activities?\r\n\r\nWhere is the academic freedom when in 1961 the pro-Communist controlled Dramatic Society wrote to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Societies to object to the application\r\n\r\nfor registration of another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrival   body?

As  a  result,  this   student   body\r\n\r\nsubsequently  went  direct  to  the  Registrar   of\r\n\r\nSocieties for advice and registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1962 both inside and outside this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  I quoted a number of articles  appearing\r\n\r\nin  the  University Tribune which  were  reproduced\r\n\r\nwith  superficial changes, articles written by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. On 7th September, 1962, the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  to  ban a booklet entitled A Brief History  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Movement in Malaya, published by  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University History and Geography  Society.\r\n\r\nThis   booklet,  though  purporting   to   give   a\r\n\r\nhistorical  record of the independence movement  in\r\n\r\nMalaya, was in effect justifying the armed struggle\r\n\r\nof  the  Communist  Party of Malaya.  It  not  only\r\n\r\nblatantly  defended  the record  of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  of  Malaya,  but it also openly  lauded  the\r\n\r\nviolence and terrorism of the Communist Party. This\r\n\r\nbooklet.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  was  one   of   the\r\n\r\npublications which the Nanyang University Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  wanted  Government's permission  to  publish\r\n\r\nduring the 1962 University Week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the University Week, the House may be\r\n\r\naware  that there is another one being prepared  by\r\n\r\nthe  Students' Union for March 1964. In fact, today\r\n\r\nis  the  last day of the camping-in in the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  campus by some 300 hard-core  students,\r\n\r\nostensibly  to  prepare for the  coming  University\r\n\r\nWeek  when  their academic work in  the  University\r\n\r\nwill be exhibited to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is interesting to know some of the\r\n\r\nthings  that have been going on during the camp-in.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  camp-in students set up  a  Livelihood\r\n\r\nCommittee which is similar in pattern to  the  ones\r\n\r\norganised by the middle school students in the past\r\n\r\nwhenever   they   defied   the   Government.   This\r\n\r\nLivelihood   Committee  is  to  run,   direct   and\r\n\r\ncoordinate the activities of the 300 undergraduates\r\n\r\nwho  stayed  in  the campus during  the  University\r\n\r\nvacation. The programme of activities published  in\r\n\r\nthe  local Chinese Press has very little to do with\r\n\r\nthe  preparation of University Week. A few examples\r\n\r\nof the activities will prove this. Two stories, The\r\n\r\nStory  of  an  Old  Lady and The  Struggle  by  the\r\n\r\nRiverside which glorified the armed struggle of the\r\n\r\nRed  Army  in China, were tape-recorded and  played\r\n\r\nthrough  loudspeakers at 7 p.m. and  7.30  p.m. to\r\n\r\nstudents  in the campus. A Current Affairs  Session\r\n\r\nwas  conducted in which questions on  the  Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment's definition of \"patriotism\", loyalty in\r\n\r\nthe  current Indonesia confrontation, and  national\r\n\r\nservice registration were discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forum was organised on 6th December, 1963, on\r\n\r\n\"some  problems concerning the current  situation.\"\r\n\r\nPrepared  speeches  were  read,  and  the  aim   of\r\n\r\nnational  service  registration  was  attacked   as\r\n\r\nbringing about hostility among Asians, thus serving\r\n\r\nthe purpose of the imperialists and suppressing the\r\n\r\npatriotic national independence movement  which  is\r\n\r\nunfavourable  to Malaysia, and that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be held responsible for the creation  of  a\r\n\r\nstate of war between Indonesia and Malaysia through\r\n\r\nthe formation of Malaysia by force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that these\r\n\r\nactivities have nothing whatsoever to do  with  the \r\n\r\nacademic work which they are supposed to exhibit to \r\n\r\nthe public during University Week early next March. \r\n\r\nIt is clear that it is not genuine academic freedom \r\n\r\nthat   the   anti-national  pro-Communist   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Students' Union are  asking  for.  What\r\n\r\nthey  are  demanding is the freedom  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nindoctrination  in  the  Communist  ideology,   the\r\n\r\nfreedom to train their cadres for anti-national pro-Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities, the freedom to intimidate and\r\n\r\nvictimise  students who dare show  independence  of\r\n\r\nthought  and  action, and the freedom  to  run  the\r\n\r\nUniversity as they like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it pains me to relate all these\r\n\r\nhappenings in the University which is built  up  by \r\n\r\nthe  support of thousands of ordinary citizens  for \r\n\r\nthe advancement of Chinese language and culture.  I \r\n\r\nam  sure these citizens, like the Government, would \r\n\r\nbe eager to see that Nanyang University is restored\r\n\r\nto  its  real  purpose for which it was established\r\n\r\nand that it should become a genuine institution  of\r\n\r\nhigher  learning and dedicated to  the  pursuit  of\r\n\r\nknowledge and truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the impressive and concrete\r\n\r\nachievements   in   education  under   the   P.A.P. \r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the last four years can  stand  the \r\n\r\ntest of time as much as it can stand any amount  of \r\n\r\ndestructive and senseless attacks from any quarter. \r\n\r\nThe  more fantastic and malicious the charges  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Barisan Sosialis, the more they reveal  of\r\n\r\nthe  achievements, progress, growth, expansion, and\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   education  in   Singapore.   The\r\n\r\ntrouncing  defeat the Barisan Sosialis suffered  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  general election is clear evidence  that\r\n\r\nthe  people's eyes are as clear as snow. No  amount\r\n\r\nof falsehoods and malicious distortion of facts can\r\n\r\nblind  the people from seeing the numerous new  and\r\n\r\nsplendid schools going up everywhere in the last 4\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears,  and many more thousands of school  children\r\n\r\ngoing  to  school every year. Parents in  Singapore\r\n\r\nknow that their children are enjoying ten years  of\r\n\r\neducation,  six years of which are free.  They  can\r\n\r\nchoose whatever medium of instruction they like. If\r\n\r\nthey are poor, their children can get assistance in\r\n\r\nthe form of bursaries and free text-books and there\r\n\r\nare  equal opportunities for education from primary\r\n\r\nlevel  to  university level if their  children  are\r\n\r\nintelligent  and are prepared to study.

There was an under-expenditure   of   this   vote   because   of   the\r\n\r\ninsufficient  number  of  Malay  students  at   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Polytechnic to qualify for such  awards.\r\n\r\nConsequently in an attempt to arrive at a realistic Budget,  the  Ministry  of Education  agreed  to  a reduction of the provision from $50,000 to  $20,000\r\n\r\nfor  1964.  That is the reason. In  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore of the provision for  1963,\r\n\r\nonly  a  sum of $18,084 has been spent. This under-expenditure was recognised, and in order to  arrive\r\n\r\nat  a  realistic Budget, the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nagreed  to  a  reduction of $ 10,000  in  the  1964\r\n\r\nEstimates.  However, the number of Singapore  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  seeking  admission to the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the University of Malaya is  expected\r\n\r\nto  increase. In order to meet the expected  demand\r\n\r\nadequate  provision  has to be  made.  Lastly,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   in  1963  there  were  15  awards.   The\r\n\r\nprovision  of $40,000 is for 40 awards. That  means\r\n\r\nthere is an increase of awards for the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.
