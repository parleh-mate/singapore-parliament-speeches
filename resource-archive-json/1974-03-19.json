(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the description of Singapore as\r\n\r\na  pragmatic society seems to be apt, judging from\r\n\r\nSingapore's  hard-headed and no-nonsense  approach\r\n\r\nto various activities, whether social, economic or\r\n\r\npolitical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the matter of labour, the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  never  allowed  itself   to   be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged from carrying out its conviction.  The\r\n\r\nunpleasant and unpopular employment legislation of\r\n\r\n1968    bears    witness   to   the   Government's\r\n\r\ndetermination and willingness to strive  for  what\r\n\r\nit  considers  to  be  objectively  desirable  for\r\n\r\nSingapore as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Employment Act of 1968, however,\r\n\r\nprovisions were made for the basic legal framework\r\n\r\nof a comprehensive Employment Exchange. Up to that\r\n\r\ntime  the  Exchange,  then  known  as  the  Labour\r\n\r\nExchange,  was operated by the Ministry of  Labour\r\n\r\nas  part  of  its ancillary services  for  clerks,\r\n\r\nlabourers and shop assistants. With the passing of\r\n\r\nthe  Employment  Act, it might have  been  thought\r\n\r\nthen  that a decisive advantage would be taken  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Employment Exchange  to  regularise  the\r\n\r\nsituation  affecting  job seekers.  To  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent  the  subsequent action of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  in  upgrading the Exchange  by  having  it\r\n\r\nheaded  by officers of administrative grade rather\r\n\r\nthan executive grade seemed to justify this hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost six years later, the Employment Exchange\r\n\r\nwhich   the  Ministry  prefers  to  call  it   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Service  seems to  have  been  stunted\r\n\r\nsince birth. True, the Employment Service can  now\r\n\r\nboast  of a handful of registrants averaging  less\r\n\r\nthan  1  per cent of the total, who are university\r\n\r\nor  college  graduates looking for administrative,\r\n\r\nmanagerial  or executive openings.  But  the  fact\r\n\r\nremains  that no employer is under any  obligation\r\n\r\nto  inform  the  Service of  any  vacancy  in  his\r\n\r\nestablishment or to recruit new employees  through\r\n\r\nthe Service. Employers in Singapore mostly recruit\r\n\r\neither directly or through employment agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overshadowing all these agencies and the\r\n\r\nEmployment Service itself is the machinery set  up\r\n\r\nby  MINDEF  to  place  ex-national  servicemen  in\r\n\r\ncivilian    employment.    Granted    that     the\r\n\r\ndetermination of MINDEF to look after the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  ex-national servicemen is commendable,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink any emplacement of persons in suitable  jobs\r\n\r\nshould  fall  within the scope of  the  Employment\r\n\r\nService.  The  very  fact that MINDEF  thought  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  duplicate  the  functions  of   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Service gives rise to two inferences  - either MINDEF is engaged in empire building or the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour is shirking its responsibility.\r\n\r\nIf  all  employment opportunities are notified  to\r\n\r\nand  filled  through the Employment  Service,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  priority  for  ex-national  servicemen  can\r\n\r\nstill  be assured, just as MINDEF can arrange  for\r\n\r\nhousing  priority for reservists in  the  National\r\n\r\nService through the Housing and Development Board,\r\n\r\nwithout  MINDEF having to set up its  own  housing\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pertinent point is that the present\r\n\r\nunderdeveloped  form  of  the  Employment  Service\r\n\r\ncauses the Government to rule by guesswork  in  an\r\n\r\nimportant  area  of labour. We have  comprehensive\r\n\r\ndata  on  the total labour force, the distribution\r\n\r\nof  such  labour force by occupation, industry  or\r\n\r\nsex and even the number of work permit holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we have no reliable statistics on the rate  of\r\n\r\nturnover  of workers in the whole of Singapore  or\r\n\r\nin   an  industry  or  firm.  Not  too  long   ago\r\n\r\nconditions  for  the issue of  work  permits  were\r\n\r\ntightened because of some employers' complaints of\r\n\r\nthe  high turnover of work permit holders.  If  we\r\n\r\nhave  authoritative  and  reliable  statistics  at\r\n\r\nhand, we can know whether the rate of turnover for\r\n\r\nwork  permit  holders in a particular industry  or\r\n\r\nestablishment is matched by the rate  of  turnover\r\n\r\nfor non-permit holders. If the rate of turnover is\r\n\r\njust  as  high  for  work permit  holders  as  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, then obviously  something  is\r\n\r\nwrong in that industry or establishment. The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  workers are non-citizens does not mean  that\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employers should be allowed  to  get\r\n\r\naway with the intolerable working conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, it is a matter of great regret that the\r\n\r\nEmployment Service has not availed itself  of  the\r\n\r\nenlarged  scope  under Part XI of  the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct.  The present Service is like putting together\r\n\r\na jumbo bus body with the engine of a mini-bus and\r\n\r\nexpecting  the ill-assembled vehicle  to  function\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, since there is\r\n\r\na   great  shortage  of  manpower  both   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the private sectors, it is time the\r\n\r\nGovernment relaxed the ruling governing the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group and allow them to work after  office\r\n\r\nhours.   This  could  be  regulated  by   imposing\r\n\r\nconditions,  such  as controlling  the  number  of\r\n\r\nextra  hours  they work, etc. After all,  teachers\r\n\r\nare  permitted to work up to six extra hours after\r\n\r\ntheir  teaching hours, and yet the Government  has\r\n\r\nnot  relaxed the ruling for the lower income group\r\n\r\nof  Government servants. The cost of living  being\r\n\r\nso  high,  a relaxation in this ruling  will  help\r\n\r\nthem to reduce their sufferings; because there  is\r\n\r\nevidence  that  many people are working  on  extra\r\n\r\njobs as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngardeners,  cooks and drivers after  their  office\r\n\r\nhours and are not detected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring to the notice of the Minister\r\n\r\nthe  exploitation  of both our citizens  and  non-citizens   by  many  employers.  There  are   many\r\n\r\nfactories  which employ workers who are below  the\r\n\r\nminimum  legal  employable age.  To  make  matters\r\n\r\nworse, many non-citizens are employed illegally at\r\n\r\nreduced pay and with no benefits whatever. Most of\r\n\r\nthese misdeeds occur during night shift hours when\r\n\r\nour  Labour  Ministry sleeps. It is time  surprise\r\n\r\nchecks  were  made at night so as to minimise  the\r\n\r\nexploitation by some employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past there was a provision in the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act enabling workers to be entitled for\r\n\r\ndomicile leave after certain years of service. But\r\n\r\nthis  provision has been gradually withdrawn. This\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  has  caused many daily-rated  workers,\r\n\r\nwho  have  served many years of dedicated service,\r\n\r\nto  pack up. Their decision was made because  many\r\n\r\nof  them had to visit parents and relatives abroad\r\n\r\nevery four or five years. But now with the imposed\r\n\r\nrestrictions  they  have no other  choice  but  to\r\n\r\nleave for good. Since Singapore is short of labour\r\n\r\nnow  and  until  such time as we have  an  optimum\r\n\r\nlabour  force, a relaxation of the law would  help\r\n\r\nour  labour market to a certain extent.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider the suggestion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year it was announced that non-citizens wishing to marry Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nshould  get the prior approval of the Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor Employment. What were the reasons behind this?\r\n\r\nIs  it  true  that in every case the newly-married\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  will seek employment here?  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister elaborate on the subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more item which I would like to ask is this:\r\n\r\nwhat  precautionary steps has the Labour  Ministry\r\n\r\ntaken against the incidence of silicosis among the\r\n\r\nsand-blasting workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  two amendments* to raise on the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour.

Since this is\r\n\r\na  difficult  year  it may be desirable  to  adopt\r\n\r\nemergency  measures to tide us  over  the  present\r\n\r\ncrisis.   For  example,  overtime   is   now   not\r\n\r\ncompulsory, and to meet target dates if  employers\r\n\r\nneed  the services of some employees for more than\r\n\r\n48 hours per week, it is often difficult to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   overtime  is  performed  because   of   the\r\n\r\nrestriction  imposed by the  existing  law.  As  a\r\n\r\nconsequence,  in order to meet the  deadline  some\r\n\r\nemployers are carrying more staff than they  need.\r\n\r\nThis  has  two adverse effects. Firstly,  it  will\r\n\r\naggravate the labour situation and, secondly,  the\r\n\r\ncost  of production will be pushed up, thus making\r\n\r\nour goods less competitive internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore has to export in order to\r\n\r\nsurvive,   it   may  be  worthwhile  to   consider\r\n\r\nexploring  the  need  for compulsory  overtime  in\r\n\r\ncertain essential areas. While this may help  ease\r\n\r\nour labour shortage as well as reduce costs, this,\r\n\r\nof  course, can only be considered after full  and\r\n\r\nexhaustive discussions with the NTUC.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  members  of our trade unions, who  have  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  our young nation at heart  and  who\r\n\r\nfully appreciate the need for our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendments read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head GA be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead HA 1111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the total sum to be allocated for Head\r\n\r\nGA in respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurvival,  may  be  prepared  to  accept   certain\r\n\r\nrestraints  during  this crucial  year  that  lies\r\n\r\nahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue which I would like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Minister is the applications  of\r\n\r\npermanent residents to marry Singapore citizens. I\r\n\r\nwould  like the Minister to investigate why it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  take  two  months  to  process  the\r\n\r\napplications.  Once a person, who has  been  given\r\n\r\npermanent  residence in Singapore, is prepared  to\r\n\r\nrenounce whatever citizenship he holds, he  should\r\n\r\nbe given permission without undue delay. Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot  suggesting  that this permission  be  granted\r\n\r\nindiscriminately, but a permanent resident who has\r\n\r\nstayed  in  Singapore  for more  than  five  years\r\n\r\nobviously  has  every intention to make  Singapore\r\n\r\nhis  home. And if he has regular employment during\r\n\r\nthe last five years, there should not be any undue\r\n\r\ndelay in processing the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in affairs of the heart, the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not take a hard line,  otherwise\r\n\r\nthe impression will be given that our Ministers do\r\n\r\nnot  know  what  falling in love  means.  All  our\r\n\r\nMinisters  are  successfully  married,  and   they\r\n\r\nshould encourage permanent residents to marry  and\r\n\r\nsettle  down  instead of having permanent  affairs\r\n\r\nwith our Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has all along\r\n\r\nstressed   the  point  that  we  have  reached   a\r\n\r\nsituation of full employment. In recent years,  we\r\n\r\neven have to accept foreign labour into our labour\r\n\r\nforce  in order to keep up our production  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  trades and commercial lines.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nfact.   At   the   moment,   many   factories   or\r\n\r\norganisations engaged in production find that they\r\n\r\nlack  manpower. From my own observation, I  notice\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Labour is also  trying  its\r\n\r\nbest to remedy this shortage of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have discovered another fact, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  there are still many unemployed  people,\r\n\r\nwho  are  mainly  youngsters,  roaming  about  the\r\n\r\nstreets, doing nothing. By mentioning this,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  mean  to blame the Government for not  having\r\n\r\ndone  anything  to help them, or to  provide  them\r\n\r\nwith any employment. My purpose is to find out why\r\n\r\nthere  are  so  many youths still unemployed  when\r\n\r\nthere are so many jobs available to them, and that\r\n\r\nthey  would  rather roam the streets like  loafers\r\n\r\ndoing  nothing, and complaining to everybody  that\r\n\r\nthey  are unemployed. Some of them even seek  help\r\n\r\nfrom  Members of Parliament to get jobs for  them.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  talk about this, I must avail  myself  of\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to thank the senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Labour  for  having\r\n\r\ngiven a lot of help to MPs in this respect. He has\r\n\r\nbeen  trying his best to get jobs for  these  job-seekers,  but,  however, they have  not  responded\r\n\r\nwell  to the job opportunities given by him.  Here\r\n\r\nis  a fact which is normal to state, and I believe\r\n\r\nthe Minister will pay attention to it: because  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  natural resources,  therefore,  our\r\n\r\ncitizens should be our natural resources. If  they\r\n\r\nare  wasting  away their time and eat  away  their\r\n\r\nassets,  I  feel  that they  are  a  loss  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we should also encourage\r\n\r\nsavings.  We  should understand that these  youths\r\n\r\nhave been softened by circumstances. They did  not\r\n\r\nwork hard in school, so they were dropped out, and\r\n\r\nthey feel that they have no chance to be one-up on\r\n\r\nothers and they fight shy of taking up jobs  which\r\n\r\nthey consider lower than what they should take on.\r\n\r\nOn  the  one hand, they do not want to  study  all\r\n\r\nover  again  to educate themselves. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  they are not willing to take up jobs  which\r\n\r\nthey consider are not suitable, not matching their\r\n\r\npositions, or below their dignity to accept.  Thus\r\n\r\nin  the  end  they roam the streets. They  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve in the philosophy that taking on any  kind\r\n\r\nof job is honourable,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovided  one  has asserted one's ability  and  is\r\n\r\nearning  an honest living out of it. Perhaps  this\r\n\r\nis  the  sort of philosophy of these people  which\r\n\r\nshould  be  understood first before tackling  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about delinquents or those who are about to\r\n\r\nbecome delinquents, the Government should try  its\r\n\r\nbest  to take immediate measures to save them from\r\n\r\nbecoming  delinquents or from degrading themselves\r\n\r\nfurther.  Otherwise it will lead  to  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhich will be beyond remedy. I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour has any plans  to  help  such\r\n\r\npeople.  In  the  past, I seldom  heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of anything relating to delinquency.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  had neglected this problem  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  I  would  like to take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\nremind him and to urge him to take immediate steps\r\n\r\nto  solve this problem so that the hard-won assets\r\n\r\nand  fruits that we have got through the hard work\r\n\r\nof our people will not be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, to prevent these people from\r\n\r\nbecoming soft, I feel that the Ministry of  Labour\r\n\r\nshould  adopt harsher measures to get these people\r\n\r\ninto  our  production lines. In  this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that we incorporate this measure  in  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act so that every able-bodied  person,\r\n\r\nparticularly  our youths, would have  to  take  up\r\n\r\nsome  kind of job, otherwise they would  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by the law. If we can do this, then we  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  go  one  step  forward  towards  the\r\n\r\nsolution  of employment problems and be closer  to\r\n\r\nfull  employment. Then every citizen or youth will\r\n\r\nhave a job and he will not have to waste his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the fundamental objective  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  Employment  Service  is   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  employment  process  and  improve  the\r\n\r\nefficient utilisation of the labour force.  It  is\r\n\r\nopen  to  every  citizen. On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nDirection of Employment Department in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Defence was set up with the specific  task  of\r\n\r\nhelping  national servicemen, who  have  completed\r\n\r\ntheir  full-time national service liabilities,  to\r\n\r\nlook for civilian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment.  For  obvious  military  reasons,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence would want to handle this  job\r\n\r\nitself.  However,  in spite of the  difference  in\r\n\r\nobjective, the procedures involved in implementing\r\n\r\nthe  objectives  are  somewhat  similar.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, there has been close working relations\r\n\r\nbetween the two bodies to ensure that no person or\r\n\r\nestablishment is inconvenienced as a result of the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  these two bodies  to  look  after\r\n\r\nemployment   matters.  There  is,  therefore,   no\r\n\r\nnecessity to merge the two to establish a  central\r\n\r\nagency for handling employment matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised the question of\r\n\r\nexploitation  by  employers of workers  below  the\r\n\r\nminimum legal employable age. Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is quite aware that there are  employers\r\n\r\nwho   engage  workers  below  the  minimum   legal\r\n\r\nemployable  age without first obtaining  clearance\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry. Labour Officers from the Labour\r\n\r\nInspectorate, on their routine or surprise  checks\r\n\r\non  factories,  are constantly on the  lookout  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  no under-aged workers  are  employed\r\n\r\nwithout  prior  approval from  the  Ministry  and,\r\n\r\nwhere  permission has been granted, to see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  the conditions imposed are adhered  to.  The\r\n\r\nconditions imposed include disallowing  the  young\r\n\r\nperson  to:  (a)  work  on any  service  involving\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  or  attendance  on  machinery   in\r\n\r\nmotion;   (b)   work  on  any  service   involving\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  or attendance on or  proximity  to\r\n\r\nlive  apparatus  not properly  insulated;  (c)  be\r\n\r\nemployed  as  a workman during the night;  (d)  be\r\n\r\nemployed as a workman on a rest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson may wish to know that last\r\n\r\nyear, 19 employers were convicted for engaging  71\r\n\r\nunder-aged    workers   without    applying    for\r\n\r\ncertificates  of registration, and  were  fined  a\r\n\r\ntotal sum of over $9,000. As for employment of non-citizens without work permits, I think the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  should  be  well aware  that  constant\r\n\r\nchecks by Labour Officers are being carried out in\r\n\r\nfactories and construction sites. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  fully  aware  that  there  are  many\r\n\r\nindustries operating on night shifts and that some\r\n\r\nemployers  are engaging non-citizens without  work\r\n\r\npermits to man these shifts. The Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nmay  be  assured  that the Ministry  does  conduct\r\n\r\nrandom  spot checks at night not only  to  prevent\r\n\r\nillegal  employment of non-citizens  but  also  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  working conditions are  satisfactory\r\n\r\nduring the night. Labour Officers are required  to\r\n\r\ncarry out night inspections by rotation. With  the\r\n\r\nrecent  acquisition  of a Ford  transit  van,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  hopes to step up its night  enforcement.\r\n\r\nFor  the  information of the Member for Anson,  an\r\n\r\naggregate  of  103 employers were prosecuted  last\r\n\r\nyear  for  engaging 229 non-citizens without  work\r\n\r\npermits,  and the total fine imposed  amounted  to\r\n\r\nabout   $46,000.   The  Labour   Inspectorate   is\r\n\r\ntherefore not sleeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised the question as\r\n\r\nto  why  marriage of non-citizens should seek  the\r\n\r\napproval   of  the  Commissioner  for  Employment.\r\n\r\nPresently,   a  large  majority  of  non-citizens,\r\n\r\nwishing   to  contract  marriage  with   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens,  are  work  permit  holders   and   are,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  already in employment when they  apply\r\n\r\nfor  approval to contract marriage. It is presumed\r\n\r\nthat  most of them are likely to continue  working\r\n\r\nafter  marriage in order to increase their  family\r\n\r\nincome so as to enjoy a higher standard of living.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this is not of major consideration.  The\r\n\r\nreasons for the need to seek prior approval of the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Employment for  marriage  to  be\r\n\r\ncontracted  between a citizen and  a  work  permit\r\n\r\nholder  are  contained  in a Government  statement\r\n\r\nissued  on  the  25th June, 1973.  I  presume  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has not read the  Government's\r\n\r\nstatement and, for his benefit and those like him,\r\n\r\nI would like to read extracts of the statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One significant facet of Singapore's economic\r\n\r\ngrowth has been the easy employment situation  for\r\n\r\nyoung  school  leavers and others still  in  their\r\n\r\nteens.  They come into contact with equally  young\r\n\r\nworkers on work permit in Singapore. It is natural\r\n\r\nfor  these  young workers on work permits,  having\r\n\r\nfound their bearings, to make friends and mix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreely in our society. After a time, many of  them\r\n\r\nmay  want to marry, settle down and raise families\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  This evolution  can  result  in  a\r\n\r\nhealthy infusion of vigorous and hardworking types\r\n\r\nto  Singapore's  population,  provided  they  have\r\n\r\nacquired  work  skills  and  are  industrious  and\r\n\r\nthrifty.  These qualities are essential  if  these\r\n\r\nyoung  people  are  to be integrated  successfully\r\n\r\ninto Singapore's society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it takes time for such attributes to be\r\n\r\nproven   in  regular  and  successful  employment.\r\n\r\nUnless  the work permit worker is adjusted to  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  and  faster pace of life  in  a  highly\r\n\r\ndisciplined  and  urbanised society,  and  to  the\r\n\r\nethos  of small planned families, marriage between\r\n\r\na  work permit holder and a Singapore citizen  can\r\n\r\nlead   to   difficulty  for  themselves  and   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour has decided to discourage\r\n\r\nthese   young   workers  on  work   permits   from\r\n\r\ncontracting early marriages until they have  shown\r\n\r\nthat they are able to settle down successfully  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and to support a small family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st July, 1973, it will be necessary for a\r\n\r\nwork permit holder to first obtain the approval of\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner for Employment before contracting\r\n\r\nmarriage  with  a  Singapore citizen.  A  marriage\r\n\r\nbetween   work  permit  holders  where   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship or permanent residence in Singapore is\r\n\r\nnot  acquired  nor desired will not require  prior\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  hope  the Member for Anson will appreciate  now\r\n\r\nthe  reason why prior approval is necessary before\r\n\r\na  marriage  is contracted between a  work  permit\r\n\r\nholder and a Singapore citizen or resident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned about the\r\n\r\ndelay in getting replies from the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nEmployment   in   respect  of   applications   for\r\n\r\nmarriages.  I hope the Member for Bras Basah  will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  because  of  the  importance  of\r\n\r\npersonal  interest  attached to the  applications,\r\n\r\ngreater  care  has to be exercised  in  processing\r\n\r\napplications from work permit holders to  contract\r\n\r\nmarriage   with  either  Singapore   citizens   or\r\n\r\npermanent residents. This is to ensure that  there\r\n\r\nis  no slip-up in approving non-deserving cases or\r\n\r\nrejection of truly deserving ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, processing of some applications\r\n\r\nmay  take  a  longer time than usual  because  the\r\n\r\napplicants themselves have not completed their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforms correctly or had omitted certain significant\r\n\r\nparticulars.  It  is  because  of  this  that  the\r\n\r\nparties  concerned will have to be interviewed  to\r\n\r\nclarify  the  doubts  as well  as  rectifying  the\r\n\r\nerrors  where they occur. In certain cases,  extra\r\n\r\ntime  is  involved as investigations  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  to  verify  documents  submitted  by\r\n\r\napplicants  in  support of their  applications.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to assure the Member for  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry realises the importance attached\r\n\r\nto   the  applications  and  that  these  will  be\r\n\r\nprocessed   as  quickly  as  possible   to   avoid\r\n\r\nunnecessary   delay  and  inconvenience   to   the\r\n\r\napplicants.  If  the Member could supply  me  with\r\n\r\nparticulars  of  the cases where undue  delay  has\r\n\r\nbeen  encountered,  these  would  be  looked  into\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  it  is desirable  to  introduce\r\n\r\ncompulsory overtime to meet the labour shortage in\r\n\r\norder  to reduce the cost of production. Hours  of\r\n\r\nwork  of  employees are regulated by law  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir   health  and  welfare  can  be   adequately\r\n\r\nsafeguarded. The present limit on normal hours  of\r\n\r\nwork  of  eight hours a day or 44 hours a week  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  fair  and  reasonable.  Under   normal\r\n\r\nconditions an employee must be given the choice to\r\n\r\naccept  or  reject a request from the employer  to\r\n\r\nwork  overtime.  However, adequate safeguards  are\r\n\r\nprovided   in  the  law  to  ensure   that   under\r\n\r\nexceptional  circumstances, such  as  work  to  be\r\n\r\nperformed   by   an  employee  in  the   essential\r\n\r\nservices,  or where urgent work is to be  done  to\r\n\r\nmachinery or plant, or where interruption of  work\r\n\r\noccurs  for  which it was impossible  to  foresee,\r\n\r\nemployees must comply with the employer's request.\r\n\r\nMaking  over-time compulsory will not  be  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the employees. This  is  because  in\r\n\r\ncertain  types of industry or operations prolonged\r\n\r\nhours  of  working  would expose  the  workers  to\r\n\r\nhazards  which  may be injurious to their  health.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it would be difficult to ensure  that\r\n\r\nemployers  are justified in asking their employees\r\n\r\nto work over-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of labour shortage cannot be solved\r\n\r\nby  forcing workers to work overtime at  the  whim\r\n\r\nand fancy of the employers, without due regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  health  and  well-being of the  workers.  The\r\n\r\nmaximum  hours of work are specifically laid  down\r\n\r\nin  the Employment Act to protect the workers. All\r\n\r\nover  the  world  the trend is towards  a  shorter\r\n\r\nworking   week.  The  introduction  of  a  44-hour\r\n\r\nworking  week  in  1968  had  already  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  need of industries as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nhealth of the workers. Besides, the Employment Act\r\n\r\nalso  provides for a maximum over-time of 72 hours\r\n\r\na   month   and,   in  exceptional  circumstances,\r\n\r\npermission  may  be sought to exceed  this  limit.\r\n\r\nInstead  of compulsion, employers should think  of\r\n\r\noffering  better incentives and working conditions\r\n\r\nto  induce  the  workers to accept overtime  work.\r\n\r\nHowever,  far  more  important in  a  labour-tight\r\n\r\neconomy   is  for  the  industry  itself   to   be\r\n\r\nmodernised so as to raise productivity by the  use\r\n\r\nof  more  labour-saving devices and machinery  and\r\n\r\nmore  efficient management techniques. The  labour\r\n\r\nintensive low technology industries which have low\r\n\r\nvalue-added   per  worker  should   give   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration   to   switching   over   to    more\r\n\r\nsophisticated    industries    employing    higher\r\n\r\ntechnology which will give a higher GNP return per\r\n\r\nhead.  The present provisions in the law,  whereby\r\n\r\nemployees  may  be  required to  perform  overtime\r\n\r\nunder  conditions  which I have just  listed,  are\r\n\r\nconsidered adequate at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Here\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister to be  fair  to\r\n\r\nsome factories. It does not always mean that these\r\n\r\nfactories like to employ non-Citizens. It is  just\r\n\r\nbecause they cannot find enough workers. In  fact,\r\n\r\nin  Jurong  I have received a number of complaints\r\n\r\nfrom factory operators that their applications for\r\n\r\nwork  permits have not been approved. So  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir production going they have to resort to  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of non-citizens with work  permits.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  the  Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nliberalising   the  granting  of   work   permits,\r\n\r\nparticularly after the Chinese New Year season.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that many foreign workers returned home\r\n\r\nfor the Chinese New Year but have not come back to\r\n\r\nSingapore to continue with their employment. As a\r\n\r\nresult, there has been an acute shortage of labour\r\n\r\nin the Jurong factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Bras Basah has also raised\r\n\r\nthe  question of marriages. I understand that most\r\n\r\nof  the  applications have not been approved.  But\r\n\r\nthe  rejection of the applications does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat the applicants do not get married because the\r\n\r\nforce  of  love  is greater than the  approval  of\r\n\r\ntheir marriages. They get married somehow, legally\r\n\r\nor  otherwise.  That will leave us  with  a  great\r\n\r\nsocial  problem,  and  a social  problem  of  this\r\n\r\nnature is very serious because if we have too many\r\n\r\nillegal  marriages,  then  it  will  be   a   very\r\n\r\nunhealthy development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

I am not stopping them. If they want to,\r\n\r\nthey  can go ahead. The only thing is that if they\r\n\r\ndo, then they will have to suffer penalties in the\r\n\r\nform of a withdrawal of certain privileges to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is well aware that the Government, in\r\n\r\nfact,  has  been  quite liberal in  granting  work\r\n\r\npermits to non-citizens. This liberal policy  will\r\n\r\nbe  continued  as long as there is a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nlabour in Singapore. The Member will be aware that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  is  shifting  its  emphasis   in\r\n\r\neconomic development from labour intensive to high\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  high skilled industries.  In  the\r\n\r\nlight   of   this   new  strategy  of   industrial\r\n\r\npromotion, work permits will be issued more freely\r\n\r\nto   skilled  workers  and  those  with   suitable\r\n\r\nqualifications. Those who are unskilled and  those\r\n\r\nwho are applying for white-collar jobs will not be\r\n\r\nfavourably considered for work permits unless they\r\n\r\nhave  special merit. As I have explained just now,\r\n\r\nit  is  best for the labour intensive low  skilled\r\n\r\nindustries  to think seriously now, if  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  done  so,  to  modernise  themselves  and  to\r\n\r\nintroduce   as   much  labour-saving   device   as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I seek\r\n\r\na  point  of  clarification from the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour?

One of the most  significant\r\n\r\nfeatures  of the housing policy of the  Government\r\n\r\nhas been the assistance to the lower income groups\r\n\r\nto  have  houses of their own by allowing them  to\r\n\r\nutilise their credit in the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\nto pay for the flat or to meet the down payment or\r\n\r\npart payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature of our public housing in helping\r\n\r\nour  citizens  to  own their own  homes  with  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  is  unique, but there remains the  middle\r\n\r\nand  upper-middle  groups  of  employees  who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to own their own homes because of  soaring\r\n\r\nland  prices and building costs which  are  beyond\r\n\r\ntheir means and who are unfortunately not eligible\r\n\r\nfor HDB fiats.

This\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the reasons why there is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\ndemand  for accommodations offered by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance.  It is not because the middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup  do not like to move into these fairly  good\r\n\r\nflats,  but  simply because the  imposition  of  a\r\n\r\nfurther  10  years' service does not  make  it  an\r\n\r\nattractive proposition.

Firstly,\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents, and secondly, the  question\r\n\r\nof  insufficient number of staff  in  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of industrial accidents has\r\n\r\nattracted our attention every year. The reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  too  many  industrial  accidents\r\n\r\ncausing a tragic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffect  on  the workers and their families.  There\r\n\r\nare  people  who  say that with  great  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  it  is  inevitable  that  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents will occur. Although this may be so,  we\r\n\r\ncannot say that because industrial accidents  will\r\n\r\nhappen,  we  should allow them to happen.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  we should try to find out how  best  we\r\n\r\ncan  prevent  or reduce the number  of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Minister has often asked our\r\n\r\nworkers  to raise their productivity to  help  our\r\n\r\nindustrial development. This is indeed  the  right\r\n\r\nthing to do. In order to achieve this, we have  to\r\n\r\nprovide a safer working environment to reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of deaths due to industrial accidents. Last\r\n\r\nyear   alone   160  people  died  from  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents. Although it shows a slight increase  as\r\n\r\ncompared with the figure for the year before, this\r\n\r\nnumber is still very high. Of this figure of  160,\r\n\r\nthe construction industry accounts for the highest\r\n\r\nnumber,  60.  Another industry  accounts  for  46;\r\n\r\ntransport  and related industries, 38;  and  other\r\n\r\nindustries,  16.  We can say that  the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople who died from industrial accidents is  very\r\n\r\nhigh.  The number of our factories has grown  from\r\n\r\nyear to year because of industrial development. So\r\n\r\nthere is a great need to take positive action  and\r\n\r\nall possible measures to reduce the number of such\r\n\r\naccidents. On the other hand, there are many cases\r\n\r\nof  deaths in construction sites, including  cases\r\n\r\nof people falling off from scaffoldings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember last year the Minister ordered a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry into the cause of deaths  at\r\n\r\nconstruction   sites  so  that   it   could   make\r\n\r\nrecommendations on safety standards to be observed\r\n\r\nin construction sites, and ensure that all workers\r\n\r\nfollow such measures. Why is it that we still have\r\n\r\ncases  of industrial accidents? What is the reason\r\n\r\nfor  the continuation of this state of affairs?  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Minister to take early  action  to\r\n\r\nfind out the real cause of these accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to refer to the number of\r\n\r\nstaff  in the Factory Inspectorate. We have raised\r\n\r\nthis  question  many times in this House  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  has agreed  that  there  is  an\r\n\r\ninsufficient number of people in this section. The\r\n\r\nmain  reason,  according  to  him,  is  that   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance has not approved  additional\r\n\r\nprovisions  for  the  Factory  Inspectorate,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they could not increase the  number  of\r\n\r\nFactory Inspectors. If that is so, I would like to\r\n\r\nsympathise with the Minister for Labour.  Although\r\n\r\nhe is a man full of sympathy, we cannot expect him\r\n\r\nto  pay  out  of his own pocket for the additional\r\n\r\nstaff  required  in  the Factory  Inspectorate.  I\r\n\r\nthink the responsibility lies with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance. I notice that the Minister for Finance is\r\n\r\nnot  here.  I would like to urge the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  to consider increasing the provision  for\r\n\r\nthe   Factory  Inspectorate  immediately.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the provision is only $365,000, which  is\r\n\r\nan  increase of $73,000. This is not  a  very  big\r\n\r\nsum. But we can prevent more than a hundred people\r\n\r\nfrom  dying  and the consequent tragic effects  on\r\n\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

Is it possible for the Minister to  look\r\n\r\ninto the matter and give us a definite reply as to\r\n\r\nthe number of inspectors employed, and the type of\r\n\r\nwork they have been doing to uplift the morale  of\r\n\r\nworkers  and ensure better safety precautions?  As\r\n\r\nlate  as  a year ago, there have been a  spate  of\r\n\r\nfactory accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received complaints that some of the\r\n\r\ninspectors are biased in their duties.  They  only\r\n\r\ncheck  certain factories and find fault with them,\r\n\r\nwhereas   numerous   other  factories   committing\r\n\r\nsimilar  offences were being overlooked. And  when\r\n\r\nthe  victim  draws the attention of the inspector,\r\n\r\nthey get rude remarks that it is not his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether there is any discrimination\r\n\r\nshown by the factory inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the area\r\n\r\nof  industrial safety, it is generally agreed that\r\n\r\nprevention  is better than cure. When an  accident\r\n\r\noccurs, there will, in fact, be no cure. The  very\r\n\r\nmere  fact  that monetary compensation is  awarded\r\n\r\nfor  death  or  injury offers no  consolation~  to\r\n\r\nthose  who have suffered. In looking at the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry's Estimates, one gets the impression that\r\n\r\ngreater emphasis is placed on compensation  rather\r\n\r\nthan  prevention. I say this because I notice that\r\n\r\nwhilst it is proposed to increase the staff of the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's   Compensation   Department   from   the\r\n\r\nexisting  strength  of  16  to  22,  i.e, a  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial increase of 6 or some 37 per cent, the\r\n\r\nproposed increase for the Factory Inspectorate  is\r\n\r\nonly from 50 to 55, representing an increase of 5,\r\n\r\nor only 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during past years much tougher rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  had been introduced with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nreducing  the  high rate of accidents.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  to say that, as two hon. Members have  also\r\n\r\njust  mentioned, the enforcement seems to be quite\r\n\r\ninadequate. I am just wondering what the  Ministry\r\n\r\nis proposing to do here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister in his Budget Statement\r\n\r\nto  the  House has called for the cutting down  of\r\n\r\nwastage.  Of  all forms of wastage,  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  - human resource - through accidents  is\r\n\r\none  area  that we can ill-afford to allow  it  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.  I  would  urge  the  Minister  to  give\r\n\r\nserious  consideration  to substantially  increase\r\n\r\nthe  number  of staff for the Factory Inspectorate\r\n\r\nso  as  to  ensure  that  the  relevant  laws  are\r\n\r\nadequately enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to refer to Part VII, section 62, of\r\n\r\nthe  Factories Act.

Section 62 empowers the Minister  to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations for the medical supervision  and\r\n\r\nmedical   examination  of  workers   employed   in\r\n\r\nfactories where cases of illness have occurred or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrisk  of  injury to health of the workers employed\r\n\r\nare present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would be most grateful if I\r\n\r\ncould  be  informed whether this section has  been\r\n\r\nutilised  by  the  Minister, as  very  clearly  it\r\n\r\nshould   have   been,   due  to   the   increasing\r\n\r\nconsultations  and  investigations  made  by   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Health Unit regarding problems  related\r\n\r\nto  chemical  hazards and dust.  In  addition,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  am sure that  the  silica  dust\r\n\r\nhazard faced by sand-blasters and other workers in\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity  during  sand-blasting  necessitates\r\n\r\nregulations    for    medical   supervision    and\r\n\r\nexamination of these workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rapidly industrialising Singapore, most\r\n\r\ncertainly  many  health  hazards  are   faced   by\r\n\r\nworkers. Two of these, occupational dermatitis and\r\n\r\nnoise-induced deafness, are gaining prominence  in\r\n\r\nindustry,   although  figures   are   not   easily\r\n\r\navailable  due  to  the lack of investigations  on\r\n\r\nthem.  To  ensure that workers are safely  guarded\r\n\r\nagainst these hazards. Sir, they will have  to  be\r\n\r\nincorporated in the Sixth Schedule (section 60) to\r\n\r\nthe   Factories  Act,  as  notifiable   industrial\r\n\r\ndiseases.  In  this way, it would be possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to take the necessary  precautions\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that workers are safeguarded  and  for\r\n\r\nemployers  to be aware of their responsibility  to\r\n\r\nminimise the occurrence of such diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nsame concern expressed by the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nthat  despite the Government's extensive  efforts,\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents, particularly in the building\r\n\r\nand  construction  sector, are  still  increasing.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would like to stress that  there  was\r\n\r\nonly  a  marginal increase of 0.6 per  cent,  from\r\n\r\n2,892  accidents  in 1972 to  2,910  in  1973.

In  this  connection,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\naccepted  the  recommendations  of  the   ad   hoc\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Wood Scaffoldings, and  contractors\r\n\r\nhave been required to comply accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.

This  is\r\n\r\nstill    very   valid   today.   Although    sound\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  scaffoldings  is  essential   in\r\n\r\npreventing  accidents, it is more  important  that\r\n\r\nemployees  working  on these scaffoldings  take  a\r\n\r\nkeen  interest  in  their own  safety  by  double-checking  the  safety aspects of the  scaffoldings\r\n\r\nand  by using the necessary safety equipment, such\r\n\r\nas safety belts and life-lines provided for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view to educating workers and employers,\r\n\r\ncertain  measures are being taken by the Ministry.\r\n\r\nA  Committee  on Safety and Health at Construction\r\n\r\nWork-sites  was  set up some  time  last  year  to\r\n\r\nadvise on ways and means of curbing the increasing\r\n\r\nnumber   of  accidents.  The  Committee  comprises\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  contractors,  associations,\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies,  statutory  boards  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour. The Committee has worked out a\r\n\r\ncode   of   practice  on  safety  and  health   at\r\n\r\nconstruction  worksites, and  this  code  will  be\r\n\r\nobserved by all building contractors. The  various\r\n\r\nprofessional bodies represented on this  Committee\r\n\r\nwill be signing an undertaking on the 26th of this\r\n\r\nmonth to observe these regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is a \"Dos and Don'ts\"\r\n\r\nbooklet  in  pictorial form, and we are  going  to\r\n\r\ndistribute this shortly.

It is clear, therefore, that my  Ministry\r\n\r\ndoes  not  let  up in its efforts  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nincidence of industrial accidents in the  country.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continue  to  deal severely  with  those\r\n\r\nselfish  employers and workers who have no  regard\r\n\r\nfor the safety and well-being of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the staffing position of the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate, I would like to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang for his support. As Members can see,  we\r\n\r\nare  very  conscious of the need to  recruit  more\r\n\r\npersonnel  to cope with the extremely diversified,\r\n\r\ncomplex  and  arduous  tasks  facing  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate and the Industrial Health Unit of the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  A  total of 25 professional  and  field\r\n\r\nposts  were  requested for, of  which  only  three\r\n\r\nposts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere approved. On further appeal, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance agreed to add an additional post of  staff\r\n\r\nnurse  to  be created by Establishment Warrant  in\r\n\r\nthe next financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised the question of\r\n\r\nstaffing.  We have 47 Factory Inspectors  gazetted\r\n\r\nunder  the Factories Act. These Factory Inspectors\r\n\r\nenforce the Factories Act, make periodic visits to\r\n\r\nfactories  to advise both the management  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers on the safe and proper procedure to handle\r\n\r\nmechanical  equipment  as  well  as  pointing  out\r\n\r\nunsafe  acts  and unsafe conditions of  the  work.\r\n\r\nThey  also advise workers and employers on matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to  industrial health  and  hygiene.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the Factory Inspectors also ensure  that\r\n\r\nall  lifting  equipment and pressure  vessels  are\r\n\r\ntested   to   the  requisite  standard.   It   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  clear that the duties of  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectors are primarily aimed at ensuring a  safe\r\n\r\nand  healthy working environment in the  interests\r\n\r\nof the workers. Recalcitrant employers and selfish\r\n\r\nworkers who have no regard for the safety of their\r\n\r\ncolleagues have been prosecuted and fined  in  the\r\n\r\nlaw   court.  Besides  enforcement,  the   Factory\r\n\r\nInspectors   also   engage  in   promotional   and\r\n\r\neducational activities, for instance, contributing\r\n\r\nto the Ministry's publication, \"The New Worker\" or\r\n\r\ncompiling  the  booklet,  \"Dos  and  Don'ts\"   for\r\n\r\nworkers in the building and construction industry,\r\n\r\nand organising safety campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint that the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectors are biased and rude, I wish  to  stress\r\n\r\nthat  the  task facing them is, to say the  least,\r\n\r\nonerous  and  unenviable. They are  certainly  not\r\n\r\npopular with all the factory occupiers because  in\r\n\r\norder  to  carry out their duties efficiently  and\r\n\r\nconscientiously   they  have   to   impose   legal\r\n\r\nobligations on the factory occupiers. These  legal\r\n\r\nobligations  can be very costly in terms  of  time\r\n\r\nand  money  to  the factory occupiers.  Under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,    it   is   understandable    that\r\n\r\ncomplaints  have  been made  against  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectors. My Ministry is aware of this  problem,\r\n\r\nand  field  officers are constantly reminded  that\r\n\r\nthey should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  polite, courteous and exercise impartiality in\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement of factory laws. However, if  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has  any  specific  complaints\r\n\r\nagainst any particular officer, appropriate action\r\n\r\nwill   be  taken  against  the  officer   if   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints are substantiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree more with the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu that prevention is better than cure. The last\r\n\r\nincrease   in   the   staff   of   the   Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Section - at least he seems to  imply\r\n\r\n- indicates a corresponding increase in industrial\r\n\r\naccidents. Although, as I have said earlier, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  marginal increase of 0.6 per cent  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  industrial  accidents,  the  Member's\r\n\r\ninference is not correct, as the increase in staff\r\n\r\nwas to effect a smoother function of the Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Section which  was  then  very  much\r\n\r\nunderstaffed.  As  a  result of  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nstaff,   the   time  taken  to  settle   workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation claims has been considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nMoreover, not all accidents resulting in workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation can be classified as accidents  under\r\n\r\nthe  Factories  Act.  Workmen's  compensation   is\r\n\r\npayable  whenever a workman suffers an  injury  or\r\n\r\ndeath by accident arising out of and in the course\r\n\r\nof  his employment. It does not matter whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  he is working in an establishment which comes\r\n\r\nunder the definition of \"factory\" in the Factories\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw his attention to the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  Factory Inspectorate made  a  total  of\r\n\r\n9,995  inspections last year. As a result of these\r\n\r\ninspections, 1,689 items of non-compliance of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Factories Act were spotted  and\r\n\r\nreferred   to  the  occupiers  of  factories   for\r\n\r\ncompliance. 128 occupiers and nine employees  who,\r\n\r\ndespite  advice  and warnings from  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\ncontinued   to   flout  the   safety   laws   were\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  prosecuted in the law  courts.  They\r\n\r\nwere  fined  a  total of $84,990. I can  see  that\r\n\r\nthere  is still room for improvement in the  field\r\n\r\nof  enforcement. The Factory Inspectorate and  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Health  Unit  of  the  Ministry,  with\r\n\r\nadditional  posts approved for the next  financial\r\n\r\nyear, would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinitely  make  every effort in this  direction.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  wish to state that strict enforcement\r\n\r\nof  the  safety laws is not the be-all and end-all\r\n\r\nof  accident  prevention. In recognition  of  this\r\n\r\nfact,  my  Ministry  has in  the  last  two  years\r\n\r\nchannelled   considerable  time  and   energy   to\r\n\r\npromotional and educational activities in accident\r\n\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir mentioned about\r\n\r\nsection 62, (Part VII) of the Factories Act. It is\r\n\r\ntrue that this particular section has not yet been\r\n\r\ninvoked.  But  I can assure him that  it  will  be\r\n\r\ninvoked soon. We intend to introduce the Factories\r\n\r\n(Abrasive  Blasting)  Regulations  in  due  course\r\n\r\nunder   this   section  to  control  sand-blasting\r\n\r\noperations  in  view of the high risk  to  workers\r\n\r\ncontracting silicosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the second\r\n\r\npart  of my question has not been answered by  the\r\n\r\nMinister   of   State,  i.e, the   inclusion   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  dermatitis and noise-induced  deafness\r\n\r\nas part of the Sixth Schedule (section 60).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I am sure we will look into\r\n\r\nthat too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point\r\n\r\nraised  by the Member for Jalan Kayu has not  been\r\n\r\nadequately answered.

However, in his earlier reply to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang he has indicated  that  the\r\n\r\nreason  for this was that the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nhad  rejected  the request of the Labour  Ministry\r\n\r\nfor  an  adequate increase of staff in the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: in view of the concern which\r\n\r\nMembers  have  shown  over the  persistently  high\r\n\r\naccident  rate in industry, will the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  make  another attempt  at  it,  this  time\r\n\r\nexpressing   the   concern   and   sentiments   of\r\n\r\nParliament?

As to the Member for Moulmein,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to thank him and the other Members  for\r\n\r\ntheir  support.  He  is quite  right  that  I  had\r\n\r\nindicated  earlier on that we  had  asked  for  25\r\n\r\nprofessional and field posts but unfortunately  we\r\n\r\nwere  not  able  to get all of them.  As  for  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  staff for the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nSection, I have already said that this Section has\r\n\r\nbeen very much understaffed for several years  and\r\n\r\nthere  was a tremendous number of backlog of cases\r\n\r\nnot  settled.  So it was imperative that  we  have\r\n\r\nmore bodies to clear up all the claims. It is true\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  better  to  prevent  accidents  from\r\n\r\nhappening  rather  than to pay  out  compensations\r\n\r\nlater. But once accidents occur, we would like  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  victims'  families get  compensation  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, the Minister intimated just now\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  an  increase  in  staff  in   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Health Unit.

The  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngot  one additional post of Factory Inspector  for\r\n\r\nthis  year.  The important thing is not  just  the\r\n\r\naddition  of  one post but the number  of  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectors  that  remain  with  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nLabour. That is the point, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an occasion to interview safety officers\r\n\r\nfor  a statutory board which is required to employ\r\n\r\nsafety  officers as a result of legislation  which\r\n\r\nrequires safety officers to be employed among  its\r\n\r\nemployees.   There  were  no   less   than   three\r\n\r\nInspectors from the Ministry of Labour who applied\r\n\r\nfor  this  job, and all of them had  been  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  just one year, with practically  no\r\n\r\nexperience  in the job that they were expected  to\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem therefore is not just the number of\r\n\r\nFactory Inspectors in the Ministry. What I want to\r\n\r\nknow  is  the sort of training that they  undergo,\r\n\r\nand  how equipped they are to perform their duties\r\n\r\nas  expected  of  them. I would be satisfied  even\r\n\r\nwith the present number of Inspectors only if they\r\n\r\ncould  remain  in the Labour Ministry consistently\r\n\r\nand if they are sufficiently capable of performing\r\n\r\ntheir duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  keep the Factory  Inspectors  in\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs and increase their efficiency.

I hope that with the  extra\r\n\r\ntraining open to them they would be more contented\r\n\r\nwith  their jobs and stay with us. We all  realise\r\n\r\nthat  there is a demand for certain categories  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  and I think we cannot rule out the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  everyone would want to try and get a  better\r\n\r\npost at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, although the question of industrial accidents\r\n\r\nis  causing concern to all of us, however, what we\r\n\r\nare  glad  to hear is that the Ministry is  taking\r\n\r\nsteps  and  measures to deal with it.

We all realise that at a time  when\r\n\r\nwe  are  short  of  manpower, the  safety  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers is particularly important and necessary at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture because they provide the  necessary\r\n\r\nmanpower  `for our production lines.

In  the  light  of  the   changed\r\n\r\ncomposition of the labour force, the provisions of\r\n\r\nsection 29 (1) of the Trade Unions Act has  become\r\n\r\nanachronistic.  Section 29 (1) stipulates  that  a\r\n\r\nperson  under the age of 21, but above the age  of\r\n\r\n18,  may be a member of a registered trade  union.\r\n\r\nThis  implies that a person under the  age  of  18\r\n\r\ncannot  be  a member of a trade union.  It  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, be necessary to amend the law to  allow\r\n\r\nmembership  of  a trade union to a person  who  is\r\n\r\nbelow 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now facing a situation in which the vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of employees in many establishments  are\r\n\r\nbelow   the  age  of  21.  To  meet  the   changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances, an amendment to section 29  (1)  of\r\n\r\nthe Trade Unions Act is an absolute necessity.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  pertinent to point  out  that  such  an\r\n\r\namendment  would  not be inconsistent  with  other\r\n\r\nlegislation. For instance, in the Employment  Act,\r\n\r\na  person who has completed the age of 16  is  not\r\n\r\ndeemed to be, by definition,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na young person and who, therefore, may be employed\r\n\r\nwithout   any  restrictions  whatsoever   in   any\r\n\r\ncommercial or industrial undertaking. There  seems\r\n\r\nto  be  no  reason, therefore, to  restrict  union\r\n\r\nmembership to only those who have attained the age\r\n\r\nof  18,  for if a person under 18 can be employed,\r\n\r\nthen  by the same token he can also be allowed  to\r\n\r\njoin a trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next and more important point, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nsection  29 (1) of the Trade Unions Act  does  not\r\n\r\nallow  any  person under the age  of  21  to  hold\r\n\r\noffice  in  a  trade  union.  Though  these  young\r\n\r\npersons  may join trade unions, we are very  often\r\n\r\nconfronted  with the difficulty of forming  branch\r\n\r\ncommittees  because,  invariably,  in  many  cases\r\n\r\nelections   to   the   branch   committees   will,\r\n\r\nunavoidably, have to be from amongst the rank-and-file  membership who are under 21. If  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  form  branch  committees   in   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   trade   union   organisation   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the rules of the trade  union  is\r\n\r\ninhibited and makes union membership a mockery for\r\n\r\non  the one hand these persons may become members,\r\n\r\nbut  on the other they cannot form themselves into\r\n\r\nbranch committees. This is an untenable situation.\r\n\r\nIn   the   circumstances,  I   ask   that   urgent\r\n\r\nconsideration  be  given  to  lower  the  age  for\r\n\r\nholding office in trade unions to 18 as against 21\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also be pertinent to point out that for\r\n\r\nworkmen's compensation purposes a person who is 18\r\n\r\nyears  of  age and above is entitled to  the  same\r\n\r\nquantum  of  compensation as any other adult.  The\r\n\r\nunmistakable inference from this is that  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of workmen's compensation a person  above\r\n\r\nthe  age of 18 is deemed to have attained the  age\r\n\r\nof  majority. It would not also be out of place to\r\n\r\nmention that in the Factories Act, on the strength\r\n\r\nof  section 62 (c), the fact that the Minister may\r\n\r\nmake  regulations  for  medical  supervision   for\r\n\r\npersons  below  the  age of 18 employed  in  work,\r\n\r\nwhich  may  cause risk or injury to their  health,\r\n\r\nindicates that those who are 18 years of age and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabove  are for the purposes of the Act, considered\r\n\r\nto  have attained the age of majority. All in all,\r\n\r\nthere  seems  to be no valid reason for  having  a\r\n\r\nseparate  set  of principles for admissibility  to\r\n\r\nmembership of and to hold office in trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, there are strong and valid\r\n\r\nreasons  to urgently review the position and  make\r\n\r\nthe  necessary amendments to section 29 (1) of the\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions Act and to reduce the age limit  for\r\n\r\nunion membership to 16 as against .18 now and  for\r\n\r\nholding office in trade unions to 18 as against 21\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which deserves urgent consideration\r\n\r\nis  the development of a policy towards those  who\r\n\r\nbenefit  from the organised labours of  others.  I\r\n\r\nrefer to non-unionised employees in establishments\r\n\r\nwhich  are  unionised  and  represented  by  trade\r\n\r\nunions. These non-unionised employees in unionised\r\n\r\ncompanies  enjoy the same terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment  which  are obtained  by  trade  unions\r\n\r\nthrough  collective bargaining with the employers.\r\n\r\nIndeed,   in  the  collective  bargaining  process\r\n\r\nitself,   the  facilities  offered  by  the   NTUC\r\n\r\nResearch  Unit  are extensively  utilised  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  their unions whose  sweat  and  toil\r\n\r\nresult in better terms and conditions for workers,\r\n\r\nbut   non-unionised  employees  who  enjoy   these\r\n\r\nbenefits  make no direct contributions.  They  are\r\n\r\nthe  parasites of the right zone. These are people\r\n\r\nwho  live  in a social vacuum believing that  they\r\n\r\ncan  survive by living on the efforts  of  others.\r\n\r\nThey believe that society exists for them. Indeed,\r\n\r\nto  them  all State agencies, social organisations\r\n\r\nand    trade   unions   have   only   a    one-way\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  They believe that  they  have  no\r\n\r\nreciprocal obligations or responsibilities to  any\r\n\r\nsocial  organisations. They  are  the  silent  and\r\n\r\ninactive   beneficiaries  who  are   parasitically\r\n\r\ndependent  on the labours of organised labour  who\r\n\r\ncontribute  consciously and  tangibly  to  general\r\n\r\nwelfare and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is basically unfair and unjust and must be\r\n\r\nremedied if social justice is to be achieved in an\r\n\r\nequitable  manner. Though a closed-shop policy  by\r\n\r\ntrade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions   can   be   advocated   to   remedy   this\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  state of affairs,  such  a  policy\r\n\r\nwould violate the principles of free and voluntary\r\n\r\nassociation  of  workers  in  trade  unions   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, such a step is not socially desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I suggest that there is nothing undesirable\r\n\r\nor  unethical to make it obligatory for  all  non-unionised employees in unionised establishments to\r\n\r\ncontribute an equivalent of union subscription and\r\n\r\nlevies  to  a  special  Workers  Development   and\r\n\r\nWelfare Fund which can be jointly administered  by\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  and the Ministry of Labour.  This  fund\r\n\r\nwould  not  be used for the operating expenses  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  or the NTUC but would  be  utilised\r\n\r\nwholly   to   provide   a  variety   of   welfare,\r\n\r\nrecreational  and educational facilities  for  our\r\n\r\nworking population as a whole. Indeed, there is an\r\n\r\nobligation for non-unionised workers to  accept  a\r\n\r\ncertain measure of responsibility to their  fellow\r\n\r\nworkers  as  a  condition  for  the  enjoyment  of\r\n\r\nbenefits  secured  for  them  by  the  efforts  of\r\n\r\norganised workers. We cannot afford to continue to\r\n\r\ncarry  them  as passengers dependent on  organised\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come for serious consideration to be\r\n\r\ngiven to this matter, and I would commend that the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  a  special Workers  Development  and\r\n\r\nWelfare Fund be given active consideration by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour and make it obligatory for non-unionised   workers  in  unionised  companies   to\r\n\r\ncontribute to this Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, trade unions\r\n\r\nare  important social institutions and trade union\r\n\r\nofficers  have  a  vital  role  to  play  in   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a healthy trade union movement  and\r\n\r\nthe  economic  development  of  the  country.   To\r\n\r\ndischarge their duties as responsible trade  union\r\n\r\nofficers,  they must have qualities of  leadership\r\n\r\nso  as  to be able to lead and command the respect\r\n\r\nof  their  rank and file. Since they are entrusted\r\n\r\nwith  the responsibilities of managing the affairs\r\n\r\nof their unions and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to  negotiate with employers  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\ntheir  members,  they should possess  keenness  of\r\n\r\nmind  and maturity of outlook. This can only  come\r\n\r\nabout  with  age and with a sufficient  period  of\r\n\r\nworking  experience. It is therefore not  proposed\r\n\r\nto  reduce, as a general rule, the minimum age  at\r\n\r\nwhich  trade union members can become officers  of\r\n\r\ntrade unions, i.e, from 21 years to 18 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry is aware that there are\r\n\r\ninstances  where there is a high concentration  of\r\n\r\nyoung  workers in certain establishments, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  garment  and  electronic industries.  If  the\r\n\r\npresent  law is rigidly adhered to, the union  may\r\n\r\nnot be able to find sufficient eligible members to\r\n\r\nstand  for  election as office-bearers.  In  these\r\n\r\nspecific  instances, there would appear  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncase   for   the  Ministry  to  consider  granting\r\n\r\nexemption to those between the ages of 18  and  21\r\n\r\nyears to enable them to hold office. However,  the\r\n\r\nproposal  has  other important implications  which\r\n\r\nrequire  further  study before a decision  can  be\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no compelling reason for lowering\r\n\r\nthe  minimum age from 18 to 16 years for a  person\r\n\r\nto  be  eligible  for union membership.  To  begin\r\n\r\nwith,  the  average age for our youths, especially\r\n\r\nour  young  men,  to enter the  labour  force  has\r\n\r\nrisen.  According to the 1970 Population Census  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  86,441 persons in the age  group  15-19\r\n\r\nwere  working. This represents only  about  7  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the total work force. This is because  of\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  our  education  system,  which  now\r\n\r\nprovides  more  opportunities for  our  youths  to\r\n\r\npursue secondary and post-secondary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, should the new entrant to the\r\n\r\nlabour force be under 18 years of age, it will not\r\n\r\nbe  long  before  he reaches that  age.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nyoung  workers  are more easily  misled  by  self-seeking    and   slogan-shouting   leaders    into\r\n\r\nsupporting undesirable or irrelevant issues  which\r\n\r\nare  not  in  their interests nor in the  nation's\r\n\r\ninterests.  They  are  also  more  susceptible  to\r\n\r\nmanipulations by irresponsible trade unions, which\r\n\r\nwill undoubtedly use them to consolidate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir   base.  For  these  reasons,  the  existing\r\n\r\nminimum age of 18 years is considered adequate for\r\n\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand the sentiments of trade\r\n\r\nunion  leaders against the nonunionised employees\r\n\r\nof  an  establishment who pay no  union  dues  but\r\n\r\nnonetheless enjoy the benefits of trade unionism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> They are social parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes. However, my Ministry is\r\n\r\nnot  yet convinced that the best way to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe    problem   of   \"free-riders\"   or   \"social\r\n\r\nparasites\", as the Member called them, is to force\r\n\r\nthem  to  contribute financially to a  development\r\n\r\nand  welfare fund, as it would have the effect  of\r\n\r\nforcing  non-unionised employees to  become  union\r\n\r\nmembers  as they will then have to pay  an  amount\r\n\r\nequivalent to trade union subscription  and  other\r\n\r\nlevies.  However,  much as we value  the  positive\r\n\r\ncontribution   of  responsible  democratic   trade\r\n\r\nunionism, in our free society an individual should\r\n\r\nbe  able  to seek and accept employment  with  any\r\n\r\nemployer without having to pay tribute to a  third\r\n\r\nparty. If non-unionised workers are forced to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  equivalent of union dues to a development and\r\n\r\nwelfare fund, in effect they are forced to pay for\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  work, a right  which  they  should\r\n\r\nfreely enjoy as citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However much we may deplore the actions of \"free-riders\" who only want the benefits of trade\r\n\r\nunionism  but without paying for them,  we  should\r\n\r\nnot  throw out fundamental rights in any  solution\r\n\r\nto  the problem. A more positive solution would be\r\n\r\nfor  trade  unions to pursue even more  vigorously\r\n\r\ntheir campaign to increase union membership. If  a\r\n\r\nman can be voluntarily persuaded to become a union\r\n\r\nmember  and pay his union dues, he is far more  of\r\n\r\nan asset to the union than an unwilling person who\r\n\r\nis forced to pay the equivalent of union dues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a marked increase\r\n\r\nin   the  number  of  unionised  members  in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  number rising from 112,500 in January  1971\r\n\r\nto  191,500  in  December 1973. With  the  dynamic\r\n\r\ngrowth   of   co-operatives  and  other   services\r\n\r\nprovided  by the NTUC for its members, undoubtedly\r\n\r\nmore  workers will find it beneficial to join NTUC\r\n\r\nunions. That, Mr Speaker, is a better way to solve\r\n\r\nthe   problem  of  the  \"free-riders\"  or  \"social\r\n\r\nparasites\" as the Member called them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, since the Minister has said\r\n\r\nthat the percentage of workers below the age of 18\r\n\r\nyears  is very small, will he consider a temporary\r\n\r\nexemption  for those companies which have  a  very\r\n\r\nbig  percentage, maybe 20-25 per cent, of  workers\r\n\r\naged  16-18? And when the minimum working  age  is\r\n\r\nincreased  to 18 years, he may then withdraw  this\r\n\r\nexemption.  Will the Minister also  consider  this\r\n\r\nfact:  that  in  a  unionised  establishment   the\r\n\r\nnonunionised  workers are getting more  than  the\r\n\r\nunionised workers? Assuming a $300 take-home  pay,\r\n\r\nthe  union  member  will  have  to  pay  $4  union\r\n\r\nsubscription;  in  other  words,  minus  $4.   The\r\n\r\nunionised  worker, therefore, in effect gets  less\r\n\r\nthan the employee who is not unionised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nexplained  just  now,  at this  moment  I  am  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  consider lowering the age  of  union\r\n\r\nmembership  to  those  who  are  below  18  years.\r\n\r\nHowever,   I  am  prepared  to  consider  granting\r\n\r\nexemption for those who are above 18 years to hold\r\n\r\noffice in trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quite convinced that the non-unionised\r\n\r\nworkers  in  a unionised establishment are  better\r\n\r\noff  than  the  unionised members  at  this  time,\r\n\r\nbecause  with  the  coming of the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil,  whatever  advantages  the  non-unionised\r\n\r\nworkers  have  been enjoying in the past  will  no\r\n\r\nlonger  be able to continue any more. In fact,  as\r\n\r\ntime  goes on, I think the non-unionised employees\r\n\r\nwill  find  that it will be to their advantage  to\r\n\r\njoin the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Point of clarification, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.

I think we  are\r\n\r\nnot   doing   that  badly.  In  Japan  the   total\r\n\r\npercentage  of unionised workers is  only  34  per\r\n\r\ncent, as reported in the Japan Labour Movement  in\r\n\r\n1973. In Canada it is 26 per cent. In West Germany\r\n\r\nit  is  35  per  cent. Even in the United  States,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  supposed to have the most advanced  and\r\n\r\npowerful labour movement, it is only 25 per  cent.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore I would say that it is more than  33\r\n\r\nper cent. I think the union has done its part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am pointing out, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nnon-unionised workers in a unionised establishment\r\n\r\npurely have the advantage, and this is not fair to\r\n\r\nthe unionised workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think\r\n\r\none  can  right an unfair and unjust act,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Boon Teck has put it, by another unfair\r\n\r\nand  unjust act. But, as I have pointed  out  just\r\n\r\nnow,  the  increase  in  trade  union  membership,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the last one year or so,  has  been\r\n\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say the NTUC has succeeded in a large\r\n\r\nmeasure in persuading workers to join their union.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I  have been looking  at  some  of  the\r\n\r\nfigures of certain unions affiliated to the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nand  I  have noticed that the percentage of  union\r\n\r\nmembership in certain establishments has  gone  up\r\n\r\nfrom  about  30-40 per cent in 1971 to  80-90  per\r\n\r\ncent  today. So I think the unions are  not  doing\r\n\r\nbadly  and,  given a little bit  more  time,  they\r\n\r\nwould be able to achieve, if not 100 per cent,  at\r\n\r\nleast  90 per cent membership.

There seems to\r\n\r\nbe a lot of discrimination shown to persons and no\r\n\r\nreason  is  given  by the officials  at  the  Work\r\n\r\nPermits  Office  for rejecting an  application.  I\r\n\r\nwill  quote  an example. Two persons of  the  same\r\n\r\nage,  and  coming from the same town, applied  for\r\n\r\nthe same type of job. One application was approved\r\n\r\nwhile the other was rejected. No reason was given.\r\n\r\nThe present labour shortage is so acute that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  employers  are prepared  to  take  risks  by\r\n\r\nemploying   non-citizens  without  work   permits,\r\n\r\nalthough  their  applications have been  rejected.\r\n\r\nWould  it  not be better for the country to  grant\r\n\r\nmore  work  permits, so that the CPF contributions\r\n\r\nthey  make  and  the taxes they pay  would  be  an\r\n\r\nindirect  earning  for us. It is  also  better  to\r\n\r\nstate the reason for the rejection of work permits\r\n\r\nto  relieve heartaches. No doubt, skilled  persons\r\n\r\nshould  be issued with work permits. But  servants\r\n\r\nare rare nowadays. So a relaxation in this respect\r\n\r\nwould help in the employment of valuable citizens,\r\n\r\nwho  have  to  give  up jobs to look  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gross waste when teachers and lawyers\r\n\r\nhave  to  resign  in  order to  look  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren  at home. Their useful services  will  be\r\n\r\navailable  only if they can get servants  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their children. Sir, to quote another case,\r\n\r\nsometime  ago  a  personnel  officer  of  a  large\r\n\r\nfactory  in  Jurong  went to the  Labour  Exchange\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore to recruit 100 male workers  to\r\n\r\nwork in Jurong. He hired 100 workers. The youngest\r\n\r\nwas  an 18-year old lad, the oldest a 34-year  old\r\n\r\nman,  married  with a 3-year old child.  Each  was\r\n\r\nrequired  to  work on weekly rotating shifts.  The\r\n\r\npay  was  $4.40  a  day for the first  and  second\r\n\r\nshifts  and $5.20 for the night shift.  They  were\r\n\r\nhoused  in a 12-storey block of 3-room flats.  Ten\r\n\r\npersons  were  allocated to a flat; four  beds  in\r\n\r\neach bedroom and two in the living room, for which\r\n\r\neach  person paid $8 rent a month. Since they  are\r\n\r\nnot  Singapore citizens, the company  applied  for\r\n\r\nwork  permits  for them to work in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ncompany  did  this. Two months later  the  company\r\n\r\nreceived  a  letter from the Work  Permits  Office\r\n\r\nstating that its application for work permits  for\r\n\r\n79  employees,  which included the lad,  had  been\r\n\r\napproved and that the application for work permits\r\n\r\nfor  the  balance of 21 employees was still  being\r\n\r\nconsidered. Another three months later the company\r\n\r\nwas  informed by the Work Permits Office that  the\r\n\r\napplication  for  work permits for  the  21  which\r\n\r\nincluded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  34-year old married person with a child,  was\r\n\r\nrejected.  No reason was given. They were  shocked\r\n\r\nwhen  they  were  told that the company  could  no\r\n\r\nlonger employ them. They were given a week to move\r\n\r\nout of the company's quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are cases in the\r\n\r\nelectronic  component factories where there  is  a\r\n\r\ngrave  shortage  of  daily-rated  workers.  As   a\r\n\r\nresult,  non-citizens  were recruited  off-and-on.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many  of the employees had  applied  for\r\n\r\nwork   permits  on  behalf  of  their  non-citizen\r\n\r\nworkers  and  found that some of the  applications\r\n\r\nwere  rejected without reason being given. So much\r\n\r\nso, I understand, that some of these factories are\r\n\r\nemploying non-citizens without work permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not see why all these applications for\r\n\r\nwork  permits are being rejected. After all, there\r\n\r\nis  a  shortage  of  labour  in  these  factories.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  illegal workers in  these  factories\r\n\r\nwill  mean the employers are not contributing  any\r\n\r\nCPF  for them. Further, may I also ask why our own\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens shy away from certain types  of\r\n\r\nwork?  Can  these types of jobs be given  to  non-citizens   by  issuing  them  with  work  permits?\r\n\r\nSometime ago, I came across our citizens receiving\r\n\r\nwelfare aid and not preferring to do certain types\r\n\r\nof  jobs  offered to them. It is time that  we  be\r\n\r\nstrict  with such people living at the  taxpayers'\r\n\r\nexpense.  Unless they are sick, or  physically  or\r\n\r\nmentally retarded or aged, I see no reason why the\r\n\r\nable-bodied cannot work and get out of  the  habit\r\n\r\nof  living at public expense. Surely at this time,\r\n\r\npeople have no excuse to lay idle and live at  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers' expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is one\r\n\r\nof  the members of ASEAN. Nevertheless, the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry's  Work Permits Office has practised  two\r\n\r\nstandards in regard to the issue of work  permits.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, a worker coming from Penang,  which\r\n\r\nis  about  500 miles away from Singapore,  can  be\r\n\r\nissued  with a work permit, whilst another  person\r\n\r\ncoming from, say, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRhio  Islands in Indonesia, the distance is  about\r\n\r\ntwo hours' boat ride, cannot be issued with a work\r\n\r\npermit.  They can only be allowed to  work  on  an\r\n\r\nemployment  pass. I just want to know the  reasons\r\n\r\nfor this double standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that it\r\n\r\nis  proposed  to  increase the total  strength  of\r\n\r\nstaff  in the Work Permits Office from 23  to  37.\r\n\r\nThis  increase  of  14 is quite large.  Does  this\r\n\r\nimply  that  there  will be  a  change  in  policy\r\n\r\nregarding the issue of work permits, and that more\r\n\r\npermits will be issued?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while on the subject of work permits, I\r\n\r\nwould  also  like  to take up a  point  previously\r\n\r\nbrought up by the Member for Toa Payoh, concerning\r\n\r\nblue   identity   card  holders.  Hitherto,   this\r\n\r\ncategory of persons who are permanent residents of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  are,  in the same way  as  foreigners,\r\n\r\nrequired to apply for permits. Of the large number\r\n\r\nof blue identity card holders, I am convinced that\r\n\r\nmany  of them were born and bred here but, because\r\n\r\nof   insufficient  documentary  proof,  they  were\r\n\r\nunable to obtain citizenship. This is particularly\r\n\r\nthe  case  with those born during the  war  years.\r\n\r\nThese people have no family roots elsewhere. Their\r\n\r\nonly roots are here in Singapore. Many of them are\r\n\r\nmarried  to  Singapore citizens and have  children\r\n\r\nwho   are  also  citizens.  I  feel  that  special\r\n\r\nconsideration  should be given  to  these  people.\r\n\r\nThey  should  be  allowed to work  freely  without\r\n\r\nrequiring them to apply for work permits. By doing\r\n\r\nso,  we  will  give them a sense of  security  and\r\n\r\nassist  them to make a better contribution to  the\r\n\r\ncountry. Sir, there are no more frustrating people\r\n\r\nthan  those  who feel that they belong to  nowhere\r\n\r\nand are not even allowed the freedom to make their\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the various points  raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Anson. On the one hand,  while\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  acute shortage of  workers  in  our\r\n\r\nfactories, on the other hand, work permits are not\r\n\r\neasily  obtained, so that employers have to employ\r\n\r\nworkers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout  work  permits. And  if  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  finds  this  out, the factories  concerned\r\n\r\nwill  be  fined. I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour whether this is the way to increase the\r\n\r\nnational revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to direct to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour is this: just now,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  only  those who are skilled will  be  issued\r\n\r\nwith work permits. However, there are many places,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  barber  shops,  bakeries,  coffee-shops,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  to  employ workers.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not they are categorised  as  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  but  will the Minister issue  them  with\r\n\r\nwork permits?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier  that because  of  the  present\r\n\r\nshift  in  our  economic  strategy,  from  one  of\r\n\r\npromoting    labour   intensive   low   technology\r\n\r\nindustries  to  less labour intensive  and  higher\r\n\r\nskilled  industries,  we  will  have  to  be  more\r\n\r\nselective in our intake of foreign labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work permits, as 1 have said just now, will\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   be  issued  liberally   to   those\r\n\r\napplicants who possess the skills which  Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds,  or  who can be easily trained  to  acquire\r\n\r\nthese   skills.  On  the  other  hand,   unskilled\r\n\r\napplicants  and  those applying  for  white-collar\r\n\r\njobs  will not be favourably considered  for  work\r\n\r\npermits  unless  they have special  merits.  These\r\n\r\nunskilled workers include shop assistants, coffee-shop assistants, and so forth, as mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-riding basis upon which work permits are\r\n\r\nconsidered  is the skill and the qualification  of\r\n\r\nthe non-citizen worker. There is no discrimination\r\n\r\nsince  our  policy is based primarily on  economic\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Certain instances were  quoted  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson. I am afraid I am not able to\r\n\r\ngive  him  an informative reply unless he supplies\r\n\r\nme  with the particulars of those cases. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink that Budget time is the time for a Member to\r\n\r\nraise  specific  cases concerning either  his  own\r\n\r\nconstituent or his friend. If he wants a reply, he\r\n\r\nshould raise a Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has also stated that\r\n\r\nwith a relaxation of work permit policy, Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  gain  from CPF contributions and  taxes  -I\r\n\r\npresume  income  taxes - derived from  non-citizen\r\n\r\nworkers.  I wish to point out that this, in  fact,\r\n\r\nwould  not necessarily be the case as the majority\r\n\r\nof  unskilled  non-citizen workers if  allowed  to\r\n\r\nwork  in  Singapore, will be earning  salaries  of\r\n\r\nless  than $200 a month, in which case income  tax\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  payable  by them.  Similarly,  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  need only be paid by  the  employer\r\n\r\nwhich  goes  direct into the credit  of  the  non-citizen worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is also aware that some professionally\r\n\r\nqualified  women  have  been  unable  to  take  up\r\n\r\ngainful employment or have to give up jobs because\r\n\r\nof   the   difficulties  in   obtaining   domestic\r\n\r\nservants.  The Ministry had, in fact,  been  quite\r\n\r\nliberal  in the issue of work permits to  domestic\r\n\r\nservants. In 1971 there were 2,623 non-citizens on\r\n\r\nwork  permits working as domestic servants in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic. The number increased to 3.369  in  1972,\r\n\r\nand   further   increased  to   3,964   in   1973.\r\n\r\nHouseholders who intend to employ non-citizens  as\r\n\r\ndomestic servants would have little difficulty  in\r\n\r\nobtaining  work  permits if both the  husband  and\r\n\r\nwife  are in gainful employment or if the  husband\r\n\r\ncan  satisfy the Commissioner for Employment  that\r\n\r\nhis  wife  would  take  up  employment  within   a\r\n\r\nreasonable  period  of  time  upon  being  granted\r\n\r\napproval to employ a non-citizen domestic servant.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in view of our current policy  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown  population  increase and also  marriages  of\r\n\r\nwork  permit holders, preference will be given  to\r\n\r\nthose  applicants who are middle-aged  or  already\r\n\r\nmarried in their home country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu mentioned about the\r\n\r\nincrease in the staff of the Work Permits  Office.\r\n\r\nI think he is aware that several new measures have\r\n\r\nbeen  implemented  by the Work Permits  Office  in\r\n\r\nrecent months. In May 1973 the Work Permits Office\r\n\r\nimplemented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  scheme whereby skilled workers, technicians and\r\n\r\nsupervisors  may  have their yearly  work  permits\r\n\r\nrenewed for a three-year period if they pass trade\r\n\r\ntests  conducted by the Industrial Training Board,\r\n\r\nor   they  have  acceptable  qualifications.  This\r\n\r\npolicy  was  introduced to encourage skilled  non-citizen  workers to remain in Singapore. The  Work\r\n\r\nPermits  Office has received a sizable  number  of\r\n\r\napplications for three-year work permits since the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the scheme. Then  in  June  1973\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Permits Office, in a move to discourage\r\n\r\nexcessive  job-hopping,  introduced  measures   to\r\n\r\ndisallow   work   permit  holders  from   changing\r\n\r\nemployment  unless  there  are  good  reasons   to\r\n\r\nsupport  their applications, for example, changing\r\n\r\nto  a  higher  skilled job. The implementation  of\r\n\r\nthis policy has, to a considerable extent, reduced\r\n\r\nundesirable  labour  turnover  among  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders. However, it has increased the workload of\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Permits Office. Then in July  1973  the\r\n\r\nWork Permits Office implemented a policy requiring\r\n\r\nwork  permit holders to obtain the prior  approval\r\n\r\nof  the  Commissioner for Employment in  order  to\r\n\r\ncontract marriage with Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the above measures has\r\n\r\nresulted  in  an  increase  in  the  workload  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of the Work Permits  Office.  It\r\n\r\nis, therefore, necessary for the staff of the Work\r\n\r\nPermits  Office to be increased. In addition,  the\r\n\r\nWork  Permits  Office  has  recently  computerised\r\n\r\nseveral areas in the Work Permits Office in  order\r\n\r\nto  improve the operating efficiency and to enable\r\n\r\nthe   speedy   compilation  of  statistical   data\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the formulation and  assessment  of\r\n\r\npolicies. This has also resulted in the  need  for\r\n\r\nincreased staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has also asked whether\r\n\r\nconsideration  may  be given to  exempt  Singapore\r\n\r\nblue  identity  card holders  who  have  no  roots\r\n\r\nelsewhere  from the need to obtain  work  permits.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Labour has  been  issuing  work\r\n\r\npermits  freely  to  applicants holding  Singapore\r\n\r\nblue  identity  cards. As a rule,  Singapore  blue\r\n\r\nidentity card holders are given work permits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalid for two years, as against one year for other\r\n\r\ncategories of applicants. Further, Singapore  blue\r\n\r\nidentity card holders on work permit and who  have\r\n\r\nfamily  roots  in  Singapore may be  granted  work\r\n\r\npermits  for a five-year period. A review  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  made of the position of permanent residents\r\n\r\nholding  blue  identity  cards,  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ngranting  them  work permits valid  for  a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod.  Meanwhile, it is proposed not  to  exempt\r\n\r\nSingapore blue identity card holders who  have  no\r\n\r\nroots  elsewhere  from having to  apply  for  work\r\n\r\npermits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will recall that sometime ago the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Labour  announced  that   permanent\r\n\r\nresidents  who passed the appropriate skill  tests\r\n\r\nor     who     possessed    acceptable    training\r\n\r\nqualifications  would be eligible for  citizenship\r\n\r\nif   they   satisfied  the  ten-year   residential\r\n\r\nqualification. Holders of Singapore blue  identity\r\n\r\ncards  who are unskilled should, therefore, strive\r\n\r\nto  upgrade their skills so that they can  qualify\r\n\r\nfor citizenship under the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

While  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may be able to justify its decision  to\r\n\r\npermit  the increase, the bus commuters also  have\r\n\r\nample   causes  for  their  resentment  over   the\r\n\r\nincrease.  Apart from their, perhaps,  exaggerated\r\n\r\nfear of the inflationary effect of an increase  in\r\n\r\nbus  fares,  members of the public felt  that  the\r\n\r\nincrease  would  not result in any improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe bus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

But  this\r\n\r\namendment is on policy matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus commuters in Singapore have, on the whole,\r\n\r\nbeen  ill-served by the bus companies  during  the\r\n\r\nlast   two   decades.  The  performance   of   the\r\n\r\nmanagement of the SBS up to-date seems  to  be  in\r\n\r\nthe  grand tradition of mismanagement of Singapore\r\n\r\nbus  companies.  1 would not, however,  bore  this\r\n\r\nHouse  by listing out all the defects of the  SBS.\r\n\r\nLet me touch on a few significant points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS is a huge, complex organisation as far as\r\n\r\nSingapore  goes. Yet the SBS is run as  a  one-man\r\n\r\nshow  in  the style of a Chinese family  business.\r\n\r\nThe  1.7 million passengers carried daily  by  the\r\n\r\nSBS, the several thousand employees of the SBS and\r\n\r\na  few hundred thousand other road-users, tend  to\r\n\r\ndirect against one another their frustration  over\r\n\r\nthe   shortcomings  of  the  SBS.  Only   if   the\r\n\r\nmanagement of the SBS were to loosen their  purse-strings  and  employ  more  executives  with   the\r\n\r\nprofessional expertise, the SBS might be  able  to\r\n\r\nmeet its social obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be more symptomatic of the SBS's\r\n\r\nmess   than   the  fact  of  only  one   qualified\r\n\r\nmechanical  engineer, employed  early  this  year,\r\n\r\nwith  a few assistants and without modern workshop\r\n\r\nfacilities to service a fleet of 2,000 odd  buses.\r\n\r\nThe  result is for one reason or another that  the\r\n\r\nSBS can put on the roads an average of 1,400 buses\r\n\r\nduring peak hours, when double that number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  required.

I do not see how the management of the  SBS\r\n\r\nhas  got to do with the policy of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Aljunied please\r\n\r\nstop  beating about the bush, and get on to policy\r\n\r\nmatters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it may be\r\n\r\nthat  the  road  transportation is a  complex  and\r\n\r\ntaxing responsibility which may cause the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  overlook  some  matters  and  to  make  rather\r\n\r\nconflicting  decisions. Before  I  deal  with  the\r\n\r\ntopic of taxis and taxi-drivers, I should like  to\r\n\r\ntouch  on  a  matter which is a  sore  point  with\r\n\r\nScheme A bus drivers. I refer to the reserved  bus\r\n\r\nlanes originally for the exclusive use of the  SBS\r\n\r\nbuses  on  certain major roads. Now it seems  that\r\n\r\nScheme  B buses and lorries are also permitted  to\r\n\r\nuse  these reserved bus lanes. But Scheme A  buses\r\n\r\nbringing  office  workers to the City  are  barred\r\n\r\nfrom  using these lanes. Worse still, some  roads,\r\n\r\nsuch as Robinson Road, have a reserved bus lane on\r\n\r\none side and traffic signs prohibiting parking and\r\n\r\nstopping  during  peak hours on  the  other  side,\r\n\r\nmaking it impossible for passengers to be set down\r\n\r\nat  any point along the roads. The bus drivers are\r\n\r\nangry   as   they   are  paying  the   same   tax,\r\n\r\nregistration   fees  and  additional  registration\r\n\r\nfees, and performing similar services as those  of\r\n\r\nthe  Scheme B vehicle owners. I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan  give serious consideration to the use of  the\r\n\r\nreserved bus lanes by Scheme A buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I shall deal with the topic of taxis. Those\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who drive taxis and who aspire to own\r\n\r\ntheir  taxis  must  find the  Government's  policy\r\n\r\ntowards  them  rather puzzling.  I  refer  to  the\r\n\r\nimposition of the additional registration fee  (or\r\n\r\nARF) on taxis. In streamlining the ARF in October,\r\n\r\n1972,  the  opportunity was taken to increase  the\r\n\r\nARF to 25 per cent to discourage private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncar ownership by jacking up the price of each\r\n\r\ncar  by  about  25 per cent. Omnibuses  and  goods\r\n\r\nvehicles, therefore, have been paying a much lower\r\n\r\nrate  of  the  ARF  in line with the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy to promote public transportation. But taxis\r\n\r\nand mini-buses are not enjoying the same privilege\r\n\r\napparently  on the ground that they  do  not  form\r\n\r\npart  of  the public transportation system.  Taxis\r\n\r\nand mini-buses, however, can rightly claim to form\r\n\r\nan  integral  part  of  the public  transportation\r\n\r\nsystem  in  that they supplement the  general  bus\r\n\r\nservices  and  cater for persons  who  are  either\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay  more for  greater  comfort  and\r\n\r\nconvenience or forced by circumstances  to  use  a\r\n\r\nfaster  means  of transportation. Moreover,  taxis\r\n\r\nand  mini-buses  are socially more desirable  than\r\n\r\nprivate   cars  in  the  context  of   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncongested  roads  as an average taxi  or  mini-bus\r\n\r\ncarries  more persons than an average private  car\r\n\r\nper trip or per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pleading for the reduction of ARF for taxis\r\n\r\nand mini-buses, I have in mind the difficulty of a\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver to own a taxi. The life span of a taxi\r\n\r\nis  statutorily limited to seven years.  With  the\r\n\r\nrecent  increase of the ARF to a total of  55  per\r\n\r\ncent  and the higher rate of interest on loans,  a\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver finds he may have to buy a new taxi as\r\n\r\nsoon as he has completed paying his instalments on\r\n\r\nhis taxi. This is if he is fortunate enough to  be\r\n\r\na  member of NTUC COMFORT. But it is a fact that a\r\n\r\nyellow-top taxi-driver cannot hope to own his taxi\r\n\r\nin a lifetime unless he has a lucky windfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of taxi-drivers beneficially owning\r\n\r\nthe taxis they drive in is socially desirable. For\r\n\r\none thing, the drivers tend to take better care of\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles, doing their utmost to keep  their\r\n\r\nvehicles  clean  and  in  a roadworthy  condition.\r\n\r\nCompare the average SBS bus and the average school-bus,  and one can see the difference. For  another\r\n\r\nthing, the plight of taxi-drivers who have to hire\r\n\r\na taxi from day to day from unscrupulous owners is\r\n\r\nmost unenviable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, over the past few days in this House, Members\r\n\r\nhave  contributed a great deal of  views  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the Minister.

The  introduction of bus  lanes  and  the\r\n\r\nsupplementary public transport service are some of\r\n\r\nthe  measures  that  have been taken.  The  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system  has  aroused  public  interest,\r\n\r\nparticularly from the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this has nothing to\r\n\r\ndo with the policy of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the public\r\n\r\nbus  service should be improved. I asked  an  Oral\r\n\r\nQuestion  in  this House a few days ago,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister in reply gave an assurance that  the  bus\r\n\r\nservice would be improved stage by stage.  On  the\r\n\r\nbasis of that assurance, I was gratified. But I am\r\n\r\nstill  waiting  to see an improvement.

Firstly,    the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  introducing a 14-seater  mini-bus\r\n\r\nservice  in  Singapore. These 14-seater mini-buses\r\n\r\ncan operate within a radius of five miles from the\r\n\r\nCity   so  as  to  facilitate  speedy  travel   by\r\n\r\ncommuters in the City area, instead of the use  of\r\n\r\nlorries and omnibuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Sembawang come\r\n\r\nnow  to  the policy of the Ministry? It  would  be\r\n\r\nmore comforting for the Minister to listen to  him\r\n\r\nalong those lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you\r\n\r\nfor your guidance and advice. What follows will be\r\n\r\nmore on policy than on details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, at present the buses only display\r\n\r\nthe  Service numbers without indicating the routes\r\n\r\nthat  they  are supposed to run. The  destinations\r\n\r\nare  not  clearly indicated on the buses  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit   of  the  commuters.  I  hope   that   an\r\n\r\nimprovement  will  be  made  to  ensure  that   no\r\n\r\ninconvenience is caused to passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, buses should be properly scheduled. Too\r\n\r\nmany buses are now usually found to congregate  in\r\n\r\none bus terminus. My proposal is that there should\r\n\r\nbe  a board indicating the bus that will be taking\r\n\r\noff  or the first bus that will be leaving the bus\r\n\r\nterminus, so that passengers do not have to  chase\r\n\r\nafter the buses at the terminus which would create\r\n\r\na dangerous situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto   consider   the  employment  of   female   bus\r\n\r\nconductors to relieve the shortage of labour,  and\r\n\r\npossibly to improve the bus services. It has  been\r\n\r\nproved that female workers are equal with the male\r\n\r\nworkers  in the performance of work. What the  men\r\n\r\ncan  do, the women can do too. For example, in the\r\n\r\nearly  days  of  Singapore there  were  few  women\r\n\r\npolice constables. Nowadays we can see many  women\r\n\r\npolice  constables  everywhere,  and  their   good\r\n\r\nperformance has already been acknowledged  by  the\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would ask the Minister to consider the\r\n\r\nintroduction of season tickets to relieve the work-load of bus conductors. We can have season tickets\r\n\r\nat,  say, $5 valid for a month or a week, and  the\r\n\r\nbus  conductors need only to punch the ticket  for\r\n\r\neach trip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my speech is\r\n\r\nfairly  long and I hope the Minister will  not  be\r\n\r\nangry with me.

At present, the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  service is one of the major  issues  in\r\n\r\nour country. Whilst the Ministry of Communications\r\n\r\nis  taking  steps  to alleviate  the  setbacks  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  supplementary  transport  schemes  as\r\n\r\nalternatives, the Minister must make it a point to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  having a better transport service  in\r\n\r\nthe future. It will be useless to waste much money\r\n\r\nand sweat on anything that brings adverse results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are disgusted in having to read the\r\n\r\ndaily press of the numerous complaints against our\r\n\r\npublic transport system. With the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe new revised bus services recently, the changes\r\n\r\nhave  not  shown any marked improvement.  Instead,\r\n\r\nsome  of the commuters experience further hardship\r\n\r\nin  waiting for buses that finally appear  but  do\r\n\r\nnot  bother to pick them up. They have to wait for\r\n\r\na  considerable  time just to get into  the  right\r\n\r\nbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mornings and evenings there is a mad rush\r\n\r\nof office workers and school children to board the\r\n\r\nbuses,  and many of them report late for  work  or\r\n\r\nschool.  To aggravate the situation, most  of  the\r\n\r\nbuses display only the numbers, some of which  are\r\n\r\nsmall  and  illegible. The commuter has to  strain\r\n\r\nhis  eyes  to  make  out the numbers,  and  he  is\r\n\r\nexpected to know where the buses are heading  for,\r\n\r\njust  by  looking  at  the numbers.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nnumbers are even written with marker pens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the commuter is expected to be a\r\n\r\nwalking  `memory book' of bus routes. Let  me  ask\r\n\r\none simple question. Is it going to cost that much\r\n\r\nmore  just  to include the terminus and  the  main\r\n\r\nroutes  of  the  buses? How do you expect  a  poor\r\n\r\nilliterate person to remember numbers and to  take\r\n\r\nthe right bus? Woe betide the traveller who boards\r\n\r\nthe  wrong bus. He will be a victim of insults and\r\n\r\nshouts  from  bus  conductors who  have  generally\r\n\r\nacquired   a  reputation  for  their  uncalled-for\r\n\r\nremarks and intolerant behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the route numbers appearing in front\r\n\r\nand sides of the buses should be clearly indicated\r\n\r\nwith  luminous paint and the lighting  behind  the\r\n\r\nroute  number should be more effective. At  night,\r\n\r\nmany  bus  drivers switch on the head  lights  and\r\n\r\ndrive  at  deadly speed, so that commuters  cannot\r\n\r\nsee  the bus numbers and thereby cannot signal  to\r\n\r\nstop and board it in time, even though the bus  is\r\n\r\nempty.  Therefore, the driver is the wise guy  and\r\n\r\ncommuters  are left to curse the bus service.  How\r\n\r\nmuch longer have the people of Singapore to suffer\r\n\r\nand  tolerate  under the very poor mass  transport\r\n\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the bus drivers are very hasty in closing\r\n\r\nthe  exit  door  even  before the  commuters  have\r\n\r\nalighted.  A  case in point is the incident  of  a\r\n\r\nwoman  whose  arm was caught by the sliding  door,\r\n\r\nthus  preventing  her  from getting  down  at  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  bus stop. When she finally got down,  she\r\n\r\nhad  injured her arm. This sort of incident  is  a\r\n\r\ndaily  occurrence, and nothing is  being  done  to\r\n\r\npenalise the driver to correct his attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I spoke on the introduction of a\r\n\r\ncomplete ban on smoking in buses. I am indeed glad\r\n\r\nto   note   that  my  suggestion  has   now   been\r\n\r\nlegislated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is much room for further\r\n\r\nimprovement of the buses. There are too many buses\r\n\r\nwith  tickets  and bits of paper thrown  here  and\r\n\r\nthere,   litter  boxes  with  no  bottoms,  seats,\r\n\r\nwindows and doors damaged and smoky exhausts.  The\r\n\r\nbuses  are  often  very untidy  inside  and  dirty\r\n\r\noutside. In fact, some of them are so filthy  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  no better than the rubbish  trucks.  We\r\n\r\nhave  been emphasising the need to keep  our  City\r\n\r\nclean.  Yet cleanliness is certainly not a  virtue\r\n\r\nwith the Singapore Bus Service Ltd. There are  too\r\n\r\nmany breakdowns and many of them can be seen lying\r\n\r\nat  the  roadside during peak periods. Day  before\r\n\r\nyesterday one bus knocked down a tree. Yesterday a\r\n\r\nbus  knocked down a tree and a lamp post,  and  on\r\n\r\nthe  same day another bus knocked down a bus stand\r\n\r\nat Raffles Quay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring to the attention of the Minister\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  re-routing of the  bus  services\r\n\r\nrecently. Firstly, some of the routing has  caused\r\n\r\nconsiderable  delay  in commuters  reaching  their\r\n\r\ndestination as the buses take a roundabout route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fare has also been increased by 10 cents for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the  bus company,  thus  causing\r\n\r\nfurther  hardship to the people. Since  the  fares\r\n\r\nhad  been  raised,  the  public  expect  a  better\r\n\r\nservice.  But  then it is just the reverse.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the increase in bus fares,  I  observe\r\n\r\nthat there has been a sharp drop in the number  of\r\n\r\npeople travelling by bus. The routing of buses has\r\n\r\nstill   to   be  revised.  I  quote  an  instance.\r\n\r\nPreviously  there was a direct service,  No.  125,\r\n\r\npassing  through the stretch of Alexandra Road  to\r\n\r\nKeppel Harbour and the commuter had to pay only 20\r\n\r\ncents.  But today the same commuter has to  change\r\n\r\nservice, that is, one service from the Lower Delta\r\n\r\nRoad  to  the  juction of Alexandra/Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nRoad,  and  from there another service  to  Keppel\r\n\r\nHarbour, and every time he changes a bus he has to\r\n\r\npay an extra 10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bus there is no chart to indicate the fare\r\n\r\nstages.  Many  of  the  commuters  and  even  some\r\n\r\nconductors  themselves  do  not  know  the   exact\r\n\r\namount, and the various fare stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine if a commuter has innocently short-paid his fare and is about to get down at an extra\r\n\r\nstop. If the conductor is not a reasonable person,\r\n\r\nwhich  happens many a time, the poor commuter  has\r\n\r\nto  pay an extra 20 cents for the distance to  the\r\n\r\nnext bus stop. How costly is their extra stop!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major complaint is that the buses are not\r\n\r\ntravelling  according to schedule,.  What  is  the\r\n\r\npoint of having a schedule? What is the purpose of\r\n\r\nhaving  a  bus guide, when the commuters  have  to\r\n\r\nwait as long as an hour for certain services?  And\r\n\r\nwhen they do arrive, one will not be surprised  to\r\n\r\nsee them coming in twos or threes in a stretch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know why the three former bus\r\n\r\ncompanies had to merge. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsense  that due to the amalgamation, there  is  no\r\n\r\ncompetition  and therefore this state  of  affairs\r\n\r\nhas arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, greater emphasis and publicity should be\r\n\r\nextended  to  the  supplementary public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem.  Though a start has been made,  there  are\r\n\r\nmany  teething problems which should be  rectified\r\n\r\nas soon as possible. I would also request that the\r\n\r\nsupplementary  public  transport  service   should\r\n\r\nbegin  at  6  a.m, for the benefit  of  the  shift\r\n\r\nworkers  in the port and in the factories  because\r\n\r\nthere is a mad rush for buses in the morning.  Can\r\n\r\nanything  be  done to bring about a better  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system, especially when price increases\r\n\r\nhave  already caused great hardship to the people?\r\n\r\nWith  the recent rise in the price of petrol,  can\r\n\r\nsomething  be  done to keep inflation  down  to  a\r\n\r\nminimum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Telephone Board in the past\r\n\r\nhad  declared  proudly that its profits  ran  into\r\n\r\nseveral millions. Yet the services provided to the\r\n\r\nordinary subscribers are extremely poor.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  existing policy of the management of the STB?\r\n\r\nAre  they  out to make profits from the City  area\r\n\r\nand to ignore the rural areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New applicants for the installation of telephones\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to get a line. Some have  been\r\n\r\nwaiting for years, and yet the Board has plans  to\r\n\r\nintroduce telephones in cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB encourages the public to use the digital\r\n\r\nsystem  and  car telephones, though  the  services\r\n\r\nprovided  are quite often appalling. Some  of  the\r\n\r\noperators  are  frequently  the  most  elusive  of\r\n\r\ncharacters, and if by chance one gets through them\r\n\r\nto inquire about a certain number, the quick reply\r\n\r\nwould be that the telephone is out of order.  That\r\n\r\nis a very convenient excuse, I must say, but it is\r\n\r\ndone  too  often.  Either the  section  is  under-staffed or something is wrong with the operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, your ten minutes\r\n\r\nare up.

So I promise to be short.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some two years ago when the bus services were\r\n\r\nfirst   reorganised,  the  Citizens'  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Jalan Kayu at my request  set  up  a\r\n\r\nstudy group to look into the needs of commuters in\r\n\r\nJalan   Kayu.   A   memorandum  was   subsequently\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to the Minister and he was kind  enough\r\n\r\nto  agree and to direct a new route, 73/73A, which\r\n\r\nprovided a direct link between Jalan Kayu and  the\r\n\r\nCity    area.   Unfortunately,   at   the   recent\r\n\r\nreorganisation of bus routes, Service  73/73A  was\r\n\r\nunilaterally withdrawn from us without  any  prior\r\n\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the opportunity of enquiring\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Minister  whether  he  would  consider\r\n\r\ndirecting SBS to reinstate the service to  us.  If\r\n\r\nthe route was considered necessary two years' ago,\r\n\r\nI  fail  to  see  why  it is no  longer  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause in the meantime the population in my  area\r\n\r\nhas expanded quite considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take the opportunity of\r\n\r\nenquiring from the Minister what factors are taken\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  in deciding  upon  whether  a\r\n\r\nroute   should   be   extended,   maintained,   or\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  Is  the  decision based  just  on  the\r\n\r\nprofitability  of  that  particular   route,   and\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not prior approval has been  obtained\r\n\r\nfrom the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, food,\r\n\r\nclothes, accommodation and transportation are  the\r\n\r\nmain   problems   of  living.   The   problem   of\r\n\r\ntransportation is the most important that  affects\r\n\r\nour citizens. The need to improve the bus services\r\n\r\nis, therefore, very great. Up to today we have not\r\n\r\nseen  very  definite results from the  efforts  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our bus services as pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious Members of Parliament. The main aim of the\r\n\r\nbus  service  is to provide efficient  and  timely\r\n\r\nservice. I am afraid that the present bus  service\r\n\r\nis departing further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  further  away from this principle  of  cheap,\r\n\r\nfast and good form of transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.\r\n\r\nThe  first one is the upward revision of bus fares\r\n\r\nwhich  has  unfortunately increased the burden  of\r\n\r\nour  people  in  the  midst of the  inflation,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the lower income groups  who  usually\r\n\r\ntravel  over  a  distance of less  than  four  bus\r\n\r\nstops. Everyday they have to incur an increase  of\r\n\r\n20  cents  in bus fares. I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he is prepared  to  consider  a\r\n\r\nreduction in bus fares for distances of less  than\r\n\r\nfour bus stops to restore the old price structure.\r\n\r\nThe  present  rates for the other  number  of  bus\r\n\r\nstops may remain the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point has already been brought up by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Jalan Kayu,  that  services  for\r\n\r\ncertain  routes in the old schedule  are  actually\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Unfortunately,  after  the   revision,\r\n\r\nthese routes have disappeared. The result is  that\r\n\r\nthose who used to travel in one direct service now\r\n\r\nhave  to travel on more than one service in  order\r\n\r\nto  reach  their destination. This would  mean  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 40 Cents in bus fares. I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether  he  is  prepared   to\r\n\r\nreconsider this problem of minimising the need  to\r\n\r\ntake   a   second  service  to  reach   the   same\r\n\r\ndestination, or the commuters be charged according\r\n\r\nto  old  rates  when they have to  take  a  second\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is related to the question of\r\n\r\nbus  lanes. Some people say that the small  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  have  been eliminated but  the  big  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  have emerged in their place, and these  are\r\n\r\nthe big buses. Even before the introduction of bus\r\n\r\nlanes, the bus drivers behaved as though they were\r\n\r\nthe   only  users  of  the  roads.  Now,  we  have\r\n\r\nallocated  up to one-quarter of the width  of  the\r\n\r\nroad  for the exclusive use of the buses. We  must\r\n\r\nremember that the construction of roads comes from\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers' money. Is it fair to reserve  this\r\n\r\nspace  for  the  exclusive use of  buses?  Another\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  I  understand the  Ministry  will\r\n\r\nconfiscate  vehicles that violate  bus  lanes  for\r\n\r\nmore than three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimes. Is the Ministry prepared to reconsider this\r\n\r\npoint?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question is this. From the press we\r\n\r\nlearn   that   since  the  introduction   of   the\r\n\r\nsupplementary   transport   service,    the    SBS\r\n\r\nimmediately sent out a great number of  inspectors\r\n\r\nto  assist  commuters at the  various  bus  stops.\r\n\r\nBefore   the  introduction  of  the  supplementary\r\n\r\ntransport service, we did not see any form of such\r\n\r\nassistance.  It is only after the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  supplementary transport service that  we  see\r\n\r\nthis  improvement in service. The  SBS  sends  out\r\n\r\nthese  people in order to get more bus  commuters.\r\n\r\nIs this not an example of better service resulting\r\n\r\nfrom competition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nasked  the question: was the amalgamation  of  the\r\n\r\nthree  bus companies really necessary? That  is  a\r\n\r\nvalid question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question is related to a point brought\r\n\r\nup  by the Member for Sembawang as to whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  prepared to introduce the  14-seater\r\n\r\nmini buses in Singapore. As we all know, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  embarking on a \"Conserve Energy\" drive at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,   and  the  public  transport  system   is\r\n\r\ninefficient. The introduction of these  mini-buses\r\n\r\nwould, I think, improve the services provided  and\r\n\r\nalso  conserve some of our energy as  a  mini  bus\r\n\r\ncarries more people than a taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth question: I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he has noticed that roads in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity  of  bus terminus, whether or  not  white\r\n\r\nlines  or yellow lines are drawn are flooded  with\r\n\r\nSBS  buses at night. This creates traffic  hazards\r\n\r\nto  some extent. I would like to ask whether  this\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  an infringement of the  rights  of\r\n\r\nother road users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh question is in regard to Jurong. In\r\n\r\nJurong  we  have  about 50,000  people.  At  least\r\n\r\n20,000  of  them work in the factories. There  are\r\n\r\nnot enough buses which ply between the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious  residential  areas  in  Jurong  and   the\r\n\r\nfactories. The number of buses operating in Jurong\r\n\r\nis  rather  small. The buses that come  to  Jurong\r\n\r\nfrom  the  City are usually full when  they  reach\r\n\r\nJurong.  So  the residents in Jurong cannot  board\r\n\r\nthese  buses.  I  would like to  ask  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  prepared to introduce  internal  bus\r\n\r\nservices  within  the Jurong  area  to  facilitate\r\n\r\ntravel between various areas in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eigth question is this: We know from the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of  the Ministry  of  Communications\r\n\r\nthat  the management of SBS is based on a clannish\r\n\r\nand   family-type  of  business.  Is  this  modern\r\n\r\nmanagement?  Should we not help it to  update  and\r\n\r\nmodernise  the  various styles and  techniques  of\r\n\r\nmanagement?   Perhaps  our  National  Productivity\r\n\r\nBoard could lend a helping hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth question is: has the Ministry audited\r\n\r\nor  examined  the accounts of SBS monthly  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether there is any irregularity in the accounts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is: If the SBS cannot carry out\r\n\r\nthe   instructions  given  by  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications,  for  example,  to  increase   the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  buses, will the Ministry withdraw  its\r\n\r\nlicence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since\r\n\r\nprevious  speakers  have taken their  \"bus  rides\"\r\n\r\nunder the Head of the Minister, I wonder whether I\r\n\r\nmay  be  allowed  to  join the  \"bus  ride\"  as  a\r\n\r\npassenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Thank you, Sir,In the past\r\n\r\nfew  days, I have listened with great interest  to\r\n\r\nthe  spirited  exchanges of views in the  diatribe\r\n\r\nbetween  the Minister for Communications  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kallang over the  pros  and  cons  of\r\n\r\nnationalisation  of  the  SBS.  To  my  mind,  the\r\n\r\nproblem of providing an efficient bus service does\r\n\r\nnot  hinge  on the fact whether it  is  run  as  a\r\n\r\nprivate  monopoly or a public concern.  Running  a\r\n\r\ncomplex  operation  to meet the increasing  demand\r\n\r\nand  higher  expectations of service by  commuters\r\n\r\ncalls for (1) well-qualified management\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonnel,   (2)  well-paid  and   contented   bus\r\n\r\ndrivers, conductors, mechanics, and so on, and (3)\r\n\r\nsufficient number of well-maintained buses  and  a\r\n\r\nhost of other things, to ensure the most efficient\r\n\r\nrunning  of the bus service. All these  must  mean\r\n\r\nadditional  cost. The question is:  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nservice do we want, and how much are we willing to\r\n\r\npay for the efficient service and comfort that  we\r\n\r\nexpect? And the important question is: how is this\r\n\r\nadditional cost to be met -by the commuters or  by\r\n\r\na  subsidy from the Government? The Government has\r\n\r\nalready made known that it will not subsidise  the\r\n\r\nrunning of the bus service. The Member for Kallang\r\n\r\nhas promised the Prime Minister yesterday that  he\r\n\r\nwill  move a motion on the public transport system\r\n\r\nin Singapore. I will therefore reserve my comments\r\n\r\non  whether  the Government should or  should  not\r\n\r\nsubsidise  public transport when Parliament  meets\r\n\r\nto  discuss the motion that the Member for Kallang\r\n\r\nintends to table before this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, let me add my bit of confusion\r\n\r\nto  the  already confused state of affairs in  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport system. The former STC collapsed\r\n\r\nsimply  because of poor management. The SBS  might\r\n\r\nalso collapse one of these days simply because  of\r\n\r\nlack   of   management  expertise.   The   present\r\n\r\nmanagement of the SBS, which is nothing more  than\r\n\r\nan  unholy  alliance of three parties  drawn  from\r\n\r\nthree  former  bus  companies  is  accustomed   to\r\n\r\nrunning  small  operations  and  is  not  used  to\r\n\r\nrunning a bus transport service on a scale of  the\r\n\r\nSBS.  What worries me is that, with all the public\r\n\r\ncriticisms  levelled  against  the  SBS  and   the\r\n\r\ninability of SBS to run a viable business  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  at  the same time a cheap and comfortable\r\n\r\nservice demanded by the travelling public, we  may\r\n\r\njust  witness the collapse of another bus  company\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. The present management personnel of\r\n\r\nSBS are just ordinary businessmen whose motive  is\r\n\r\nto   make  money.  Most  businessmen  like  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness  with  good  profit returns  and  without\r\n\r\nbeing   subjected   to   public   criticisms   and\r\n\r\nGovernment constraints. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  SBS  is  subjected  to  Government\r\n\r\nconstraints  such as the rate of  profit  returns,\r\n\r\netc.,  as  well as public criticisms. It  may  not\r\n\r\nsurvive  under  such  hostile conditions  and  may\r\n\r\ndecide  to  fold  up. The wish of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKallang  to  attend the funeral rites of  SBS  may\r\n\r\njust  come  true. As the lyrics of a popular  song\r\n\r\ngo:  \"What  then,  my love?\", I wish  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  \"What  then, Mr  Minister?\",  when  the\r\n\r\npresent SBS management gives up the ghost,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak. There will be a lot of wailing and gnashing\r\n\r\nof  teeth at the Communications Ministry, and also\r\n\r\nat  the  Labour Ministry because the  bus  workers\r\n\r\nwill   be  concerned  over  their  jobs.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore earnestly urge the Minister to treat, as\r\n\r\na  matter  of priority, the question of developing\r\n\r\nthe  necessary management expertise and  personnel\r\n\r\nin  his  Ministry  as  well as  assisting  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  such expertise and  personnel  in\r\n\r\nSBS,  as  a  necessary  precaution  to  abort  any\r\n\r\npossibility of a total breakdown of the  transport\r\n\r\nservice.  The development of management expertise,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  long-term point of view, is a necessary\r\n\r\nadjunct to an efficient transport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public confidence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, over\r\n\r\nthe  handling of the bus problems in Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen   shaken  simply  because  there  have   been\r\n\r\nfrequent   changes  and  shifting   of   policies.\r\n\r\nCommuters,  being  human,  do  not  like  to  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  having  to  adjust  and  re-adjust  to\r\n\r\nfrequent  changes of timetables and bus routes.  I\r\n\r\nwould therefore urge the Minister to minimise  the\r\n\r\nchanges in bus routes, time-tables, etc.,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake such changes only after very careful planning\r\n\r\nand assessment of the impact of such changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to the Minister, since the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of   the  supplementary   transport\r\n\r\nscheme, the bus service has improved. As a  matter\r\n\r\nof fact, a letter was published in the man-in-the-street   column   of  a  local   paper   yesterday\r\n\r\nexpressing satisfaction over the new arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Everybody else has got  into\r\n\r\nthe bus. It is about time I got in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Moulmein has pointed out,\r\n\r\nin  the past few days we have heard so much  about\r\n\r\nthe   inefficient   public   transport   services.\r\n\r\nComplaints were made against the SBS, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Communications, and even the commuters and bus\r\n\r\nemployees.  I  am  not going to touch  on  similar\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications, Sir, has\r\n\r\ncategorically  stated that the Government  has  no\r\n\r\nintention   of  taking  over  the  bus   transport\r\n\r\nservice. I am not going to pursue the matter as  I\r\n\r\ntoo am not in favour of the Government taking over\r\n\r\nthe  SBS. However, Sir, the Minister admitted that\r\n\r\npublic transport is a public utility, and as  such\r\n\r\nit  is the intention of the Government to see that\r\n\r\nwe  have a reasonable public transport service  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fear that from what we know of the\r\n\r\nfinancial  position of SBS, I have no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe SBS will not be able to introduce the required\r\n\r\nnumber  of  new  buses into  the  service  in  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future. In this respect, I welcome the\r\n\r\nsupplementary  lorry-bus  service  which  utilises\r\n\r\nschool   buses  and  goods  vehicles  for   public\r\n\r\ntransport.  I  also  agree  with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  that the commuter transport  system  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  relief  somewhat  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the supplementary service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the heated argument about public\r\n\r\ntransport  in the last few days, we have forgotten\r\n\r\nto  consider  the difficulties faced  by  the  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers   in  Singapore.  We  were  busy  accusing\r\n\r\neverybody.  Sir, since the reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nbus  services, the distance between terminals  has\r\n\r\nbeen  lengthened. As a result, the bus driver  now\r\n\r\nhas  to  drive a longer distance than he was  used\r\n\r\nto. This is not easy for him. Nobody would dispute\r\n\r\nwith  me if I say that driving in Singapore,  with\r\n\r\nroad congestions, is no welcome proposition. Those\r\n\r\nof  us  who drive to office would testify to  that\r\n\r\nfact. What makes it worse for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbus driver is driving an old rickety bus over long\r\n\r\ndistances,  with frequent stops,  going  into  and\r\n\r\nsteering  out of bus bays, changing gears hundreds\r\n\r\nof times during a journey. This can be killing for\r\n\r\nthe bus drivers. Can we really blame the driver if\r\n\r\nat  times  he loses his temper? I lose  my  temper\r\n\r\nhundreds of times driving in our congested  roads,\r\n\r\nand I do not drive as often as the bus driver.  He\r\n\r\nis  on the road for as much as 10 hours a day.  It\r\n\r\nis  about time that we replaced new buses equipped\r\n\r\nwith  automatic  transmission and power  steering.\r\n\r\nLet  me hasten to add, Sir, that this is going  to\r\n\r\ncost the SBS more, and it is not going to be well-received,   considering  the  additional   finance\r\n\r\nrequired. But at the same time, I am glad to hear,\r\n\r\nSir, that the jumbo buses introduced recently  are\r\n\r\nequipped with power steering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we accept that public transport is a public\r\n\r\nutility,  and we are satisfied that SBS  does  not\r\n\r\nhave  sufficient  capital  to  provide  reasonable\r\n\r\ncommuter   transport  services,  and   they   need\r\n\r\nimprovement.  I would therefore suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  look  into the possibility  of  either\r\n\r\nproviding  tax  relief to the SBS  in  order  that\r\n\r\nadditional  funds  may be made available  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase of new buses. Or if this is not accepted,\r\n\r\nthen   the   Government  should  look   into   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  providing  soft  loans  for   the\r\n\r\npurchase of new vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Does the Member want the Government\r\n\r\nto support the SBS?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

It is commonly known that the SBS is a one-man  show. Sir, is it true that whenever there  is\r\n\r\nany  problem between the SBS and the workers,  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  threatens to throw in  the  towel?  If\r\n\r\nthis  is  true,  then I fear we are  in  for  more\r\n\r\ndifficult times in respect of public transport  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have\r\n\r\nyour permission to jump on the buses too?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about the public\r\n\r\ntransport system in Singapore, especially over the\r\n\r\nlast  two  weeks and this evening by many Members.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the discussions were centred around  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  the  public transport  system  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the provision of more buses  on  the\r\n\r\nroad,   less   breakdown  of   buses,   Government\r\n\r\ntakeover,  etc. The Minister has given answers  to\r\n\r\nall these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also other aspects which have a\r\n\r\ncumulative  effect  in  the deterioration  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport system. I would like  with  your\r\n\r\npermission, Sir, to elaborate on them, and  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether he intends to adopt some  of\r\n\r\nmy  suggestions  or give reasons as  to  why  they\r\n\r\ncannot be adopted or utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there is this business of commuter\r\n\r\ndiscipline. I would not go into the sordid details\r\n\r\nof  the  law  of the jungle that persists  at  bus\r\n\r\nstops  during the rush-hour. Unless some  commuter\r\n\r\ndiscipline  is  introduced,  it  will  be  utterly\r\n\r\nimpossible  for  the  public transport  system  to\r\n\r\nimprove.  I  would  like to know  what  plans  the\r\n\r\nMinister    has   to   introduce   this   commuter\r\n\r\ndiscipline, and when will it be introduced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the matter of strengthening worker\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  The  workers  on  the  public   buses\r\n\r\nsometimes  adopt a devil-may-care  attitude.  Some\r\n\r\nconductors treat commuters rather shabbily and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  drivers  skid along the roads  at  breakneck\r\n\r\nspeeds  emulating  grand  -prix  drivers,  causing\r\n\r\ngrave danger to the bus commuters, pedestrians and\r\n\r\nother motor vehicles. On more than one occasion, I\r\n\r\nhave  noticed buses moving off bus stops when  all\r\n\r\nthe  passengers have yet to alight.  I  have  even\r\n\r\nseen  many  a passenger with hardly a toe-hold  on\r\n\r\nthe  bus  hanging on precariously  for  dear  life\r\n\r\nbecause to hang on is the lesser evil than to jump\r\n\r\noff  as the bus rockets from the bus stop ignoring\r\n\r\ncommuters' safety. Time and again the buses do not\r\n\r\nuse the special lanes constructed for them at some\r\n\r\nbus  stops. This not only causes great  danger  on\r\n\r\nthe   road  but  also  sparks  off  a  race  among\r\n\r\ncommuters who dash towards the bus in forlorn hope\r\n\r\nthat they may get a place on the bus, and be early\r\n\r\nfor work or an appointment. I am sure the Minister\r\n\r\nis  working  closely with SILO to strengthen  this\r\n\r\nworker discipline, and I would like to know of the\r\n\r\nplans  which  are afoot to obtain  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is also tied up with the workers\r\n\r\nand  plans  to  improve their working  conditions.\r\n\r\nWorking  conditions are tied up with  occupational\r\n\r\nhealth  and  safety,  and I am  wondering  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister is taking into consideration that fatigue\r\n\r\nand boredom can be potent causes of accidents. One\r\n\r\nof  the  disadvantages of modern  driving  is  the\r\n\r\nboredom  produced  in  many drivers.  Fatigue  can\r\n\r\naccentuate boredom and boredom can feed  `fatigue.\r\n\r\nIs  there any plan by the Minister to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe workers are adequately protected from this?  I\r\n\r\nmust  stress that particular attention  should  be\r\n\r\npaid  to general working conditions to ensure that\r\n\r\nbus   drivers  do  not  suffer  from  fatigue  and\r\n\r\nboredom. Some of the things to be looked for would\r\n\r\nbe  to  have controls readily accessible and dials\r\n\r\nof instruments in constant view without the driver\r\n\r\nhaving  to change his position. The driver's  seat\r\n\r\nmust  be comfortable and adjustable backwards  and\r\n\r\nforwards,  and upwards and downwards,  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  individual  variation of the  length  of  the\r\n\r\ndriver's legs and body height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the back of the seat must  be  shaped\r\n\r\nto  provide adequate support to the lumbar region.\r\n\r\nAutomatic  gears,  and power-assisted  brakes  and\r\n\r\nsteering assist the reduction of physical  fatigue\r\n\r\nin  drivers. Attention should also be paid to  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  to  limit total driving time  for  each\r\n\r\nshift and to ensure that individual spells of duty\r\n\r\nare  not too long. Furthermore short breaks should\r\n\r\nbe allowed within each spell of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to combat boredom the morale of drivers\r\n\r\nmust be kept high by providing sources of pride in\r\n\r\ntheir jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to stress that drivers should\r\n\r\nreceive  pre-employment  medical  examination  and\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  examined  routinely  at  regular\r\n\r\nintervals,  with  increasing  frequency   as   age\r\n\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the display boards on buses are too\r\n\r\nsmall.  One can see many a commuter squinting  his\r\n\r\neyes  as  he tries to discern the number on  these\r\n\r\ndisplay  boards to ensure that he flags  down  the\r\n\r\nright bus. At night, due to the dimunitive size of\r\n\r\nthe   board,   the  darkness  and   the   blinding\r\n\r\nheadlights  of the bus, it is impossible  to  flag\r\n\r\ndown  the  right bus. Many a commuter  flags  down\r\n\r\nevery bus until he gets lucky. This irritates  the\r\n\r\nbus  drivers and causes unnecessary time  loss.  I\r\n\r\nwill  just leave it to your imagination, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nunmentionable words these irritated  drivers  use.\r\n\r\nIs  the Minister taking steps to increase the size\r\n\r\nof  these  boards and the size of the  numbers  on\r\n\r\nthem?  Will the Minister also consider  making  it\r\n\r\nobligatory  for  all buses to display,  in  words,\r\n\r\ntheir exact destinations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the Minister to\r\n\r\ngive  more  publicity to the monthly tickets  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  obtained by commuters from  the  SBS.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  these  monthly tickets can  be  obtained\r\n\r\nonly at the SBS office in Changi. There should  be\r\n\r\nprovision for these monthly tickets to be obtained\r\n\r\nfrom all bus terminals. These monthly tickets will\r\n\r\ncut  down  to  a certain extent both commuter  and\r\n\r\nconductor inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since\r\n\r\nsome  Members  have  taken  pre-emptive  steps  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  whether  SBS  should  or  should  not  be\r\n\r\nnationalised,  I wish to join in at this  juncture\r\n\r\njust to make my stand quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have questioned the wisdom of Government's\r\n\r\npolicy in allowing a private monopoly to control a\r\n\r\npublic  service.  It  is  my  conviction  that  to\r\n\r\nachieve   a  desirable  social  objective   public\r\n\r\ntransportation  must  be  in  the  hands  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment either in its own hands or jointly with\r\n\r\nprivate  individuals or groups. Pragmatism  should\r\n\r\nnot   go   beyond  the  point  where  it  counters\r\n\r\nachieving  a desirable socialist objective.  Carry\r\n\r\non  supervising and improving the present  service\r\n\r\nas  much as possible, but what I am interested  is\r\n\r\nwhether  or not public transportation will finally\r\n\r\nbe  in  public hands and, if not now, will  it  be\r\n\r\nlater or never at all? I will always disagree with\r\n\r\nthe  Government if nationalisation never comes  at\r\n\r\nall.  The  formation of a strong Government-backed\r\n\r\ncorporation  will  ensure  the  job  security   of\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  conductors.  They  will  always   be\r\n\r\nneeded.  There  is  no  fear  that  they  will  be\r\n\r\njobless. I am sure the interest of the public will\r\n\r\nbe taken into account. That is what the Government\r\n\r\nis  for. Public transportation is a public utility\r\n\r\nand  must  be run as a service. The administration\r\n\r\nand  operation  of  the service will  be  directly\r\n\r\naccountable to Parliament. Now we are debating the\r\n\r\nadministration and operation of a private company.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  the  Ministry of Communications,  at\r\n\r\nleast  through the ROV, had gone to the extent  of\r\n\r\nsupervising  the administration and  operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  SBS,  made policy statements, authorised  the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  bus fares, so much so  that  it  has\r\n\r\ngiven  us  the opportunity to attack  the  SBS  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  If it had not been so, I  would  have\r\n\r\nfound it most difficult to discuss the affairs  of SBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never proposed that as a firm condition\r\n\r\nthe bus service should be directly subsidised. The\r\n\r\npoint  I  have  taken up is:  should  the  SBS  be\r\n\r\nnationalised? That is, should the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  over  the rights and interests of  the  SBS?\r\n\r\nSubsidy is another thing. If you have to subsidise\r\n\r\na public service, if there is a necessity to bring\r\n\r\nabout  reasonable standards and efficiency, it  is\r\n\r\nup  to  the  Government, the Parliament,  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  to decide. Taking the rights and interests\r\n\r\nof SBS is the point I wish to make at this moment.\r\n\r\nWhether  or not we will debate on public transport\r\n\r\nat  great length, and whether or not it should  be\r\n\r\nnationalised, I think we all look forward to  that\r\n\r\nday, if it is all the more necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, even if we go on debating\r\n\r\nuntil the cows come home, I do not believe that we\r\n\r\ncan  really  force the issue asking the Government\r\n\r\nto nationalise or to take over the SBS. We are all\r\n\r\nvery satisfied with the Government's reply that it\r\n\r\nhas  got  no intention of taking over  nor  is  it\r\n\r\nbacking the SBS. The only way we can put the issue\r\n\r\nto  a  test is to hold a referendum to see whether\r\n\r\nthe bus service should be run by the Government or\r\n\r\nwhether  it  should be in the hands of  a  private\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just a few\r\n\r\npoints.

This  stands  in\r\n\r\nrather  violent  contrast to the  experience  that\r\n\r\npeople  have  had and are still having  when  they\r\n\r\ntravel on the SBS. The improvement has really come\r\n\r\nfrom  this competition, and commuters now  have  a\r\n\r\nchance of choosing and the choice is an indication\r\n\r\nof a vote against the SBS, so to speak. Now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have the ability of saying: \"We do not  want\r\n\r\nto  travel  by  the SBS if we have  a  chance.

Perhaps   the\r\n\r\nresponse has not been adequate so far because  the\r\n\r\nincentives  for people to come in and compete  are\r\n\r\nnot  adequate.

I think that if we want\r\n\r\nto  be kind, we have got to be cruel. But, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, if commuters want to jump  down  at  a\r\n\r\nroad   junction,  i.e, if  they  want   to   kill\r\n\r\nthemselves, I think legislation has also got to be\r\n\r\nmade  to punish them so that they are disciplined.\r\n\r\nThe improvement has got to be all round.

May I give an explanation  on\r\n\r\nthe  sad state of these buses, which I would  call\r\n\r\n\"hippie buses\" of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, 1973, the Registrar of Vehicles was\r\n\r\ninstructed  to  hold discussions with  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board (PUB) on the possibility  of  SBS\r\n\r\nbeing allowed to use hosed water from PUB mains to\r\n\r\nwash  buses. The PUB stated that it is its general\r\n\r\npolicy  that washing of motor vehicles with  hosed\r\n\r\nwater from PUB mains should not be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was observed that refuse vehicles of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment were  hosed  down\r\n\r\nwith  water  from  PUB  mains  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nTransport  Centres, at Mackenzie  Road,  Henderson\r\n\r\nRoad  and Tannery Lane. It was explained  that  if\r\n\r\nthese  refuse vehicles were not hosed down  daily,\r\n\r\nthey would be too dirty and evil-smelling to go on\r\n\r\nthe roads. A request was made to PUB for a similar\r\n\r\nexception in the case of the public bus fleet,  as\r\n\r\nthe  man-hours  and operational  cost  of  washing\r\n\r\npublic buses, by hand from buckets of water, for a\r\n\r\nfleet  of  1,400 operational buses would be  high,\r\n\r\nbesides being ineffective in view\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof oil and grease.

Studies  are\r\n\r\nalso  being conducted to install water reclamation\r\n\r\nsystems in these plants to recycle the water  used\r\n\r\nin the washing to reduce the amount of water used.\r\n\r\nThe cost of mechanical washing equipment would  be\r\n\r\nabout $40,000 for each washing bay and about 10 of\r\n\r\nthese  would  be  required at various  depots.  In\r\n\r\nother words, a sum of $400,000 would be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS has also commissioned its architects to put\r\n\r\nup  plans  for  a  washing depot at  Jurong  where\r\n\r\nindustrial water is available. But it would not be\r\n\r\noperationally  feasible to set  up  a  centralised\r\n\r\nwashing  depot at Jurong for the entire  fleet  of\r\n\r\n1,400  or  more  buses. Depots for  washing  buses\r\n\r\nwould  also have to be located in areas not served\r\n\r\nby  industrial water. If industrial water is to be\r\n\r\nused  at these other depots, the water would  have\r\n\r\nto  be transported in bowsers, each of which would\r\n\r\ncost  $40,000  to $50,000. Storage tanks  for  the\r\n\r\nwater would also have to be built at each depot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of equipment for cleaning the passenger\r\n\r\ncompartments  is also being studied, besides  just\r\n\r\ngetting people to clean up with brooms and so  on.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  washing and cleaning of buses is  fully\r\n\r\nmechanised   and   the  present  inefficient   and\r\n\r\nlaborious system of washing buses with buckets  of\r\n\r\nwater is dispensed with, the fleet of public buses\r\n\r\nwill certainly not do injustice to our clean city.\r\n\r\nBut  until then would Members of the House  please\r\n\r\ntolerate our \"hippie buses\" on the road?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much criticism has been voiced by bus\r\n\r\ncommuters  and now even by my colleagues,  Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House,  over the present  state  of  our\r\n\r\npublic  bus  service.

Is  this  the panacea  to  our  transport\r\n\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was, in fact, one of the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe  Commission of Enquiry set up  by  the  former\r\n\r\nLabour   Front  Government  in  1955,  under   the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of Mr L C Hawkins, a member  of  the\r\n\r\nLondon  Transport Executive. Even  if  the  former\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  Government had wanted to  implement\r\n\r\nthis  proposal, it could not have done so  because\r\n\r\nSingapore's reserves had been run down to  such  a\r\n\r\nlow  level,  and  there was  no  second  Christmas\r\n\r\nIsland to be sold to Australia to find the tens of\r\n\r\nmillions  of dollars which would have been  needed\r\n\r\nto nationalise the bus companies then operating in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the People's Action Party assumed the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  Singapore in 1959, nationalisation\r\n\r\nof  bus companies was not one of its platforms and\r\n\r\nrightly so, even to this day!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then,  may  I repeat, in the year 1974,  15  years\r\n\r\nlater, it is also not its policy.

Together with the\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Company, they ran the scheduled\r\n\r\nbus services from the time the new routings became\r\n\r\neffective in April 1971 until the end of the year,\r\n\r\nwhen  operational difficulties forced the  STC  to\r\n\r\ncease  operations  and its vehicles  and  services\r\n\r\nwere taken over by the three remaining companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968 there were less than 1,200 buses in\r\n\r\nscheduled service; of these 60 per cent were  more\r\n\r\nthan ten years old, and 28 per cent were more than\r\n\r\n16  years old. The goal of 2,000 buses, set in the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  for  1973, was  reached  in  April\r\n\r\n1972. Only one quarter of the fleet was then  more\r\n\r\nthan 10 years old, and less than ten per cent  had\r\n\r\nbeen  in  service longer than 16 years. They  were\r\n\r\noperating on 141 routes, as shown for each company\r\n\r\nin  Figure  2-10,  at headways varying  from  four\r\n\r\nminutes  to one hour.

This was envisaged in para. 4.2 of  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper which reads as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The ideal situation would be to have just one\r\n\r\nsingle  Road Transport Authority, so that the  bus\r\n\r\ncommuter need pay only once and be able to  travel\r\n\r\non  any  service  or  services,  speedily  to  his\r\n\r\ndestination,  with  the  minimum  change  of  bus,\r\n\r\nwherever possible.

There have been suggestions that\r\n\r\nthe  Government nationalise the bus companies  and\r\n\r\nsubsidise the commuter. But what happens when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  nationalises a company which  has  not\r\n\r\nyet    got   institutionalised   management,   and\r\n\r\ncorruption  on  a  scale  rampant  in  the  former\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Company inevitably results?

Sir, I submit once  again  that  in\r\n\r\nreturn  for  all  the  incentives  that  Singapore\r\n\r\noffers  to  \"flag  of  convenience\"  ships,   such\r\n\r\nregistration brings no benefit to Singapore at all\r\n\r\nother  than perhaps the dubious prestige of having\r\n\r\nits  name appearing in the Lloyd's Register  as  a\r\n\r\ncountry with a sizable shipping tonnage. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink that we should get into the Register at  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  getting ourselves associated and  lumped\r\n\r\ntogether  with countries such as Panama,  Liberia,\r\n\r\nSomalia  and  Honduras, which  are  our  notorious\r\n\r\npredecessors in allowing their flags to be lightly\r\n\r\nused by shipowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned during the Budget debate,\r\n\r\nships registered under the flag of a country  need\r\n\r\nnot have to call at a port of the country of their\r\n\r\nnominal   flag,   not   even   for   the   initial\r\n\r\nregistration at all. Many of the ships  registered\r\n\r\nunder \"flag of convenience\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  continue to sail the seven seas  but  without\r\n\r\never touching the shores of the country whose flag\r\n\r\nthe  ships are flying. The foreign ship-owners  of\r\n\r\nvessels  presently registered under the  Singapore\r\n\r\nflag are birds of passage, who would not have  the\r\n\r\nslightest  hesitation of changing to another  flag\r\n\r\nof registration if there arc better pickings to be\r\n\r\nmade  under the new flag. I mentioned this, and  I\r\n\r\nrepeat,  that Singapore's good name and  its  flag\r\n\r\nare being tarnished if we continue to tolerate the\r\n\r\npractice of \"flag of convenience\" registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the registration of foreign vessels under\r\n\r\nSingapore  flag, the owners only need  to  hire  a\r\n\r\ndesk-space and the use of an office address.  They\r\n\r\nneed  not employ Singapore crew. Many of  them  do\r\n\r\nnot.  They employ crew which is known as \"crew  of\r\n\r\nconvenience.\" In other words, they register  ships\r\n\r\nhere  which need not come to Singapore shores  and\r\n\r\nneed not employ local crew. Even if the ships call\r\n\r\nat  Singapore regularly, the ship-owners can still\r\n\r\nemploy  foreign crew openly and with the  blessing\r\n\r\nof the Director of Marine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be claimed that the \"flag of convenience\"\r\n\r\nhas the same effect on organised seamen just as  a\r\n\r\nred  rag is commonly supposed to incite a bull.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  deny  that trade unions, particularly  of\r\n\r\nseamen,  have  very strong views on and  are  very\r\n\r\nfirmly   opposed  to  the  \"flag  of  convenience\"\r\n\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look at the problem in as an\r\n\r\nobjective  manner as we can. On the  one  hand  we\r\n\r\nhave the following disadvantages: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nothing much, if anything at all, is gained\r\n\r\nby  Singapore by way of foreign exchange either as\r\n\r\ninvestment   or  earnings.  The  investment   that\r\n\r\naccrues  to Singapore upon registration is  wholly\r\n\r\nor  mostly  tied  up  with  the  ships  which  are\r\n\r\nextremely  mobile.  Although flag  of  convenience\r\n\r\nships  are required to maintain a business address\r\n\r\nin Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir actual operational office is situated\r\n\r\nelsewhere to which their earnings are remitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nwants an answer from the Minister, could he please\r\n\r\nmake his speech short?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, that is why I did not\r\n\r\nmove my previous amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Flag of convenience ships do not have to\r\n\r\nemploy  Singapore seamen, irrespective of  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are union members or not. And if such  ships\r\n\r\ntake  on foreign seamen there i5 no assurance that\r\n\r\nthe  ships  will  observe  Singapore's  provisions\r\n\r\ngoverning  safety  of ships. The odium  associated\r\n\r\nwith  the loss of life, of property in the sinking\r\n\r\nof  a \"coffin\" ship registered under the Singapore\r\n\r\nflag may outweigh whatever the benefit of allowing\r\n\r\nflag of convenience registration to Singapore.  If\r\n\r\nmost  flag  of convenience ships do  not  call  at\r\n\r\nSingapore  there  is  no means  for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nensure    that   they   observe   certain   safety\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Having a large fleet of flag of convenience\r\n\r\nvessels  does not mean our exporters and importers\r\n\r\nwould be able to obtain concessions on the freight\r\n\r\nof  goods  to and from Singapore as these  vessels\r\n\r\nwould  be  either  tied to  one  of  the  shipping\r\n\r\nconferences  or  be interested in making  as  much\r\n\r\nprofit as they possibly can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Our Port may not even benefit from the flag\r\n\r\nof  convenience ships which may never have  called\r\n\r\nat Singapore at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against all these disadvantages, we have (1) the\r\n\r\ndubious  prestige of a nation with  a  substantial\r\n\r\nmercantile  navy whose individual ship-owners  and\r\n\r\nmasters may not even know where Singapore is,  and\r\n\r\n(2)  the revenue from the taxation on the earnings\r\n\r\nof   the  vessels.  If  the  skill  of  land-based\r\n\r\nenterprises   in   avoiding   taxation   is    any\r\n\r\nindication,  the  revenue  from  this  source  can\r\n\r\nhardly amount to much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  our  Registry can be  seen  from  the\r\n\r\ntonnage figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> What for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Just to tell the Member that we\r\n\r\ndo  derive  benefits from it by knowing  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened in a short period. In 1968, we had on our\r\n\r\nregister  253,000 tons and on 28th  February  this\r\n\r\nyear,  we  have more than 2.85 million gross  tons\r\n\r\nregistered in our Registry. What does this mean in\r\n\r\nterms  of  benefits to us? First, we come  to  the\r\n\r\nactual revenue which the Member mentioned was  not\r\n\r\nmuch.  In 1971, the revenue was $885,000. In 1972,\r\n\r\nit  was  $2.33  million. That is in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nactual revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about other advantages that we have derived\r\n\r\nfrom this registry of ships? We must remember that\r\n\r\nwe  have a port which is the fourth largest in the\r\n\r\nworld\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserving  ships  of many nations and equipped  with\r\n\r\nfacilities for cellular container ships.  Then  we\r\n\r\nhave shipping and ship-repair industry which is  a\r\n\r\nvery  substantial  industry.  We  also  have   the\r\n\r\nnational  shipping line providing liner and  other\r\n\r\nshipping  services.  In addition,  we  have  local\r\n\r\nshipping  companies,  some  of  them  are   owning\r\n\r\nsubstantial fleets. Then we have a whole range  of\r\n\r\nassociated activities from ship-breaking to  ship-chandlering,  ship  insurance,  financing,   legal\r\n\r\nservices,  inland transport services, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAll  these  are  various aspects of  the  shipping\r\n\r\nindustry and the registry of ships is part of this\r\n\r\nsystem.  Viewed  in  this  broader  context,   the\r\n\r\nRegistry can be seen to play a role in helping  to\r\n\r\npromote  Singapore as a shipping centre. The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  earnings of Singapore-registered  ships\r\n\r\nare  exempt  `from Singapore income tax  may  make\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions more  willing  to  provide\r\n\r\ncredit   facilities   particularly   against   the\r\n\r\nsecurity   of  firm  period  charters  since   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of changes in tax level  is  removed.\r\n\r\nOwners  of Singapore flag ships may then  find  it\r\n\r\neasier  to  get  access  to financing  from  local\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions.

The first question is  on\r\n\r\nthe  taxi service at the Paya Lebar Airport.  Many\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  the Airport had a system  of  permits\r\n\r\nwhich  were  issued to taxis to  ply  between  the\r\n\r\nairport  and  the  city. Only those  with  permits\r\n\r\ncould  enter the precincts of the airport to  pick\r\n\r\nup  passengers.  The number of  taxis  which  were\r\n\r\ngiven  permits were selected from a  few  thousand\r\n\r\napplications.  Selection was  done  by  the  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation Department, the Registry of Vehicles, the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  and so on. With  this  system  of\r\n\r\npermits,  I  am  afraid there is quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nconfusion at the airport at present. The reason is\r\n\r\nthat  there is inadequate control. However,  there\r\n\r\nare also some taxis plying between the airport and\r\n\r\nthe city without permits. This defeats the purpose\r\n\r\nof  issuing permits. I would like the Minister  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member for Sembawang wants\r\n\r\nan  answer from the Minister, he will have to stop\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, I need only half a\r\n\r\nminute more.

But there are taxi stands  for  only\r\n\r\nabout  20-odd  taxis at the airport  precincts.  I\r\n\r\nthink this number is not enough. I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider whether the number  of  taxi\r\n\r\nstands could be increased at Paya Lebar Airport in\r\n\r\norder  to  improve  the service  provided  by  the\r\n\r\ntaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P.
