I would be happy to provide them to the Member for Chua Chu Kang if he should so require. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that in two separate accidents recently, two cars split into two? Does this mean that those makes of cars meet with the required safety standards? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, those two accidents had nothing to do with pollution. Immediately after the accidents, ROV and the Traffic Police carried out detailed investigations. The investigations suggest that the accidents occurred at extremely high speeds at the point of impact. ROV had caused technical teams from the manufacturers to come to Singapore to study the accidents and to report on them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The manufacturers have carried out detailed investigations, including a re-enactment of the accident, and their technical reports suggest that the two accidents occurred with relative velocities in excess of 90 km per hour and 110 km per hour respectively. Preliminary studies of the reports that have been submitted to the ROV have given us indications that the vehicles met the safety standards that are internationally accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the lesson that one can draw from these accidents is that motorists should drive safely and keep to the traffic rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister comment whether this split-up of the vehicle is in fact a safety feature designed, during an accident, on impact, to release the occupants so as to save them from fatal injuries, like a fighter aircraft ejecting its pilot in the event of an accident? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when an accident occurs with impact velocities in the region of 100 km per hour, very serious damage can occur to a vehicle. In the two particular incidents under discussion, the force applied to the vehicles was at an angle at the point of impact. This resulted in very serious shearing mechanical forces and caused the metal as well as the welding to tear. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how high is the passing rate of vehicles tested by VICOM. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, all vehicles have got to meet the standards set by ROV. Many of them do not pass on the first occasion, but upon servicing, repair and re-inspection, they pass. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question for the Acting Minister, and that is about the lead content in petrol. I asked this about two years ago. I want to know whether the Ministry is doing anything about it because the lead content, as the Minister is probably aware, has been determined as a health hazard. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the question bears no relevance to the subject under discussion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it has something to do with pollution control, Dr Yeo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the standard for lead content in the petrol used in Singapore has been decreased progressively and this subject will continue to be under study. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, could the technical report in question be made public? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see no need for this particular technical report to be made public because this report has been made to the ROV by the manufacturers and it may contain proprietary information. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, it is for the good and for the interest of the motoring public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, if an accident occurs at very high speed, one can expect all kinds of damage. In other countries it has been observed that much more extensive damage occurs in accidents on freeways and expressways. And these occur whenever people do not obey traffic rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am interested in the Minister saying that there was a re-enactment of the accidents. I just wonder whether he would let us know how that was conducted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many manufacturers of motor vehicles have extensive laboratories at their home base. Many of them also have test facilities where they have vehicles crashing at different angles and at different speeds. These accidents, which have been carefully designed, are then photographed with high-speed cameras and measurements made after the accident. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>2.40 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SUPPLY BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to provide for the issue from the Consolidated Fun?

In 1969, Professor Sasaki, a Japanese expert in Physical Education, visited Singapore to study our school physical education programme. Among some of his observations of our school children, he noted that they were not getting enough strenuous exercise. Many of our school fields were empty compared with Japanese school fields. He also commented: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Compared to Japanese children, there are many slim boys and girls in Singapore.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>He was referring to their thin arms and legs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in 1969, 15 years ago. Today, with better diet, our children are not as slim as when Professor Sasaki saw them. But the need for a proper physical education programme in our schools continues to exist. The need is not only to improve \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the physical fitness of our urban flat-dwelling children and to prepare the boys to be more fit for National Service. Good physical education would improve overall the health of our people and cut down on our national health cost. The recreational and social aspects of physical education would have far-reaching benefits as our society becomes more affluent and can afford leisure activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Sasaki recommended that a physical education college should be set up to train full-time physical education teachers if we wanted to give physical education its due priority in our schools. Unfortunately, we had many other more pressing matters in education in the years after the Sasaki report. However, three years ago, we decided to address the problem of physical education and to give it due priority in our schools. Our major constraint is not enough qualified physical education teachers. At present, we have only 60 physical education teachers who have undergone full-time courses overseas. A well-run physical education programme in our secondary schools and junior colleges alone would require 700 full-time physical education teachers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this need, my Ministry has decided to set up a College of Physical Education. An autonomous college would be able to focus its full attention on all aspects of physical education. It will not only be training teachers for our schools. It will also be working with bodies such as the Singapore Armed Forces, the Singapore Sports Council, the People's Association and the Police to meet their physical education manpower needs. As leisure needs in Singapore increase in the future, it is conceivable that coaches, sports club administrators and others will be in demand. The Physical Education College would have a growing role as a centre for training and research. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planning for the new Physical Education College is in an advanced stage and key personnel have been appointed. The first intake of about 50 students will take place in July this year. The College will be located at the Institute of Education campus at Bukit Timah Road with which it will be sharing facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Institute of Education Act are to enable the Institute of Education Council to establish autonomous colleges such as the Physical Education College in addition to the Institute of Education. The college or colleges will be directly responsible to the Institute of Education Council and the head of the college will be a member of the council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken at this time to move several other amendments to the Institute of Education Act, the most important of which is the composition of the membership of the Institute of Education Council. The amendment allows the Minister in charge of the Institute of Education to appoint members in their personal capacity instead of the present provisions in which members are appointed as representatives of specific organizations. This will give more flexibility to the Minister to appoint members to the Institute of Education Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments will not in any way affect the powers of the Institute of Education Council nor the position of the Director of the Institute of Education as the Head of the Statutory Organization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>2.50 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my main purpose in rising to speak on this Bill is really to ask for a clarification and for an assurance from the Minister of State for Education who has moved the Second Reading of this Bill. He said that the main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the setting up of a College of Physical Education to train teachers for physical education of pupils in schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Act, Mr Speaker, Sir, in outlining the object and the purpose of the Institute Council has something to this effect - that it shall provide courses of study for the training of teachers in all fields of education. The amendment now is that it should provide training of teachers and other persons in the various fields of sports and education. I have two observations to make on this. Sports, as I understand it, is wider than physical education. The Minister says the whole object \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is to try and provide teachers for the teaching of physical education in schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I am a bit curious as to why sports would appear, from this provision in the Act, to rank a greater priority than education. As I said, the present Act talks about \"in all fields and at all levels of education.\" I should have thought the setting up of the College (of Physical Education) would have come within that objective. But we now have an amendment to bring in sports, and sports is mentioned before education. Are we to understand that the Ministry now proposes to divert a lot of its attention to sports rather than the education of our children? We have seen reports in the papers of the Minister of State visiting schools to inspect latrines to see that they are kept clean. That, may I suggest, is not really the purpose of the Ministry of Education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we to understand now that the Ministry is turning its attention to training our children, not educating them but training them for the various sports? May we have that assurance that the objective of the Ministry of Education which is to educate our children will not be lost sight of in this objective of sports and physical education? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson has a very narrow view of education. We take a much wider view of education in which we believe that education embraces all curriculum matters in school. It embraces sports. It embraces education in social responsibility and citizenship. So whether we have put the word \"sports\" before \"education\" in the Act or whether we have put the words the other way round, I do not think there is any doubt at all in our minds what our objectives for the Institute of Education are, and the Member can rest assured that we will not lose sight of these objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Tay Eng Soon]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.55 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

Between late September and December last year, there were three such incidents and one near-miss. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd September, 1983, a motortrailer carrying piling machinery hit the bottom part of a pedestrian overhead bridge along Upper Thomson Road. The impact dented the vital framework and caused a crack in the pavement it the side between the bridge's two supporting concrete pillars. The incident was given wide publicity by our newspapers with prominent headlines and pictures. The driver was subsequently charged in court for inconsiderate driving under the Road Traffic Act and for carrying a load of excessive height under the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Rules. He was fined $350 for the first offence and $200 for the second offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following upon the incident, the Traffic Police on 7th October, 1983, issued a warning to all operators and contractors that court action will be taken against those who do not take out permits to carry loads above 3.2 metros in height from the road and for false declaration of the height. Despite the warning and the wide publicity given to the dangers posed to the public, the second incident occurred on 23rd October, 1983, when a motor-trailer carrying a cylindrical bulk failed to clear an overhead bridge along Marymount Road. Investigations by the Traffic Police ascertained that the owner of the motor-trailer had given false information with regard to the height of the trailer when he applied for a permit from the relevant authority. The owner was convicted under section 177 of the Penal Code and was fined $750. Again the incident was given publicity by all our newspapers which drew attention to the dangers posed to public safety by such irresponsible behaviour on the part of drivers and owners of heavy vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite that, a third incident happened on 8th November, 1983. An empty oil tanker mounted on a lorry hit a pedestrian overhead bridge along Paya Lebar Road. One of the two bottom chords of the bridge which provide structural support to it was damaged. The driver has been charged in court. The case is still pending. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police also stepped up their checks on heavy vehicles carrying high loads and booking those which exceeded he height limit and had no permit. However, all these measures again went \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unheeded. In yet another incident on 26th December, 1983, a prime-mover conveying a front-end loader hit a pedestrian bridge at Upper Serangoon Road. This bridge was so badly damaged that it had to be dismantled. The total cost of the damage came to about $200,000 comprising installation of a new bridge and expenses incurred in dismantling the damaged bridge. After the incident, the driver ran away. Police investigation is still proceeding on this case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that some drivers and owners of motor vehicles which carry loads of excessive height are not concerned with the dangers that they pose and the damage that they could cause with their irresponsible behaviour. It is also evident that the present penalties provided under our existing legislations are insufficient to deter such behaviour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fortuitous and fortunate that no one was hurt in all the four incidents I have recounted. However, we cannot rely on such good fortune and allow pedestrians to be constantly exposed to such risks until somebody has been hurt. Overhead bridges are built to enable pedestrians to cross roads safely and we have mounted campaigns to encourage everybody to use them. There are now some 200 overhead pedestrian bridges in Singapore, most of which are situated close to schools. In the event of a vehicle with a high load hitting a pedestrian overhead bridge at a time when school children and other pedestrians are crossing the bridge, it could result in a great. loss of lives and injury to many people. Such a disaster would surpass the cable car tragedy manifold. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recklessness of some inconsiderate drivers and owners must be curbed without delay. It would be too late to punish them after the harm is done. In view of the grave danger to public safety, it is necessary to provide for strict deterrent measures and heavy penalties to prevent the occurrence of another incident of a vehicle with a high load hitting a pedestrian overhead bridge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill therefore seeks to make it a specific offence for any heavy motor vehicle, whose overall height including any load carried thereon exceeds 3.2 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> metres, to travel on our roads without a permit authorising the journey and route to be taken; or where a permit has been obtained, the vehicle exceeds the stated height or the vehicle takes a different route. The penalty for a first offence will be a fine not exceeding $2,000 and a mandatory imprisonment term of between one and three years. Upon conviction the court shall order the accused to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of his release from prison. The penalty for a second or subsequent offence will be both a fine not exceeding $5,000 and an imprisonment term of between two and five years. Disqualification on a second or subsequent conviction will be for a period of not less than two years effective from the date of his release from prison. The fines and imprisonment will also extend to whoever is in charge of the heavy motor vehicle or cause it to be driven on the road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill further provides mandatory imprisonment of up to six months and 13 fine not exceeding $1,000 for the offence of giving false information in connection with the overall height of a vehicle in applying for a police permit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the introduction of this Bill. I would like to take this opportunity to raise two points. The first is on the Bill where penalties are only provided for the driver of the vehicle and nowhere is there the provision to penalize the owner of such a vehicle. Sir, as you may be aware, sometimes the drivers of these heavy motor vehicles drive such vehicles under duress or pressure from their owners. So I would have thought that there would be a corresponding penalty for owners as well as drivers of these heavy motor vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on this subject, I would also like to ask the Hon. Minister for Home Affairs whether he will also consider reviewing the deterrent penalty against owners or drivers of heavy motor vehicles for illegal parking. Sir, as,we are aware, heavy motor vehicles attract a higher rate of road tax for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reasons of their length and width. Penalties for illegal parking are at present uniform, between $20 and $30 depending on the nature of the offence, which is manifestly inadequate. It is obvious that a heavy motor vehicle like a trailer occupies more road space than a motor car, maybe three or four times the road space of an ordinary motor car; thus causing more serious obstruction which can cause more serious accident. I hope the Hon. Minister will consider this suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the first point, what about the owner? The Member for Toa Payoh wants the owner also to be responsible. In fact, I have already explained that we have a provision in the amendment to the law that any person who caused such a vehicle to be driven on the road is equally guilty and will be charged under this section. Therefore, the question of the owner being responsible has already been taken care of in the Amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as parking offence committed by the drivers of heavy vehicles is concerned, the Member for Toa Payoh wants a heavier penalty to be imposed on them. Well, we will consider the matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.12 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Employment Agencies Act in two main respects:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to confer powers on the Commissioner for Labour to ensure effective con- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> trol over licensed employment agencies; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to enhance the penalties for offences under the Act and the rules made there-under. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Employment Agencies Act was enacted in 1959 at a time of high unemployment. The purpose of the Act at that time was to license employment agencies and to enable certain types of workers to secure employment through such agencies. The main concern of the Government then was to protect job seekers, especially those looking for clerical and secretarial jobs, from being exploited by bogus employment agencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the labour market situation today is marked by full employment that we have to supplement local supply with foreign workers. Government has made it clear that this is transitional and by certain dates the foreign workers will be repatriated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience has shown that most employers are not familiar with the recruiting procedures in foreign countries and have been using unscrupulous illegal agents to recruit foreign workers for them. These illegal agents are prepared to take the risk of operating without a licence, as the penalty for the offence is very light. In some instances, foreign workers particularly those from the non-traditional sources were cheated by these illegal agents and left stranded here without any employment. In this light, the present provisions of the Act relating to licensing will be amended to provide for more effective control over employment agencies which will now be licensed to recruit foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will ensure that licensed employment agencies comply with the provisions of the Act as well as the Government's policy on the issue of work permits. Under the amendments, the Commissioner for Labour, who is the licensing authority, can require an applicant for a licence to furnish a security deposit before a licence is granted and to impose conditions for this licence. The licence can be revoked if the licensee contravenes any of the provisions of the Act or fails to comply \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with the conditions of his licence or carries on an employment agency in a manner detrimental to the interest of his clients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present penalty for the offence of operating an employment agency without a licence is a fine not exceeding $500 for a first offence and a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both for a second or subsequent offence. This penalty is inadequate to deter illegal employment agents, particularly those who may wish to continue operating illegally to avoid payment of the security deposit. Clause 2 of the Bill enhances the penalty to a fine not exceeding $5,000 for a first offence and a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both for a second or subse. quent offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 5 of the Bill seek to enhance the penalties for the other offences under the Act and offences under the rules. These penalties were set when the Act was enacted in 1959 and are no longer adequate in the present context. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to remind the House that the Government is firm in its decision to phase out foreign workers. Exceptions will be made on the basis of those who have skills of value to contribute to our economic development. Employers should not therefore misconstrue the passage of this Bill as a signal of relaxation of policies governing recruitment of foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>3.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek a point of clarification from the Minister with regard to clause 2 (section 7(2) and section 7A). The proposed new section 7(2) says that the Commissioner may grant a licence with or without conditions and the other one is on security. I would like to know whether the conditions imply that the employment agencies will be required to furnish security for the payment of wages for individUal workers so employed, as we are aware of the recent case of some \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> foreign workers who were not paid and there was a near-riot as a result of non-payment of wages. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the principle of this Bill which is to provide for control over persons who seek to bring in workers from overseas. I am aware of bogus operators and I support, as I said, the principle of the Bill. There is clearly a need for exercising some control over these operators and to see that foreign workers are not brought in under false pretences and left stranded in this place. But what I am not very happy about is the powers that are given to the Commissioner under this Bill and the rights or remedies that are given to any licensee or applicants for licences who may be aggrieved by any decision of the Commissioner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time that I have spoken on this subject. I am alarmed, as I said - I suppose it cannot be helped in modern complexities of government - at the growing instances of powers given to Ministers and to civil servants without any recourse to the courts or proper redress or rights given to citizens who may be affected by the decisions. I think it is important to realize that whilst control is desirable, nevertheless, at the same time, care must be taken to see that innocent persons are not unjustly penalized or prejudiced by the exercise of powers given to the executive, be it civil servants or ministers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if one looks at clause 2 and it is the proposed now section 7, the Commissioner is given very wide powers. He may grant a licence with or without conditions or refuse to grant a licence. So there is absolute power given to the Commissioner without any guidelines as to when he may refuse them or when he may grant them. Then again, when we come to subsection (3) of that section 7, it says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Commissioner may at any time vary or revoke any of the existing conditions of a licence or impose new conditions.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>First of all, will he be asked to state his reasons? As I said, I have mentioned this several times before. Will the Commissioner be required to state his reasons? This Bill makes no mention of that. Then \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> when we come to the proposed section 7D: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Commissioner may revoke a licence if he is satisfied that the licensee - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is contravening or has contravened any of the provisions of this Act or any rules made thereunder; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has failed to comply with any of the conditions of his licence; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) has carried on or is carrying on an employment agency in a manner likely to be detrimental to the interests of his clients.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>If I may skip paragraph (d) because - that does not really matter - if the licensee has ceased to carry on employment I can understand the reason for revoking, but I am concerned about the first three conditions under which the Commissioner may revoke the licence. Again, will he be obliged or required to give reasons? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the process by which the Commissioner will go about before he revokes the licence. The proposed section 7D(2) says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Commissioner shall, before revoking any licence under subsection (1), give the licensee concerned notice in writing of his intention to do so, specifying a date, not less than 21 days after the date of the notice, upon which such revocation shall take effect and calling upon the licensee to show cause to the Commissioner why such licence should not be revoked.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>That is all very good on paper, Mr Speaker, Sir. What I want to know is: Will the Commissioner when he gives this notice to the applicant or to the licensee set out quite clearly the reasons why he wishes to revoke the licence. And if there is any breach of any or more conditions, will he spell out what are the conditions breached? Or will he merely write to the licensee or to the applicant and say, \"i propose to revoke your licence. Will you please show cause why I should not do so?\" We have then a Kafka situation, where the poor man does not know what he is accused of and he is asked to defend himself against something of which he knows nothing, a case which often happens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may draw by way of analogy - taxi drivers. They are told they cannot see the complaint that is made \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> against them. That is the sort of situation I am speaking of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister, if it is not possible to spell it out in the Bill itself today, whether he would consider setting out by way of rules and regulations the various procedures that must be taken by the Commissioner before he exercises these powers, and to see that these rules and regulations contain sufficient safeguards and remedies or rights for persons who feel they may be wronged and may be aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is the provision for a notice of appeal. Again, on paper it sounds very good. There is an appeal to the Minister. But why is it not possible to provide for an appeal to the courts? Because the decision concerns the business activity of some of our citizens and this provision is to be found in a number of other Acts regulating business activities. If it is felt that the courts should not be burdened with all this, then cannot consideration be given to the setting up of a tribunal which will hear an appeal and will give the person who appeals a right to be heard fully and will also acquaint him of the objection and the reasons of the Commissioner for his decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is alarming that at every opportunity powers are given to civil servants, ministers and others without sufficient safeguards provided for the citizen's rights and without sufficient remedies given to him. I would ask the Minister whether he would consider all this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, the point raised by the Member for Toa Payoh who asked whether, under the proposed section relating to conditions and payment of security deposit, my Ministry will consider utilization of these provisions to ensure that the licensed employment agencies will meet their obligation for wages. This is not provided for in this Bill, and without giving a definitive answer I would like to thank him for his suggestion and will assure him that the Ministry will take this into consideration \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> when the regulations are drawn up for the security deposit and the framing of the different conditions. I should add that the major objective of the proposal for a security deposit is to ensure that cost of repatriation will be forthcoming should they be stranded here. But I would nevertheless look into the suggestion which he has made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to deal at length with the points raised by the Member for Anson for these are points which he has raised on diverse occasions relating to similar provisions in other Bills. He has asked why do we not provide for appeal to the courts. We have many instances of analogous legislation where administrative and ministerial decisions have to be taken, and taken fairly expeditiously. If all appeals against administrative and ministerial decisions are to go by way of appeal to the courts, obviously our courts will be completely bogged down with reviewing administrative decisions. They will have no time to deal with pressing matters, such as people charged with bicycle theft, assault on taxi drivers, commissions of contempt of court, deceiving creditors, and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Very funny. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our couns must have as a priority different tasks, and also the Member for Anson is unaware of the trends in administrative law in other countries where it is impossible to have administrative action reviewed individually by the courts or by the setting up of tribunals which will result in a tremendous delay. Adequate safeguards exist. The Member for Anson must also know that under the system of administrative law which we have inherited and which operates in Singapore, any person who feels that the exercise of administrative action is contrary to the law can have it reviewed in a court of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

The present subscription of Singapore to the authorized capital of the Asian Development Bank is US$32.4 million. Under the third general capital increase of the Bank, we have been allotted a further US$34 million.

Our economy is in robust health. Investments expanded. Our currency is strong. Real incomes have risen. Inflation was minimal. This happy state of affairs is due in no \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> small part to the past efforts of my predecessor as Minister for Finance, the late Mr Hon Sui Sen. The economic policies, which he laid down, established a sound foundation which enabled our economy to weather the 1980-82 recession and emerge fitter for the experience. He has left us a solid base to build on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1983 the United States economy experienced a sharp upswing and the world took its first steps towards economic recovery. The total gross national product of the countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose by 2 1/4%, reversing its decline of 0.3% in 1982. The rest of the world benefitted. World trade recovered to grow by 1% in volume terms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly because of the reduction in oil prices, world inflation eased further. In June 1983, the inflation rate in the OECD countries went down to 4.9%, the lowest annual rate of increase since 1972. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the path to recovery was hampered by old obstacles. Unemployment remained high especially in Europe. The international financial system continued to be plagued by the debt problems of a number of the developing countries. Although timely intervention by international authorities prevented a major financial crisis from erupting, the debt problem remains a threat to sustained world economic expansion. In addition, protectionist sentiments were widespread in spite of the upturn in economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an open economy Singapore benefitted from the world economic recovery. Our economy expanded by a commendable 7.9% compared with 6.3% in 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a resurgence in foreign demand for our goods and services. Led by the marked recovery in output of the electrical and electronics industry, the manufacturing sector picked up from its decline of 6% in 1982 to grow by 2%. As a result of our good manufacturing performance and the recovery in world trade, our re-exports and non-oil domestic exports grew significantly. The financial and business services sector grew by 16% and was the largest contributor to our GDP growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction remained the fastest growing sector. The main thrust to the sector's expansion came from the accelerated public housing programme. Transport and communications, however, slowed down to grow by 8%, the first single digit growth since 1975. The tourist trade was adversely affected by the 4% drop in the number of tourist arrivals, the first decline in 20 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the faster economic growth in 1983, our workforce rose by only 2.6% compared with 5.2% in 1982. Our efforts in urging industries to use labour more productively are showing encouraging results. There was a marked reduction in the number of workers in the manufacturing and transport sectors because of automation and mechanization. Consequently, productivity improved significantly, growing by 5% compared with 1% in 1982. We continued to have full employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation was low throughout 1983. Consumer prices rose by 1.2% for 1983 as a whole, one of the lowest rates in the world. Because of the lowering of oil prices and the strong Singapore dollar, imported consumer products were generally cheaper. Our inflation was therefore largely due to domestic factors, a trend which we will have to watch closely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I warned the House that we must be prepared for no growth in real incomes if the world economy were to deteriorate further. Fortunately, as a result of our strong economic performance in 1983, Singaporeans were able to enjoy a bigger increase in real income. As measured by GDP per capita real incomes rose by 7.6% considerably higher than the 5.1% increase in 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now elaborate on specific areas of our economic policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our manufacturing industry is now recovering from the setbacks that it suffered as a result of the world recession it will be some time before industrial production returns to the level of 1981. Industries producing electronic components, electrical and electronic consumer products as well as computer related equipment such as disk drives were behind the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recovery of the manufacturing sector in 1983. As some of these products are in the forefront of new technological developments, this augurs well for the upgrading of the manufacturing industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic restructuring policies have stood us in good stead. Investors continued to place their confidence in Singapore as an attractive location for investment. New investment commitments were $1.8 billion in 1983, slightly higher than in the previous year. Substantial investment was committed in the petroleum industry for process upgrading and energy conservation. A major portion of other commitments was for the manufacture of computer-related equipment and components, construction materials, food and chemicals. Nearly half of the total investment commitments were new and diversification projects, a substantial improvement over recent years. This is a welcome trend as it is such investments which bring the new technology that is needed for our industrial upgrading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also encouraged by the fact that local manufacturing companies continued to commit substantial investments, amounting to $520 million in 1983. They accounted for 29% of total investment commitments. Besides the traditional fields, local investments increased in modern supporting industries such as those producing precision metal products and engineering plastic components. To promote the growth of local companies, the Small Industries Finance Scheme (SIFS) provided $92 million in concessionary loans to 265 cases in 1983. The qualifying level of the SIFS Scheme has been modified so that companies with fixed assets not exceeding $3 million can now apply for assistance under the Scheme. Many small local companies may not be aware of the range of services that statutory bodies such as EDB, SISIR and TDB can provide for them. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has therefore asked these bodies to pool their resources so as to address the technical, promotional, financial and manpower problems faced by small industries in a more comprehensive way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If local companies are to do well in the longer term, they must look for business opportunities in the newer technologies. In the last Budget Statement, I informed the House that some local companies have ventured into non-traditional areas such as computer equipment and robotics. Such non-traditional or \"venture capital\" investments, as they are sometimes called, are inherently risky. The risk of failure is high. To assist enterprising local companies which are prepared to enter these new fields, I am pleased to announce that local companies which invest in approved venture capital projects in new technology industries will now be able to write off up to 50% of the equity invested in such projects if the projects incur losses. Companies that are interested in this area should approach the EDB. Through its international network of offices, the EDB can assist them in locating suitable foreign partners with a view to setting up joint venture projects in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to reduce our dependence on foreign workers without sacrificing high economic growth, we have no choice but to speed up the pace of automation and mechanization. The potential for doing this is greatest in manufacturing. I am therefore pleased to report that in 1983 the Skills Development Fund has approved grants for 220 manufacturing projects under its Interest Grant for Mechanization Scheme. These grants will help companies to acquire about $87 million worth of new automated equipment. More robots are being used in industry. To give a further boost to robotisation, a robot leasing company has been established to provide consulting services as well as lease industrial robots and accessories. Companies wishing to automate and robotize their operations should consult the EDB on the range of tax incentives that are available to them. Where there are significant labour savings, the EDB will recommend to the Income Tax Department that the company should be allowed to write off the cost of the robots purchased in one year. Training facilities in the skills required for the operation and maintenance of automated equipment are also being expanded and upgraded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts to encourage Research and Development (R&amp;D) are proceeding as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> planned. More companies today are placing emphasis on R&amp;D. Twenty-one local companies have so far been awarded grants totalling $1.9 million under the Product Development Assistance Scheme (PDAS), while grants totalling $18.6 million have been given under the R&amp;D Block Vote to fund 23 research projects. To further encourage private sector initiative in research and development, the scope of the R&amp;D Block Vote was liberalized. Previously, private companies were required to team up with public bodies such as the National University of Singapore before they could receive financial assistance for their R&amp;D projects. Under the revised scheme, deserving projects can be considered for grants even without the participation of a public sector organization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the Science Park was completed at the end of 1983. Twelve standard units of research laboratories were made available for leasing to companies. The DNV Marine Technology Centre, a major tenant in the Park, commenced operations in September 1983, several months ahead of schedule. Companies involved in the development of industrial and educational robots and low-cost microcomputers and related peripherals will take up occupation in the Park this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Prospects Ahead</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remain internationally competitive, our manufacturing industry will have no choice but to become more technology and skill-intensive. The industry will have to face growing competition as a result of increasing automation in developed countries. With large-scale automation, companies in the advanced countries which do not already have plants overseas will have little interest to invest in new offshore capacity. At the same time, increasing protectionism has accelerated the trend towards investing in the markets rather than in lower cost offshore production centres. A \"reindustrialization\" movement is taking place in developed countries and concerted programmes are being mounted to promote investments in the new technologies. Hence the environment for attracting foreign investments to Singapore will become more difficult. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, so long as our workers are productive and our business environment is conducive to private enterprise, there will always be niches in manufacturing where Singapore will continue to be competitive. These include specialized industries which cannot be totally mechanized as well as industries which are unlikely to go into full automation in the initial years. Our existing base of manufacturing companies is another potential source of new investments as the companies expand and upgrade their operations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also examine new opportunities outside manufacturing. One area of activities which has come into prominence is that of internationally tradeable services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services are not new to Singapore. They account for over 70% of our GDP and over 60% of total employment. Net export earnings from services have increased from $892 million in 1970 to $12 billion in 1982. These are mainly in tourism, port services, air transportation, shipping and warehousing. There are, however, new types of internationally tradeable services which can make use of our modern telecommunication and other infrastructural facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB has started to promote investment in such services. So far, it has concentrated on manufacturing related technical and engineering services. These included process control instrumentation, oilfield services, aircraft maintenance and servicing, and engineering consultancy. The scope of services to be developed will be broadened to include all types of international services where Singapore has a comparative advantage. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>TRADE DEVELOPMENT</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the world economy has started to recover, and trade has begun to grow again, protectionist sentiment has not abated. Our exports of refrigeration compressors to the United States were subject to a countervailing duty petition. Charges of dumping were levelled against our exports of ballbearings to the European Community and dextrose monohydrate, a sugar substitute, to Australia. Some of the benefits which we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> received under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for exports of developing countries were removed or restricted. Our exports of office machine components for example now face higher duties for entry into the US. In Europe a quota was set on the volume of our exports of electric capacitors which could enjoy preferential duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation committed to free-trade we are naturally concerned about the effects of protectionism on our exports. There is unfortunately little reason to hope that protectionism can be rolled back until the developed countries, particularly Europe, have resolved the problem of structural unemployment in their economies. The Government will endeavour through closer bilateral relations with other countries, to mitigate the problem faced by our firms threatened with protectionist actions. However, the best way to counter protectionism is to improve our productivity. We should also seek out new markets and activities where protectionism is less likely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board commenced operations last year. To ensure that its policies and services reflect the needs of the business community, the Board is tapping the expertise of the private sector in its work. Five advisory committees comprising representatives from a number of industries were formed to advise the Board on trading and marketing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New services have been launched, for example, a centralised trade enquiry service which provides traders with general market information, documentation procedures and customs regulations of foreign markets. The Board also introduced an incentive scheme to encourage manufacturers to produce brochures of an international standard for overseas promotion. To date 12 companies have made use of the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assistance of the Board, Singapore companies continued to participate aggressively in overseas promotion activities such as fairs and exhibitions. In addition, 11 marketing seminars and work- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shops were organized to disseminate information useful to our manufacturers and exporters, The Trade Development Board will undertake more of such activities in the coming year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has expanded its network of overseas offices. Two new ones were set up in Brussels and Dubai while honorary representatives were appointed in Sydney, Seoul and Dusseldorf. Efforts to explore opportunities in non-traditional markets were also intensified. The Board is drawing up a plan to increase its overseas representation over the next few years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional trade cooperation under the ASEAN Preferential Trading Arrangements (PTA) continued to strengthen. By the end of 1983, the number of items under PTA had increased to over 12,000 items. Several measures were taken to enhance the contribution of PTA to intra-ASEAN trade. These included deepening the margin of preference of items already under the PTA and in future exchanges from the existing 25% to a maximum of 50%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN countries are making headway in the area of industrial cooperation. Under the ASEAN Industrial Project (AIP) Scheme, the Indonesian urea project recently came on stream while a similar Malaysian project is under construction. Details of the Thai and Filipino projects are being worked out. In the case of Singapore, we have identified the production of Hepatitis B Vaccine as a suitable AIP. When formally accepted by the other countries, ASEAN will have its first set of five AlPs. To further increase cooperation, the ASEAN countries recently signed a Basic Agreement on Industrial Joint Ventures which aims to stimulate private investments in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exchange rate policy has to balance the twin objectives of minimizing imported inflation and safeguarding export competitiveness. Another major consideration is to ensure that international confidence in our economy is maintained. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with the uncertainties in the world economy and in the international financial system, the Monetary Authority sought to maintain a stable and strong Singapore dollar. Keeping a stable exchange rate was not an easy task, given the volatility in currency markets which also saw a few competitive devaluations. There was even speculation in April last year that the Singapore dollar was to be devalued i As it turned out, the Singapore dollar actually firmed against the currencies of our major trading partners and, in particular, was remarkably steady vis-a-vis the US dollar. The strength of the Singapore dollar is a reflection of the Government's prudent financial policy and the soundness of our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>FINANCIAL SERVICES</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Budget Statement, I announced a tax exemption scheme for the promotion of loan syndication. All income earned by participants of offshore loans syndicated out of Singapore are now exempted from tax. The scheme has met with encouraging support. The Ministry of Finance has received more than 20 applications under this scheme since it started in April 1983 despite the worldwide slowdown in syndication activities. In view of the good response, I have decided to give further encouragement to similar types of financial activities. The tax exemption scheme will now be extended to cover the syndication of guarantees, performance bonds and certain underwriting activities such as underwriting of floating rate notes and revolving underwriting facilities. To facilitate the growth of loan syndication activities, the Government has continued to be liberal in its admission of foreign law firms to service the legal documentation of loans. Eight more have been admitted since March 1983 bringing the total to 23. It is hoped that all these measures will assist in the development of Singapore into a full fledged syndication centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area for promotion is offshore fund management. In September 1983, a tax exemption scheme was introduced for non-resident investors who have their funds managed by approved Asian Currency Units (ACUs) in Singapore. The scheme exempts all income earned by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> non-residents from tax provided that their funds are managed by approved ACUs and the income is derived from offshore investment, Management fees of the fund managers will be taxed at the concessionary rate of 10%. Since the introduction; 3 ACUs have been approved under the scheme and five more applications are being processed. The potential for growth in this area over the next few years is good. A US-led world economic recovery should increase opportunities for investments, especially in the Asia-Pacific region where Singapore is well placed to play an intermediary role. To further this objective, efforts will be made to seek more foreign shares and securities to be listed in Singapore. The latest was the listing in the Stock Exchange of Singapore of securities guaranteed by the US Government National Mortgage Association under its Mortgage-backed Securities Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial futures will be making a formal entry into the Singapore financial scene this year. The link between the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the International Monetary Markets of Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the first of its kind, providing close to 24 hours trading in financial futures. Because it is a new area of financial activity, various tax incentives will be given to help the futures market develop in the initial years. Since these are foreign currency transactions, the tax incentives will be in line with those given to promote the offshore markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further develop Singapore as an international futures market, the number of futures contracts available for trading could be extended to other commodities. A possible area would be in oil futures. Singapore has large storage and efficient oil handling facilities, and the trading of oil futures contract would be a logical extension of our oil trading activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the domestic front, greater automation and computerisation by banks are being encouraged to promote efficiency and productivity. More Automated Taller Machines (ATMs) are in use while computerized cash management/terminals for corporate clients have been introduced. An off-line Electronic Funds Transfer System is being planned for implementation in the middle of this year. This system will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> simplify, among other things, the payment of bills and salaries by electronic means. Two other systems are being studied and should be implemented before the year-end. One is the Automated Interbank Payment System and the other is the Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale terminals. The latter is the next major step towards a cashless society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>TOURISM</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sector that has yet to recover from the world economic recession is tourism. In 1983, visitor arrivals fell by 4%. The average length of stay also dropped marginally to 3.7 days. Earnings from tourism, however, increased slightly by 3%. On the brighter side, the growth of our convention and exhibition business was sustained. Last year Singapore was the venue for 350 meetings, 57 exhibitions and 520 incentive groups, The total of 927 \"convention-type\" events represented an increase of over 50% as compared to 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the overall poor performance last year, the tourist industry will have to work doubly hard to sell their services. It will have to find ways to maintain Singapore as a reasonably priced tourist destination which gives good value for money. Hard work done now will bear fruit in future years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotel room rates are beginning to ease and this should help tourist promotion. I am pleased to note that hoteliers and travel agents are intensifying their overseas marketing activities. In addition, the quality of the work force in the industry will improve with the establishment of the Singapore Hotel Association's training school. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board will on its part cooperate closely with the tourist industry in promotional and other efforts both abroad and in Singapore. The Board will intensify its promotional activities in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Two new overseas offices will be opened in Osaka and Taipei this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>COMPUTERIZATION</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service Computerization Programme is making good progress. We have significantly increased the pool of computer expertise in the public sector. Ministries and departments are beginning to benefit from the programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Computer Board (NCB), the System and Computer Organization of the Ministry of Defence and the Institute of Systems Science are carrying out joint research in software engineering. The work will not only help computer professionals in the Civil Service to improve their productivity but will also set the pace for applied research in the local software industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our institutions are progressing well in the training of computer professionals. The curriculum of the Computer Science Department at NUS has been revised to provide students with more practical skills required by the industry. The first batch of 50 students from the Japan-Singapore Institute of Software Technology graduated in February 1984. The Institute of Systems Science has already produced two batches of about 75 Systems Analysts each with a third batch graduating in August this year. The Institute's new building will be completed by July to enable it to implement its expansion plans. The Centre for Computer Studies in Ngee Ann Polytechnic will graduate its first batch of about 110 students in September this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computerization in the private sector continued to grow. The NCB estimated that there are now about 2,600 firms using computers as compared with 2,000 in 1982. Computer utilisation is expected to increase as more companies take advantage of the incentive announced last year which enables capital expenditure on computers and office automation equipment to be written off in one year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my past Budget Statements, I have repeatedly emphasised the importance of manpower development. This is because our economic growth depends crucially on how fully we maximize the potential of our population through training and educaion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that we are beginning to see an increasing number of trained young men and women coming out from our educational and training institutes. By 1985 the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological Institute, Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic will be producing twice as many graduates when compared to 1980. Once these graduates have acquired the necessary working experience, they will provide the managerial, supervisory and technical expertise for the new industries. Skilled workers will also be available in greater numbers from the VITB and the EDB training centres. The current shortage of professional, technical and skilled manpower will therefore ease in a few years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the increase in number, the realization of our training and education plans will bring about significant changes in the quality of our workforce. By 1985, output of \"graduate\" manpower will constitute about 15% of the total input into our labour force. Technicians and skilled workers will account for 65% of the now workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now better equipped to pursue the restructuring of our economy. In the Seventies, we promoted investment on the basis of low wages. Henceforth, we will be able to attract better quality investment on the basis of a pool of well-trained and skilled manpower. The quality of the investments which we have attracted in the past few years will have considerable impact on the structure of our economy in future years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While placing emphasis on the training and education of professional, technical and skilled manpower, we have not overlooked the upgrading of our existing work force. Last year, we launched a pilot Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST) programme to enable workers who did not complete their primary schooling to attain basic standards in English and Mathematics. The rationale behind this programme is that workers who lack the basic numeracy and literacy skills will find it increasingly difficult to undergo retraining and adapt to more advanced technology. Response to the pilot BEST program was encouraging with a total enrol- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ment of 23,000 in 1983. In view of the good response, the BEST programme will be expanded in 1984 to take in about 40,000 workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of our workers should not be considered as having ended when they leave our training and educational institutions. Training must be a continuous pro- cess and is best provided at the workplace. No amount of training by public institutions can take the place of in-company training which is better tailored to the needs of the business. Consequently, the Skills Development Fund (SDF) has provided generous support to companies prepared to undertake training for their staff. Last year, employers were encouraged to formulate total, rather than ad hoc, training plans, which could be fully integrated with their development plans. SDF grants will be paid in advance to help them to carry out their plans. The SDF also continued to encourage industry groups to sat up their own permanent training centres. In this respect, the hotel industry training and education centre was successfully set up in 1983 and there are plans to got up and upgrade similar centres for banking, insurance, construction, trading and manufacturing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our long-term aim is to train our people to their fullest potential, we should not close our doors to talented foreigners who can make an effective contribution to our economy. Over the years, we have benefitted from the influx of talented foreigners who have come to Singapore first to seek work and then to make this island their home. Given our small population and the more than abundant job opportunities in our growing economy, we should continue with this liberal open-door policy. In particular, we should welcome those foreign professionals and skilled workers who have cultural values compatible with our own and who can be easily assimilated into our society. Apart from adding to our talent pool, the presence of good quality foreign professionals will provide the necessary competition to spur our own population to greater heights of achievement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>WAGES</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fundamental requirements for success in our economic restructuring \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is to ensure that better work is rewarded with better pay. Wages should be determined as much as possible by market forces. Only then will we be able to allocate our scarce labour resources to the more productive industries. The National Wages Council (NWC) has served us well in the past in moderating wage increases at a stage of our development when we had to compete in the world market on the basis of low wages. As we have now to compete on the basis of a skilled, better paid and more productive workforce, we must allow market forces to determine our wage level. Hence, we started last year to move away from the tripartite collective wage negotiations conducted at the national level and instead to promote union-employer wage bargaining at the individual company level. Towards this direction, Government representatives on the NWC played a less active role in determining the wage guidelines. Nevertheless, while we believe in direct bargaining as a way to introduce more market considerations in wage determination, it would be dangerous to rush the process. Direct wage-bargaining will be allowed to evolve in accordance with the readiness of employers and unions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>PRODUCTIVITY</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported earlier, our productivity performance last year was gratifying. While an increase in our productivity was expected as a result of the economic recovery, the final results nevertheless represented significant gains in efFiciency obtained through greater automation and mechanization. This was particularly so in manufacturing and transport and communications where the labour force actually shrank despite an increase in output. Given our limited manpower resources and our intention to have a wholly Singaporean workforce by 1992, we must sustain the productivity gains if we are to continue to have good rates of economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board through its various activities, will help to mould workers' attitudes and instil in them the will to be more productive. In this respect, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> it is encouraging to note that a national survey on \"Productivity Will\" conducted in September 1983 revealed that most employees possessed positive work attitudes. The increased awareness of the importance of productivity was reflected by the four-fold increase to 1460 in the number of Quality Control Circles (QCC). Response to NPB courses and seminars on productivity was also encouraging. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the positive attitudes of our workers towards productivity improvement, it is up to employers to respond in kind by better management methods and investments in capital equipment and training. In respect of capital equipment, the Government will provide the necessary tax incentives and financial assistance. Companies will be failing in their duties if they do not take advantage of the incentives provided to upgrade productivity. In particular, companies in the commerce and retail sectors should make a special effort as productivity in the sector has lagged considerably behind the rest of the economy. To help them, I allowed expenditure on computers and office automation equipment to be written off in one year in the 1983 Budget Statement. This year, I propose to extend to all sectors the option of accelerated 3-year depreciation of equipment purchased which is presently enjoyed only by manufacturing enterprises. The details will be outlined in Part III of my Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>ENERGY &amp; WATER</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil prices did not rise in 1983. This was a welcome relief for consumer nations like Singapore. Under mounting pressure from the continuing glut in the market official oil prices were in fact reduced early last year. Singapore benefitted from the reduction. For the second time within a year, we were able to reduce electricity tariffs by as much as 9% for the lowest tariff block. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1984 should see another year of stable energy prices for consumer countries. This will provide favourable conditions for continuing economic growth and low inflation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the easing of oil price was a boon to our economy, it should not be allowed to dampen our drive for energy conserva- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tion. Last year, whilst the economy grew by 7.9% compared with 6.3% in 1982, total electricity consumption rose by 10%, twice the rate of 1982. To a large extent, this was due to greater mechanization and automation, the installation of now plants, brisk construction activity and the opening of several commercial complexes. However, the trend is worrying as it will increase our dependence on oil and undermine our competitiveness if prices start to rise again. We must therefore continue to pursue energy conservation earnestly. In May this year, another Energy Conservation Campaign will be held to remind the public and firms of the need to conserve and to use energy efficiently. We will also have to see if there are measures similar to the OTTV (Overall Thermal Transfer Value) surcharge which can be adopted to induce energy efficiency. This measure has had notable success in enforcing energy considerations in the design of buildings. Of the 200 buildings that originally did not comply with standards, only nine were still paying the surcharge by the end of 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I drew the House's attention to the relentless rise in our water consumption and the limited land that we have for water catchment. We experienced a dry spell in the first half of last year and domestic water consumption rose by 7% in 1983. The PUB held a Water Conservation Campaign in September to drive home the message that we need to be frugal in our water usage. The Board also mounted an exercise to encourage companies to use industrial water. Five companies with large water consumption have agreed to install facilities to receive industrial water. There are plans to extend the industrial water network to Tuas. The Government has further decided to grant a 50% Investment Allowance to commercial and industrial enterprises which install plant or equipment that can save water by a substantial margin. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic growth and rising standards of living it will not be easy to moderate the growth in water consumption. However, we should not lose our resolve for conservation as, without large water resources of our own, we have no choice but to be frugal in water usage. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CONSTRUCTION</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry continued to perform impressively. The public housing programme is proceeding according to plan. In 1983, HDB completed a record 40,000 flats. This year, it expects to deliver another 48,000 units. With work on the MRT coming on stream, major developments in and around Marina Centre and the accelerated public housing programme, the construction industry will be kept busy again this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry was able to meet our expectations because of expanded and improved productivity. Building materials were in abundant supply and prices were kept down. Contractors were able to bring in more foreign workers to meet their labour needs. Many reputable overseas contractors have set up operations here to tender for public and private sector contracts. Apart from keeping tender prices low, their presence also benefits the industry through technology and knowledge transfer. The Government's call for mechanization received good response. Forty-five applications for investment allowance have been received involving capital expenditure amounting to $74 million. With increased mechanization, our construction workers were able to turn in a considerable productivity growth of 9% in 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry, however, has a long way to go to catch up with productivity in other sectors. The Government is therefore setting up the Construction Industry Development Board to upgrade the building industry. Apart from reviewing standards and building regulations to adapt them to industrialized building technologies, the Board will also encourage the private sector to set up factories to produce prefabricated and precast components. In this connection, I would like to reiterate that the Economic Development Board will provide tax incentives for supporting industries which manufacture construction components. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major task is the training of construction workers. The Construction Industry Training Centre has received encouraging response from Singaporeans. Many employers have also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> agreed to provide on-the-job training. I the response and support continue to be good, the Government will consider setting up a second training centre to teach more specialized construction skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of special significance for the industry was the start of construction on the MRT project in October 1983, a mere 11/2 years from the time that the decision to proceed was taken. Implementation of the MRT was timed so as to take advantage of low tender prices arising from the recession. A total of 10 contracts were awarded in 1983, at prices well below original estimated cost. Another gratifying factor was the extent of local participation. Of the 10 contracts awarded in 1983, five were joint ventures with local partners. This augurs well for the effective transfer of technology and specialist construction skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry, like the other economic sectors, must thrive on free market competition. The Government's role has been and will continue to be a supportive one. Contractors should take advantage of Government incentives and assistance to venture into new building systems. They can best succeed if they also build up a permanent workforce of skilled Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CONCLUDING REMARKS</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker,Sir, this time last year, I took a gloomy view of the world economy. I noted that protectionism was rising. The international financial system teetered on the brink of a breakdown. The US economy showed no signs of recovery. In the event we performed better than expected. However, notwithstanding the widespread optimism that seems to be the fashion in international financial circles today, I am not yet persuaded that we are out of the woods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protectionist sentiment in the industrialised countries has not receded. The problem of a high level of international indebtedness still hangs over us although, fortunately the international monetary authorities and financial institutions have managed to contain the crisis so far. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected strong turnaround of the US economy in 1983, brought about by a surge in consumer spending, has given the world a respite. There are, however, doubts over how long the recovery will last. A crucial element is the course of American economic policy in the run-up to the Presidential elections. If the huge US federal budget deficits are not reduced, interest rates will remain high and this can stall the economic recovery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore we face a serious problem of labour shortage which can set a limit to our growth potential. The repatriation of unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers from non-traditional sources must go on if we are to succeed in our economic restructuring. This means that future growth can only come from productivity improvement. Singaporeans must therefore work hard and be more productive if we want to continue to better our standard of living. If we do not slacken we can ensure that the growth we achieved in 1983 will continue into 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this concludes the first part of my Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to take the Suspension now. I suspend the Sifting and will take the Chair again at 5.10 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 4.37 pm until 5.10 pm.</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 5.10 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Section II</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to FY 84 Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic growth in the last two years has been sustained partly by the stimulation of domestic activities through Government spending. Now that the outlook is more favourable it is an opportune time to pass the initiative back to the private sector to spearhead the drive for further growth. The FY 1984 Budget is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> accordingly directed towards three objectives: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) restraining the increase in Government spending; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) encouraging greater efficiency and productivity in companies; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) rewarding individual enterprise and hard work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As compared to FY 83, the allocation for infrastructural, industrial and commercial development in the FY 84 Expenditure Budget is increased. A bigger provision is made for education and manpower training to expand the pool of skilled, technical and professional manpower required for upgrading the economy. More funds are provided to the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to sustain its public housing construction programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Government spending (excluding the transfer from the Consolidated Fund to the Development Fund) for FY 84 is estimated at $16,561 million. This exceeds the FY 83 figure by $1,889 million or 13%. This rate of increase is lower than the average annual growth of 24% in actual total expenditure over the period FY 78-82. Outlays on economic and manpower develop- ment and public housing together account for $9,624 million or about 58% of the total allocation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total budgeted recurrent expenditure for FY 84 is $7,567 million. This is $684 million or 10% higher than the FY 83 figure. The rate of increase is much lower than the average annual growth of 24% in actual recurrent expenditure over the FY 78-82 period. The growth in recurrent expenditure has been reduced to make more funds available for development projects. Nevertheless the allocation for recurrent expenditure should be adequate to cover the higher manpower and operating costs as well as the expansion of such services as education and manpower training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on manpower will go up by $102 million or 6%. A total of 489 additional posts is provided for new or expanded areas of work. Of these, 209 are for the Neighbourhood Police Posts, Ang Mo Kio fire station and vital installations. The bulk of the remaining 280 posts is for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the new Changi Airport fire station, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok branch libraries, Tuas incineration plant, Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore and clerical and other support services for new schools and junior colleges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the Armed Forces expenditure, Other Operating Expenditure is expected to drop by $21 million or 3% mainly because of lower agency fees to the Urban Redevelopment Authority for managing the sale of state lands on behalf of Government, transfer of major equipment purchases to the Development Estimates and a smaller allocation for the Fixed Rate Export Financing Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an increase of $257 million or 24% in Grants, Subsidies and Other Transfers. This is due largely to higher manpower and operating costs of statutory boards and other institutions dependent on Government financing, a sum of $192 million to top up the Advance Accounts and an allocation of $50 million to augment the Contingencies Fund for recurrent expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of $76 million or 4% in the provision for Public Debt is due to a bigger allocation for interest payments as the volume of domestic loans has increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recurrent expenditure will be fully met by the anticipated revenue of $9,969 million, leaving a surplus of $2,403 million for transfer to the Development Fund to help finance development projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total development outlay for FY 84 is estimated to be $8,994 million or 54% of the net total budget. The provision is $1,205 million or 15% higher than the FY 83 figure. Allocations for public housing, infrastructural, industrial and commercial development as well as education and manpower training take up $7,809 million or nearly 87% of the development budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 45% or $4,000 million of the budgeted development expenditure is for the public housing construction programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation for infrastructural, industrial and commercial development is $3,178 million or 35% of the development outlay. Included in the provision is $2,019 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> million for new land reclamation projects and the development of industrial estates, mass rapid transit system and roads; $1,076 million to meet the requirements of Temasek Holdings, Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore, lines of credit to the Development Bank of Singapore and the Ship Financing Scheme; as well as $83 million for the Capital Assistance Scheme for the Construction Industry and the Economic Development Board's Capital Assistance and Product Development Assistance Schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for education and manpower training is $630 million. This is for the school and junior college building programme, and expansion of the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological Institute, Singapore and Ngee Ann Polytechnics as well as vocational and industrial training institutes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $52 million is provided for the purchase of hardware and software development for the Civil Service Computerization Programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Section III</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Revenue</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With existing tax rates, recurrent revenue for FY 84 is estimated at $9,969 million. This represents a decrease of $552 million or 5.2%, compared with the revised estimates of $10,521 million for FY 83. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Tax will continue to be the largest single source of revenue, accounting for about 33% of total revenue. Income tax collections for FY 84 are expected to amount to $3,300 million, which is $169 million or 4.9% less than FY 83 collections. The main reason for this decline is the economic slow down which continued into the first half of 1983. This will adversely affect corporate tax revenue collection especially from the oil refining, ship repairing, shipbuilding, hotel, manufacturing and commercial sectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total budgeted expenditure for FY 84 is $16,561 million, comprising recurrent \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> expenditure of $7,567 million and development expenditure of $8,994 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after taking into account the Development Fund income of $2,670 million, the total revenue of $12,639 million will be insufficient to finance total recurrent and development expenditure. There is a deficit of $3,922 million which will be financed by public borrowings and a drawing down from the Development Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the tax changes. In the first pan of my Budget Statement, I mentioned four tax changes which are designed to stimulate the corporate sector and promote greater efficiency and productivity in our economic activities. I will now elaborate on these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Accelerated Depreciation Allowance</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing enterprises are presently allowed to write off their plant and machinery over three years. Non-manufacturing enterprises are, however, precluded. I wish to emphasize that all firms should take the necessary steps to automate and upgrade their operations, regardless of whether they are manufacturing or non-manufacturing concerns. I propose therefore to extend the three-year accelerated depreciation allowance to all plant and equipment in all sectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from Year of Assessment 1985, all new equipment will be allowed to claim an accelerated depreciation allowance of 33 1/3% over three years. Effectively, it means that expenditure oh all new equipment can be written off against taxable profits in the three years following the year of purchase. In order not to penalize those who have already purchased their equipment, unclaimed residual allowances in respect of existing equipment will also be allowed full set-off in three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be consistent with our policy to restrain growth in the number of passenger vehicles, these concessions will not be given to motor cars, motor cycles and light goods vehicles. Computers and office automation equipment will continue enjoying the 100% depreciation in the first year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Investment Allowance for Local Companies to Invest in New Technology Projects</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, local companies which invest in approved venture capital projects in new technology industries will be able to write off up to 50% of the equity invested in such projects if the projects incur losses. This will take the form of an investment allowance of up to 50% of the equity investment by those companies which undertake projects approved by the Economic Development Board. A company is defined to be a local company if the majority (ie more than 50%) of its equity is owned by Singapore citizens or Permanent Residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment allowance of 50% will be granted to the investing company only if the new project does not make any cumulative profit during the three-year period commencing from the expected date of production. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incentive should encourage our local investors to venture into new frontiers of technological advancement and serve to broaden our present technological base. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extension of Offshore Syndicated Loan Tax Exemption</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also indicated the Government's intention to extend the present tax exemption scheme for offshore syndicated loans to cover other syndicated credit facilities. Specifically, the tax exemption scheme will now include the syndication of guarantees, performance bonds and certain underwriting facilities, such as underwriting of bonds, floating rate notes and revolving underwriting facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All income earned from the syndication of such facilities will be exempt. In the case of underwriting, the tax exemption will not cover income earned by the underwriter arising from the holding of part of an issue that has not been fully subscribed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the scheme for offshore syndicated loans, the tax exemption will be granted to credit facilities which meet certain criteria and are syndicated in Singapore during the five years from 1 April 1983. The criteria are essentially simi \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lar to those we have at present for offshore syndicated loans. Both schemes can also be extended by the Minister for Finance beyond 31 March 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Incentive for Financial Futures Market</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial futures market will come into operation in June. As this is a new area of financial activity, I have decided to give tax incentives to help the futures market get off to a successful start. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore International Monetary Exchange (\"SIMEX\") will be given a five-year tax exemption on its income derived from futures activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income of corporate members which arises from transactions with non-residents, Asian Currency Units and other SIMEX members will be taxed at the offshore concessionary rate of 10%. Individual members of SIMEX will also be able to enjoy this concessionary tax rate. Since futures transactions will be essentially foreign currency transactions, this concession is in line with those given to promote the offshore gold and Asian Dollar Markets. Income arising from transactions with residents will be taxed at 40%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market users will be taxed according to the normal tax laws. The tax treatment will vary, depending on the nature and circumstance of each transaction. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now consider the tax changes for individuals. Budget speeches in recent years, including this year, have repeatedly stressed the need to reward individual enterprise and hard work. When individuals succeed, they benefit not only themselves but also society. People must be given the motivation to want to work hard, to better themselves, to invest in new ventures, to take calculated risks. In this Budget I propose to provide the motivation through two major changes: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Reduction in Personal Income Tax rates, and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Simplification of Estate Duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>In addition, the scheme for Enhanced Child Relief will be improved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Personal Income Tax Rates</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy on Personal Income Tax rests on three basic principles. First, personal income tax should never be so high as to become a disincentive to work and enterprise. Second, the tax base should be as wide as practicable in order to drive home the message that the cost of services provided by the Government has to be borne by all citizens. The more citizens we have paying tax, even if it is a nominal amount, the more widespread will be the realization that welfare giveaways ultimately carry a price tag. The third principle is to ensure that inflation does not push income earners into higher tax brackets. Personal Income Tax rates should therefore be revised periodically to correct for inflation \"creep\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rates of personal income tax have been reduced three times since 1978. As a result, the share of personal income tax collections as a proportion of total income tax collections has declined from 34% in 1977 to 23% in 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last reduction in personal income tax rates took effect in Year of Assessment 1982. For the Year of Assessment 1984, I have decided to give a rebate of 10% on the tax payable. The rebate of 10% will more than mitigate the erosion of real incomes by inflation which, according to the Consumer Price Index, rose by 5% between 1981 and 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Year of Assessment 1985, the existing rates of personal tax will be reduced. With your permission, Sir, I would like to table a schedule (Appendix I) (Cols. 469 - 470) which shows the revised income tax rates. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1984/19840302/19840302-HA-0430469.htm\">Appendix I - INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION UNDER REVISED RATES SCHEDULE FROM YEAR OF ASSESSMENT 1985 (Cols. 469 - 470)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the revision of tax rates, I have paid special attention to the middle income groups whose chargeable incomes fall within $10,000 to $100,000. They will enjoy average reductions in income tax ranging from 11.9% to 13.5%. The highest marginal rate has been reduced from 45% to 40% giving reductions of between 8.4% and 9.8% for our biggest taxpayers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates of tax for the first three chargeable income groups, that is, up to chargeable income of $10,000 are, in my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> view, already low enough and will not, therefore, be changed. Instead, I intend to give a flat rebate of 10% on the tax payable in respect of the first $10,000 of chargeable income for Year of Assessment 1985 and future years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue loss as a result of the reduction in tax rates is estimated at $89 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Estate Duty</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Debate last year some Members pointed out that the present structure of Estate Duty is not consistent with Government's philosophy of encouraging people to work hard and save. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Government taking away a big chunk of what the taxpayer has worked so hard in his lifetime to accumulate, the Members felt that it would be more sensible for the taxpayer to spend his income rather than ret the Government take it away when he dies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of Estate Duty therefore encourages consumption and discourages saving. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed Members then that the Ministry of Finance was in the process of reviewing the whole rationale of estate duty and I promised to let Members have more information this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that the Ministry of Finance has completed its analysis and the structure of Estate Duty will be substantially simplified. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there will only be two rates of duty. The first $10 million value of estate chargeable to duty will be taxed at 5% and all subsequent amounts at 10%. This two-tier rate of duty will replace the existing complicated system of remission and taxation with tax rates ranging from 5% to 60%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the exemption limit for residential properties will be revised to $3 million irrespective of the number of residential houses which the deceased owned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the full Central Provident Fund (CPF) balance of the deceased will continue to qualify for exemption. Where the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> CPF balance exceeds $500,000, no further exemption will be given for other assets except for those which qualify for exemption as residential properties. Where the CPF balance does not exceed $500,000, the maximum exemption that will be given for other assets including CPF balance will be $500,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period governing inter vivos gifts will remain at five years. Gifts made within five years preceding the date of death will be liable for estate duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these revisions in the structure of estate duty, it should be unnecessary for the vast majority of our taxpayers to worry at all about estate planning to minimise estate duty liabilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above concessions will take effect from 1 April 1984. The revenue loss will depend on the number and value of estates that will be assessed and for FY 1984 it is estimated to be in the order of $22 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Enhanced Child Relief</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year I increased the enhanced child relief for specially qualified married women to be the normal child relief plus 5% of the woman's annual earned income for each of the first three eligible children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provoked a lively debate among Members. Some felt that the relief was \"peanuts\" and unlikely to persuade highly qualified married women to continue to work and give society the benefit of their talents and abilities. Others suggested that the relief should be extended to all working women or, at the very least, to those categories of married working women who have some form of tertiary training and education although this might not be at the University level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply I stated that I was not convinced that there was a case to extend the enhanced child relief to all working women but there might be merit in the suggestion to widen slightly the present narrow range of qualifications which would entitle married working women to claim the enhanced child relief. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered the matter further and have now come to the conclusion that a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> somewhat more liberal scheme can be justified not only to induce our better educated married women to continue to work but, more important, to encourage them, hopefully, to have a second, if not a third child. This will go a little way towards correcting the present lop-sided pattern of procreation in Singapore which is a cause for concern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided that, with effect from Year of Assessment 1985, the enhanced child relief will be increased to the following amounts: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\nFor the first      Normal child relief plus\r\n\r\n  qualifying       5% of annual earned in-\r\n\r\n  child            come or $10,000 which-\r\n\r\n                   ever is less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the second     Normal child relief plus\r\n\r\n  qualifying       10% .of annual earned in-\r\n\r\n  child            come or $10,000 which-\r\n\r\n                   ever is less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the third      Normal child relief plus\r\n\r\n  qualifying       15% of annual earned in-\r\n\r\n  child            come or $10,000 which-\r\n\r\n                   ever is less.\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>Furthermore the enhanced child relief will be extended to all married women who have successfully completed their secondary school education with at least five \"O\" level passes or who possess equivalent or higher qualifications. This will cover about one-third of our female working force. The loss to revenue is estimated to be $2 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>TAX INCREASES</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I move on to the tax increases. Our overall tax philosophy has been to shift the burden of taxation from personal income tax to tax on consumption particularly on those items which cannot be regarded as comprising the necessities of life. In line with this philosophy I intend to increase the duties on bets, cigarettes, tobacco, beer, stout and samsoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duty on Bets</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present duty on bets is 15% on the amount of bets placed on any totalisator or pari-mutuel promoted by any racing club or association. The duty was last revised \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> on 1 April 1981. It will be further increased to 20% with effect from 1 April 1984. The additional revenue yield is estimated at $26 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Cigarettes and Tobacco</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes and tobacco were raised last year in pursuit of our objective to discourage smoking particularly among our younger population. Consumption was dampened for a few months but quickly picked up and in December last year, consumption of cigarettes and tobacco reached an all-time high. However, we must persevere in this noble cause and not give up. This year I propose to raise the import duty on cigarettes, cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and other tobacco products, which are now at varying rates, to a uniform $60 per kilogram. The excise duty on cigarettes will be increased from $14 per kilogram to $24 per kilogram. Excise duty on cigarettes is payable in addition to the duty of $36 per kilogram on imported leaf tobacco which is used for the manufacture of cigarettes. Excise duty on other tobacco products will be fixed at $60 per kilogram. Details of the revision are set out in Appendix II (Cols. 471 - 472). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1984/19840302/19840302-HA-0430471.htm\">Appendix II - DUTIES ON CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO (Cols. 471 - 472)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision in duties will take effect from today and the yield in revenue is estimated at $43 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Liquors</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excise duties on beer, stout and samsoo have not been raised since 1975. Import duties on beer and samsoo were last raised in 1977 and import duty on stout in 1980. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from today the excise duties on beer and stout will be increased by $6 to $22 per decalitre while the excise duty for samsoo will be raised from $75 per proof decalitre to $100 per proof decalitre. Import duty on beer and stout will also be raised by $6 per decalitre to $33 per decalitre and $45 per decalitre respectively, while import duty on samsoo will be raised by $25 per proof decalitre to $155 per proof decalitre. Details of the revision in import and excise duties on beer, stout \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and samsoo are listed out in Appendix III. (Cols. 473 - 474). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1984/19840302/19840302-HA-0430473.htm\">Appendix III - DUTIES ON LIQUORS (Cols. 473 - 474)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision in duties is expected to yield an additional $38 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Motor Cars</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a word about duties on motor cars. Members will know that one of Government's objectives is to restrain the growth of the motor car population in Singapore in order to contain the problem of congestion on our roads. I had considered increasing registration fees and road tax in this Budget but eventually decided not to do so in view of the substantial increases announced in October last year. I hope, however, that the decrease in personal income tax rates, which I announced earlier, will not lead to an upsurge in purchases of motor cars. Should this happen, Government will have to review the situation and make adjustments accordingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CONCLUSION</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, steering the economy of a nation is a delicate exercise. Holding the brakes full on means there is no progress. On the other hand if you press the accelerator too hard you may end up in the gutter. The trick is to be able to read the weather signs correctly and proceed at a pace which will satisfy the natural aspirations of our people, but which will not result in a nasty crash. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years we, together with the rest of the world, have had to embark on unchartered waters. New perils, protectionism, instability of the international banking system, volatile exchange rates have arisen. While navigating the day-to-day obstacles we have had to make sure that the process of restructuring in our economy is not halted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One consistent theme has recurred: the importance of manpower development, education, training and management-labour cooperation. While the slogans may be new, the theme merely reflects the self-evident truth that Singapore's only resource is her people. How well we utilize our manpower will determine how much \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> progress we can make and how prosperous we will be in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic policies and tax changes which I have outlined today are designed to keep up the momentum of our progress. It will be too much to hope that no new problems lie ahead. Problems and dangers there must be but, provided we do not slacken in our efforts and we work together, we will surmount them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1984 to 31st March, 1985.\" In accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 84, the debate now stands adjourned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate to be resumed on what day, Dr Tan? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> On Monday, 12th March, 1984, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That at its rising today Parliament do stand adjourned to Monday, 12th March, 1984.\" - [Mr E.

One rule bars the raising of matters for which no Minister is responsible and the other bars discussion of matters involving legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust Members will bear this in mind when they raise matters on the adjournment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PARLIAMENT'S AUTHORITY OVER THE EXECUTIVE AND</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RESPONSIBILITIES OF MINISTRIES TO PARLIAMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>5.47 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have asked to speak today on the Motion for the Adjournment on a subject which I consider very important for us to examine in our society. It is not, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure you and the Members, a mere exercise in academics nor is it due to a craving for publicity which I am sure will be attributed to me by our press from the Ministry of Propaganda. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is perhaps appropriate that I should raise this and the subject, of course, is what role do we envisage for Parliament (this body that gathers here in this Chamber) in the task of governing ourselves in Singapore. It is, as I said, perhaps appropriate that we should examine this question because it is possible that before the end of the year there may be elections for a new Parliament, as the life of this Parliament comes to an end. We shall be spending quite a large sum of money in providing for elections to Parliament. Not only that, Parliament itself the institution, costs us something like $6 million annually, paid out of taxpayers' money. So it is not a mere academic exercise. It is perhaps also an economic question - whether the taxpayers are getting value for the $6 million which they are asked to pay every year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question that I propose to ask in these 20 minutes or so is: what is the role that we envisage for Parliament? I hope I will be forgiven if I go back a little and discuss about the role as the originators of parliamentary government saw it. Whether we like it or not, Mr Speaker, Sir, when we decided way back in 1959 to cut our ties with the colonial power, we decided that their system of government was the government most suited for us and we decided to inherit it and to adopt it for our system of government. Therefore, I make no apology for going back to the role and the purpose, as they saw it, of parliament. And I wish, Mr Speaker, Sir, to refer to a book written by Mr Quentin Hogg as he then was and is now the present Lord Chancellor of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> England. The book is entitled \"The Purpose of Parliament\" and that is what I am here about - the purpose of Parliament. After making the point that Parliament is the central feature of our system of government, he goes on to ask the question: what is the purpose of Parliament? And he goes on to say: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is true that Parliament is the body which controls public finance, appoints and dismisses Governments, and under whose authority all our laws are passed.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>And then he goes on to say: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The powers of Parliament are the marks of the successive struggles which had to be undergone before Parliament could achieve its purpose efficiently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, every student of constitutional history will know about the struggles ,- how Parliament fought to be the only body which could raise taxes and that the monarch or the executive might not raise or levy any tax without, first of all, Parliament approving the specific tax. That is all history. But it is important that we should remind ourselves of it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then goes on to say this, Mr Speaker, and that is very apposite for us. He says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Parliament is by its very definition an instrument of discussion.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>And he talks about soldiers in the army, complaining that Parliament seems to do nothing but talk and his explaining to them that that was what Parliament was for. [Laughter] I know it is very amusing to Members of Parliament. But he goes on to explain and I read from him: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The object of Parliament is therefore not primarily efficiency in administration; indeed, in many ways it is obviously less efficient than a dictatorship. It is not even to achieve a logical or perfectly just system of laws, although over a period of centuries k is more likely to achieve this end than any other system of government. Parliament is the device for government by discussion [I repeat that Mr Speaker, Sir] Parliament is the device for government by discussion which Englishmen have developed through centuries in order that they may live in peace and unity with one another.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, he makes the point that you can have government either by force or by discussion and the more preferable, as he concludes, is a government by discussion. Therefore, as he saw it and, as he said, the English saw it when they came up with the idea of Parliament, Parliament was the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> organ which provided for government by discussion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What role do we envisage for our Parliament? Do we, Mr Speaker, Sir, see Parliament as a place for theatrics with little or no relevance to the task of government, as our Prime Minister said not very long ago? I am sorry that he is not here. Or do we see this beautiful building maintained at the expense of the taxpayer again merely as a showpiece for tourists so that tourists who are being conducted around Singapore may be shown this Parliament building and told, \"That is Parliament House in Singapore.\" And they go away feeling, \"Oh, yes, they have got parliamentary democracy in Singapore.\" \"Singapore is one place where they have got parliamentary democracy.\" Do we see Parliament in Singapore as the central feature of the Government in Singapore? Or do we see the Prime Minister's Department as the central feature of the Government? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said about discussion. Do we provide enough discussion in Parliament? Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1982, outside the sittings of Budget in March, which are statutory sittings and which are required by the Constitution, we sat only four afternoons. There were four sittings of Parliament consisting of 4 1/2 - 5 hours each. In 1983, even that was reduced. Outside the Budget sittings in March again, we only had two sittings of Parliament although one sitting lasted over two days when we were debating Medisave. So two sittings in a whole year - is that the purpose for which we have Parliament in Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir? Is that why the taxpayers are asked to cough up $6 million every year? The Members of Parliament alone take up about $3 million of the taxpayers' money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have in Singapore today a situation where taxes are raised, fees are levied, charges are levied, without so much as a word in Parliament. I have said this before. Only not very long ago there was the increase in the taxes on vehicles. Then there was the increase in fees for TV sets and radios, increase in HDB shophouse rentals, and increases in several other things. Has Parliament been consulted? Has there been any discussion in Parliament before these increases were brought about? No. Has there been any \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> discussion even after they were brought about? I know, Mr Speaker, Sir, we do have a provision that all increases shall be laid before Parliament. That provision is there. But what is the result of that? I am the Opposition Member of Parliament and if I wish to raise a motion on that, I cannot because there is nobody else to second the motion. So it goes unraised. I have tried this before without any success. So we cannot get any discussion going in Parliament on these increases. Not only that but, as I have said, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the sole privilege of Parliament to raise taxes. We would seem to have signed away this right which belongs to Parliament, a right which we should jealously guard for ourselves, Members of Parliament. We seem to have signed away this right to Ministers by flat, because in every Act we say, \"The Minister may prescribe the taxes\", \"The Minister may raise them from time to time.\" I was speaking, only this afternoon, about our delegating all our rights to the Executive. So what are we doing as a Parliament elected by the people to watch over the Government of their affairs in this country? Are we not failing in our duty? It is not only the question of taxes, Mr Speaker, Sir. There is the question of expenditure. It would appear that we can commit our taxpayers to spend about $1 billion without even bringing it before Parliament. Should not major expenditure on any item be first brought before Parliament? I ask, what is the role we envisage for Parliament? Is Parliament a white elephant? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other question about policy decisions. The Executive, the Government of the day, makes decisions. We have just recently had a decision, a ruling which affects people's rights, people's privileges. I am, of course, referring to the admission to schools. Has there been any discussion in Parliament before that about the Government policy decision? I could go on and on, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I have only got 20 minutes. But that is the situation as regards Parliament in Singapore today. We have the form of Parliament. We are very good at adopting the various forms. But may I, Mr Speaker, Sir, craving your pardon, read to you what Jennings has to say about this. Jennings is another Constitutional lawyer and he is known to every \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> student of law. And he writes about Parliamentary democracy. He quotes Lord Burleigh who says, \"England can never be ruined but by a Parliament\", that is, when Parliament abdicates its rights. And he quotes Junius who says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We can never really be in danger till the forms of Parliament are made use of to destroy the substance of our civil and political liberties, till Parliament itself betrays its trust [And I repeat, Sir, that Parliament has a sacred trust] to look after the affairs of its citizens by contributing to establish new principles of government and employing the very weapons committed to it by the collective body to stab the Constitution.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>That, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid is what is happening in Singapore. And as Jennings goes on: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The whole constitutional machine is, however, impregnated with the principles of democratic parliamentary government.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>And he says here, Mr Speaker, Sir: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At the peak stands Her Majesty's Opposition, ready and able\". \n  <br>\n  <br>[Laughter], Yes, you may laugh, but if you want parliamentary government, you have got to take note of this: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At the peak stands Her Majesty's Opposition, ready and able to pounce on injustice and oppression even more readily than upon defects of policy.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that since 1963 (or was it 1965) Parliament has consisted of a single party. But whether the Government liked it or not, the people decided in October 1981 that Parliament should no longer continue to consist of a single party. They decided that there should be a Member from another party in Parliament. So Parliament became a dual pany Chamber. Now, we have Standing Orders. I have mentioned this before and I have had no response. I would like to hear from the Leader if he is going to reply to this question. I have said this before. I have been here, as a Member, for now more than two years. Am I on any single Committee of this House? I would like to know from the Leader why is it that the Opposition Member has been excluded from any Committee of this House, because Committees are the agencies through which a lot of the control of Government expenditure can be effected. Committees are the agencies through which checks can be kept on Government executive decisions, and if these Committees do not reflect the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> composition of the House, then Parliament is not serving its purpose. As I see it, Standing Orders say that they must reflect the composition of the House, and so the question may arise as to whether these Committees have been valid since 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have five seconds left. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Five seconds, Mr Speaker, Sir!

That is all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> --- to look into the whole question of the role of Parliament and also about the rights of Members, whether a Member is entitled to information from Ministries. I have been withheld information by Ministries. Is that not a contempt of Parliament? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party has been in power in this House since 1959. This is the most patronizing lecture I have heard about parliamentary democracy since then. He asked a direct question: Why has he not been appointed to any of these Committees? I will tell him why. The relevant Standing Order 95(l)(b) says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Committee of Selection shall consist of the Speaker as Chairman, and seven Members of Parliament to be appointed by Parliament, in such manner as shall ensure that, so far as is possible, the balance between the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Government benches and the Opposition benches in Parliament is reflected in the Committee.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are about seven Committees, for which the same phrase is used, which consist of yourself as Speaker and seven Members of Parliament. Seven times seven is 49. The balance in this House is 74 to one. The hon. Member, therefore, does not qualify. He would be well advised to try and get some other Workers' Party members in this House. When he has a few, then one of them can be sitting on these Committees. But 74 to one, you have no chance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks of the Executive. He talks of the Government ignoring Parliament. We are in power. The Legislature consists of Parliament and the President. In Parliament there are, besides yourself Sir, 73 of us, and one of him. The Executive has been for a long time one-man band consisting of the President and the Cabinet all of whom belong to one Party. On this question of the Executive reporting to Parliament, we have been reporting to ourselves for years. Why should we report to you? If I may say, you are like a one-man band, knocking your own drums, clashing your cymbals and blowing a trumpet. We have been here for a long time. You have not even been here for two years and you tell us that Parliament does not exist in Singapore. We are spending $6 million and for what purpose? Why do you think we came today? To have the Budget. We are having a debate on the Budget, a debate in the Committee of Supply. And when we choose to call Parliament, we will do it on our own wish, not at the beck and call of the hon. Member. We have got work to do. We have got to come here and pass Bills, but not to satisfy him or his conscience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member grumbles that he has not been given enough time. Sir, I have made an estimate of the percentage of time the hon. Member has taken in this House. Of all the Sittings since he was elected to this House, on the average he has taken 13.68%, roughly 13% of the whole time of this House. Does he expect us to give him 50%? We will carry on as in the past. Having listened to his lecture, I know he is a great believer in British institutions. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> do not run British institutions down here. And we cannot follow them to the tee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he asked another question - he wants a Committee to be formed to look into these Committees. I am afraid I cannot agree. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not giving way to you. On a point of order, I will give way to you. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please sit down. He does not give way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> I did not interfere with you. You had 20 minutes. In fact, 22 minutes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You have mis-stated what I said. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not mis-stating. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You are. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Well, state what you want to state. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What I said was that a Committee be appointed, not to look into another Committee, but into the whole question of how Parliament can exercise better control over the Executive. That is very important if you believe in Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Why should Parliament control the Executive? Where in the Constitution does it say that Parliament controls the Executive? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am reading from the Constitution: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The executive authority of Singapore shall be vested in the President and exercisable subject to the provisions of this Constitution by him or by the Cabinet or any Minister authorised by the Cabinet.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>That is the Executive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Legislature, it says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Legislature of Singapore shall consist of the President and Parliament.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is it. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the Parliament controls the Executive. We work together. And as I pointed out to the Member, the Executive is all PAP. This House is nearly all PAP. Who do we report to? The hon. Member? Surely not! [Applause]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now
