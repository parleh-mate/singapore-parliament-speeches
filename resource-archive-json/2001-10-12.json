align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  is in a severe slowdown.  Earlier this week,  George\r\n\r\nYeo  and  Dr Richard Hu announced the third quarter  economic\r\n\r\nresults.  Our economy contracted by 5.6% compared to  a  year\r\n\r\nearlier.   In  annualised  quarter  to  quarter  terms,   the\r\n\r\ncontraction  was  9.9%.  The sustained contraction  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  three  quarters  is  the steepest  that  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th July, the Government announced a package of\r\n\r\nmeasures   worth  $2.2  billion  to  help  Singaporeans   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses cope with the downturn.  BG George Yeo made  clear\r\n\r\nin  his statement in Parliament that this was only an interim\r\n\r\npackage, as the direction of the economy and the severity  of\r\n\r\nthe  downturn  was  still uncertain.   The  Government  would\r\n\r\nmonitor  developments closely, and stood ready to do more  if\r\n\r\nconditions worsened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that interim package, conditions have indeed\r\n\r\nworsened.   This  was  happening even  before  the  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks of 11th September.  But the 11th September\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattacks  caused  major shocks to the US and economies  around\r\n\r\nthe world, both short- and long-term.  The situation is still\r\n\r\nfluid,  and no one can be certain how events will  play  out.\r\n\r\nThe  US  is  in  all probability already in  recession.   For\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  2002,  MTI's best  guess  at  this  moment  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty  is  that  growth next year will  fall  somewhere\r\n\r\nbetween -2% and +2%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 12 to 18 months, we can expect low growth,\r\n\r\nmore  retrenchments and higher unemployment.  Even as we cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  cyclical downturn, we will need to make structural\r\n\r\nchanges  in our economy to adapt ourselves to the permanently\r\n\r\naltered   environment.   Externally  there  will  be  further\r\n\r\ndisruptions,  as  the  US and its coalition  partners  attack\r\n\r\nterrorist   organisations  in  Afghanistan,   with   a   high\r\n\r\nprobability  of  the  terrorists  striking  back.   We   must\r\n\r\ntherefore  psychologically prepare ourselves for a protracted\r\n\r\nperiod of difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Off-Budget Package\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will implement a major package of\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help  the economy to tide  over  the  downturn.\r\n\r\nThese measures fall into eight categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Tax and fee rebates and reductions;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Assistance to local enterprises;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Property market-related measures;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Acceleration of infrastructure projects;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Employment assistance for workers and executives;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Help for the lower income and unemployed;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) New Singapore Shares; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) Measures related to wage costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures should help all Singaporeans, especially\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income earners and the unemployed.   They  should\r\n\r\nalso   help  businesses,  especially  the  small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises.  Let me elaborate on each of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTax and Fee Rebates and Reductions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this category of measures is two-fold.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to encourage enterprise, because the way to recover\r\n\r\nis  for  the  private sector to create new opportunities  and\r\n\r\ngenerate more wealth.  We also want to reduce business costs,\r\n\r\nso that businesses can stay afloat and minimise job losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPromoting a Conducive Environment for Enterprise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorporate Tax Rebates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will grant companies a rebate on their\r\n\r\ncorporate  income  tax payable for Year of  Assessment  2001.\r\n\r\nThe  rebate will be 50% on the first $25,500 of tax  payable,\r\n\r\nand 5% for any subsequent tax payable beyond that.  This will\r\n\r\ncost the Government $570 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Year of Assessment 2002, a corporate tax rebate of\r\n\r\n5% will be granted.  This will cost $405 million.  This is on\r\n\r\ntop  of the lower corporate tax rate of 24.5% and the new tax\r\n\r\nexemption regime announced in the Budget Statement this year,\r\n\r\nwhich also takes effect from Year of Assessment 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These corporate tax rebates will not apply to Singapore\r\n\r\ndividends,  nor  to  income earned by non-resident  companies\r\n\r\nwhich is subject to a final withholding tax.\r\n\r\nPersonal Income Tax Rebate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement this year, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  announced  a  10% personal  income  tax  rebate  for\r\n\r\nresident individuals for Year of Assessment 2001 and a cut in\r\n\r\npersonal income tax rates with effect from Year of Assessment\r\n\r\n2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For YA 2001, the Government will grant a further 5%\r\n\r\npersonal income tax rebate, at a cost of $250 million.   This\r\n\r\nwill bring the total personal income tax rebate for this year\r\n\r\nto  15%, and result in total tax savings of $750 million  for\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For YA 2002, the Government will grant a 10% tax rebate\r\n\r\nat a cost of $400 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non top of the reduction in the personal income tax rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReducing Business Costs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreased  Property Tax Rebates for Commercial and Industrial\r\n\r\nProperties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The July package included a 25% property tax rebate for\r\n\r\ncommercial  and  industrial properties,  for  one  year  with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1st  July 2001.  In view of the  poor  economic\r\n\r\noutlook, we have decided to be more generous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the 25% rebate, the Government will give a\r\n\r\nfixed  rebate of up to $8,000 per year to all commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial properties, plus a further rebate of 30%  for  any\r\n\r\nbalance property tax payable.  This will mean that many  SMEs\r\n\r\nwho  own their premises, including more than 90% of HDB  shop\r\n\r\nowners, will pay no property tax.  The new rebate scheme will\r\n\r\ntake  effect from 1st July this year and end on 31st December\r\n\r\n2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since property tax is payable in advance, owners who\r\n\r\nhave  already paid their tax for the second half of this year\r\n\r\nwill  receive  refunds from IRAS, or if they have  still  not\r\n\r\npaid, IRAS may withdraw their pink slips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total tax savings from this measure is $880 million.\r\n\r\nJTC and HDB will pass on these savings to their tenants.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment encourages other landlords to do so as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduction in Stamp Duty Rates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also decided to reduce stamp duty\r\n\r\nrates by 30% on all instruments.  The new rates will apply to\r\n\r\nchargeable  instruments (basically relating to  property  and\r\n\r\nshare  transactions) executed on or after 13th  October,  and\r\n\r\nexpire  at  the  end  of 2002.  This will reduce  transaction\r\n\r\ncosts   for   businesses  and  individuals  who  enter   into\r\n\r\nagreements  where stamp duty is payable.  It  will  cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment $290 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduction of Petrol Excise Duty and Diesel Tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petrol excise duty is currently pegged at 40% of\r\n\r\npump price, subject to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfloor  rates  that vary for the different grades  of  petrol.\r\n\r\nWith  effect from tomorrow, 13th October, we will reduce  the\r\n\r\npetrol  excise duty from 40% to 35%, and also cut  the  floor\r\n\r\nrates  proportionately  by 5 to  6  cents  per  litre.   This\r\n\r\nmeasure  will  be  in place until the end  of  2002,  and  be\r\n\r\nsubject to review after that.  The Government expects the oil\r\n\r\ncompanies  to pass on the savings arising from the  reduction\r\n\r\nof  excise  duty  fully  and  promptly  to  motorists.   This\r\n\r\nreduction in petrol duty should save motorists $120 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis today pay a Diesel Tax of $5,100 per year. Its\r\n\r\npurpose  is to close the gap between the fuel cost of diesel-powered taxis and petrol-powered private motor cars, since no\r\n\r\nduty  is  imposed  directly on the  sale  of  diesel,  unlike\r\n\r\npetrol.   In  line  with the reduction in the  petrol  excise\r\n\r\nduty, the Government will reduce the Diesel Tax for taxis  by\r\n\r\n$400,  to $4,700.  Revenue loss is $8 million per year.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  expects taxi companies to pass on the savings  to\r\n\r\ntheir taxi drivers by lowering the taxi rental rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad Tax Rebates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also give a one-time $100 road tax\r\n\r\nrebate for cars, taxis, goods vehicles and buses, and a  one-time  $20  road  tax rebate for off-peak cars, weekend  cars,\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  and trailers.  These rebates will be implemented\r\n\r\non 1st January 2002 for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue forgone is $59 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLanding Fee Rebate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the airline industry is reeling from the effects\r\n\r\nof  the 11th September terrorist attacks.  Airlines all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world have been badly affected in terms of passenger and\r\n\r\ncargo loads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the current turmoil in the industry, CAAS\r\n\r\nwill  give  a  10%  rebate on landing fees  to  all  airlines\r\n\r\noperating out of Changi and Seletar Airports.  This will take\r\n\r\neffect  from 15th October 2001, and remain in place  for  one\r\n\r\nyear.  Thereafter, CAAS will review the situation again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction will cost CAAS $20 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance to Local Enterprises\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to measures to help local enterprises.\r\n\r\nLocal  enterprises form a significant part  of  our  economy.\r\n\r\nThey   make  up  more  than  90%  of  the  total  number   of\r\n\r\nestablishments,  and  account for more  than  half  of  total\r\n\r\nemployment.  It is thus important that we help them  to  ease\r\n\r\nthe pain of the economic slowdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved Access to Funds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key issue for local enterprises is access to funds.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  already has in place  the  Local  Enterprise\r\n\r\nFinance   Scheme   (LEFS),  an  affordable,  fixed   interest\r\n\r\nfinancing  programme designed to encourage and  assist  local\r\n\r\nenterprises   to   upgrade,  strengthen  and   expand   their\r\n\r\noperations.   The scheme is administered by the  Productivity\r\n\r\nand  Standards Board (PSB) through 28 participating financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will enhance the LEFS to allow local\r\n\r\nenterprises to have easier access to funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to help SMEs reduce their interest expenses, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will reduce the interest rates for both  new  and\r\n\r\nexisting LEFS loans by up to 1 percentage point, depending on\r\n\r\nthe duration of the loan, for a one-year period starting from\r\n\r\n1st  November  2001.  This will increase  the  interest  rate\r\n\r\nsubsidy from the Government by $38 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to help SMEs access funds as banks become\r\n\r\nmore  cautious in the downturn, the Government will  increase\r\n\r\nits  share  of risk under the LEFS from 70% to  80%  for  new\r\n\r\nloans, for one year, from 1st November 2001.  This will apply\r\n\r\nto all types of LEFS loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the very small companies, a new micro-loan\r\n\r\nprogramme under LEFS will be launched.  To kick it  off,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will increase the loan line by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$250  million over five years and, the interest  subsidy,  by\r\n\r\n$14 million over five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Loan Insurance Scheme will also be launched to help\r\n\r\nSMEs,  especially those who lack collateral or track  record,\r\n\r\nto gain better access to loans.  $6 million will be set aside\r\n\r\nto  pay  for the cost of insurance premium over a  period  of\r\n\r\nfive years.  This should be sufficient to insure $500 million\r\n\r\nin loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhanced  Package  for  Hawkers  under  the  Hawker   Centres\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme (HUP)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has a Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\n(HUP)  to  upgrade  HDB,  JTC  and  ENV  hawker  centres   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and to help stallholders who are not doing well to\r\n\r\nretire  from the business.  When a hawker centre is upgraded,\r\n\r\nstallholders  who  qualify are given  the  option  either  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  the upgraded centres, or to take ex-gratia  cash\r\n\r\ngrants  and  give up their trade.  If the centre is  selected\r\n\r\nfor  standard  upgrading, then first-generation  stallholders\r\n\r\nwho  are  62  or older, qualify for the cash grant.   If  the\r\n\r\ncentre is selected for re-configuration and re-building, then\r\n\r\nall   first-generation  stallholders,  regardless   of   age,\r\n\r\nqualify.  The cash grant for a market stallholder is $15,000,\r\n\r\nand that for a cooked food stallholder is $19,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the cash grant option more attractive, we will\r\n\r\nraise  the  ex-gratia payments from $15,000  to  $18,000  for\r\n\r\nmarket  stallholders, and from $19,000 to $23,000 for  cooked\r\n\r\nfood stallholders.  Furthermore, we will relax the qualifying\r\n\r\ncriteria, to offer the grants to all first-generation hawkers\r\n\r\nregardless of age, for all HUP programmes, whether the centre\r\n\r\nundergoes  a  re-configure or re-build, or  just  a  standard\r\n\r\nupgrade.  This will apply to all stallholders affected by the\r\n\r\nHUP since 1st July 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will select 10 more hawker centres for\r\n\r\nthe  HUP,  in  addition to the 19 centres  already  selected.\r\n\r\nThese measures will help the less viable hawkers to exit, and\r\n\r\nallow more enterprising ones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto come in and make full use of the upgraded centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also implement other measures to\r\n\r\nhelp  hawkers.  These include staggered increase in rent  for\r\n\r\nthose who are due to pay market rents, subsidised rental  for\r\n\r\nhawkers  renting alternative stalls in another hawker  centre\r\n\r\nduring  the  period  when their own centres  are  closed  for\r\n\r\nupgrading, a removal allowance for all stallholders who  wish\r\n\r\nto return to the upgraded centres, and further rental rebates\r\n\r\nfor  stallholders paying market rentals in all hawker centres\r\n\r\nfrom 1st November 2001 to 31st December 2002.\r\n\r\nLand and Property-related Measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the external outlook uncertain and the economy in\r\n\r\nrecession,  the  property market has  been  in  decline.   No\r\n\r\nGovernment  can guarantee to maintain property prices,  which\r\n\r\nhave  to vary with market conditions and the property  cycle.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Singapore, the Government is a major supplier  of\r\n\r\nland  for  property development.  The Government,  therefore,\r\n\r\nshould  try  to  phase  its land sales to  be  a  stabilising\r\n\r\ninfluence on the property market, and avoid doing anything to\r\n\r\nexacerbate an over-supply situation.\r\n\r\nGovernment Land Sales Programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has reviewed its land sales programme for\r\n\r\n2001 and 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For residential sites, there are currently two sites\r\n\r\nwhere  tenders  have  been launched and will  close  in  end-October  2001.   The  Government  will  proceed  with   these\r\n\r\ntenders.  Interested tenderers may have expended much  effort\r\n\r\nin preparing their bids, and the Government should not change\r\n\r\nthe  rules  mid-stream.  We will award  the  tenders  if  the\r\n\r\nrespective reserve prices are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will withhold the launch of the\r\n\r\nlast   four  sites  in  the  Confirmed  List  of  the  2H2001\r\n\r\nGovernment Land Sales Programme, originally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanned  for  release  later this  year.   Instead,  it  will\r\n\r\ntransfer these sites to the Reserve List.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2002, the Government will suspend the sale of\r\n\r\nresidential  and  commercial sites from the  Confirmed  List.\r\n\r\nHowever,  sites will still be made available on  the  Reserve\r\n\r\nList,  and interested parties can apply to the Government  to\r\n\r\nrelease  them  for sale.  This will provide  flexibility,  in\r\n\r\ncase market conditions improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also defer all sale of industrial\r\n\r\nland for the rest of 2001 and for 2002.  In addition, we will\r\n\r\nextend  the  Project  Completion Period  for  all  Government\r\n\r\nindustrial  land  sale  projects.  Currently,  developers  of\r\n\r\nindustrial sites are granted Project Completion Periods of  8\r\n\r\nor  10 years.  This will be extended by 2 years for land sale\r\n\r\nsites already awarded, thus increasing the Project Completion\r\n\r\nPeriods to 10 or 12 years.\r\n\r\nAnti-Speculative Measures on Property\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, at the peak of a property boom, the Government\r\n\r\nintroduced  anti-speculation  measures  to  cool   down   the\r\n\r\nproperty   market.   These  proved  timely   and   effective.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,  when conditions changed,  most  of  the  anti-speculation  measures were lifted.  However, a  few  measures\r\n\r\nhave  remained, notably the income tax on gains from sale  of\r\n\r\nproperty  within three years of purchase, the restriction  on\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  borrowing  in  Singapore  dollars  to   finance\r\n\r\nproperty  purchases, and the 80% limit on  bank  lending  for\r\n\r\nmortgage loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of this comprehensive package, the Government\r\n\r\nhas reviewed these remaining anti-speculative measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, part of the gains from the sale of property\r\n\r\nwithin  three years of purchase is subject to income  tax  at\r\n\r\nthe  individual  or corporate tax rates.  The Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  remove income tax on gains from  such  sales  of\r\n\r\nproperties contracted on or after 13th October 2001.  In  the\r\n\r\npresent market, there may not be much gains from the sale  of\r\n\r\nsuch  properties, but you never can tell;  it  may  lift  the\r\n\r\nmood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, each Permanent Resident is limited to one\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar loan to purchase a residential property  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for owner-occupation.  Foreigners who are  not  PRs\r\n\r\nand non-Singapore companies are not allowed to obtain housing\r\n\r\nloans  in  Singapore  dollars.  These  restrictions  will  be\r\n\r\nlifted  with immediate effect.  Over the last few years,  MAS\r\n\r\nhas  progressively  lifted restrictions on  Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\nlending  to  foreigners which are not critical for  stability\r\n\r\nreasons,  and  this restriction on Singapore  dollar  housing\r\n\r\nloans is one of the few remaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government has decided not to lift the 80%\r\n\r\nloan-to-valuation   financing  limit  for   mortgage   loans.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  rule was introduced in a property  boom,  its\r\n\r\npurpose  was  not only anti-speculative, but also prudential.\r\n\r\nThe requirement that the owner of the property puts up 20% of\r\n\r\nthe  value in cash ensures a sufficient level of owner equity\r\n\r\nin  the property.  It lowers the risk of default, and reduces\r\n\r\nthe likely loss to the bank in case of a default and a forced\r\n\r\nsale of the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow banks to lend more than 80% of the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  property, it would be necessary to  introduce\r\n\r\nsome  form of mortgage insurance for the portion of the  loan\r\n\r\nexceeding 80% of the value.  However, such mortgage insurance\r\n\r\ndoes  not  presently exist in Singapore, and we do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether it is feasible.  MAS is studying the matter,  but  it\r\n\r\nis  not  likely that we can introduce such mortgage insurance\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExemption of Property Tax for Land under Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the Government allowed property tax exemption\r\n\r\nfor  land under development in view of the difficulties faced\r\n\r\nby  the  property sector. This measure was withdrawn  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  of  2000 when the property  market  showed\r\n\r\nsigns of recovery and transaction volume picked up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure will be reinstated with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nHowever, the property\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax exemption will be given for a period of two years instead\r\n\r\nof  five years.  Projects that start foundation works  on  or\r\n\r\nafter today will qualify for exemption from property tax from\r\n\r\nthe  date of commencement of foundation works until the  date\r\n\r\nof   Temporary  Occupation  Permit  or  11th  October   2003,\r\n\r\nwhichever is earlier.  For projects that have already started\r\n\r\nfoundation  works, the period of exemption  will  start  from\r\n\r\ntoday.   The Government will monitor the property market  and\r\n\r\neconomic   conditions  and  review  whether  to  extend   the\r\n\r\nexemption  after two years.  The revenue loss is $70  million\r\n\r\nper year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRental Rebates for Commercial and Industrial Tenants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Government agencies will also be extending\r\n\r\nassistance to tenants of properties under their charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC, for example, will give a 50% reduction in\r\n\r\nrefurbishment  charge for upfront payment lessees.   It  will\r\n\r\nalso  reduce the required rental security deposits from three\r\n\r\nto  two  months for tenants and TOL holders who make  payment\r\n\r\nthrough  GIRO.   A further 10% rental rebate  will  be  given\r\n\r\nacross the board to all JTC tenants until December 2002, with\r\n\r\neffect from November 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help tenants of HDB commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nproperties,  HDB  will  extend the existing  rental  rebates,\r\n\r\nranging  from  10%-30%, to December 2002.  HDB  will  give  a\r\n\r\nfurther   10%  rental  rebate  to  all  HDB  commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  tenants, from 1st November 2001 to 31st  December\r\n\r\n2002.   In addition, for tenants whose rent is being adjusted\r\n\r\nto  market rate, HDB will spread out the rental increase over\r\n\r\nthe remaining term of their tenancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will benefit 8,400 tenants of HDB\r\n\r\ncommercial  properties and 10,200 tenants of  HDB  industrial\r\n\r\nproperties.  They will cost the Government an estimated  $103\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Government agencies and statutory boards will also\r\n\r\nbe  extending rental rebates to their tenants.

This way, we will take advantage  of\r\n\r\nlower prices, help the economy, create some jobs, and enhance\r\n\r\nour long-term capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies have identified more than 100\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  projects  that  can  be  implemented  quickly\r\n\r\nwithin  the next 18 months.  These include upgrading the  NUS\r\n\r\ncampus,  expanding NTU teaching facilities, and  constructing\r\n\r\nnew  polyclinics  and  hospitals, such  as  the  Jurong  West\r\n\r\nPolyclinic and Simei Community Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, accelerating these projects will inject some\r\n\r\n$3.5  billion into the economy, with $280 million coming  on-stream in FY2001, $1.1 billion in FY2002 and $2.1 billion  in\r\n\r\nFY2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment Assistance for Workers and Executives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to helping people find jobs. More\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  being  retrenched,  and  those   who   are\r\n\r\nunemployed are finding it harder to find new jobs.   This  is\r\n\r\nboth  because of the economic slowdown, and also  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  restructuring  of our  economy.   Many  more  are\r\n\r\nanxious  that  they  too  may  lose  their  jobs,  and   find\r\n\r\nthemselves  in the same difficulty.  Older workers  face  the\r\n\r\nmost serious problem, because they find it harder to adapt to\r\n\r\nnew    jobs,    and   they   also   carry   heavier    family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important part of this package is, therefore, to help\r\n\r\nthese  retrenched and unemployed workers.  The main  approach\r\n\r\nis  to  encourage  and  fund training  and  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   These are critical for life-long employability,\r\n\r\nand  are  the  real  antidote to unemployment.   Workers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives with up-to-date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskills have a better chance of finding good jobs, and a lower\r\n\r\nrisk  of redundancy.  Therefore, we must help as many workers\r\n\r\nand executives as possible to upgrade quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has set up a Taskforce on Employment, led by Mr\r\n\r\nHeng  Chee  How, Deputy Secretary General of the NTUC.   This\r\n\r\nTaskforce has recommended to the Government several  measures\r\n\r\nto promote worker training and upgrading.  The Government has\r\n\r\naccepted these recommendations and will give its full support\r\n\r\nto the work of the Taskforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpansion of People for Jobs Traineeship Programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taskforce has recommended that the Government expand\r\n\r\nthe People for Jobs Traineeship Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower introduced this as a pilot\r\n\r\nprogramme  in June.  It is a vocational conversion  programme\r\n\r\nfor  older workers that seeks to help unemployed workers aged\r\n\r\n40   and   above  to  make  career  transitions.    Companies\r\n\r\nparticipating  in the programme set up traineeship/mentorship\r\n\r\narrangements  to help newly recruited older  workers  to  fit\r\n\r\ninto  their  new  jobs  and new work environment.   For  each\r\n\r\nunemployed  older  worker  that  the  participating   company\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  places, the company receives 50%  wage  support\r\n\r\nper month, up to a maximum of $600, for three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the experience gathered from the pilot\r\n\r\nprogramme, there is keen interest from employers.  Presently,\r\n\r\n60  companies are participating in the programme.  Many  more\r\n\r\ncompanies have indicated that they will also come forward  if\r\n\r\nmore funding support is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to extend the benefits of this programme beyond\r\n\r\nlower  income  production workers,  to  skilled  workers  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  staff.  Unemployment among this group is  rising,\r\n\r\nas  industries  consolidate  and restructure,  and  companies\r\n\r\nstreamline  operations to reduce layers of middle management.\r\n\r\nWe cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslow  down  this  restructuring, but we  can  and  will  help\r\n\r\naffected workers to find new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will expand the scale of the \"People for\r\n\r\nJobs Traineeship Programme\" significantly.  It will raise the\r\n\r\nceiling  on  the 50% wage support from $600 to $2,000,  which\r\n\r\nwill cover skilled workers and management staff.  If you earn\r\n\r\n$4,000, then the scheme will cover half of your salary, which\r\n\r\nis  $2,000, which is a significant proportion and  $4,000  is\r\n\r\nenough to cover quite a number of people in the middle levels\r\n\r\n-  skilled workers, junior executives, secretaries  -  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  having the most transition problems now.   We  will\r\n\r\nalso lengthen the period of support from three to six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced programme will run for one year, starting\r\n\r\nfrom  1st November 2001.  $200 million will be set aside  for\r\n\r\nthis enhancement.  This will cater to some 20,000 traineeship\r\n\r\nplaces.   Whether  all  the places  will  be  taken  up  will\r\n\r\neventually  depend  on the employers and  on  the  unemployed\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhancement of Skills Redevelopment Programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC Taskforce has also recommended that the\r\n\r\nGovernment enhance the Skills Redevelopment Programme to make\r\n\r\nit  more  attractive for employers to hold  and  train  their\r\n\r\nworkers and for unemployed workers to upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation. Currently,\r\n\r\nunemployed workers and workers on temporary layoff  attending\r\n\r\nfull-time   and  part-time  SRP  training  receive   training\r\n\r\nallowances.   The  Government  will  increase  this  training\r\n\r\nallowance. For those taking full-time courses, this allowance\r\n\r\nwill  increase from the current $600 per month to 75% of  the\r\n\r\nlast  drawn salary, or $1,000 per month, whichever is  lower.\r\n\r\nThose   on  part-time  courses   will  have  their  allowance\r\n\r\nincreased from $3.80 to $5.70 per hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who send their workers for training receive\r\n\r\nabsentee payroll support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the SRP.  This will also be increased to either  $6.10\r\n\r\nor  $6.90  per hour per worker, depending on the age  of  the\r\n\r\nworker.  These enhancements to the SRP will be for one  year,\r\n\r\nstarting on 1st November 2001 and they will cost $41 million.\r\n\r\nIncreased SDF Funding Support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the improvements to the SRP, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will increase funding support for training through\r\n\r\nthe Skills Development Fund (SDF).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SDF supports 80% of the fees for\r\n\r\ncertifiable  skills  training  from  courses.  This  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased  to  90%, for one year starting from  1st  November\r\n\r\n2001.   With  this increased support, the value of commitment\r\n\r\nfor  certifiable  courses is projected to  be  $200  million,\r\n\r\ngenerating 210,000 training places for the one-year period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signal its continued commitment to worker training,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will  also make a  one-off  top-up  of  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  to the SDF.  This is expected to support 1.9 million\r\n\r\ntraining places in total over three years.  With the  top-up,\r\n\r\nthe  SDF  can  further  intensify  its  promotion  of  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading,  particularly in certifiable  skills.  Efforts  in\r\n\r\ncontinuing education and training will also be stepped up.\r\n\r\nMatching Grant for NTUC Education and Training Fund\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC set up an Education and Training Fund (N-ETF)\r\n\r\nin  October  1998.  Since then, the Fund has  supported  over\r\n\r\n57,000  training  places, with nearly 20,000 training  places\r\n\r\nsupported in the year 2000 alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N-ETF is an endowment fund with $40 million,\r\n\r\ncomprising $10 million raised by the labour movement, and a 3-to-1  matching  grant  of $30 million  from  the  Government.\r\n\r\nEarnings  from the Fund are used to support the  training  of\r\n\r\nunion  members  in  approved  courses.   The  Taskforce   has\r\n\r\nproposed, and the Government has agreed, to inject a  further\r\n\r\n$15 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto the N-ETF, on the same 3-to-1 matching basis.\r\n\r\nIntensification of Employment Assistance Services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the economic downturn and the larger numbers of\r\n\r\nunemployed, there are still jobs which go unfilled because of\r\n\r\nmismatches in expectations between employers and job seekers.\r\n\r\nMOM  has organised many job fairs but often with discouraging\r\n\r\nresults.   We must strive harder to improve our job  matching\r\n\r\nefforts  and  promote  available  job  opportunities  to  the\r\n\r\nunemployed.   CareerLink, MOM's one-stop career centre,  will\r\n\r\nbe  beefed  up  to  meet the increased demand  of  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans for job assistance.  In addition, the employment\r\n\r\nassistance  services  of the distributed CareerLink  network,\r\n\r\nconsisting of the Community Development Councils (CDCs), self-help  groups,  NTUC  and  the  Singapore  Professionals'  and\r\n\r\nExecutives' Cooperative (SPEC) will be strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign Worker Policy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As job prospects have diminished, there have been more\r\n\r\ncalls  for  the  Government to limit the  inflow  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers in order to protect Singaporean jobs.  But this would\r\n\r\nbe  counterproductive.  It is a fallacy to imagine  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  contains  a  fixed number  of  jobs  so  that  every\r\n\r\nforeigner   takes  away  one  Singaporean's  job.    Properly\r\n\r\nmanaged,  the admission of foreign workers actually helps  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more  jobs  and  to protect some  existing  jobs  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of foreign workers is perhaps most sensitive\r\n\r\nin  the  middle  levels of the job market,  ie,  the  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  and  professionals.  This group of  foreign  workers\r\n\r\noften  competes directly with Singaporeans who  have  similar\r\n\r\ntraining and skills.  But our economy needs them, just as  it\r\n\r\nneeds  construction  workers, domestic  workers  and  factory\r\n\r\nworkers  at the lower end, and top-notch scientists, managers\r\n\r\nand professionals at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach to managing foreign workers\r\n\r\nand foreign talent is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol tightly the lower end of the skills spectrum, and  to\r\n\r\nrelax  the  restrictions  progressively  for  higher  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers and professionals.  This approach is sound.  In  this\r\n\r\ndownturn,   we   should  not  turn  foreign   workers   away,\r\n\r\nparticularly  skilled  workers.  That  would  hurt  ourselves\r\n\r\ndirectly.  It  would also damage our reputation  as  an  open\r\n\r\nsociety which welcomes talent from around the world, which we\r\n\r\nhave taken many years to build up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can and should do instead is to judiciously\r\n\r\ntighten the criteria for skilled workers and professionals so\r\n\r\nthat  we  raise the quality of the foreign workers  who  come\r\n\r\nhere  to  help  Singapore compete for global investments  and\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  quality of foreign  manpower  admitted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   compatible  with  our  level   of   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decade since 1990, the skills and educational\r\n\r\nprofiles  of  the local workforce have improved tremendously.\r\n\r\nThe  profile of foreign manpower admitted should  not  retard\r\n\r\nthe  improvement  of  our workforce  profile.   Instead,  the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker profile should be compatible with the  rising\r\n\r\nneed of industries for more skilled workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, criteria for employment passes. Foreigners with\r\n\r\nacceptable degrees, professional qualifications or specialist\r\n\r\nskills generally work in Singapore on employment passes.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will raise the minimum salary to qualify  for  an\r\n\r\nemployment  pass from $2,000 to $2,500 with effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nDecember  2001.   $2,500  will  be  comparable  with  current\r\n\r\nstarting salaries of local graduates.  This higher salary cut-off  will  apply  to  new employment pass  applications,  and\r\n\r\nemployment pass holders who change employers on or after  1st\r\n\r\nDecember  2001.   Those who continue to work  with  the  same\r\n\r\nemployer  will  be  allowed to renew their employment  passes\r\n\r\ngenerally unless there are some other reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, criteria for work permits which attract low\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy.  We have a two-tier levy system for work\r\n\r\npermits  - a higher levy for unskilled workers, and  a  lower\r\n\r\nlevy  for  those  who  are  better qualified.   Hitherto,  to\r\n\r\nqualify for a low levy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  permit,  a  person  needed NTC-3 (practical)  technical\r\n\r\nqualifications,  or  other  academic  qualifications   deemed\r\n\r\nacceptable.  Currently, more than half of work permit holders\r\n\r\nare  on  low levy, but a large proportion have low  education\r\n\r\nqualifications.  We will be raising the qualifying  standards\r\n\r\nfor  low  levy work permit holders to ensure that  a  greater\r\n\r\nproportion  of them have at least completed secondary  school\r\n\r\neducation or possess NTC-3 (practical) qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the change in the salary criterion for\r\n\r\nemployment pass holders, the new criteria for low  levy  work\r\n\r\npermits will be effected for new work permit applications, or\r\n\r\nthose who change employers on or after 1st December 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHelping the Lower Income and Unemployed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the economic measures above, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  extend  a  helping  hand  to  lower  income\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  or  those who have lost their  jobs.   They  are\r\n\r\nhardest  hit, and they need assistance the most to tide  over\r\n\r\nthis difficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFreeze in Undergraduate and Polytechnic Tuition Fees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help students whose families are affected by the\r\n\r\nslowdown, the Academic Year 2002 tuition fees for polytechnic\r\n\r\nand  undergraduate  courses,  including  medical  and  dental\r\n\r\ncourses, will be frozen at the existing levels.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education will review the fees for Academic Year 2003  in\r\n\r\nthe  second  half  of 2002.  The total revenue  loss  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is $16 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many graduates are finding it difficult to get a job\r\n\r\nafter  graduation, and so face difficulty in  repaying  their\r\n\r\ntuition fee loans and study loans.  Foreign students who took\r\n\r\nup tuition grants with a three-year bond to work in Singapore\r\n\r\nfind  that  they cannot fulfil their obligations not  because\r\n\r\nthey do not want to, but because the job market has shrunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to suspend for one\r\n\r\nyear, repayment of tuition fee loans and study loans for  all\r\n\r\nuniversity  and polytechnic graduates from 1st November  2001\r\n\r\nto 31st October 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Singaporean graduates of our universities and\r\n\r\npolytechnics who had received tuition grants are required  to\r\n\r\nserve  a  three-year employment bond in Singapore.   We  will\r\n\r\nallow them to suspend this bond for one year if they fail  to\r\n\r\nfind  a  job upon graduation or lose their present job during\r\n\r\ntheir  three-year  bond period.  After the  suspension,  they\r\n\r\nwill be required to serve out the rest of their bond period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEasing Cash Flow of New HDB Flat Buyers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that new HDB flat buyers may\r\n\r\nhave  cash  flow problems during this downturn.   To  address\r\n\r\nthis  problem,  HDB  will  extend its  Staggered  Downpayment\r\n\r\nScheme  to all first-time flat applicants from November  2001\r\n\r\nto   December  2002.   Under  the  scheme,  first-time   flat\r\n\r\napplicants can pay for the 20% downpayment in two stages, 10%\r\n\r\nat  the  signing of Sales Agreement and another  10%  at  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  keys, which could be two  years  later.   The\r\n\r\nestimated loss in interest is $10.5 million for 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will also provide a contra-facility to lessees who\r\n\r\nhave  submitted resale applications for their existing  flats\r\n\r\nand  are  buying new HDB flats that are completed or  nearing\r\n\r\ncompletion.  This will enable them to use their cash and  CPF\r\n\r\nproceeds  from the sale of their existing flats  to  purchase\r\n\r\nthe new HDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Assistance for HDB Mortgages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has earlier put in place financial\r\n\r\nassistance  measures for HDB flat lessees  with  difficulties\r\n\r\nserving  their  mortgage  loans as a  result  of  wage  cuts,\r\n\r\nretrenchment or business failure.  The measures  include  the\r\n\r\nReduced  Repayment  Scheme,  deferment  of  monthly  mortgage\r\n\r\npayment for six to 12 months, and extension of loan repayment\r\n\r\nperiod.  These measures will continue to help HDB lessees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilities Bills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporean households are concerned about high\r\n\r\nutilities   bills,   especially   electricity   bills.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment is mindful of their concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World oil prices have recently been falling. This has\r\n\r\nenabled Power Supply to reduce electricity tariffs by 4% with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1st November 2001.  On top of  this,  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  2002,  the Energy Market Authority will  reduce  the\r\n\r\nprice  cap  for  the large generation companies.   This  will\r\n\r\nmoderate their market power, and we can then expect tariff to\r\n\r\nfall  further  by  about 6%, assuming oil  prices  remain  at\r\n\r\ncurrent  levels.   This translates to $270 million  worth  of\r\n\r\nsavings in electricity bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in this year's Budget, the Government gave\r\n\r\nrebates on utilities bills as part of a new \"Utilities  Save\"\r\n\r\nscheme,  designed to help the lower income.  The rebates  are\r\n\r\n$350  for  households living in 1- to 3-room HDB flats,  $300\r\n\r\nfor  those  in  4-room flats, and $250 for  those  in  5-room\r\n\r\nflats.   The  Government will now extend the  Utilities  Save\r\n\r\nscheme  for another year, until April 2003.  This  will  cost\r\n\r\n$226 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtension of Service and Conservancy Rebates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Government has been extending\r\n\r\nService  and  Conservancy  (S&C) rebates  for  HDB  1-5  room\r\n\r\nhouseholds.   These rebates are graduated according  to  flat\r\n\r\nsize  to  help  the lower income households.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  now extend the S&C rebates for another year.

The  Government  will\r\n\r\nextend  the existing rent-free period and rental rebates  for\r\n\r\none more financial year, to 31st March 2003, at a cost of  $8\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhancement  of  the Rental and Utilities  Assistance  Scheme\r\n\r\n(RUAS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development and Sports\r\n\r\nadministers  the  Rental and Utilities Assistance  Scheme  to\r\n\r\nhelp   families  in  rental  HDB  flats  who  need  temporary\r\n\r\nfinancial aid in their payments for rent, utilities,  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges.  The assistance is for six  months,\r\n\r\nto be reviewed thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will raise the subsidy amounts and the\r\n\r\nincome eligibility criteria of this Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, MCDS will extend temporary financial\r\n\r\nassistance   to  lower-income  HDB  flat  owners   who   face\r\n\r\ndifficulty  paying  utilities and maintenance  charges.   The\r\n\r\nassistance will be for three months in the first instance, to\r\n\r\nbe reviewed further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These temporary financial assistance measures will cost\r\n\r\n$5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHospitalisation Fee Assistance Scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have comprehensive arrangements to help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  meet  their  medical costs,  through  MediSave,\r\n\r\nMediShield and Medifund.  Nevertheless, many Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nstill  concerned  that they will fall ill  and  need  to  pay\r\n\r\nsubstantial  medical bills during the economic downturn.   To\r\n\r\nease their worries, the Government will give a 10% rebate  on\r\n\r\nall  class  B2  and C hospital bills, and on  subsidised  day\r\n\r\nsurgery,  to citizens and their immediate family members.   A\r\n\r\nsimilar rebate scheme was implemented in 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will give more fee\r\n\r\nassistance  to  patients  whose  family  circumstances   have\r\n\r\nchanged.   Retrenched Singapore citizens and their  immediate\r\n\r\nfamily members can apply for additional help to cover another\r\n\r\n40% of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  bills.   This would apply to the families of  citizens\r\n\r\nwho have been retrenched on or after 1st January 2000.  Thus,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  10%  rebate,  retrenched  citizens  will\r\n\r\neffectively  enjoy  a 50% reduction in their  hospitalisation\r\n\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fee assistance scheme will be implemented from 1st\r\n\r\nNovember 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic Downturn Relief Scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the above measures, some Singaporeans may\r\n\r\nstill  face  financial difficulties, because they  have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs, or because of family circumstances.   We  should\r\n\r\ntake a targeted approach at helping unemployed and retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  This is far more discriminating and  sensitive\r\n\r\nthan across-the-board unemployment dole or welfare, which not\r\n\r\nonly  is  a  heavy  burden  on  the  State,  but  can  easily\r\n\r\ndiscourage  people from seeking new jobs, thus worsening  the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem that it hopes to alleviate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce a new initiative, the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Downturn Relief Scheme (EDRS).  Under this  Scheme,\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative  Committees (CCCs)  will  help  needy\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to meet essential expenses, such as school fees,\r\n\r\nschool transport and food.  The CCCs may, after investigating\r\n\r\nthe  cases,  provide up to $200 per month of  assistance  for\r\n\r\nthree months, to be reviewed thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDRS would be helpful to families whose breadwinner\r\n\r\nhas  been  retrenched, or whose breadwinner has  fallen  ill.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  should  stress that the  assistance  is  not  an\r\n\r\nautomatic entitlement.  The CCCs will investigate each  case,\r\n\r\nand  decide whether the applicant merits assistance  and,  if\r\n\r\nso, how much and for how long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $20 million for the\r\n\r\nScheme.  The CCCs can apply for funding from this sum,  based\r\n\r\non  their needs.  Disbursement to the CCCs will be supervised\r\n\r\nby  an  EDRS  Committee, to be chaired by Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen,\r\n\r\nSenior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary in the Prime Minister's  Office  and\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme will be implemented with effect from 1st\r\n\r\nNovember 2001, and run for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Singapore Shares\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Singapore Shares scheme is a new initiative to\r\n\r\ngive   Singaporeans  a  share  in  our  future   growth   and\r\n\r\nprosperity.  The distribution is specially weighted in favour\r\n\r\nof less well-off Singaporeans to help them during the current\r\n\r\ndownturn.   The Prime Minister had announced this  scheme  at\r\n\r\nthe National Day Rally in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give New Singapore Shares to\r\n\r\ncitizens  on 1st November 2001.  Everyone receiving  the  CPF\r\n\r\nTop-up  will  automatically also receive  the  New  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares.  Adult Singaporeans not receiving the CPF Top-up  can\r\n\r\nalso  receive the New Singapore Shares on 1st November  2001,\r\n\r\nprovided  they contribute at least $50 to their CPF  accounts\r\n\r\nbetween  1st  January this year and 15th  October  2001,  ie,\r\n\r\nMonday.   We  will  make special arrangements  to  issue  New\r\n\r\nSingapore Shares to Singaporeans who miss this deadline,  but\r\n\r\ncontribute $50 to their CPF accounts by the end of the  year.\r\n\r\nThis $50 contribution is not a co-payment for the shares, but\r\n\r\na  way to ensure that the shares are not given to dormant  or\r\n\r\n\"dead\"  CPF  accounts.   The New Singapore Shares  themselves\r\n\r\nwill be distributed free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Singapore Shares will be worth $1 per share.\r\n\r\nThe  shares  will earn annual dividends for five years,  from\r\n\r\n2002 to 2007.  The dividend rate will be a guaranteed minimum\r\n\r\nof  3% per annum.  In addition, bonus dividends equal to  the\r\n\r\nreal GDP growth rate of the preceding year (provided that  it\r\n\r\nis above zero) will be declared annually.  The dividends will\r\n\r\nbe in the form of bonus shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares will not be transferable or tradable.\r\n\r\nHowever,  citizens  can cash them in with the  Government  at\r\n\r\nface  value,  for $1 per share.  In the first 12 months,  ie,\r\n\r\nbefore  1st  November 2002, citizens may cash in up  to  half\r\n\r\ntheir shares.  After that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens can cash in their shares at any time without  limit.\r\n\r\nCitizens  who keep their New Singapore Shares until  maturity\r\n\r\nwill  earn  the maximum amount of dividends.   On  1st  March\r\n\r\n2007, the shares will mature.  The Government will redeem  in\r\n\r\ncash all shares still outstanding at $1 per share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each qualifying citizen will receive a basic allocation\r\n\r\nof  shares,  the  number to depend on his  income  level  and\r\n\r\nhousing  type.  In addition, two groups of Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nreceive  bonus shares  on top of their basic allocation,  and\r\n\r\nthese are the elderly and the NSmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the New Singapore Shares scheme is\r\n\r\n$2.7 billion.   The Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, will\r\n\r\nprovide full details of the scheme on 16th October 2001,  ie,\r\n\r\non Tuesday, including who will get how much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasures Related to Wage Costs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNWC Recommendations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC, in its recommendations in May, noted that with\r\n\r\nthe  economic  slowdown in the US and regional uncertainties,\r\n\r\nSingapore  should take a cautious approach in  managing  wage\r\n\r\ncosts, and that wage increases this year should be lower than\r\n\r\nthe  wage  increases  last year.  It divided  companies  into\r\n\r\nthree  groups:  group (A) companies which are profitable  and\r\n\r\nperforming well;  group (B) companies which are making  lower\r\n\r\nprofits  and  facing  uncertain  prospects;  and  group   (C)\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are incurring losses and performing  poorly.\r\n\r\nFor  the  last  group,  group (C), the NWC  recommended  wage\r\n\r\nfreeze or appropriate cost reduction measures, including wage\r\n\r\ncuts through the variable component.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With conditions much bleaker now than in May, the\r\n\r\ncautious  approach  recommended by  the  NWC  is  now  doubly\r\n\r\njustified.   The NWC's specific recommendations for  each  of\r\n\r\ngroups  A, B and C companies remain appropriate, but now  far\r\n\r\nmore  companies are likely to fall into group B and group  C.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  overall,  economy-wide,  we  should  expect  wage\r\n\r\nsettlements to be restrained or, in many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases, frozen.  Workers should be prepared for lower bonuses,\r\n\r\nwage cuts through the variable component or, at best, minimal\r\n\r\nwage increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual  Variable  Component (AVC) and Non-Pensionable  Annual\r\n\r\nAllowance (NPAA)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil service salaries have included an annual variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  since 1988, with payments made in the  middle  and\r\n\r\nend  of  the year.  Last year, the annual variable  component\r\n\r\nwas 1 3/4 months  -   3/4 month paid out in July and one month\r\n\r\npaid out in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the civil service paid 3/4 month of AVC in\r\n\r\nJuly.  In view of the current conditions, the Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  that  there  will not be any year-end  AVC  payment.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for  Division II, III and IV civil  servants  whose\r\n\r\nsalaries  are lower, the Government will make a special  one-time payment of 1/4 month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will pay the 13th month Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (NPAA) for all civil servants as\r\n\r\nusual in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalaries  of  Political Appointment Holders and Senior  Civil\r\n\r\nServants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To send a clear signal that this is a grave situation,\r\n\r\nand that the Government is taking the lead in wage restraint,\r\n\r\npolitical  appointment  holders and  senior  civil  servants,\r\n\r\nwhose   salaries  are  tied  to  the  private  sector  salary\r\n\r\nbenchmarks, will have their monthly salaries cut by 10%  from\r\n\r\n1st  November  2001 for 12 months.  All other adjustments  to\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries  will  be  frozen during  this  period.   The\r\n\r\nallowances  of  MPs  and  NMPs,  which  are  pegged  to   the\r\n\r\nSuperscale benchmark, will also be cut by 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the annual salaries of\r\n\r\npolitical  appointment  holders and  senior  public  officers\r\n\r\ncontain  a GDP Bonus component that is directly tied  to  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of the economy.  With negative GDP  growth  this\r\n\r\nyear,   the   annual  salaries  of  Ministers  will   already\r\n\r\nautomatically be reduced by two months, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.3%.  The 10% cut in monthly pay is on top of this.\r\n\r\nCPF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package does not contain any cut in employer CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   The  Government has  decided  against  this,\r\n\r\nbecause  employer CPF contribution rates were  only  recently\r\n\r\ncut  in  1999, and then partially restored in 2000 and  2001.\r\n\r\nThe  CPF  is  meant for the retirement needs of members,  and\r\n\r\nshould  only be cut as a last resort.  It is not designed  as\r\n\r\nan instrument for fine tuning wage costs from year to year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot guarantee that we will not need to\r\n\r\ncut  CPF  contribution rates at some point  in  this  crisis.\r\n\r\nAfter  11th  September,  we are in a totally  new  situation.\r\n\r\nWhile we address the immediate problems through this package,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will also be reassessing more  fundamentally\r\n\r\nall  our economic strategies.  This will take several months.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  rule out beforehand any options which may  become\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us  to restore the basis of  our  growth  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a substantial package. Its\r\n\r\ntotal  size  is $11.3 billion, equivalent to 7%  of  GDP.   A\r\n\r\nsummary  of  the  measures and the costs are in  the  handout\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will  now ask the Clerk to circulate.   [Copies  of\r\n\r\nhandout*  (Cols.  2411-2416)  circulated  to  hon.  Members.]\r\n\r\nMinistries will be providing further details of the  measures\r\n\r\nunder their charge in the week ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20011012/20011012-HA-0732411.htm\">Table - Summary of Measures (Cols. 2411 - 2416)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2001, the package will result in a Government\r\n\r\nbudget deficit of $4 billion.  For FY 2002, MOF's preliminary\r\n\r\nestimate  is  that the package may result  in  a  deficit  of\r\n\r\napproximately $1 billion.  A lot depends on the  growth  rate\r\n\r\nfor next year.  However, this Government has accumulated more\r\n\r\nthan enough surpluses since it took office in 1997 to finance\r\n\r\nthe entire package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General elections must be called at the latest by August\r\n\r\n2002.   After the elections, the reserves accumulated by  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government will be locked away.  The new  Government\r\n\r\nwill not have access to these surpluses. In this eventuality,\r\n\r\nthe   new  Government  will  have  to  seek  the  President's\r\n\r\npermission  to draw down on protected reserves  to  fund  the\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package will help Singaporeans and businesses to\r\n\r\ntide  over  the  downturn.  But large as  it  is,  it  cannot\r\n\r\nrestore  by itself our economy to steady growth.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nspend  our  way to prosperity.  To grow we have  to  generate\r\n\r\nwealth,  which  means producing and exporting, earning  wages\r\n\r\nand  making  profits.   And that will depend  on  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy  and  foreign  markets, because  our  economy  is  so\r\n\r\nheavily   reliant  on  external  demand.   Domestic   exports\r\n\r\namounted  to 85% of our GDP in 2000.  So our growth can  only\r\n\r\npick  up  again when external conditions improve.  Meanwhile,\r\n\r\nwe  must build up our capabilities and prepare to ride on the\r\n\r\nrecovery when it comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be resolute and resourceful to ride out the\r\n\r\ncurrent difficulties.  In the early years of independence,  a\r\n\r\nprevious  generation faced crises far graver than  this  one.\r\n\r\nYet they prevailed through sheer grit and determination.  The\r\n\r\npeople  backed their leaders and together they worked through\r\n\r\ntough  policies on to success.  In that battle for  survival,\r\n\r\npeople  and leaders forged strong bonds of mutual  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence.   As a result, they were able, in one generation,\r\n\r\nto raise Singapore from the Third to the First World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle this crisis, we have more resources: a larger\r\n\r\neconomy  and stronger capabilities in the public and  private\r\n\r\nsectors, plus a deeper sense of nationhood.  This downturn is\r\n\r\na  major  test for us, for all Singaporeans.  We will  tackle\r\n\r\nthe  immediate  problems.  We can remake Singapore  and  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant  in a changed world.  We will secure our future  and\r\n\r\nmake life better for all Singaporeans.

This\r\n\r\nis  in  addition  to  the $2.2 billion announced  previously.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are so many measures and so many  incentives\r\n\r\nbeing  announced  that I also cannot keep track  when  I  was\r\n\r\ntaking down the notes.  But allow me to make a few comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I intentionally called this the \"economic rescue\r\n\r\npackage\" because our economy indeed needs rescuing.   As  the\r\n\r\nDPM   has   said,  we  are  in  the  worst  recession   since\r\n\r\nIndependence.   In  1964 we suffered  a  4.3%  drop  in  GDP,\r\n\r\nwhereas  in  1985  we  only saw 1.6% drop,  and  now  we  are\r\n\r\nexpecting perhaps a -3% for year 2001.  But for the  rest  of\r\n\r\n2001  and  the year 2002, the outlook still looks  uncertain.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  scenario,  the people and  local  companies  are\r\n\r\nextremely  concerned.  In this cold raging storm which  would\r\n\r\nlast  into next year, or perhaps longer, the economic  rescue\r\n\r\npackage  is warmly welcomed by all.  The feeling is like  the\r\n\r\nChinese saying, \"xue zhong song tan\", which means, in a snowy\r\n\r\nstorm  you  get warm coal, and this warms the hearts  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to make some quick comments\r\n\r\nand views on the various measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the economic package of $11.3 billion, I feel, is\r\n\r\nindeed very large.  In fact, in comparison, we know that  the\r\n\r\nUSA  has  announced  an economic stimulus  package  of  about\r\n\r\nUS$100 million, which is about S$180 million.  Malaysia  also\r\n\r\nannounced  a RM4.3 billion ringgit rescue package,  which  is\r\n\r\nabout  S$2 billion, and Hong Kong recently announced a  HK$15\r\n\r\nbillion  rescue  package, which is about only S$3.5  billion.\r\n\r\nSo,  in  contrast, I would like to say that it works out,  in\r\n\r\ncomparison,  on  a  population basis, in the  US  the  rescue\r\n\r\npackage amounted to about $640 per person; in Malaysia, it is\r\n\r\nonly about $90 per person; in Hong Kong, it is about $500 per\r\n\r\nperson;  and  for  Singapore's package of $11.3  billion,  it\r\n\r\ncomes  out  to about $3,500 per person (based on a population\r\n\r\nof about 3.2 million Singaporeans and residents).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this package, indeed, is quite substantial. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Hong  Kong package, in contrast, after its announcement,\r\n\r\nhad been criticised by their locals as being insufficient and\r\n\r\nwould  not  help the economy.  This Singapore package,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  is very sizeable and should satisfy most expectations.\r\n\r\nThe  press  has  actually speculated that  the  package  will\r\n\r\namount to only $8-$10 billion.  So this $11.3 billion is even\r\n\r\nhigher  than  most  expectations, in  contrast  to  the  1998\r\n\r\npackage, which was $10.5 billion.  But in that package, about\r\n\r\n$7.5  billion  was from CPF cuts.  So the actual contribution\r\n\r\nfrom  Government was only $3 billion.  Therefore, in contrast\r\n\r\nto  this  $11.3 billion rescue package, as announced  by  the\r\n\r\nDPM, it is over three times the 1998 package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, I would like to call this economic\r\n\r\npackage  bold  and meaningful.  Bold because it  is  sizeable\r\n\r\nenough to make an impact; meaningful because the measures are\r\n\r\nthought out to be targeted at several specific sectors of the\r\n\r\neconomy  and  people who are most affected by the  recession.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the poorer families and unemployed, and  also  to\r\n\r\nhelp  local companies so that they can survive the  downturn.\r\n\r\nAnd  if local companies survive, in turn, they would help  to\r\n\r\nsustain employment and preserve jobs for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment on the Singapore Shares is that the\r\n\r\nconcept of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShares,  originally  suggested by the Prime  Minister  during\r\n\r\nthis   year's   National  Day  Rally,  is  innovative.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment has means to pay out the huge sum of $2.7  billion\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the accumulation of surpluses from this  current\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The concept of Singapore Shares is  a  form  of\r\n\r\nwealth  sharing and wealth redistribution, and is appropriate\r\n\r\nand justifiable.  In good times, we save; in difficult times,\r\n\r\nwe  take out the savings to help the people, especially those\r\n\r\nwho  are  less  well-off and less privileged.   Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with the principle of the Government to give  more  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Shares to the lower income group.  Taking  the\r\n\r\namount of $2.7 billion, if we take a base population of about\r\n\r\n2  million working adults and senior citizens, it would  come\r\n\r\nto  about $1,350 per person over five years.  For a family of\r\n\r\ntwo  adults of husband and wife, this would be about  $2,700,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  quite a substantial and meaningful sum, especially\r\n\r\nfor  lower income families who will get more than this $2,700\r\n\r\nper  family.   I  hope  that, of course, the  Government  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  do well, accumulate more reserves  and  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, perhaps give us more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister a\r\n\r\nclarification.   He said in his speech that for  the  current\r\n\r\n$11.3  billion  package, there are sufficient  funds  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent Government's reserves.  For next year, assuming after\r\n\r\nthe  election  which is definitely due by August  next  year,\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  a  need for the Government  to  call  on  the\r\n\r\nreserves  because the new Government may not  have  reserves.\r\n\r\nSo  could  he clarify whether this present package  of  $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion is already accounted for and there is no need to  dig\r\n\r\ninto the reserves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to divide my comments on the various\r\n\r\nmeasures  into two groups: (1) measures to help  individuals;\r\n\r\nand (2) measures to help local companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, measures to help individuals. On the intention\r\n\r\nnot  to have CPF cuts, I agree fully with the Government that\r\n\r\nthere  should be no further cuts in the CPF at this juncture.\r\n\r\nAnyway, CPF cut is a very blunt instrument.  At present,  the\r\n\r\nemployer's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCPF  remains at 16%.  There is already a 4% of CPF yet to  be\r\n\r\nrestored.   Any  further cut in the CPF would mean  that  the\r\n\r\neffective household income of Singaporeans is reduced.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans use their CPF to pay for housing loans.   Hence,\r\n\r\nshould  the CPF be cut, they will have to take out  of  their\r\n\r\nown  disposable  household income to  service  their  housing\r\n\r\nloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other substantial measures announced by the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, such as the additional tax rebates for\r\n\r\nindividuals, this again is most welcomed.  The lower  tax  to\r\n\r\nbe  paid by the people would mean that people would have more\r\n\r\nmoney  to cover for household expenditure, schooling expenses\r\n\r\nand  other  expenses that may need to be paid.   The  rebates\r\n\r\ncould  assist  in  some  form  of  stimulating  the  consumer\r\n\r\nspending  which will have a beneficial ripple effect  on  the\r\n\r\nretail sector, eating establishments and the overall domestic\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on measures to help companies, I am also in support\r\n\r\nand  pleased  to  hear  about the  several  schemes  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  include enhanced LEFS, higher  SDF  rates,\r\n\r\nlower  transport costs, reduction of stamp duties and various\r\n\r\nother  measures.   I  would like to particularly  praise  the\r\n\r\nscheme  which  is to gather $500 million of loans  to  assist\r\n\r\nlocal   companies,  because  this  is  the  time  when  local\r\n\r\ncompanies   do   need  help  in  terms  of  financing   their\r\n\r\noperations.  As their revenue drops, they may find that  they\r\n\r\ndo  have a shortfall of earnings to cover their expenses.   I\r\n\r\ndo like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister that in implementing\r\n\r\nthe  disbursements of the loans, consideration  be  given  to\r\n\r\nfactors  that are not just, say, liberal but at least  easily\r\n\r\naccessible for companies that are still viable and would need\r\n\r\nthe  loan  to  sustain their businesses.  Otherwise,  if  the\r\n\r\nmoney is there, with $500 million, and the loan is hard to be\r\n\r\nobtained  for  local companies, then it does  not  serve  any\r\n\r\npurpose at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other measures to introduce pump priming\r\n\r\nmeasures,   I   support   the  proposal   to   identify   100\r\n\r\ninfrastructure projects, such as upgrading the NUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampus,  constructing new polytechnics and various  projects,\r\n\r\nto   be  accelerated.   However,  we  are  aware  that   such\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  projects have leakages of  income  mostly  to\r\n\r\nforeign   sources.   Therefore,  besides  pump   priming   of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure projects, I would like to urge the  Government\r\n\r\nto  also  consider  including in the pump priming  programme,\r\n\r\nother  non-physical works.  These are in the  areas  of  soft\r\n\r\nservices, such as works to be issued by the Government for IT\r\n\r\nand  software  development,  consultancy  contracts,  process\r\n\r\nimprovements, product development and R&D projects.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  push up more generously  these  non-physical\r\n\r\nprojects,   then  local  companies  can  also  benefit   more\r\n\r\ndirectly.  The development of intellectual and human  capital\r\n\r\nfrom  these  projects would be more enduring and have  longer\r\n\r\nimpact on promoting Singapore as a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on some suggestions that the DPM may not have\r\n\r\ncovered  in his announcement.  First, I would like to suggest\r\n\r\nallowing, on a very stringent and specific basis, families to\r\n\r\ndraw  on  their CPF in case they are really in dire  need  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  support.   During this  very  difficult  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis, many people will lose their jobs and encounter severe\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties, especially those with young  families\r\n\r\nand  children to support.  I would like to suggest that,  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  are severely affected and they have  run  out  of\r\n\r\nsavings and all other means of supporting themselves and  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  they  should  be  allowed to  draw  upon  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.   If the Government is concerned about flagrant  and\r\n\r\nwanton  demands by certain people to spend their CPF savings,\r\n\r\nwhich are actually meant for old age, the Government can  set\r\n\r\nup  rules  to  limit  the withdrawals.   Withdrawals  can  be\r\n\r\nlimited  to only the Special Account, for example.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like to urge the Government to consider this suggestion\r\n\r\nseriously  and,  perhaps allowing it on a stringent  case-by-case  basis,  and  also  with the support  of  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee  (CCC).  The constituency's  CCC  can\r\n\r\nconduct  visits - they know the ground, they know the  people\r\n\r\nwell - they can investigate the financial status of each\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplicant and they can only give their support or endorsement\r\n\r\nwhen they are persuaded that these families require financial\r\n\r\nassistance and therefore can be allowed to draw on their  own\r\n\r\nCPF savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the need to urge our banks, both local and foreign\r\n\r\nbanks,  to  continue  to support our companies.   During  the\r\n\r\nrecession,  many  local companies will find  difficulties  in\r\n\r\ncash-flow  management and making sufficient income  to  cover\r\n\r\noverheads  and  pay the staff payroll.  Adding  to  the  woes\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  bankers calling at the doors  to  repay  bank\r\n\r\nloans, or insist on accelerated repayments of principals,  or\r\n\r\neven  payment  of higher interest rates, or to  provide  more\r\n\r\nsecurity cover, collaterals, or top up with cash.  Although I\r\n\r\nagree that, in principle, we should not tell the banks how to\r\n\r\nrun  their  business, but there is reason for the authorities\r\n\r\nto request the banks not to be overly panicky or being overly\r\n\r\npredatory.   They commonly say that bankers are fair  weather\r\n\r\nfriends.   In  good times, they lend you plenty of  umbrellas\r\n\r\nwhen the sun is shining.  But at the first sign of rain, they\r\n\r\nwill  scramble  to  snatch back the  umbrellas.   Worse,  now\r\n\r\nMinister BG George Yeo has told them that a terrific  perfect\r\n\r\nstorm  is  blowing.   I  think they are  even  more  worried.\r\n\r\nHence,  I would like to ask the Government to urge the banks,\r\n\r\nespecially  local banks, who may have more local interest  in\r\n\r\ntheir  heart,  to stay their hands in calling  on  defaulting\r\n\r\nloans.  They should instead be sympathetic and call on  their\r\n\r\nborrowers  to  see  how they can help them restructure  their\r\n\r\nloans or allow them to defer their repayments.  It would be a\r\n\r\nsad  case  if many companies collapse because of forced  loan\r\n\r\nrecalls by the banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similarly, for housing loans, I am pleased to note\r\n\r\nthat  the  Deputy Prime Minister has said that the  HDB  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  some schemes to help HDB dwellers to  defer  their\r\n\r\nloan  repayments.  On private residential properties, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  also  call on the banks that, for Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nhave  taken  up private residential property mortgages,  they\r\n\r\nshould be a bit more sympathetic and lenient in dealing  with\r\n\r\npossible defaulting loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the possibility of dropping property prices, many\r\n\r\nproperties can go into a negative equity, that is, the market\r\n\r\nvalue of the property could be lower than the loan taken.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  an  instance,  some banks would  be  quick  to  protect\r\n\r\nthemselves and ask for more cash or more collaterals.   Those\r\n\r\nwho  cannot meet the bank's demand will encounter forced sale\r\n\r\nof  their  properties.  I understand that, in Hong Kong,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  there are about 300,000 loans that are  already  in\r\n\r\nthe  negative equity range.  I do not know how many are there\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   But  with the raging storm  and  the  coming\r\n\r\nrecession,  I  am  sure  that more  families  will  face  the\r\n\r\nprospect  of negative equity.  So we would like to  urge  the\r\n\r\nbanks  to  be  more understanding and to try to  allow  their\r\n\r\ncustomers' housing loans to be restructured or deferred.   As\r\n\r\nMinister  George  Yeo has said, in time the storm  will  blow\r\n\r\nover  and  then the umbrellas can be returned to the  bankers\r\n\r\ngratefully  by the lenders, but please do not take  away  the\r\n\r\numbrellas when the storm is still raging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I would like to hail the move by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to have a wage cut of 10% for Ministers,  office-holders, top civil servants, MPs and NMPs.  This is  a  right\r\n\r\nmove,  especially  for  the  Ministers,  they  will  actually\r\n\r\nencounter  a 17% wage cut, because 7% is from salary  formula\r\n\r\nreduction and another 10% is from wage cut.  This is  a  good\r\n\r\ngesture and a sign of good leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to repeat the fact that\r\n\r\nthis  economic package announced by the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nis  most  warmly welcomed by all.  Let us hope that,  through\r\n\r\nthe  collective concerted efforts of our honest and effective\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the hard work and drive of the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nperseverance  and  pioneering  spirit  of  local   companies,\r\n\r\ntogether  we  shall see ourselves through  this  dark  period\r\n\r\nahead.   And  let us hope that we can see some  light  sooner\r\n\r\nthan expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the current\r\n\r\ndownturn is very different\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom   the  last.   The  1997/98  crisis  was  felt  strongly\r\n\r\nthroughout Asia and arose from several factors, including the\r\n\r\nhigh  level of foreign debt and the need for major structural\r\n\r\nand economic reforms.  The growing US economy then was a huge\r\n\r\nmitigating factor.  Despite there being some tell-tale signs,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were largely caught by surprise.   Coping  with\r\n\r\nthe  crisis then required a lot of effort.  This time  round,\r\n\r\nthe effects are global.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, over the last few years, we have\r\n\r\nproactively   begun  tackling  several  challenges,   namely,\r\n\r\nreviewing   the   type   of  manufacturing   activities   and\r\n\r\ninvestments,  promoting  knowledge intensive  industries  and\r\n\r\naddressing    structural   unemployment    issues.     Hence,\r\n\r\npsychologically, Singaporeans are prepared for the challenges\r\n\r\nthat we face as a country.  However, the global nature of the\r\n\r\ndownturn aggravated by the terrorist attacks in the  US  have\r\n\r\nadded  to  the  uncertainty and would prolong the  recession.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans therefore need to be assured that we  have  what\r\n\r\nit  takes  to ride out this challenging phase of our nation's\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the second package unveiled by the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister will go a long way towards  providing\r\n\r\nthe  much needed assurance in a very concrete way but  which,\r\n\r\nat the same time, contains a sense of reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now comment specifically on where assurance\r\n\r\ncan  be  found  by,  firstly, individuals and  families,  and\r\n\r\nsecondly, by businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, individuals and families. Recognising that\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  retrenched  would  need  assistance  to   be\r\n\r\nretrained,  re-skilled and emplaced onto jobs, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  introduced a whole slew of schemes.  But  I  would  just\r\n\r\nhighlight and applaud the following three moves: firstly, the\r\n\r\ninclusion of white collar and management staff, as  a  higher\r\n\r\nproportion than before, has been dislocated by both  industry\r\n\r\nrestructuring  and the downturn;  secondly, the  devotion  of\r\n\r\nsizeable  amounts towards SDF support so as to cast  the  net\r\n\r\neven  wider;  and, thirdly, the refinements to both the  work\r\n\r\npermit and employment pass criteria to ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  foreign  contributors are those whose  skills  we  lack\r\n\r\nrather than those who are simply more price competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, recognising the individuals and families who fail\r\n\r\nto  secure  employment for a while may experience  cash  flow\r\n\r\nproblems,  the  Government has introduced  ample  reliefs  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  basic  needs,  such  as household  living  expenses,\r\n\r\neducation and health.  We can draw comfort from the freeze in\r\n\r\neducation  fees  and  suspension in  payment  of  loans,  the\r\n\r\nreduction in electricity tariffs and extension of rebates  to\r\n\r\nlower income families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is especially noteworthy are the following\r\n\r\nthree   measures:   firstly,  the  extension   of   temporary\r\n\r\nassistance to lower income HDB flat owners, especially  those\r\n\r\nin  three  and four-room flats as they have also  been  badly\r\n\r\naffected,  but have hitherto been excluded or ineligible  for\r\n\r\nassistance under current rules;  secondly, hospital  bills  - the  10%  rebate  for  B2  and C ward  charges  and  the  40%\r\n\r\nassistance  for  those  who  are retrenched;   and,  thirdly,\r\n\r\nadditional  help  through CCCs for an  effective  meeting  of\r\n\r\nneeds at the more personal level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the business front. Recognising that\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  especially  the  smaller  operations,  could  be\r\n\r\nfinancially  strapped, the Government  has  sought  to  lower\r\n\r\noperating  costs  and ease cash flow via  significant  moves,\r\n\r\nincluding the steps taken to improve access to funds and  the\r\n\r\nhigher  property  tax  rebate  would  be  extremely  helpful.\r\n\r\nEqually  helpful would be the corporate tax rebates amounting\r\n\r\nto  a  hefty 50% rebate which will assist SMEs who  may  need\r\n\r\nhelp to continue investing in the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a general note, there is comfort in the example\r\n\r\nset  by  the  Government to restrain wage cost in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  as  well as in the move to suspend  land  sales  and\r\n\r\nremove the anti-speculative property measures.  Moreover, the\r\n\r\nmove  to  pump  prime  the economy to help  bolster  economic\r\n\r\nactivity   is   also  commendable  and  much   needed.    The\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the New Singapore Share is  significant  in\r\n\r\nbringing home the message that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  stay united as a people as we take ownership  of  our\r\n\r\nown future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, as the Deputy Prime Minister has stated,\r\n\r\nthe  challenges  of  economic strategy and employability  are\r\n\r\nreally  long  term  and  fundamental  issues.   However,  the\r\n\r\ndownturn  has  heightened some of these  concerns  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has now addressed in a very concrete  manner.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the DPM to ensure that all these measures\r\n\r\nwould be compassionately implemented.  I believe the unity of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   and   their  support  for   the   Government's\r\n\r\nendeavours will see us through these testing times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I   welcome this package presented by the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and I would like to give some views on the  efforts\r\n\r\nto  assist  our  nation  to  overcome  the  present  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   I  believe the steps will not  only  help  us  to\r\n\r\novercome  economic problems now but also open up new  avenues\r\n\r\nto address the long-term problems even after we have overcome\r\n\r\nthe  present economic problems.  I believe the measures taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Government are comprehensive.  It benefits not  only\r\n\r\nthe lower income group, but also those who are better off and\r\n\r\nthe   middle-income  group  who  is  also  affected  by  this\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of $11.3 billion and a deficit of around $5\r\n\r\nbillion  are very significant and can surely help to increase\r\n\r\nharmony  in  Singapore.  It is balanced  in  its  attempt  to\r\n\r\nassist   the  community  and  companies  to  overcome   their\r\n\r\nproblems.  But, on the whole, the community too will  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the help given to companies because companies  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  retain  the  jobs for them  and  our  workers  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be employed.  I welcome the Government's move  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  the rebates on conservancy charges  for  flat\r\n\r\nowners,  including  bigger flats like the HDB  5-room  flats,\r\n\r\nbecause  those who live in the HDB 5-room flats, who enjoy  a\r\n\r\nbetter income, have also been affected by retrenchments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Downturn Relief Scheme, introduced to\r\n\r\novercome the bleak economy, is most welcome to help those who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave lost their jobs.  I believe, if properly implemented  by\r\n\r\nthe  CCCs, which operate in all our housing estates, it  will\r\n\r\nnot only be able to help the group affected, but will also be\r\n\r\nable  to  inculcate in them the feeling of nationhood because\r\n\r\nthey  receive assistance from the grassroots leaders who live\r\n\r\nin their housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to touch on the\r\n\r\n\"People  for  Jobs Traineeship Programme\" which is  specially\r\n\r\nmeant  for  the older workers who are 40 years and above  who\r\n\r\nhave  lost their jobs.  I welcome the $200 million set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  this  group  of  people.   I  believe  this  is  a  very\r\n\r\nmeaningful  effort  because it provides the  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthose who have greater difficulties in finding another job in\r\n\r\nthe  long term.  Their effort to find new jobs and to retrain\r\n\r\nthese  workers  to adapt themselves to their  newly  acquired\r\n\r\njobs  would  be  better and it would surely  assist  them  in\r\n\r\ntaking care of their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is significant this time is that we give assistance\r\n\r\nto  executives and skilled workers who have lost their  jobs.\r\n\r\nI  believe  the  package  offered will  be  welcomed  by  the\r\n\r\nexecutive  groups and skilled workers, because many  of  them\r\n\r\nwho  have  lost  their  jobs  feel  that,  due  to  less  job\r\n\r\nopportunities and old age, it is a lot more difficult to find\r\n\r\nnew  jobs  although  they  have the  skills  and  educational\r\n\r\nqualifications.  I would like to ask, from the  sum  of  $200\r\n\r\nmillion,  how  many of the retrenched who are  40  years  and\r\n\r\nabove would benefit from the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also agree with the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that it is not timely for us to cut the  employers'\r\n\r\nCPF contribution.  We agree that CPF is for workers to use in\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement  and,  therefore, we  should  not  cut  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF  contribution,  as  long  as  we  have  other\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  overcome this problem.  This includes  lowering\r\n\r\nthe  costs of business operations.  The problem faced by  our\r\n\r\ncompanies now is not due to loss of competitiveness,  but  it\r\n\r\nis  due  to the fall in demands all over the world caused  by\r\n\r\nthe downturn in America, Japan and Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  worsened by the terrorist attacks on 11th  September.\r\n\r\nWe should implement other measures to help these companies to\r\n\r\nlower  their production and operation costs so that they  can\r\n\r\nretain their workers, and I hope that the Government will not\r\n\r\ntake early action to reduce the employers' CPF contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of foreign workers, I welcome the strict\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  be taken to tighten the employment  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  and to bring in those who are skilled  rather  than\r\n\r\nunskilled.  Some jobs which are now given to foreign  workers\r\n\r\ncould  benefit  our  own  workers, provided  our  workers  go\r\n\r\nthrough retraining courses and are given assistance to  adapt\r\n\r\nthemselves to take up these jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope additional measures will be implemented to help\r\n\r\nour   workers  to  change  their  mindset  to  grab  the  job\r\n\r\nopportunities in the sectors which they are not interested in\r\n\r\npresently,  so that they have a stable job to maintain  their\r\n\r\nfamily  and, at the same time, we could lessen our dependence\r\n\r\non foreign workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe these additional off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  not only a package to assist  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\novercome  this  downturn,  but that the  assistance  schemes,\r\n\r\nincluding the training schemes, together with the plans  that\r\n\r\nhave  been arranged by the labour movement led by NTUC, could\r\n\r\nalso  help  our country and people to overcome the challenges\r\n\r\nahead.  Even after we have overcome the present downturn, our\r\n\r\nworkers  should  upgrade  their own skills  and  acquire  new\r\n\r\ncapabilities  to meet the competition from various  countries\r\n\r\nthat  are  now more competitive as compared to the  past.   I\r\n\r\nwelcome this additional package and I hope it will be able to\r\n\r\nassist  and  strengthen  further  the  solidarity  among  the\r\n\r\npeople, the Government and employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like\r\n\r\nmy  parliamentary  colleagues, I am also overwhelmed  by  the\r\n\r\npackage  just announced by DPM.  I find it very difficult  to\r\n\r\nkeep  track  of  the details and all the individual  measures\r\n\r\nannounced by him.  But there is really no need to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to state that, prior to\r\n\r\ncoming  to  the House, what I had expected in the  package  - what  are  the  factors we must address - and  then  look  at\r\n\r\nwhether all the measures announced by the DPM will be  up  to\r\n\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first off-Budget package tabled\r\n\r\nby  Minister George Yeo, it reflected a strategy to  do  just\r\n\r\nabout the minimum that was necessary to help the economy  and\r\n\r\nalso to hope that the projected recovery of the world economy\r\n\r\nexpected  in first quarter 2002 would lift Singapore  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  current recession.  The dose of medicine proposed by the\r\n\r\ngood Minister was calibrated to be about just right - not too\r\n\r\nmuch, not too little.  That strategy would have worked if the\r\n\r\ncondition  had been favourable.  But it turns  out  that  the\r\n\r\nconfluence  of weather fronts had produced a severe  storm  - what  the  Minister had said, a perfect storm,  a  once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third quarter results show that our worst fear has\r\n\r\nbeen  confirmed.   We  have, indeed,  experienced  our  worst\r\n\r\nquarterly contraction since independence.  Furthermore,  with\r\n\r\nthe  terrorist attacks on 11th September, there is no  longer\r\n\r\nany  need to second-guess the duration or the severity of the\r\n\r\nrecession.   The drop in consumer confidence and  air  travel\r\n\r\nmeans that any hope of an early recovery in the US economy is\r\n\r\ndashed,  so  much so that the top executives of SIA  have  to\r\n\r\ntake pay cuts to weather the severe buffeting the airline  is\r\n\r\nexpected to endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that the recession in Singapore will\r\n\r\nbe  longer  than  expected and will be a difficult  one  -  a\r\n\r\nrecession  that  our people are not really mentally  prepared\r\n\r\nfor,   a  recession  that  Singaporeans  will  find  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to tackle, based on our own individual resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this severe economic recession, there is, indeed,\r\n\r\nvery  little that businesses or individuals could do to  turn\r\n\r\nthe  situation  around in the short term.  For  instance,  no\r\n\r\namount  of job training will allow the retrenched workers  to\r\n\r\nfind a job if no one is hiring.  Therefore, we, Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nare  looking  to  the Government to provide the  steady  hand\r\n\r\nneeded to steer the ship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough the stormy sea.  We are looking for bold measures, as\r\n\r\nthe  time for conservative step-wise measures is over.   When\r\n\r\nwe  look  at the US economy, we see that the Federal  Reserve\r\n\r\nBank has implemented nine consecutive interest cuts this year\r\n\r\nto  tackle  its recession.  I was hoping that our  Government\r\n\r\ncould be just as aggressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of medicine do we need, Sir? It would be\r\n\r\nuseful to think in terms of long-term measures and also short-term measures.  I was hoping to see in the second package the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, we have to protect jobs and also to\r\n\r\nkeep  people, who are already employed, working.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  keep  businesses viable, make  less  profitable\r\n\r\nbusinesses   more  profitable,  make  loss-making  businesses\r\n\r\nprofitable.   And  for those who are already  retrenched,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to provide assistance to help them to tackle the  costs\r\n\r\nof basic necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, with weaker consumer confidence, our domestic\r\n\r\neconomy  is winding down slowly.  So, therefore, we  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the cash flow in the economy and keep our  economic\r\n\r\nwheel  turning.   In  so doing, I was looking  forward  to  a\r\n\r\nmassive injection of cash into the economy, and the only  way\r\n\r\nI can see it coming from is a massive reduction of Government\r\n\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should be worried about creating a\r\n\r\ndependency mentality in our people, Sir, I think it  is  time\r\n\r\nthat  we  did not worry too much, because now is the time  to\r\n\r\nput help into their hands.  Like Mr Leong has spoken earlier,\r\n\r\nxue  zhong song tan.  It is the time to send hot charcoal  to\r\n\r\nthe people in snowy weather, ie, to provide timely help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me state that, after listening to\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister, I am very impressed that  he  has\r\n\r\ntaken  a  complete relook at every issue facing the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  and has almost redone, single-handedly,  a  complete\r\n\r\nrevamp  of  all our tax issues.  Instead of having an  energy\r\n\r\ndrink - like Red Bull in its advertisement, he le jiu xing  - we had had an intravenous injection of energy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrugs,  and  I  think the economy will benefit  significantly\r\n\r\nfrom this injection.  And since the Singapore economy is  not\r\n\r\ndead  - it is just very sick - I think the injection of  this\r\n\r\nmassive tax cut will bring around early revivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I am also very impressed that the\r\n\r\nleadership has taken the pain to take a 10% pay cut and  also\r\n\r\nforgo a certain amount of bonuses.  That indicates that  they\r\n\r\nhave  learned  their leadership skill very well from  ancient\r\n\r\nmilitary lessons that, in fighting wars, the generals and the\r\n\r\nsoldiers  must endure the same pain - the cold and  also  the\r\n\r\nhardship - together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while it is heartening that the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has indicated a whole host of measures to help\r\n\r\nbusinesses, it is also important that we realise the pain  of\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  lower income group and extend  assistance  to\r\n\r\nthem.  The package is quite comprehensive.  I just have a few\r\n\r\ncomments to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the extension of rebates in energy\r\n\r\nbills,  utilities bills and service and conservancy  charges,\r\n\r\nwe  have always depended on the classification of HDB housing\r\n\r\ntypes  as  a measure to provide such assistance.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthis  time  round, Sir, we should allow for greater  latitude\r\n\r\nand  devise  an escape route for even those who live  in  the\r\n\r\nbigger  HDB types, eg, 5-room and Executive flats.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause I believe some of them are really cash-strapped,  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  them are also faced with negative equity.  If  they\r\n\r\nwere to sell their flat today to downgrade to a smaller flat,\r\n\r\nmost of their lifelong savings will be wiped out.  In handing\r\n\r\nout  aids to HDB dwellers, we should take the plight of  such\r\n\r\nresidents  into consideration and allow greater  flexibility,\r\n\r\neven if they are staying in 5-room or Executive flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the anti-speculative measures, I was hoping\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will scrap the anti-speculative measures\r\n\r\nand  which,  indeed,  the  Deputy Prime  Minister  has  done.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  thought he should also look at  the  payment  of\r\n\r\nstamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduty  before  transactions,  because  that  was  one  measure\r\n\r\nintroduced and which is still in force today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is very important that we would like to look at\r\n\r\nall  the  short-term measures announced by the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, we should also look at some of the medium-term  and\r\n\r\nlong-term  measures, to shift the economic  strategy  of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  from  past strategies to newer  ones.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nbecause of time constraint, the Deputy Prime Minister had not\r\n\r\ntouched  very  much  on  this.  I was hoping  that  he  would\r\n\r\nelaborate  that,  in future, we would shift  our  focus  from\r\n\r\nmultinational    corporations   to   local    entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nenterprises,  a  shift  from Government-linked  companies  to\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, what really impressed me is the fact that,\r\n\r\nby  the measures announced and by the bold action taken, this\r\n\r\nis  a Government in full charge of a ship in stormy seas -  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  action  that our people  can  depend  upon  - responsive,  pragmatic and bold.  To make the measures  work,\r\n\r\nwe  need  the wholehearted support of Singaporeans.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  we  have laid a good foundation by  the  leadership\r\n\r\ntaking a pay-cut.  Together, Sir, I think we shall be able to\r\n\r\nsail through this stormy sea to calmer waters ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I am glad that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has thought of the wide ranging measures  which  I\r\n\r\nam  confident  will have a significant impact on Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  Singapore companies.  While many people had asked for  a\r\n\r\npackage  of  between  $10 billion and $15 billion  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures,  I think they never expected to get so much.   This\r\n\r\ntime  round,  as  opposed  to the past,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\npleasantly  surprised  everyone, which  is  a  $11.3  billion\r\n\r\npackage.  I applaud the Government for being bold this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been pointless to give a small dose, like\r\n\r\nwhat  Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen mentioned, like  the  $2.2  billion\r\n\r\nmeasures  implemented earlier this year.  In  that  instance,\r\n\r\nthere  was no impact at all, and another small package  would\r\n\r\nhave meant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  down  the drain.  Governments must have the  political\r\n\r\nwill  to take bold measures if they are really serious  about\r\n\r\nmaking   a   difference  in  situations  like  the   economic\r\n\r\nrecession.   Most of the time, piecemeal effects  are  wasted\r\n\r\nefforts.   Mr  Leong  Horn Kee talked about  the  ineffective\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken by some other governments in this region.   I\r\n\r\nthink   this   time  round,  we  have  shown   to   everyone,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  to  the rest of the  world,  that  we  are\r\n\r\nwilling to take bold moves which are indeed necessary to make\r\n\r\nany significant difference in situations like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on a few issues. First of\r\n\r\nall, it is the predictive capability of the Government.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  third quarter results of a negative 5.6% forecast and  a\r\n\r\nnegative 3% for the year are once again way off the mark,  as\r\n\r\nhas been the case for forecasts done by the Government in the\r\n\r\npast few years.  I am sure that the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Trade and Industry must agree with me  that\r\n\r\nthe  large negative swing of the economic indicators has  got\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do with the September 11th actions in  the  USA.\r\n\r\nThe  fate  of the third quarter results was mostly sealed  by\r\n\r\nthen.   Many people are, of course, using September  11th  as\r\n\r\nexcuses for many things, but I think, in this case, at  least\r\n\r\nfor  the  third quarter results, that cannot be  the  reason.\r\n\r\nLooking  forward  to the fourth quarter and beyond,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  significant impact.  It is easy  to  say  in\r\n\r\nhindsight,  but  we all know that the position  held  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  even three months ago, was quite different  from\r\n\r\nwhat many industry analysts were saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I am raising this issue is because I am\r\n\r\nreally concerned about the indicators that the Government  is\r\n\r\nusing  to  measure  the  future state  of  the  economy.   My\r\n\r\nimpression  is  that we are using old models  that  may  have\r\n\r\nworked in the past but these models may not be suitable in  a\r\n\r\nrapidly  changing new economy.  I would like to  ask  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  doing anything to put  in  place  better\r\n\r\nmodels for predicting the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to touch on is the issue\r\n\r\nof retrenched executives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  professionals.   While  I am comfortable  that  we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient measures to help the lower income families who may\r\n\r\nbe  hit  by  the  recession,  our  various  welfare  schemes,\r\n\r\nincluding the public assistance, rental rebates, Medifund and\r\n\r\nothers,  are  tailored to help the lower income Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nBut  people  who were once drawing high income  but  are  now\r\n\r\nretrenched  are  not eligible for any one of  them.   We  are\r\n\r\nstarting  to see many cases of Singaporeans who may be  asset\r\n\r\nrich  but cash poor because of a sudden turn of events.  This\r\n\r\nis  especially so for those in the 40s and 50s, who may  have\r\n\r\nbeen successful in their careers and have a steady income and\r\n\r\nhave families to support.  They would have been committed  to\r\n\r\na  property  and  have many liabilities and responsibilities,\r\n\r\nespecially   paying  mortgages  for  properties,   children's\r\n\r\neducation, expenses and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system of welfare schemes will not be able to\r\n\r\nsupport them.  We must think of ways to ease their cash  flow\r\n\r\nsituations in the short-term.  For such people, it  does  not\r\n\r\nmake  sense to give them the type of assistance given to  the\r\n\r\nlower income Singaporeans.  We need to think of new ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to start thinking out of the box\r\n\r\nand  be  flexible on some of its policies.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that we allow such people to borrow money from  their\r\n\r\nCPF   Special   Account,  as  opposed   to   withdrawing   it\r\n\r\npermanently, that they be allowed to borrow so that they  can\r\n\r\ndraw  a  monthly amount to help them tide over the  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   And when they are gainfully employed again,  we  can\r\n\r\ninstitute  a  higher  monthly deduction from  their  employee\r\n\r\nportion  of  CPF  to  repay back into the  CPF  account  with\r\n\r\ninterest, if we have to.  In this way, they do not have to be\r\n\r\ndependent  on any of the welfare schemes.  With this  scheme,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have to put extra burden on the public  funds  as\r\n\r\nthose  affected will be using their own money  in  case  they\r\n\r\ndraw  from their CPF.  It is much easier to justify  this  to\r\n\r\nall Singaporeans than to support the asset rich and cash poor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the extensive measures to help reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness costs which were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannounced  by the Deputy Prime Minister.  But in my  opinion,\r\n\r\nwhile they are going to be effective in the short-term, these\r\n\r\nare  temporary measures.  In fact, the measures that we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  used  to  in  the  recent past have  been  a  temporary\r\n\r\nreduction approach of reducing costs. We have to put in  more\r\n\r\npermanent cost reduction measures.  Most of the measures  put\r\n\r\nin  place like rental rebates, property tax rebates,  rebates\r\n\r\non  charges are all temporary in nature and such an  approach\r\n\r\ndoes  not  give  comfort to businesses that  we  have  indeed\r\n\r\nidentified a longer term solution for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is about time that we seriously looked at\r\n\r\npermanent  reduction  measures.   If  we  fail  to   do   so,\r\n\r\nespecially  at  this  point of time, we may  actually  see  a\r\n\r\nstructural destruction of our industrial base.  As  countries\r\n\r\nlike  China  and India catch up and are able to provide  same\r\n\r\nresources at a much cheaper cost, we risk permanent  loss  of\r\n\r\nour  industries and may see a hollowing of our  economy.   We\r\n\r\nhave no choice but to keep manufacturing as an important wing\r\n\r\nof  our  economy and we therefore have to re-look at  how  we\r\n\r\nprice the various resources which make significant impact  to\r\n\r\nthe  cost of manufacturing.  For example, why cannot we price\r\n\r\nindustrial land differently?  The costs of land and  building\r\n\r\nare  just  too  high, perhaps the highest in the  world.   We\r\n\r\nalready   have  a  mechanism  of  differential   prices   for\r\n\r\nresidential properties, different prices for HDB flats versus\r\n\r\nprivate  properties.  It is really up to  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ndecide  how they want to price industrial land.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which sets the price benchmark in this  case.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  that there needs to be a drastic reduction so  that  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to address this cost issue once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that finally something substantial is being\r\n\r\ndone  to  help SMEs secure funding through the loan insurance\r\n\r\nscheme.   The  $500  million will  go  a  long  way  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies  overcome their difficulties in securing  financing\r\n\r\nfor  activities.   In many cases, as has been  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nthere are companies with good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness deals but lack the financing and result in the deals\r\n\r\ncollapsing  or  collapse of the companies.  I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nloan  insurance scheme will be implemented such that it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  too difficult for companies to apply.  It cannot  be\r\n\r\nleft  to banks to decide solely on disbursement of this loan.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  some  intervention and  involvement  of  the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and  Standards  Board  for  the  scheme  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful because leaving it completely to the banks may not\r\n\r\nchange  the  situation  because  banks  have  typically   not\r\n\r\npreferred to lend to small and medium enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of property prices, I am a little\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that the Government has become distracted  from\r\n\r\nthe  original  objective  of preventing  speculation  in  the\r\n\r\nproperty market.  While I do sympathise with property owners,\r\n\r\nand  I  too  own a property, that we have lost value  in  our\r\n\r\nproperties, I feel that it is for the long-term good  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  if we do not allow property price bubbles to develop\r\n\r\nas  a  result of speculation.  If it develops as a result  of\r\n\r\ngenuine buyers, I think we have no choice, but if as a result\r\n\r\nof  speculation,  this  is something we  should  not  accept.\r\n\r\nWhile up to now property buyers in the last few years may not\r\n\r\nhave  made gains, as the Deputy Prime Minister indicated just\r\n\r\nnow,  my  fear  is  that  this  lifting  of  anti-speculative\r\n\r\nmeasures will spark off a rapid rise in property prices again\r\n\r\nby  people  who hope to make a quick gain, as  was  the  case\r\n\r\nbefore 1996.  And if we build up another bubble and it bursts\r\n\r\nagain,  we may go the way of Japan where they never recovered\r\n\r\nfrom the big burst of their property bubble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I would like to applaud the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for its leadership in identifying  the  extensive\r\n\r\noff-Budget measures.  I am confident that we will be able  to\r\n\r\nturn  things around as we start implementing these  measures.\r\n\r\nIt  is  always  important in situations  like  this  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take the leadership and to be bold rather  than\r\n\r\nto  be  conservative.  I think if we err, we will err on  the\r\n\r\npositive side rather than on the negative side in the case of\r\n\r\nthe  situation when we are too conservative in  the  measures\r\n\r\nthat we implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in 1998, we had the Asian financial crisis.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time, it was just a mild cold but in the year 2000  and\r\n\r\nthis  year,  we came across a very serious influenza.   After\r\n\r\nSeptember  11th, with the flu, we were drenched  in  a  heavy\r\n\r\nrain,  and  the  influenza has developed into something  much\r\n\r\nmore serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, when I heard the off-Budget package announced\r\n\r\nby  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, I am glad to know  that  our\r\n\r\nhealth  is  still very strong in Singapore, and that  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to pull through all kinds of stormy weathers and remain\r\n\r\nsafe  and  sound.  A few months ago, we announced  the  first\r\n\r\npackage of $2.2 billion and now this second package is  $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion,   making a total of $13.5 billion.  This is  a  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan to help our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this package, we have very detailed plans and schemes\r\n\r\nto  help  our  citizens,  including rebates  on  income  tax,\r\n\r\nproperty  tax, HDB and JTC rentals, etc.  Among these,  there\r\n\r\nare also extensions to the existing rebates on utilities, HDB\r\n\r\nand JTC rentals, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that all these rebates are part\r\n\r\nof  a  very  good package that will help our people  overcome\r\n\r\nthis  severe economic crisis. It is like the Chinese  saying,\r\n\r\n\"sending coal in a snowy weather or handing out umbrellas  in\r\n\r\nheavy  rain\".   It is a very good assistance package  indeed,\r\n\r\nbut we must not forget to look into the possibility of longer\r\n\r\nterm schemes to help our citizens.  The announcement made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister will surely be  welcomed  by  our\r\n\r\npeople.   The Government is able to do this because  we  have\r\n\r\n\"made  hay  when the sun shines, and prepared for  the  rainy\r\n\r\ndays\".   During  good times, through prudent  management,  we\r\n\r\nwere able to accumulate surpluses so that when we come across\r\n\r\nany  financial crisis,  we are able to fork out  extra  money\r\n\r\nfrom  our coffers to help our people.  This is a good example\r\n\r\nand  the  result  of cooperation between the people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the whole, I think it is more important to have\r\n\r\nlong-term plans to help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed people in particular.  How do we  help  them?\r\n\r\nWe  can train them, re-skill them and re-educate them in  the\r\n\r\nhope  that they can quickly find a job.  But I am afraid  the\r\n\r\nolder  people,  those  who  are  50  and  above,  will   have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  getting  a  job  even  after  going  through  the\r\n\r\ntraining   and  enhancing  their  skills,  in   the   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  I hope that the Government will take the lead\r\n\r\nbecause if our retirement age is 62, and the people are  only\r\n\r\n50  years old, they have 12 more years of working life.   The\r\n\r\nMinistries  in  the  Government  should  go  through  various\r\n\r\navenues  to  help these people look for employment.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  take  the lead to  absorb  these  people,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   the   private  companies  will  also  emulate   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to feedback received, when an applicant\r\n\r\ntelephones  in  response to a job vacancy advertisement,  the\r\n\r\nfirst question asked of him is invariably: \"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\nIf  the reply is 50 and above, he will be told, \"Do not come,\r\n\r\nyou  are  too  old!\"  If this trend persists, those  who  are\r\n\r\nolder and unemployed, or when they are retrenched, will  face\r\n\r\nsome very difficult times ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I am concerned about is that this\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis is not just in Asia but  it  is  global  in\r\n\r\nnature.   With  the opening up of the Chinese market  to  the\r\n\r\nworld,  the  entry of China into the WTO, and its hosting  of\r\n\r\nthe  Olympic  Games in 2008, I think in the next  few  years,\r\n\r\nChina  will  be able to attract a lot of foreign  investments\r\n\r\nthere.   This  is also a good opportunity for our  people  to\r\n\r\ninvest  there, but, of course, we must have the  avenues  and\r\n\r\nthe  way to go there.  If you depend on special companies  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  China, you may have difficulties.  I hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  MTI  will take the lead  again  to  lead  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs there. Small companies should endeavour to join\r\n\r\ntogether  so  that they may have the scale and  resources  to\r\n\r\nventure  into the China market. When you venture into  a  new\r\n\r\nmarket, there are lots of challenges facing us there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government to consider giving\r\n\r\nsome sort of special loans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  those who are venturing into the China market, or to help\r\n\r\nthem  make some arrangements and give them assistance. As  it\r\n\r\nis  said: \"The business world is like a battle field.\"   When\r\n\r\nwe  fight  a war, we must have the vanguards to charge  ahead\r\n\r\nand  lead  the  rest  of the army forward.   Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nvanguards are taking the biggest  risk.  But for the sake  of\r\n\r\na  victory in a war, they will risk their lives and take  the\r\n\r\nlead  forward.  Similarly, in the  business  world,  when  we\r\n\r\ninvest  in a new market, the challenges are tough and severe.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  should give them greater  encouragement  and\r\n\r\ninstill  in them more confidence, so that we will be able  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more  opportunities for our own  people,  spread  our\r\n\r\nsecond wing and venture into this emerging market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Dr Wang Kai Yuen said that the utilities rebate\r\n\r\nis  a  very  good measure to assist people to overcome  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties.  But for those who  live  in  5-room\r\n\r\nflats  or  private properties, they are not entitled  to  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  under this scheme.  I believe that in this  present\r\n\r\neconomic downturn, they too are having  similar difficulties.\r\n\r\nI  think  they  too  need some form of  assistance  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  hope that apart from HDB flat dwellers,  the\r\n\r\nprivate  property owners should also be given some  utilities\r\n\r\nrebate,  so  that they can share the happiness  and  hardship\r\n\r\ntogether with their fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, DPM mentioned about the wage cut for our\r\n\r\nMinisters and senior civil servants.  I believe that this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  our people will all agree  with.   It  also\r\n\r\nshows  that we are prepared to share our woes together.   Our\r\n\r\nleaders  have  put in a lot of efforts to make  policies  and\r\n\r\nwork  out strategies to lead our country. In good times, they\r\n\r\nlead us to prosperity and in bad times, they guide us out  of\r\n\r\ntroubled  waters. Our people generally appreciate what  these\r\n\r\nleaders  have  done.  They realise that it is  not  easy  for\r\n\r\nthese  leaders to lead our country through bliss  and  gloom.\r\n\r\nBut  during a financial crisis when the people are  suffering\r\n\r\nunder adverse circumstances, the Ministers also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannounced  that  they  will take a pay  cut.   This  is  very\r\n\r\nlaudable indeed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, during bad times, we are not giving up our efforts\r\n\r\nto  attract  foreign investments here in Singapore.  It is  a\r\n\r\ndifficult time, because many companies will  choose to invest\r\n\r\nin  China  instead of Singapore.  There may be  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  them to come here, but we must also review the terms and\r\n\r\nconditions  we  offer to these foreign  investors  so  as  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  attract them to come here.  We should  simplify\r\n\r\nour  administrative procedures to make it easier for them  to\r\n\r\nset  up  their businesses here in Singapore, so that  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess we can create  more job opportunities for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave just one short point to make and two clarifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point actually arises from my having sat in some\r\n\r\nrecent dialogue sessions where some professionals have raised\r\n\r\nthe   issue  of  infrastructural  work,   now  that  we   are\r\n\r\naccelerating some of the major projects to the tune  of  $3.5\r\n\r\nbillion.  I believe PWD, which was corporatised not that long\r\n\r\nago,  is  still  enjoying a moratorium  on  major  Government\r\n\r\nprojects, and this results in PWD having a lion share of  all\r\n\r\nthis  work.   We have many professional firms  -  architects,\r\n\r\nengineers,  various building consultants -   who  are  having\r\n\r\nvery  bad times.   They are struggling.  And while it is nice\r\n\r\nto  have  acceleration of these projects, I  trust  that  the\r\n\r\nentire amount would not end up going towards the corporatised\r\n\r\nPWD,  leaving all of these firms out in the cold.  I do  hope\r\n\r\nsome consideration will be given to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two clarifications are: first, with regard to\r\n\r\nhospital  fee rebates for classes B2 and C, we are  targeting\r\n\r\nat  citizens and their families.  I was not clear on  whether\r\n\r\nfamily  members who are non-citizens would also  qualify.   I\r\n\r\nwork  in  a hospital.  Very often, we would see citizens  who\r\n\r\nstruggle with dealing with fees for their family members  who\r\n\r\nmay  not  be citizens.  So that would be a good clarification\r\n\r\nto have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is with regard to the New\r\n\r\nSingapore  Shares.   I  just  want  to  make  sure   that   I\r\n\r\nunderstand.   The shares will be given through CPF  accounts,\r\n\r\ncurrent or non-current accounts.  By that, I understand  that\r\n\r\nall  non-CPF  account holders will not qualify  for  the  New\r\n\r\nSingapore Shares.  The New Singapore Shares are not the  same\r\n\r\nas CPF Top-ups.  I think they are meant to give all Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  the feeling of belonging and of sharing.   A  large\r\n\r\npercentage  of  home-makers  would  not  have  CPF  accounts.\r\n\r\nSurely, it cannot be right that they will not be eligible for\r\n\r\nthe New Singapore Shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is all that I wanted to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in a  short period of three months, we are  now\r\n\r\nintroducing a second package, and this time it is  for  $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion.  I think the important thing for us to do now is  to\r\n\r\nrestore  the  confidence of the people, because many  workers\r\n\r\nare   worried  that  they  would  lose  their  jobs  and  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses are worried that they would collapse.   After  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11 event, many people were saying that  the  World\r\n\r\nTrade  Centre  had  collapsed and  the  companies  here  will\r\n\r\ncollapse too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, $11.3 billion is a big sum of money. But no matter\r\n\r\nhow much we have instilled in our economy, the most important\r\n\r\nthing  is  to  maintain the confidence  of  the  people,  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and the Government.  The Feedback  Unit  recently\r\n\r\nconducted a survey on how much confidence the people  had  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  leading us out of the  present  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Only 56.5% stated that they had great  confidence in\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  capability in pulling us through,  another\r\n\r\n34%  or so said that they had some confidence, not very  much\r\n\r\nbut not very little, but just some confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we increase the confidence of this 34% in\r\n\r\nthe  Government?   If  this survey  is  conducted  after  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this package by DPM, I am  sure  many  more\r\n\r\npeople  would have greater confidence in the Government.   In\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills Development Fund alone, the Government will be putting\r\n\r\nin another $50 million.  I am sure this will give people more\r\n\r\nconfidence  that the Government is serious in  equipping  the\r\n\r\nworkers so as to enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People for Jobs Traineeship Programme will benefit\r\n\r\nthose in the middle income group because, prior to this,  the\r\n\r\nconcern  was on the lower income group only, but now  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking  into  the benefits for the middle income  people  as\r\n\r\nwell.   But these people still do not have confidence in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Many of them have reservations about  undergoing\r\n\r\nretraining or skill enhancement.  Many people say  that  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  feel good about going back to the classrooms or  the\r\n\r\nworkshops.   I  think  we  should make  them  feel  good  and\r\n\r\nconfident  in  being retrained.  As many of my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues have said in this House, many people above the age\r\n\r\nof  50  cannot get a job. Now, even those above 40 are having\r\n\r\ndifficulty  getting a job. Nowadays, at 40,  you  are  looked\r\n\r\nupon  as an old man.  That being the case, then half  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  would be deemed to be old people.    I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould change this perception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government is granting a rebate on\r\n\r\ndiesel  tax.  This will benefit the taxi drivers.  Many  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers told me that nowadays after queuing for four hours at\r\n\r\nthe  airport,  they  could  not get  any  tourists  as  their\r\n\r\npassengers   - no more American or Japanese tourists.   After\r\n\r\ndeducting their costs, their net income is just about  $10  a\r\n\r\nday.   I hope the taxi companies will pass on the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthis diesel tax rebate to the taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that is worth mentioning is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   decision  not  to  cut  the   employers'   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.   I  think this is a good  reassurance  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Of course, if the recession gets worse, I think  we\r\n\r\ncannot  rule  out  the  possibility of  a  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have the people lost their confidence? This is\r\n\r\nbecause  in  the last few years, we have been developing  too\r\n\r\nfast.  Many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies are relocating and we have been importing a lot  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talents.  Many people who were retrenched could  not\r\n\r\nfind  an  alternative job, and they put the blame on  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents.  And now with China coming up, many people are  also\r\n\r\nblaming  China for all these problems.  These are  challenges\r\n\r\nwhich the Government will have to face and tackle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has now introduced this package where a lot of money\r\n\r\nis put into our economy.  I think this will help to boost the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the people.  As I see it, there are four levels\r\n\r\nof  problems.    First, the superficial level.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nenhance   the  employability of the people, and  the  country\r\n\r\nmust  have the competitiveness. We have been emphasising this\r\n\r\neven  in the 1960s, but the people just looked at the surface\r\n\r\nof  the  matter  and  were not prepared to  look  beyond  the\r\n\r\nsuperficial  level. In 1970s and 1980s, when faced  with  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  and recession, people  began  to  look  a\r\n\r\nlittle deeper, which I shall call the sub-surface level.  The\r\n\r\npeople  were  persuaded to cooperate with  the  employers  to\r\n\r\nsuffer a pay-cut to keep their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Asian financial crisis in 1997 brought the\r\n\r\npeople  to  the inner level, where they began to realise  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  skills  upgrading  and  retraining  to   stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive and enjoy better employability. The September  11\r\n\r\nevent  in   2001  gave the people a rude jolt that took  them\r\n\r\ninto  the  deep-inside  level where  not  only  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nworkers  but  also  the  middle and senior  management  level\r\n\r\npeople  are  feeling the pinch.  The people begin to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  they  have to look far and beyond the present problems.\r\n\r\nI  think  the Government has a very long telescope which  can\r\n\r\nsee very far ahead. Perhaps, the Government should share this\r\n\r\ntelescope with the people, so that they can look farther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members were talking about handing out umbrellas\r\n\r\nduring rainy days.   I think, in the present day context, the\r\n\r\numbrella  is  not good enough, because it has its limitation.\r\n\r\nThe feeling is that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  hand  out umbrellas when it is raining.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  build up an environment whereby companies can   carry\r\n\r\non  with their businesses, rain or shine, storm or no  storm.\r\n\r\nWe  should  convey this message to everybody.   Nowadays,  in\r\n\r\nevery  HDB  neighbourhood, we have  built  covered  walkways.\r\n\r\nResidents  can  walk along the covered walkways  to  the  bus\r\n\r\nstop even when it rains. But, I heard that where there is  no\r\n\r\ncovered walkway, the residents would complain that they could\r\n\r\nnot  walk  out to the bus stop when it rains.  I asked   them\r\n\r\nwhy  they did not get an umbrella. They said that it was  too\r\n\r\ntroublesome. They would rather wait for the rain to stop.   I\r\n\r\nthink  if  you have to catch a bus to go to your destination,\r\n\r\nyou  should  run across to the bus stop, whether there  is  a\r\n\r\ncovered  walkway or not, even if you do not have an umbrella.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  you  will  not catch the  bus  and  get  to  your\r\n\r\ndestination in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think DPM should emphasise to the people that they on\r\n\r\ntheir part too must  trim themselves in a difficult time like\r\n\r\nthis  and  make every effort to lift up their heads  and  not\r\n\r\nwalk  around with their chins down. The people must not  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  confidence.  Whether  or not  there  is  an  umbrella,\r\n\r\nwhether or not there is a covered walkway, life must  go  on.\r\n\r\nWe should work together hand in hand to make Singapore strong\r\n\r\nand  competitive.   Yes,  what  we  need  is  confidence   in\r\n\r\nourselves!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, before I came\r\n\r\nto this Chamber this morning, I listed down a list of what  I\r\n\r\nthought  Government  could do in so far as  these  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  resuscitate the economy to achieve  growth  and\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities in our economy  are  concerned.   I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that the Deputy Prime Minister's list far exceeded\r\n\r\nmy  expectations.  My list also included cuts  in  Ministers'\r\n\r\nand  Members of Parliament's salaries and allowances.  So  it\r\n\r\nis a sincere and genuine list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one policy that I really could not understand, and\r\n\r\nperhaps the Deputy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime Minister could explain, is the GST.  I believe that one\r\n\r\nof  the  most  powerful instruments that we can  do  in  this\r\n\r\npresent  circumstance actually is to reduce the rate  of  our\r\n\r\nGST  without dismantling the structure of the GST  operation.\r\n\r\nWhy  do I say that it is important?  It is not a question  of\r\n\r\njust  3% makes no difference to price cuts and whatever.   It\r\n\r\nis  really a question of a reduction of perhaps 2%  and  with\r\n\r\nthat,  a very sizeable flow of liquidity in the economy.   It\r\n\r\nmight  not  make  much  difference  to  price  as  to  affect\r\n\r\nspending.  But, nonetheless, it gives opportunities for small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  other businesses to survive and  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  present situation.  If you estimate the GST collection\r\n\r\nat  about  $1.5 billion a year, a reduction of 2% could  well\r\n\r\nmean  $1  billion  immediate and sustained injection  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems in resuscitating measures in off-Budget measures or fiscal spending measures is the time lag.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  have here $11.3 billion, you can  see  that  it\r\n\r\ntakes  probably two or three years before this whole  package\r\n\r\ncan be fully worked out.  What we need now is actually a very\r\n\r\nstrong  dose for resuscitating the economy.  So I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  could really think about  this  and  perhaps\r\n\r\nconsider this once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to raise is for the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  small and medium-sized enterprises.   There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  this  policy suggested of a new look  to  assist  local\r\n\r\nenterprises.  One of the items listed here is the micro  loan\r\n\r\nscheme.   I  really applaud this new out-of-the-box  type  of\r\n\r\nthinking  by the Government in trying to look at these  micro\r\n\r\nloan  features.   Of course, it will take time  before  micro\r\n\r\nloan features and micro loan lending can work out.  But there\r\n\r\nare   many   countries   where  such  schemes   have   worked\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.  So I would like to support this and  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  work  full  steam ahead  on  such  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes for small and medium enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reducing rental property and property taxes, one of\r\n\r\nthe  problems that tenants always face is that the owners  of\r\n\r\nproperty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not pass down these rebates to the tenants or the lessees.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder whether there can be some measures or instruction\r\n\r\nor  some  conditionality placed such that tenants do get  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  this.   Because right  now  it  is  really  the\r\n\r\ntenants,  not just the owners but also downstream across  the\r\n\r\neconomy, that people are faced with difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trying to assist SMEs, I note in this Executive\r\n\r\nSummary  that the Government talks about \"improved access  to\r\n\r\nfunds  for  local enterprises\", and this \"improved access  to\r\n\r\nfunds\"  is really clearly underlined.  This has been  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  complaints by SMEs that many of them do not seem to  get\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of these funding schemes by Government.   So  by\r\n\r\nimproving  access, I really believe that the Government  must\r\n\r\nwork  out  features  and  processes for  them  to  avoid  the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  network and bureaucracy difficulties  that  they\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government could work out measures\r\n\r\nwithin  this  assistance package to the  SMEs  to  help  them\r\n\r\nrefinance  their lendings.  One of the complaints  that  SMEs\r\n\r\nhave  been bringing up is that although interest rates  right\r\n\r\nnow  are low, they are stuck with rates that they have  fixed\r\n\r\nsometime ago and that this difference in spread really is now\r\n\r\nmade  by the banks.  So they are thinking and asking of  ways\r\n\r\nand  means  by which the authority and we, as the Government,\r\n\r\ncan  help  them by refinancing such schemes and whether  such\r\n\r\nrefinancing packages that are announced today can be packaged\r\n\r\ninto this difficulty that is specifically faced by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with what one of my colleagues, Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh,  talked  about  just now on  some  of  the  investment\r\n\r\ncriteria and requirements for industrial properties from  the\r\n\r\nJTC  authority.   I believe that investment criteria  by  JTC\r\n\r\nshould be relaxed so that you do not need to put in such high\r\n\r\ninvestments  in  order to secure leases.  Perhaps  even  such\r\n\r\nlower investment criteria might generate more employment  for\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise the point that I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Deputy Prime Minister that this present  situation\r\n\r\nneeds  a  complete re-look at how our domestic economy  would\r\n\r\nhave  to perform in the future.  One of the suggestions  that\r\n\r\nSMEs  have been bringing up is that they hope that they could\r\n\r\nalso  be  part  of  this  effort  in  re-looking  at  how  to\r\n\r\nrevitalise over a long term our domestic economy and how they\r\n\r\ncan  actually  also make their views heard at higher  levels,\r\n\r\nwhether  at  statutory  boards or at  GLCs,  where  they  can\r\n\r\nprovide   downstream   facilities   as   well   as   business\r\n\r\nopportunities and contracts, so that the economy as  a  whole\r\n\r\ndownstream can also benefit from the leading sectors  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   The view is that at the current stage,  what  they\r\n\r\ncan  do  in  presenting their views is usually done  only  in\r\n\r\ncommittees that are called from time to time, feedback and so\r\n\r\non.   But  in  actual business environment context,  many  of\r\n\r\ntheir  views and capabilities, perhaps even their weaknesses,\r\n\r\ncould be improved upon.  So I hope the Government could  take\r\n\r\na  new  look at these whole measures and assist the  economy,\r\n\r\nnot  just this present package but also in the coming one  or\r\n\r\ntwo years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, this downturn is\r\n\r\nsharp,  and the Deputy Prime Minister has described  this  as\r\n\r\nthe    steepest    downturn   Singapore   has    experienced.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are hurting and having to make some very painful\r\n\r\ndecisions  in  everyday life.  A couple of days  ago  when  I\r\n\r\ntalked  to some of my grassroots leaders, they gave  me  some\r\n\r\nanecdotal  evidence  which,  I  think,  really  rings   true.\r\n\r\nIndividuals  are  having to make decisions  like  whether  to\r\n\r\nleave  their  children  in  kindergartens  or  withdraw  them\r\n\r\nbecause  they  cannot  afford the fees due  to  retrenchment.\r\n\r\nThere  are  others who work in coffeeshops who tell  me  that\r\n\r\neven  decisions as minute as wanting to buy a soft drink have\r\n\r\nbecome  marginally  significant.   Also,  individuals,  young\r\n\r\npeople  who  are at work, are afraid to go on  leave  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  afraid  that when they come back,  they  would  be\r\n\r\namongst those who are retrenched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this environment, the evidence is that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  doing their best to help  themselves,  but\r\n\r\nthey  are  also looking to the Government to do its  part  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them through this period of difficulty.  In that sense,\r\n\r\nI  think the package has been a very significant one.  It  is\r\n\r\nsignificant,   first,  in  terms  of   its   size   and   how\r\n\r\ncomprehensive it has been.  I think, secondly,  it  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  significant because it demonstrates that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  the will and commitment to come out with a large package\r\n\r\nto  help  Singaporeans when there is a time  of  need.   Many\r\n\r\ntimes  in  this House in the last several years, I have heard\r\n\r\nquestions raised on why we accumulate surpluses and insist on\r\n\r\nputting  money away for a rainy day, and the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nhas  been  hard  put  explaining the  Government's  rationale\r\n\r\nbehind  this  prudent budgeting policy and  attitude  towards\r\n\r\nreserves.  I think this particular experience demonstrates to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that the Government does have the resolve to use\r\n\r\nthe  reserves  when the need arises and that a rainy  day  is\r\n\r\nlike what we have today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I also would like to add my voice to the\r\n\r\nchorus of others who have lauded the leadership shown by  the\r\n\r\nMinisters,  other top civil servants and MPs to  take  a  pay\r\n\r\ncut,  in particular the 17% pay cut that the Ministers  would\r\n\r\nbe  taking.   Sir,  there  are many  types  of  leadership  - leadership  by  example which demonstrates an empathy  and  a\r\n\r\nshared sense of purpose, is perhaps the most compelling,  and\r\n\r\nI congratulate the Government for taking that initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has also stressed one\r\n\r\nimportant point which I thought in our focus on dealing  with\r\n\r\nthis  downturn and the measures that have come about in  this\r\n\r\npackage  we  should not overlook, which is  that  after  this\r\n\r\ncycle is over and we come out of it, how well positioned will\r\n\r\nSingapore  be  to  meet the longer term  challenges  and  the\r\n\r\nstructural  changes.  In particular, Sir, we have  been  made\r\n\r\naware  of many of these fundamental movements, like the shift\r\n\r\nof the economic centre of gravity towards Northeast Asia with\r\n\r\nthe emergence of China, like the need to diversify our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic  base  more into services and in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector  away from the electronic sector to other  areas,  the\r\n\r\nneed to move up the skills ladder and also nurturing our SMEs\r\n\r\nas  another  engine of growth.  And I think many of  the  new\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  have been introduced in this package  can  be\r\n\r\nharnessed to not just help deal with the pain of the downturn\r\n\r\nbut also position Singapore for the longer term challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the slew of measures that the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  outlined and  I  would  like  to  focus\r\n\r\nspecifically on two or three key areas.  The first is that  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is good that we have come out with a package  that\r\n\r\nwould  help many HDB residents meet their mortgage  payments,\r\n\r\netc,  with respect to their home loans.  The key though, Sir,\r\n\r\nis   there  are  other  aspects  which  I  thought  I  should\r\n\r\nhighlight,  in  particular  with  respect  to  the  upgrading\r\n\r\npackages  that  the Government has introduced,  ie,  the  MUP\r\n\r\nprogramme.  These require typically for a household to commit\r\n\r\nbetween $10,000 and $20,000 expenditure, if they also opt for\r\n\r\nthe  space-adding  item.   This is a  significant  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney, and in the minds of many householders it is a sum that\r\n\r\nthey are not prepared to commit.  There are two categories  - those  who have already committed to it and the payment  will\r\n\r\nbe  due  over  the next year or two because the projects  are\r\n\r\nnearing  completion.  Then there are those who are having  to\r\n\r\nmake a decision over the next few months in a period of great\r\n\r\nuncertainty, and for whom this financial burden  would  be  a\r\n\r\npivotal  factor  in  making their  decision.   We  have  some\r\n\r\nschemes  in  place but they are targeted at the  elderly  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are below a certain income threshold.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether the Government could consider broadening the scope of\r\n\r\nthis in order to make it easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part, Sir, is on the servicing of housing\r\n\r\nloans.  I am considering the question of those in the private\r\n\r\nsector,  those  who  are  taking  up  loans  from  banks  and\r\n\r\nservicing loans on private homes, whether there is scope  for\r\n\r\nsome  of  them to be able to tap into the Special Account  of\r\n\r\nthe CPF, especially when they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen retrenched and contributions to the Ordinary Account dry\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wanted to address is the Economic\r\n\r\nDownturn  Relief Scheme, which is to be administered  through\r\n\r\nthe  CCCs.   I think this is a very welcome move  because  it\r\n\r\nbrings assistance to the ground, closer to individuals and is\r\n\r\nto be administered through individuals who know the area well\r\n\r\nand the needs of their residents.  I would ask, however, that\r\n\r\nthis  be  administered in as efficient a way as  possible  by\r\n\r\nallowing  the agencies on the ground, whether it is the  CCCs\r\n\r\nor  the CDCs, to acquire more manpower in order to do the job\r\n\r\nmore efficiently and, at the same time, in terms of criteria,\r\n\r\nthere is a tendency for such schemes to be bogged down  by  a\r\n\r\nlot  of evaluation.  And the question is whether we can be  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more relaxed with the criteria so that help  where\r\n\r\nneeded  can  be given quickly and it needs to be done  in  an\r\n\r\nearly and expeditious manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point is on the delivery of the service\r\n\r\nitself.  Sir, we live in a system where we are used to a very\r\n\r\nbrisk  and  efficient  form  of service  delivery.   This  is\r\n\r\nexcellent,  but especially at a time of trial like  this,  we\r\n\r\nmay  need to alter the mindsets of many of our civil servants\r\n\r\nor  counter staff and even those on the ground who are  being\r\n\r\nentrusted with the responsibility to administer some  of  the\r\n\r\nservices we are talking about, like financial aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it takes a lot for an individual in hardship to\r\n\r\nswallow  his or her pride and to come out and ask  for  help.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  want to make sure is that we do not make that  task\r\n\r\nmore difficult by either making the process too brisk or  too\r\n\r\nopen,  denying them the confidentiality for the privacy which\r\n\r\nwould  help them preserve their dignity.  I would  urge  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government seriously consider some form of  training  or\r\n\r\nguidance  for those who are entrusted with this,  both  civil\r\n\r\nservice  staff,  but,  as importantly,  the  volunteers,  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders who are being asked to  do  this  on  the\r\n\r\nground,   because  they  need  to  be  made  aware   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  This is not just about telling people,  \"Here\r\n\r\nis the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform,  here  is the scheme, fill it up, let's  do  it.\",  but\r\n\r\nreaching  out  to  them in a manner that  is  empathetic  and\r\n\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I would\r\n\r\njust like to say that the schemes that were introduced by the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister were very comprehensive.  I have  just\r\n\r\ntwo  questions  here.  One is the retraining  programmes  for\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.   I  am  curious  to  know  as  to   how\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  those who are retrenched are retrained  and  to\r\n\r\nfind  a job again.  Is there some kind of feedback here  that\r\n\r\nwe  could  have that would be useful to know how  useful  the\r\n\r\nretraining  programmes  are?  The other  issue  leads  to  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee's point about the New Singapore Shares  and  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  women  and  housewives which  she  has  already\r\n\r\nraised.   I  am not going to go further, but may I  beg  your\r\n\r\nindulgence here to ask for another group of people, and  that\r\n\r\nis,  the destitute elderly in the welfare homes.  It  may  be\r\n\r\nquite  right and justified to let them partake, to a  certain\r\n\r\nextent,  in this scheme that is coming down the Singaporean's\r\n\r\nway.  We have no record in many cases of their histories.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  know how they have contributed to what Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntoday and since we have a scheme now called the New Singapore\r\n\r\nShares to benefit all Singaporeans, I appeal that it is their\r\n\r\nright to be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, if I may, on the whole question about\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr  Iswaran has brought up.  In helping the people  who\r\n\r\nneed  financial aid, I have a slight reservation  here  about\r\n\r\nthe  role  of  the  CCCs.

Many people are\r\n\r\nworried  that the economy will get worse.  Many of  them  may\r\n\r\nlose  their jobs and the businesses may go bust.  The  people\r\n\r\nare  concerned that once they have lost their jobs,  or  when\r\n\r\ntheir  business  collapses, how are they and  their  families\r\n\r\ngoing  to survive, as the cost of living in Singapore  is  so\r\n\r\nvery high.  I do not think I need to reiterate this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of my previous speeches, I have urged the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to make the burden of living so hard  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.   But the Government always says that all things  are\r\n\r\n\"affordable\" to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the economy is good, our people may be able to\r\n\r\nafford  the services and facilities, but barely so.  At  this\r\n\r\ntime of a severe downturn, the Government should promptly re-examine the charges and tariffs to see whether they are still\r\n\r\n\"affordable\"  to  the people.  In the Government's  so-called\r\n\r\n\"market  economy\" and privatisation of public  services,  the\r\n\r\nbottom line is inevitably that the charges are affordable  to\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Now, these people lose their jobs, but the cost\r\n\r\nof  living  is  still  the same. The burden  has  not  become\r\n\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this package is concerned, it has not broken\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Government's existing framework.   Through  all\r\n\r\nthese  rebates  and  temporary measures,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  show that it cares for the people.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  low-income  families, the  fees  of  the  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions are frozen.  I think what the Government  should\r\n\r\ndo  is  to reduce the fees, the charges, the conservancy  and\r\n\r\nservice charges and the utility charges.  A temporary  freeze\r\n\r\nis not enough.  How can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou put off the fire on a cartload of wood with just a cup of\r\n\r\nwater?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this package introduced by the Government, it says\r\n\r\neverybody can get a $200 subsidy.  In a family, if  the  sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinner loses his job and is unemployed, how  is  he  and\r\n\r\nhis  family going to live with $200?  In the present economic\r\n\r\nsituation, the Government should first of all find out how to\r\n\r\nreduce the burden of the people.  For example, GST.  Will the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider reducing the GST or to suspend  GST  for\r\n\r\nthe  time  being?  As for those who are the sole breadwinners\r\n\r\nof  the  family, once they have lost their job, I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should see how many dependants they have, and  use\r\n\r\nit  as  a  basis  of  consideration,  just  like  our  public\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme.   I  think  only  in  this  way  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment give them some genuine help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government should also conduct a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review on the foreign talent policy.   Yes,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt, if we want to be a hub of the global economy, we  have\r\n\r\nto  adopt  an  open-minded attitude to accept  these  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents.   But the problem is how do we define talent?   From\r\n\r\nwhat  I  understand,  to  qualify their  applicants  for  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Pass  system, many companies are  making  use  of\r\n\r\nvarious loopholes to employ foreign workers to save on  their\r\n\r\nmanpower  cost,  and  I think this is not  a  very  foolproof\r\n\r\nmethod.  I have written to MOM on this, but to no avail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singaporeans are born in this country.\r\n\r\nThey   have  completed  their  national  service,  they  have\r\n\r\nshouldered their responsibility as citizens.  But now,  these\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  are coming here to snatch away  their  rice\r\n\r\nbowl.   Of  course, from DPM's speech, I understand that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has already begun to look into this matter.   But\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not this matter can be effectively  resolved,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is still doubtful.  The Government should  take  a\r\n\r\ndeeper  look  into  the matter and work  out  some  means  to\r\n\r\noversee  this system.  We should not reject our local talents\r\n\r\nand  ask  these foreign talents to take up jobs  which  could\r\n\r\nactually  be taken up by our own citizens.  I think  this  is\r\n\r\nunfair to our own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This present package can be said to be more presentable\r\n\r\nthan the two previous so-called off-Budget packages.  In  the\r\n\r\nprevious  packages, the main emphasis was on saving  business\r\n\r\ncosts,  and  the  workers are the people  who  suffer.   This\r\n\r\npackage can be described as a \"painless\" package.  Why is  it\r\n\r\npainless?  Because the General Election is coming.  After the\r\n\r\nelection,  the  pain  will  come.   Singaporeans  should   be\r\n\r\nmentally prepared for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, today the Government has announced the new off-Budget  package at a total cost of $11.3 billion.  We welcome\r\n\r\nthis package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry had urged the Government to introduce a package\r\n\r\nof  no  less  than  $10 billion, and to have  more  bold  and\r\n\r\nefficient  off-Budget measures to help  the  businesses  tide\r\n\r\nover  the  difficult times.  The various chambers of commerce\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore  Confederation of  Industries  and  other\r\n\r\norganisations   have  also  made  similar  appeals   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   This  package announced by the  Government  has\r\n\r\nfully illustrated that the Government has the confidence  and\r\n\r\ncapability  to  deal with the present economic problems,  and\r\n\r\nhas  also  placed  great importance on  the  appeals  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community. It has shown its sincerity in wanting  to\r\n\r\nhelp the business community get out of this crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this package, there are some adjustments that have\r\n\r\nbeen  adopted,  just like it was mentioned  by  the  previous\r\n\r\nspeakers  before me but, on the whole, this  package  is  one\r\n\r\nthat is praiseworthy.  On behalf of the business community, I\r\n\r\nwould like to express our sincere thanks to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new financial assistance package is a measure to\r\n\r\nstimulate our economy, to help our economy turn around  at  a\r\n\r\nfaster pace.  It is indeed a shot in the arm for our economy.\r\n\r\nParticularly,  in this package, there are various  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes.  Financial assistance schemes were introduced in the\r\n\r\nhope that the employees from the various sectors - industrial\r\n\r\nand commercial sector, property sector,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  sector  and  the  SMEs - would  be  given  more  job\r\n\r\nopportunities,  so  as to help the unemployed  find  jobs.  I\r\n\r\nthink   the  workers  from  the  various  enterprises  should\r\n\r\ntreasure and seize this opportunity, and make full use of the\r\n\r\nmeasures  in this package and adopt a more positive  attitude\r\n\r\nin  their  work, to continue learning, to upgrade themselves,\r\n\r\nto re-skill themselves, and to enhance their competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIn  this situation of economic recession, as employees,  they\r\n\r\nshould  be more realistic in their expectation.  They  should\r\n\r\nnot  add  on to the burden of the employers, because  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation  it  is a very important  thing  that  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses do survive, so that the workers are able to retain\r\n\r\ntheir jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the employers will also make full use\r\n\r\nof  the measures under this package and strengthen themselves\r\n\r\nso  that  they  are able to ride through this stormy  weather\r\n\r\nand,  if  necessary, the various chambers of commerce  should\r\n\r\nwork  together  with  the relevant authorities  so  that  the\r\n\r\nmeasures could be more effective in their implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enterprises should look at the long-term perspective\r\n\r\nand  take  this opportunity to reposition themselves  and  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  their  businesses so  that  they  could  perform\r\n\r\nbetter  after  the  economy  has turned  around.   With  this\r\n\r\npackage  announced  by  the  Government,  apart  from   being\r\n\r\ngrateful   to   the   Government   for   understanding    our\r\n\r\ndifficulties, we also hope that the Government would  quickly\r\n\r\nimplement  these measures so that they could  have  immediate\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also hope that the Government would allow these\r\n\r\nmeasures  to be implemented over a longer period of time  and\r\n\r\nto  avoid  withdrawing these measures the moment the  economy\r\n\r\nturns  around, like in the past. I think we should  give  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses some breathing space so that they will be able  to\r\n\r\nrecover from this crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that so long as we could\r\n\r\nmaintain  and  manifest this spirit of tripartism  among  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the labour and the management,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  each  party  giving  its best,  and  all  working  with\r\n\r\nsincerity  and  unity,  we  will surely  pull  through  these\r\n\r\ndifficult times and head for a brighter future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the debate thereunder be\r\n\r\nexempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Mr\r\n\r\nWong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TACKLING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, first of all, I do not understand Mr Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang's  remarks.   I think we should  not  give  the  wrong\r\n\r\nimpression to our people.  The important point here  is  that\r\n\r\nduring a recession, when any citizen cannot afford to pay for\r\n\r\nhis  or  his children's education fees, we have all kinds  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance schemes to help him. There  are  always\r\n\r\nvarious  kinds  of  bursaries available to the  students,  to\r\n\r\nensure  that they are not deprived of the opportunity  to  be\r\n\r\neducated just because they could not afford the fees.  I  can\r\n\r\nsay this with full conviction because in the 1980s during the\r\n\r\neconomic  recession, I was one of those  who  depended  on  a\r\n\r\nbursary to complete my studies.  For others who require  help\r\n\r\nto pay for their utilities bills, HDB rentals, loans, etc, we\r\n\r\nare also providing them with various kinds of assistance.  We\r\n\r\nmust  make them feel assured that help is on the way  or  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given to them.  We should not exacerbate their  worries\r\n\r\nand concerns or they will not be able to sleep properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the DPM's $11.3 billion\r\n\r\npackage.   It  is  a  comprehensive  and  wide-ranging   help\r\n\r\npackage.    From  the  big  businessmen  to  the   small-time\r\n\r\nstallholders, from management staff to ordinary  workers  and\r\n\r\nso  on, to students, undergraduates, graduates, they have all\r\n\r\nbeen considered in this package so that everybody can benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  it.   I  believe that this package can  allow  all  our\r\n\r\npeople to pull through the crisis and preserve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  energy so that when the economy turns over, they  will\r\n\r\nemerge stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a story that goes like this:\r\n\r\nan  intelligent person came across a fish which was caught in\r\n\r\na  small  puddle of water.  The fish pleaded  with  the  man,\r\n\r\n\"Please  save  me!  Give me the water that you have  in  your\r\n\r\ncontainer.\"   The intelligent man replied,  \"The  sun  is  so\r\n\r\nstrong  and it is so hot here.  Even if I give you the  whole\r\n\r\ncontainer of water, it will not last long as it will  dry  up\r\n\r\nsoon, and you will die in due course.  So, I am going to  dig\r\n\r\na canal all the way from the seaside to here so that you will\r\n\r\nbe  able to swim to the sea and stay alive.\"  The fish sighed\r\n\r\nand  said,  \"By then, I would have become a dried fish.\"   In\r\n\r\nthis  story, the thinking of both the sage and the  fish  was\r\n\r\nnot  wrong.  But, a well thought out plan that takes ages  to\r\n\r\nbe  implemented  will  not save a man in immediate  distress.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  are in a predicament, we need immediate reliefs  to\r\n\r\nsolve  our immediate problems.  But, of course, we  must  not\r\n\r\nlose  sight  of long-term effective solutions.  So,  at  this\r\n\r\ntime,  we must depend on the Government to look after  us  in\r\n\r\nthe  short  term, and at the same time, plan  for  long  term\r\n\r\nstrategies to keep us in good stead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present circumstances, our tripartite partners\r\n\r\nshould  stay united to maintain our competitive edge, in  the\r\n\r\nhope  that  we can see the happy situation of full-employment\r\n\r\nagain in the not too distant future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, right now we are facing an economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  which is quite different from the past.   Apart  from\r\n\r\nworkers  from  the  manufacturing industry, particularly  the\r\n\r\nelectronics   industry,  employees  in  financial,   banking,\r\n\r\nairlines  and all the various logistics companies - even  our\r\n\r\nwhite-collar  workers - are affected.   There  is  a  Teochew\r\n\r\nsaying  to  the effect that where the shade is, you  sit  and\r\n\r\nenjoy the cool.  To that, I want to add:  wherever there is a\r\n\r\njob,  you will go and grab it.  How do we help our workers go\r\n\r\nto  where the work is?  The important thing is that  we  must\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  work-matching efforts, that  is,  train  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  turn  to other jobs where they can  have  better\r\n\r\nprospects.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  package,  the  extension of the  period  for  the  wage\r\n\r\nsubsidy  will  also  be  a piece of very  good  news  to  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lower income group, the high utility bill driven\r\n\r\nby  increasing oil price is a perpetual headache.  So this is\r\n\r\na  good  time  to lower the electricity tariff to  help  them\r\n\r\nlighten  their  burden.  The Government understands  workers'\r\n\r\ndifficulties  by giving them a 10% rebate for  their  medical\r\n\r\nbills.  I am particularly moved by the Government's effort to\r\n\r\nfurther  give  the retrenched workers another 40%  off  their\r\n\r\nhospital bills.  This is really xue zhong song tan -  sending\r\n\r\nhot burning charcoal in snowy weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the $20 million in the package to help the\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers, I think it is a very  timely  help.   It\r\n\r\ngives  them three months' help in their daily lives.  In  the\r\n\r\npast  few  months,  during our meet-the-people  sessions,  we\r\n\r\nfrequently come across workers who come to us for help.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with what Mr Low Thia Khiang said that  the  $200\r\n\r\nsubsidy was a pittance and useless in helping the unemployed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the $200 can ensure that we have a continuous supply\r\n\r\nof  water  and electricity in our flats.  It can  give  us  a\r\n\r\nbasic livelihood.  At this time, I think this subsidy is very\r\n\r\ntimely.  It is welcomed.  I do not understand why some people\r\n\r\nfeel that this package is not necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has done so much. I hope to see that the\r\n\r\npeople in the grassroots also show more care and concern  for\r\n\r\nthe  people.   For  example,  the coffeeshop  and  restaurant\r\n\r\nowners  can pass down some of the benefits they will  receive\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of  rental  and  utilities  rebates  to  their\r\n\r\nstallholders.  The coffeeshop owners should also  adjust  the\r\n\r\nprices  of their beverages and food so as to help our  people\r\n\r\ntide over this difficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past eight months, from January to August\r\n\r\nthis year, the HDB has helped about 8,000 residents tide over\r\n\r\ntheir  difficulties by adjusting their housing loan repayment\r\n\r\nperiod.  I hope that the HDB can also consider the plight  of\r\n\r\nthe   shop   tenants  by  giving  them  similar   sympathetic\r\n\r\ntreatment.   Do  not  pressurise them  too  much  when  their\r\n\r\nrentals are in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrears.   Recently, one shop owner came to me  and  told  me\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  in financial difficulties and had  received  a\r\n\r\nlawyer's letter from HDB threatening him that if he failed to\r\n\r\npay up the rental arrears immediately, he would be liable for\r\n\r\nall  legal costs to be incurred subsequently.  I believe  HDB\r\n\r\nshould be more sympathetic towards the small-time businessmen\r\n\r\nwho are in genuine financial hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in 1997, during the economic crisis, we\r\n\r\nalso  had  provisions for every sector to help their  workers\r\n\r\ntide over the difficult period.  In 1998, we appealed to  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport operators to pass on the benefit of rebates\r\n\r\nto  their  commuters to help workers tide over the  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   I was glad that the Government effected a 5%  rebate\r\n\r\non  public transport charges for the whole year of  1999,  so\r\n\r\nthat  commuters who take public transportation to work, would\r\n\r\nenjoy  lower  transportation cost.  I  hope  that  this  time\r\n\r\nround,  during this present recession, which is more  serious\r\n\r\nthan  that in 1999, similar arrangements can be made to  help\r\n\r\nour  workers.   I hope that the bus companies will  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has addressed the issues of many\r\n\r\npeople  and  many  workers have taken  the  heed  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Now  it is for the business community  to  look\r\n\r\ninto ways and means to cooperate in the tripartite spirit  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can come out with more effective solutions.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  appeal to the employers that before  they  retrench\r\n\r\ntheir workers, they should consider other means first, as was\r\n\r\nthe agreement among the tripartite partners in 1997.  At that\r\n\r\ntime,  the  three parties agreed that during  the  recession,\r\n\r\nretrenchment  of workers would be the last  resort.   I  also\r\n\r\nhope that, in the unfortunate event the company has to resort\r\n\r\nto  retrenchment, the employer should be more sympathetic and\r\n\r\ncompassionate to the workers, by giving the workers more time\r\n\r\nand  longer  notice before they are retrenched.   You  cannot\r\n\r\njust  give them a phone call and kick them out.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  employers will be able to reduce that kind of grievances\r\n\r\nand pains to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this off-Budget package of $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion is better than the $10 billion as predicted by  many.\r\n\r\nIt  is  better by some 13%.  Compared to $2.2 billion of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  package, it is about five times more.   It  can  be\r\n\r\nseen  that  the  present   recession  is  indeed  very,  very\r\n\r\nserious.   It  also  shows  that  the  Government   has   the\r\n\r\ndetermination  to  help the people who are affected  by  this\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package basically comprises four main points.\r\n\r\nFirst, it reduces business cost  to keep the businesses  from\r\n\r\ncollapsing;  secondly, it helps to preserve  jobs  and   help\r\n\r\nthose  who  have lost their jobs to go through the  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod;   thirdly,   it    enhances   and   accelerates   our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  construction to stimulate the  economy;  and,\r\n\r\nfourthly, it prepares us for the future challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, unemployment rate has been climbing from last\r\n\r\nyear's  2.2% to the present 4%.  By the end of this year,  it\r\n\r\nis  likely  to  reach 4.5%.  I believe some  20,000  will  be\r\n\r\nworkers  retrenched this year.  There are so many people  who\r\n\r\nhave  lost their jobs.  At a time like this, I believe  those\r\n\r\naffected workers really do not know where to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the Deputy Prime Minister's statement, I\r\n\r\nfeel as though I have been given a shot in the arm.  With all\r\n\r\nthe  various  measures  announced  in  the  package,  he  has\r\n\r\ncertainly  given something for everyone, and the much  needed\r\n\r\nhelp to the workers to tide them over for the time being.  On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, opportunities for retraining are provided  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers to prepare them for better jobs to come, and  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, more money will be pumped into  the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  to  finance training  programmes  and  pay\r\n\r\ntraining allowances to the workers. I think if the people are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  upgrading  themselves,  by  undergoing  these\r\n\r\ntraining courses, they will certainly benefit from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the individual side, the Citizens' Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees (CCCs) are vested with the authority to disburse a\r\n\r\nsubsidy of $200 per month to every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeserving  resident in the constituency, under  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDownturn  Relief Scheme.  This subsidy will  help  to  defray\r\n\r\nthe  expenses of the unemployed individual and  help  him  go\r\n\r\nthrough the training.  Once he falls sick, his hospital bills\r\n\r\nwill  be reduced by up to 50%, and beyond that, there is  the\r\n\r\nMedifund  which  can  help the very bad  cases.   So  medical\r\n\r\nexpenses  should  not be a problem, even to  the  unemployed.\r\n\r\nWith  the  utilities rebate, HDB rental rebates and  deferred\r\n\r\npayment  of housing loans, etc, in the short-term, those  who\r\n\r\nare  retrenched or who are unemployed will heave  a  sigh  of\r\n\r\nrelief.     But  no  matter what kind of package  you  offer,\r\n\r\nthere  is bound to be some categories of people who  are  not\r\n\r\ncovered,  for example, the old people of 50 or 60  years  old\r\n\r\nand above. Perhaps, our Community Development Councils (CDCs)\r\n\r\ncan  find  some  ways to help such people on  a  case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis,  according  to  their  individual   circumstances.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  if  we  can  do this, then this package  would  have\r\n\r\ncovered  almost the entire population. Anyone who needs  help\r\n\r\nwill get  help under this  package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, some companies may feel that they\r\n\r\nhave  too many workers in hand.  Their expenses are too  high\r\n\r\nand  they have no choice but to cut cost in its struggle  for\r\n\r\nsurvival.  These people can make use of the various  measures\r\n\r\nin  the  package to save their costs and help tide  over  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  times.   As  for  those companies  with  redundant\r\n\r\nworkers, apart from retrenchment, they can resort to  SDF  to\r\n\r\nget  about 50% subsidy to send these workers for training  to\r\n\r\nget  ready  for the good time when the economy turns  around.\r\n\r\nThen  they will have a choice to retain their workers  or  to\r\n\r\nretrain  them  for future use, and they will  have  a  better\r\n\r\nfuture.   So on this side, this series of measures  can  help\r\n\r\nour  businessmen in cost-cutting and provide subsidies to pay\r\n\r\nfor  their workers' salaries.  It is very beneficial and will\r\n\r\nhelp the companies to survive.  It will also help our workers\r\n\r\nto keep their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring forward our infrastructure construction is the\r\n\r\nnormal practice in times of economic downturn to create\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs  and  to  stimulate the economy.  This time round,  some\r\n\r\n$3.5 billion worth of projects are in the pipeline.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  important to our construction industry.   I  hope  that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  have so many projects available, amounting to  $3.5\r\n\r\nbillion, we can go step by step, with numerous small projects\r\n\r\nto  benefit more contractors.  Some people may have  no  idea\r\n\r\nwhat   is   the   magnitude  of   $3.5   billion   worth   of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure development.  Let me tell them  that  you  can\r\n\r\nbuild two Chua Chu Kang new towns with that amount.  So it is\r\n\r\na  very  massive  amount.    Within  a  short  time,  it  can\r\n\r\nstimulate the building construction industry and bring it out\r\n\r\nof its doldrums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has certain regulations for the purchase of\r\n\r\nflats. This package has made provision for the payment of the\r\n\r\n20%  downpayment to be spread over a longer period.   On  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,   the   private  property  buyers,   especially\r\n\r\nforeigners, can use Singapore dollar loans to purchase  their\r\n\r\nproperty  and  the  exemption  from  capital  gains  tax  for\r\n\r\nproperty  sales. I think this will also give a boost  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry.  Basically, the building industry  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  doldrums for a long period.  There are many reasons, one\r\n\r\nof  which  is  man-made.   Although this  man-made  deterrent\r\n\r\nfactor  is not completely removed by this package, the  other\r\n\r\nconcessions  given  can  stimulate  our  building   industry,\r\n\r\nthereby   giving  our  building  industry  players  and   the\r\n\r\nconstruction workers a ray of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the global trend of globalisation and transition\r\n\r\ninto  a  knowledge-based  economy, we  have  to  prepare  our\r\n\r\nworkers  for the future. As we know, the economy of Singapore\r\n\r\nis  in  a  restructuring phase.  This is  the  time  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  go  for training and retraining.  The  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers  should  go for training to become  skilled  workers,\r\n\r\nwhile the skilled workers should go for further retraining to\r\n\r\nenhance their skills. Those with low education should go  for\r\n\r\nenrichment  studies  to  raise their educational  level.   We\r\n\r\nshould use the low period to retrain our people.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  very important that we prepare and equip our workers  and\r\n\r\nenterprises so that when the time comes, they will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to seize the right opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for issue of employment pass and work\r\n\r\npermit  have been reviewed.  I believe this is a step in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction to prepare us for the future.   As  for  the\r\n\r\nNew  Singapore Shares, not much details have been given.  The\r\n\r\ntotal   amount  is  $2.7  billion.   I  have  made  a  mental\r\n\r\ncalculation.  With a population of 3 million, on the average,\r\n\r\neach citizen should get about $1,000.  For a small family  of\r\n\r\nfour,  you  get about $4,000.  If they stay in a small  flat,\r\n\r\nwith  a  lower income, they get more.  It may well be  double\r\n\r\nthe  amount, say, $8,000. On the average, each family  should\r\n\r\nget  about $5,000.  You get a guaranteed 3% dividend  on  the\r\n\r\n$5,000.   Then,  with economic growth, you  would  get  extra\r\n\r\nbonus  shares.   So,  every Singaporean family  would  get  a\r\n\r\ndirect  benefit  of $5,000, plus interest of  some  5-6%  per\r\n\r\nyear.  The New Singapore Shares are indeed a great gift  from\r\n\r\nthe Government, by their conscience, to the people.  Even  at\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  time,  the people  are  able  to  share  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other angle, during the recession, people need\r\n\r\na lot of money.  The market also needs injection of money and\r\n\r\nfunds.   So when the New Singapore Shares are issued  and  by\r\n\r\nMarch next year, some of the recipients will cash it.  Let us\r\n\r\nsay,  in  the  next six months, some 50% of  the  shares  are\r\n\r\ncashed, there will be $1.35 billion of cash flowing into  the\r\n\r\nmarket. This will surely stimulate consumption in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the entire package, we can say that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  really taken into consideration all the difficulties and\r\n\r\nhardship of the people in various stations of life,  and  has\r\n\r\ngiven  them  a very strong stimulus and a shot  in  the  arm.\r\n\r\nAfter  the package has been implemented, we will get our  own\r\n\r\nshares  or  benefits.  In the process,  the  people  who  are\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  the impact of the economic downturn  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  helping  hand  to  prepare  themselves  for  future\r\n\r\nopportunities when the economy turns around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbelieve that we must thank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  for this very generous, comprehensive,  bold\r\n\r\nand  far-reaching package of $11.3 billion.  I agree with  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Prof. Low Seow Chay, that it is a  good  economic\r\n\r\npackage.   It is definitely not an election ploy, as  alleged\r\n\r\nby  the Opposition.  I believe that this package deserves the\r\n\r\nsupport of all Singaporeans regardless of party line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing a crisis of enormous proportions, and\r\n\r\nwhere  the people are crying out for help, it would be  wrong\r\n\r\nnot  to  do  something about it.  It will  be  wrong  not  to\r\n\r\nsupport such a package.  We should do what is in our national\r\n\r\ninterest  and  what  is  good for  the  common  good  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   I  am therefore glad that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nleaving  no stone unturned and taking all necessary steps  to\r\n\r\nassist  the  lower  income families, the unemployed  and  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   In  particular, I welcome  the  Economic  Downturn\r\n\r\nRelief  Scheme  which  I  believe will  bring  immediate  and\r\n\r\npractical assistance to affected families, and help  them  to\r\n\r\ntide over the current recession.  The involvement of the CCCs\r\n\r\nand grassroots leaders is a plus point, as I believe that the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders know the ground well and they can  better\r\n\r\nadminister  such a scheme.   They can follow up  by  visiting\r\n\r\nthe families and take follow up action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the more stringent criteria for the issue\r\n\r\nof  employment passes and work permits.  This  will  help  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  concern of some Singaporeans on the competition\r\n\r\nfor  jobs  in the recession.  However, we must bear  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  there is no doubt that we need good foreign workers  to\r\n\r\nensure  our economic competitiveness.  The world is changing.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do not have good foreign workers, we may not get  the\r\n\r\ninvestments  that we need to produce better results  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  At the same time, the higher criteria for such\r\n\r\npermits  will ensure better selection and give a  balance  to\r\n\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hail the move by the Government for a\r\n\r\nvoluntary  monthly wage cut of 10% for senior civil servants,\r\n\r\npolitical  office  holders  and  Members  of  Parliament.   I\r\n\r\ncommend the Government for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  sacrifice that it is undertaking for the common good  of\r\n\r\nour  people,  and  setting an excellent example  of  selfless\r\n\r\nservice   to  the  people.   By  this  move,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndemonstrates clearly that it understands the problems of  the\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street, that it stands shoulder to  shoulder  with\r\n\r\nthe  people  and  bond with the people,  in  this  moment  of\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has shown the way for us in this\r\n\r\ncrisis.  All Singaporeans must rally and unite as one  people\r\n\r\nbehind the Government.  Then our future will be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has weathered many storms before, since\r\n\r\nour  separation  from Malaysia in 1965.  This  crisis  is  no\r\n\r\ndifferent.  We shall overcome, but we must keep faith and run\r\n\r\nthe race.  No problem is insurmountable if the people and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  work closely hand in hand to face the  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.  Sir, make no mistake about it.  We, as a people, will\r\n\r\nemerge  stronger from this crisis and we will have  a  deeper\r\n\r\nsense of common destiny and nationhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.08 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for\r\n\r\nthis opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are faced with the worst recession this country\r\n\r\nhas  seen  in  more  than  30 years.  With  unemployment  now\r\n\r\nhovering at about 4% and potentially rising, there is an  air\r\n\r\nof  uncertainty  that hangs over us.  For the  many  who  are\r\n\r\nemployed,  they are now less confident that their  jobs  will\r\n\r\nremain  for the future; and for those who have recently  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs,  there is less certainty that  their  jobs  will\r\n\r\nreturn when the shower of recession passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this recession did not come about from\r\n\r\nwithin,  but  from without.  Economic forces not  within  our\r\n\r\ncontrol have buffeted us since last year, beginning with  the\r\n\r\nslowdown  of  the US economy.  And it did not help  that  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11  terror  attacks  on  America  accelerated  and\r\n\r\ndeepened  the  recession.  Indeed, one  would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 attacks had hastened the slide of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld  economy.  For Singapore whose economic well  being  is\r\n\r\nmuch  dependent on exports to the US and the other  developed\r\n\r\ncountries, this is bad news indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not surprised therefore when Ministers George Yeo\r\n\r\nand  Richard  Hu informed the people that the  economy  would\r\n\r\nshrink  by  perhaps more than 3% this year.  This is  perhaps\r\n\r\nunprecedented  as our people cannot remember  a  time,  since\r\n\r\nindependence, when the economy did so poorly.  For the  post-65  generation,  accustomed to robust growth,  these  figures\r\n\r\nbring   home   the  reality  of  our  vulnerability    -    a\r\n\r\nvulnerability  that  tells us that we too  can  be  as  badly\r\n\r\naffected  as our neighbours were in the last Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis of 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told to be prepared for the long haul. The\r\n\r\neconomy does not look like it is going to recover before  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half of next year.  And beyond that, many have  their\r\n\r\ndoubts  as  to  whether or not there will  be  any  signs  of\r\n\r\nrecovery if the global situation remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond these figures, for the people of Singapore, the\r\n\r\nteeth  of  recession  will  begin to  bite  when  people  get\r\n\r\nretrenched and when there is less money to bring home.  These\r\n\r\nare  real concerns, as with unemployment and salary cuts, the\r\n\r\npressures of paying their bills will surely mount.  How  will\r\n\r\nthe  utilities bills be paid?  Will there be money to pay for\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges?  How will the fees for  the  children's\r\n\r\nschool and tuition be provided for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, Sir, I am gratified that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  come  up with a second round  of  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures.   The  series  of measures  are  clearly  aimed  at\r\n\r\nproviding  relief  for the individuals and  businesses.  What\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  know and realise is that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncares.   Earlier this year, when the first round of  measures\r\n\r\nwas introduced by Minister George Yeo, he mentioned then,  if\r\n\r\nI  may  paraphrase, that there was a drizzle, but  we  should\r\n\r\nnonetheless  have  our umbrella ready  in  case  there  is  a\r\n\r\nshower.   Now  that  the  shower is upon  us,  the  umbrella,\r\n\r\nrepresented by these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures,  should provide Singaporeans with much  relief  and\r\n\r\nprotection from the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we done enough? Should we do more and can we give\r\n\r\nmore?  Are all Singaporeans covered by these measures?  There\r\n\r\nare no doubt questions that have been asked and no doubt will\r\n\r\nbe   asked   by  many  Singaporeans.   These  are  legitimate\r\n\r\nquestions.  However, even before we begin to ponder on  these\r\n\r\nquestions,  we  should  sit  back  and  appreciate  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has done, ponder on the greater challenge and  the\r\n\r\ngreater worries ahead of us, and think of our response  as  a\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accepting these measures, we must look at the horizon\r\n\r\nand  beyond.   We must realise that Singapore  has  a  narrow\r\n\r\nexport    base    that   is   concentrated   on   electronics\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.   Over  the years, our  global  share  of  the\r\n\r\nelectronics  market  has  been  dwindling  because  of   keen\r\n\r\ncompetition  from emerging economies.  Both India  and  China\r\n\r\nand  other  emerging  economies  are  increasingly  competing\r\n\r\ndirectly  in  our  export turf.  Our present  cost  structure\r\n\r\nmakes  it  difficult  for  us to  compete  effectively.   The\r\n\r\nresult,  as  we  are  beginning to see,  and  we  are  seeing\r\n\r\nelsewhere, is a hollowing out of our manufacturing  industry.\r\n\r\nWith  the hollowing out of our manufacturing industry,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  greater displacement of jobs.  How do we  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our people can continue to stay employed in a meaningful\r\n\r\nmanner in the face of these challenges ahead of us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we succeed in economic restructuring, our very\r\n\r\nown   economic  survival  may  be  at  stake.   When  we  are\r\n\r\nconfronted  with questions like our long-term  survival,  the\r\n\r\nother  questions relating to civil liberties and human rights\r\n\r\npale   by   comparison.   Just  so  that  I   will   not   be\r\n\r\nmisunderstood,  Sir, I am not saying that  these  issues  are\r\n\r\nunimportant.  Indeed they are.  What I am saying is  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  maintain a proper perspective and  balance  to  the\r\n\r\nissues at hand.  The reality is that no one speaks philosophy\r\n\r\non an empty stomach.  The basic physical needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be provided for now and secured for the future.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  choice  to  be  made.  We can either  close  ranks  in\r\n\r\nuncertain times and collectively seek to bring in more grains\r\n\r\nfor  the  family or we can choose to bicker and stay divided,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  result is the family goes hungry.  We can  either\r\n\r\nchoose  to  be  grateful for what we have  and  treasure  the\r\n\r\npresent for the future, or we can gripe about what we do  not\r\n\r\nhave and gamble the future with what we have for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced a series of measures that\r\n\r\nseek to help Singaporeans stay the course for the moment.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  we will have to restructure the economy to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  challenges of the future and, no doubt, our people  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  retooled  to  meet the  demands  of  tomorrow's\r\n\r\neconomy.   But  for  the  moment, against  a  bleak  economic\r\n\r\nlandscape,  we  will  have to dig in and  stay  united  as  a\r\n\r\npeople,  believing as always that we will  ride  through  the\r\n\r\nrough  economic weather together.  We have done this  before,\r\n\r\nin  1968, in 1973, in 1985 and, more recently, in 1998.  Now,\r\n\r\nmore than ever, we face the biggest challenge yet.  I have no\r\n\r\ndoubt that if the people's confidence remains reposed in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  they have done in the  past,  we  will  ride\r\n\r\nthrough this stormy weather together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that Mr Sin Boon Ann has given a Churchillian\r\n\r\nspeech here, but I am afraid that the Opposition do not agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.  It is true that this round, the downturn  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is  unlike the others. In 1963/64, we  had  the  oil\r\n\r\ncrises.   In 1985/86, we had the economic downturn, and  then\r\n\r\nrecently  in  1997/98 we had the financial crisis.   So  this\r\n\r\ntime it is apparently quite different and it is quite serious\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is not purely on costs alone.  It is a  cyclical\r\n\r\neffect.   From what I know of cyclical effect, world  economy\r\n\r\nrises  like waves.  Now we are apparently in the trough.   So\r\n\r\nwe  have  to wait for things to turn around and get into  the\r\n\r\ncrest again.  I suppose the $11.3 billion off-Budget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  can  help Singaporeans and Singapore businesses  to\r\n\r\ntide over this period.  Hopefully, it would not be too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Prof. Low Seow Chay has given four reasons for\r\n\r\nthese particular off-Budget measures.  But I can think of the\r\n\r\nfifth  reason.   I think the fifth reason is also  political.\r\n\r\nElection is just around the corner.  It has a bearing on  the\r\n\r\noff-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a targeted approach to those who are unemployed.\r\n\r\nWhat  does  it  mean  by \"targeted\"?  It  is  quite  surgical\r\n\r\nactually.  Of course, Government's main policy is it does not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in giving away handouts.  But when it comes  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's purpose, the PAP's purpose, their own rules  are\r\n\r\nall not taken account of.  I mention this because I am in the\r\n\r\nOpposition and we feel it.  The Government MPs, of course, do\r\n\r\nnot  feel  it.  How do you like, if you are in a constituency\r\n\r\nlike  Potong Pasir working very hard, trying to do a  lot  of\r\n\r\nthings for the people, when your prospective candidate  comes\r\n\r\nalong, knocks at the door and asks, \"Are you in some sort  of\r\n\r\ntrouble?  Here you are, $200.\"?  Or, \"Here is a coupon  ($40)\r\n\r\nfor  you  to buy your rice and your bread.\"  [Interruptions.]\r\n\r\nNo,  these  are Government funds he is giving away.   CDC  is\r\n\r\nGovernment fund.  So when I read about this targeted help for\r\n\r\ncertain people, I begin to wonder how does it affect  us  and\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition.   And then giving away New Singapore  Shares\r\n\r\nfree  of charge!  I think Prof. Low Seow Chay again has  made\r\n\r\nit  very clear, in fact, about a small family in an HDB  flat\r\n\r\nwho is very poor, and here you have somebody coming along  to\r\n\r\ngive  them  $1,000 or $2,000, and in the end, they  ended  up\r\n\r\nwith  $5,000 shares.  How do you think this family will feel?\r\n\r\nYou  give him the money, of course he accepts.  What  do  you\r\n\r\nthink?   He  is  not  going to say \"no\".    Surely,  he  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely accept the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is this: we are not supposed to give away\r\n\r\nthings  free.   You have to earn your money and  if  somebody\r\n\r\ncomes to give you something free, obviously you are obligated\r\n\r\nto him.  So, to put it more frankly, I think this is buying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvotes.  No doubt, these schemes are all supposed to be  quite\r\n\r\naltruistic  to  help  people tide over  this  very  difficult\r\n\r\neconomic  situation  in  Singapore,  which,  I  believe,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to do.  But the way they do it  is  a  very\r\n\r\ngreat   disadvantage  to  the  Opposition.   So,   obviously,\r\n\r\npolitics  has a part to play in this $11.3 billion off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures.  At first, it was only $2.2 billion - that was  not\r\n\r\nmany months ago - and suddenly this amount has increased five\r\n\r\ntimes.  I was wondering why suddenly it has increased to five\r\n\r\ntimes.   So  they must add in all these things,  like  giving\r\n\r\naway  shares  free of charge, giving away money  to  targeted\r\n\r\npeople  who are in need of money.  So probably you  add  them\r\n\r\nall up, it comes to $11.3 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is basically, from what I have heard from\r\n\r\nmany  speakers here, to tide over this very difficult period.\r\n\r\nI  have never heard this will improve our economy.  I suppose\r\n\r\neven with the people in the PAP think tank, we cannot improve\r\n\r\nthe  economic situation at this point.  We just have  to  sit\r\n\r\nand  wait.   It  is  just  like a  flu.   There  is  no  cure\r\n\r\napparently for flu.  You just have to let it take its course.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope the Government will admit that this is a kind  of\r\n\r\nflu,  an  economic flu, where they cannot do anything.   They\r\n\r\njust  have  to  sit tight, give some financial  help  to  the\r\n\r\nunemployed, people who are sick, old age and those in the HDB\r\n\r\nflats  who  are given lower rentals.  Just sit  and  hang  on\r\n\r\nuntil  the  whole  thing is over, until  good  weather  comes\r\n\r\nagain.   My  point is that even how smart the  PAP  is,  they\r\n\r\ncannot do anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned about taking\r\n\r\naway  the  anti-speculative measures in land.  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.   The  Government believes that land value  just  cannot\r\n\r\nescalate sky high all of a sudden.  That will cause a  bubble\r\n\r\neffect, people become multi-millionaires overnight.  It shows\r\n\r\nthat  the Government wants land prices to be high.  And  then\r\n\r\nthe  suspension  of land sales makes land become  more  rare,\r\n\r\nthus  the prices will go higher.  The point is this: if  land\r\n\r\nprices  go  higher,  and with all these  off-Budget  measures\r\n\r\ngiven to, say, an HDB dweller, and he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaves  a  bit  of money, and when the time comes  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nhimself,  when times are better, all the prices of land  will\r\n\r\nshoot  sky  high and all that the savings that  he  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Government will go into the purchase of  a  new\r\n\r\nflat.   So where does he stand?  He is still not much better,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  $11.3  billion  off-Budget  measures  that  are\r\n\r\nsupposedly given to him.  All these tens of dollars  that  he\r\n\r\ncan  save from all these off-Budget measures will be used  up\r\n\r\nwhen he buys a new flat which costs hundreds of thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars.   So  I  do  not know.  It seems  that  this  policy\r\n\r\ncounter-cancels each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I hear training for the retrenched. I have heard\r\n\r\nthis  many times.  Whenever there is a problem, it is  always\r\n\r\nretraining.  We have so many retraining programmes.  What  is\r\n\r\nhappening to all these retraining programmes?  Are they doing\r\n\r\nany  good  at  all to the workers?  I personally  think  that\r\n\r\nthere  is something wrong with our education system.  I think\r\n\r\nwe  should  start in our schools.  We should  teach  them  to\r\n\r\nread,  write and converse properly in English, and  let  them\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  language.  Without an understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguage, you can learn nothing.  So we should go back to the\r\n\r\nbasics  -  teach them the 3R's, teach them the right attitude\r\n\r\ntowards work and the willingness to change their work when it\r\n\r\nneeds  be.   I think that will save a lot of these retraining\r\n\r\nprogrammes that we have been speaking of many times  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is I do agree that we should have pump\r\n\r\npriming.  But in your pump priming measures I see that  there\r\n\r\nis no pump priming in building more schools.  I have objected\r\n\r\nmany times in this House and said that our classes of 40  are\r\n\r\ntoo  large.   You cannot teach a class of 40.  No  wonder  so\r\n\r\nmany of our students leave school without even knowing how to\r\n\r\nread  and  write  proper  English.   I  think  there  is   no\r\n\r\nopportunity to teach them properly.  So we must have  smaller\r\n\r\nclasses.  If we have more smaller classes, you just  have  to\r\n\r\nbuild  more  schools.  I do not see any of this  money  going\r\n\r\ninto building more schools.  I wish they did.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink we need at least another 25% more schools built.   Then\r\n\r\nyou  can  have one-quarter less of our school size.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  we  have  got  about 40.  I think  30  should  be  a\r\n\r\nmanageable  size.  And I wish some of this money will  go  to\r\n\r\nactivate the economy, pass the money around a bit to go  into\r\n\r\nbuilding  more schools - 25% more schools than what  we  have\r\n\r\ntoday.  I see the Minister for Education is not here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome, of course, lowering of rentals in HDB flats.\r\n\r\nHDB  shopkeepers are for many months now in a bit  of  a  fix\r\n\r\nwith  very,  very poor business, mainly because young  people\r\n\r\nhave changed their style of living and they do not believe in\r\n\r\nshopping  in  their  own neighbourhood shops  anymore.   They\r\n\r\nprefer  to  go  to  the supermarket and nice  air-conditioned\r\n\r\nshops  to  do their shopping.  So I think anything that  they\r\n\r\ncan do to help the HDB shops are welcome by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the rebates given to HDB flat dwellers.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, why should water and electricity bills be\r\n\r\nso  high?  If you keep them low, you do not have to give them\r\n\r\nall  these  rebates.  So I hope that after all these  rebates\r\n\r\nhave been given, like what Mr Low Thia Khiang said, all these\r\n\r\nutilities bills should remain permanently low.  It shows that\r\n\r\nwith  the  need to give rebates, all these bills and  charges\r\n\r\nare definitely too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your\r\n\r\npermission to clarify what Mr Chiam said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr Chiam lamented\r\n\r\nin  his speech just now, complaining that the prospective PAP\r\n\r\ncandidate is giving money in his constituency.  He said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition could feel it.  I am afraid I have to clarify\r\n\r\nthat   I  have  a  different  view,  because  he  said   \"all\r\n\r\nOpposition\".  Sir, I have no complaint if the prospective PAP\r\n\r\ncandidate in my constituency gives away assistance and money.\r\n\r\nI think he should give more, the more the merrier.  I welcome\r\n\r\nit.  I would be worried if he is not giving.  Then I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   asking:    \"Is   the  PAP  Government   treating   every\r\n\r\nconstituency the same and fairly?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe, and I am confident, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nvoters  in Hougang cannot be bought over just by giving  them\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\njust  heard from Mr Low that Mr Chiam does not speak for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in this House and I wonder whether Mr Chiam speaks\r\n\r\nfor  his  constituents in this House.  He has  said  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  give away anything for free.  The  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  given  out a list of the  measures  just  now.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  Mr  Chiam would like to tick off what he thinks  his\r\n\r\nconstituents  should not be getting.  I am  sure  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister would be quite ready to oblige him by  taking\r\n\r\nthis off and not making it available to his constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my part, Sir, I rise in support of the Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement by the Deputy Prime Minister to tackle the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   At  a  recent  dialogue,  someone  asked  me   in\r\n\r\nreference to the emergence of China as an economic  power  to\r\n\r\nthe US as a magnet for talents, and to Singapore for our lack\r\n\r\nof  competitive advantage.  He asked me, \"Have we gone beyond\r\n\r\nthe  limits  of  our development?  Have we  over-reached  our\r\n\r\npotential?\"   He went on to say that Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\ntold  time and again that we are, or can be, the best in this\r\n\r\nand  that.  Perhaps it is time that we be realistic and teach\r\n\r\nour  young to lower their expectations of the good  life  and\r\n\r\naccept being not the best.  I told him in no uncertain  terms\r\n\r\nthat  that was not a viable option for us to build  a  secure\r\n\r\nfuture.  That kind of spirit will be the start of the end  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as we know it.  We may be a little down  for  now,\r\n\r\nbut  we are certainly not out.  As a nation, we have overcome\r\n\r\nenormous  difficulties in the past.  We must not lose  heart,\r\n\r\nand we will prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these off-Budget measures are comprehensive, broad-based and touch on the concerns of Singaporeans across-the-board. They must also be considered together with all the\r\n\r\nother prudent policies, programmes and measures that the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment has been putting in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  all  along, both in good times as well as  bad  times.\r\n\r\nThese  measures  can  be grouped into  two  main  categories:\r\n\r\nfirst,  those  measures that will help affected Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nboth  businesses and individuals, to tide over this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod  by  way of cost cutting and income support;   second,\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help Singapore as a nation, and  this  requires\r\n\r\nboth  businesses  and individuals to do our part  to  adjust,\r\n\r\nrestructure and upgrade our skills and capabilities so as  to\r\n\r\nbe  more competitive in the changed economic environment that\r\n\r\nwill emerge from the present economic downturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the worst recession since Independence.\r\n\r\nContrary  to  Mr Chiam's opinion that it is only cyclical,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a very structural and very fundamental change  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  environment.  It is made  worse  because  many\r\n\r\nindustries and companies have barely started to recover  from\r\n\r\nthe  last financial and economic crisis when their businesses\r\n\r\nwere  hit  again early this year.  The decline was too  quick\r\n\r\nand  devastating.   Many  people were expecting  a  recovery,\r\n\r\nwhether  described as \"V-shape\" or \"U-shape\",  as  one  would\r\n\r\nnormally  expect  after the downturn.  Many  did  not  expect\r\n\r\nanother recession to come so soon after.  Many did not expect\r\n\r\nthe  severity  of this recession.  Measures to help  affected\r\n\r\nbusinesses and individuals in the near term to alleviate some\r\n\r\nof the pain and hardship are therefore very crucial for their\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost-cutting measures give us some breathing space.\r\n\r\nIncome  support schemes lighten our financial burden for  the\r\n\r\ntime being to tide us over while we consolidate and wait  for\r\n\r\nthe  dark clouds to pass.  I am happy to find in this package\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  many  people have  been  asking  for.   These\r\n\r\ninclude  improved  access  to funds  for  local  enterprises,\r\n\r\nreduction of business costs through property tax rebates  and\r\n\r\nlower   petrol  prices,  diesel  tax  and  utility   charges,\r\n\r\nextension  of HDB loan scheme and S&CC rebates  and  the  New\r\n\r\nSingapore Shares which are free and pay a guaranteed  minimum\r\n\r\nof  3%  per  annum.  I welcome this scheme  which  is  unlike\r\n\r\nprevious sale of shares in Government companies where  people\r\n\r\nhave to pay for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  shares  and have been disappointed by  the  inadequate\r\n\r\nreturns  or  the losses from such investments.  Further,  the\r\n\r\nNew  Singapore  Shares  pay bonus  dividends  pegged  to  the\r\n\r\npreceding  year's GDP growth.  This is important,  especially\r\n\r\nin  a  downturn,  as people will find the  extra  money  most\r\n\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.35 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot disagree more with Mr Chiam's opinion that\r\n\r\nwe  should just sit and wait.  We cannot afford to simply sit\r\n\r\ntight and wait for the storm to pass.  While cost cutting can\r\n\r\nreduce  our expenditure and income support can alleviate  our\r\n\r\nburden, this must not distract us from the need to take other\r\n\r\npainful  measures, painful decisions to adjust  and  position\r\n\r\nourselves  to  be  more  competitive  in  the  future.    All\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and individuals must actively look  out  for  new\r\n\r\nopportunities and seize them.  To be in a better position  to\r\n\r\nachieve  that,  some may need to reorganise and  acquire  new\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   This package contains important  measures  on\r\n\r\nPeople  for  Jobs Traineeship Programme, Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme and the SDF funding.  To just rely on cost  cutting\r\n\r\nand   income  support  alone  is  like  surviving   on   your\r\n\r\naccumulated  savings.  Someone who has  been  retrenched  may\r\n\r\nhave  some savings in cash.  He may live on this for a while.\r\n\r\nBut  these  savings  are finite and would  soon  be  depleted\r\n\r\nunless  he  is  able to replenish them by earning  wages  and\r\n\r\nmaking  profits.  His old job may never come back again  even\r\n\r\nwhen  times  are better.  To gain a new income, he  must  see\r\n\r\nwhere  the  prospects are, reorganise his skills and  acquire\r\n\r\nnew ones to fit into those prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this recession is the most severe economic crisis\r\n\r\nsince Independence.  The economy shrank a devastating 5.6% in\r\n\r\nthe  third  quarter.   It is estimated  that  the  number  of\r\n\r\nunemployed may hit 80,000, or 4% of the workforce.  Our  near\r\n\r\nterm prospects are bleak.  This has prompted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of this package worth a  total  of  $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion.   I  am  very  relieved to  note  that  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  able  to  finance this  entire  package  from\r\n\r\nsurpluses accumulated since it took office in 1997.  But some\r\n\r\npeople said times are so bad that we should dip into our past\r\n\r\nreserves.   I would like to take a moment here to reflect  on\r\n\r\nthis point.  Some said things cannot get any worse than this.\r\n\r\nBut is this the worst case that can happen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, it is hard for us, especially for the\r\n\r\nyoung, to fathom the financial cost of armed conflicts.  Wars\r\n\r\nand  conflicts occur in far-off places, like Bosnia, Chechnya\r\n\r\nand  Sri  Lanka.  We see pictures of the dead and the injured\r\n\r\nand  can empathise with the human suffering.  But what is the\r\n\r\nfinancial  cost  of the devastation?  What  is  required  for\r\n\r\nrepairs  and  rebuilding?  Consider for a moment  the  damage\r\n\r\ncaused  by the recent terrorist attacks on Manhattan and  the\r\n\r\ncollapse  of the World Trade Centre.  The financial  cost  to\r\n\r\nNew  York city runs into more than $100 billion and the  city\r\n\r\nis seeking US$54 billion in Federal aid to help its recovery.\r\n\r\nWe  can  then just begin to imagine how much more is required\r\n\r\nto  rebuild an entire nation if some form of conflict were to\r\n\r\noccur.  The conflict on the other side of the world has  only\r\n\r\njust started.  The definition of \"war\", in this instance,  is\r\n\r\nnot clear.  The physical arena may not be contained.  How  it\r\n\r\nwill  develop  and end, no one can tell.  We do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nFederal government we can look to for aid.  I think we should\r\n\r\nbe  very  prudent before dipping into our protected  reserves\r\n\r\ntoo early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have the opportunity to\r\n\r\nclarify  with Mr Ong Kian Min?  Sir, I certainly did not  say\r\n\r\nthat I want Mr Goh to stop the residents at Potong Pasir from\r\n\r\naccepting the shares.  In fact, I did say that if shares,  or\r\n\r\nanything  free  is  given  to a resident,  it  will  be  most\r\n\r\nwelcomed.   But  I  also  did  say  that  the  receiver  will\r\n\r\ncertainly be obliged to the giver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI welcome the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  announcement of this package.  It  costs  $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion, and it is a lot of money.  In fact, I was very happy\r\n\r\nat  the  size of the package that was announced.  And  I  was\r\n\r\neven  happier  that I am going to explain to my  constituents\r\n\r\nhow  helpful the Government was until I heard the  speech  by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Hougang.  His basic point was that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was not doing enough.  He highlighted the instance\r\n\r\nof  the  $200  financial  assistance  package  and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could do more.  What I wanted to hear  from  him,\r\n\r\nperhaps  later on, is whether he will clarify  how  much  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should help each individual Singaporean.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nhe  has  the figure in mind.  Similarly, the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir said that the utility charges should be as cheap\r\n\r\nas  possible.  Perhaps, he could tell us how cheap should the\r\n\r\nutility  charges be.  If it is a possibility, then he  should\r\n\r\ngo  on  and set up a utilities company and offer these  cheap\r\n\r\nservices.  I am quite sure the relevant Minister can consider\r\n\r\nthe  cheapest  utilities service for all Singaporeans.   But,\r\n\r\nSir,  what is frightening is this tendency to highlight  that\r\n\r\nwe must try to give as much to Singaporeans as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my interaction with Singaporeans shows that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are people with dignity.  And  at  times,  they\r\n\r\nfeel  very  shy  even to approach the relevant  agencies  for\r\n\r\nassistance.  This sense of dignity is something important and\r\n\r\nit  is something that the Government has worked very  hard to\r\n\r\nensure  that  everybody keeps it and every Singaporean  walks\r\n\r\nwith his shoulders raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very easy to call upon the Government to\r\n\r\nspend  the  reserves  because we have  built  up  a  sizeable\r\n\r\nreserve.   But  we must be very careful and always  have  the\r\n\r\nlong picture or the long path ahead of us in mind whenever we\r\n\r\nconsider measures.  It reminds me of a classic case which  is\r\n\r\nhighlighted  in  many management studies where  a  person  is\r\n\r\nflying on a plane across a desert, the plane crashes and  the\r\n\r\nperson  survives with a bottle of water.  The choice that  he\r\n\r\nhas is that when he is thirsty, he can take several\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngulps and continue the uncertain journey without any water in\r\n\r\nthe  bottle, or he can take sips along the way, or even forgo\r\n\r\nthe  water for the time being and hope that he will reach  an\r\n\r\noasis, or a town, or some other resourceful place, very soon.\r\n\r\nIf everybody were to take the choice that has been offered by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  for Hougang, whereby everybody  takes  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  gulp  and finishes the water immediately,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  what we will have is a lot of dead Singaporeans  in  a\r\n\r\nvery short period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are very thoughtful. They are aware that\r\n\r\nthis  Government  cares for them, but  it  cares  with  great\r\n\r\nprudence that we have to conserve our resources for the  long\r\n\r\nrun  because the path ahead is uncertain.  Everybody  thought\r\n\r\nthat the 1997 crisis was the last crisis.  But, here, we have\r\n\r\nanother  crisis.   In the last four days,  some  people  have\r\n\r\nbecome  optimistic  and  they said that  things  have  turned\r\n\r\naround.   But  the FBI has just issued another  warning  that\r\n\r\nterrorist  attacks can be expected and we may have a  further\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.  So we need all these resources and we  must\r\n\r\ndispense them prudently and judiciously.  While the  call  of\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Hougang looks very attractive and  very\r\n\r\neasy,  I  think that is not the slippery path that we,  as  a\r\n\r\ncountry, should take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the package. The present\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis has a different impact on different  sectors\r\n\r\nof  society.  The measures have been expected for  some  time\r\n\r\nand  I  am  glad that the Government has chosen to  introduce\r\n\r\nthese  measures  immediately.  I am happy that  the  measures\r\n\r\nthat  have been announced today have something for everybody.\r\n\r\nIt is both substantial and far reaching.  Sir, businessmen  I\r\n\r\nhave met have clamoured for tax rebates, lower property taxes\r\n\r\nand  increased  access for Government funds, bank  loans  and\r\n\r\nother assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed glad that the Government has chosen to\r\n\r\ngive  help  to  businesses in the various areas.   This  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  help  companies to retain  or  raise  new  working\r\n\r\ncapital.   There was some good news for the property  sector,\r\n\r\nlike the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspension of the land sales programme, deferment of sale  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  land,  the  removal  of  capital  gains  tax  for\r\n\r\nproperties which have been held for three years, or less, and\r\n\r\nthe  lifting of the restriction of Singapore dollar loans  to\r\n\r\nforeigners for property purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am equally pleased that the Government has acted\r\n\r\nprudently  in  not  removing the 80% cap  on  housing  loans.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  sizeable number of Singaporeans who  feel  that\r\n\r\nproperty prices still remain high and the removal of this 80%\r\n\r\ncap  will  lead to another speculative property  boom  cycle.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  very  happy that the Government has  decided  to\r\n\r\nretain this 80% cap on housing loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the programmes offered for\r\n\r\nthe lower income and the unemployed.  Sir, I am thankful that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has shown its usual concern  for  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  and  the unemployed.  The extension of the  utilities\r\n\r\nrebates,  reduction of electricity tariffs and  extension  of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  rental  assistance scheme will  certainly  be  much\r\n\r\nappreciated   by   this  group  of  Singaporeans   who   need\r\n\r\nGovernment's  help most.  At a time when people  are  worried\r\n\r\nabout  jobs  and retrenchment, the Government's  decision  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  10%  rebate for C and B2 hospital  charges  for  all\r\n\r\ncitizens  is  timely.  The added 40% assistance  on  hospital\r\n\r\ncharges will certainly be a big help for families of citizens\r\n\r\nwho have been retrenched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting up of the Economic Downturn Relief\r\n\r\nScheme  for Singaporeans is certainly a very welcomed effort.\r\n\r\nThe  provision  of $200 per month for three  months  is  very\r\n\r\nhelpful   for  families  where  the  breadwinner   has   been\r\n\r\nretrenched  or cannot find employment.  Sir, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHougang  said  that  $200 does not  go  any  way  in  helping\r\n\r\nfamilies  because the amount is too small.  What he fails  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  is  that this is one of the many programmes  that\r\n\r\nare  made  available to Singaporeans who are in difficulties.\r\n\r\nHe  himself  highlighted that in his constituency  there  are\r\n\r\nschemes also.  For example, in Jurong constituency,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  a CCC fund, a Jurong Needy Residents' Fund and,  on\r\n\r\ntop of that, we have various other schemes under our CDC.  So\r\n\r\nit  is  not  a case of the $200 being an isolated  assistance\r\n\r\npackage  for  residents.  There are various other  programmes\r\n\r\nand  various  other  NGOs  out there  which  are  all  coming\r\n\r\ntogether  to  offer assistance to Singaporeans.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nformula which has worked in Singapore, and we should stick to\r\n\r\nthis  successful  formula because we want to  encourage  this\r\n\r\nspirit  where every Singaporean feels that he has a  part  to\r\n\r\nhelp each other in overcoming any crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this package, combined with various other\r\n\r\nassistance schemes made available to our people,  will  go  a\r\n\r\nlong  way to show that the Government and the community  care\r\n\r\nfor the downtrodden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Government has initiated a novel\r\n\r\nscheme to grant all Singaporeans a share in our future growth\r\n\r\nand prosperity, ie, the New Singapore Shares.  It is simply a\r\n\r\nmoney-in-the-bag scheme designed to ensure that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nreceive  the  fixed money value and dividend for the  shares.\r\n\r\nThis is a welcome scheme as it avoids the pitfall of granting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans listed-company shares whose prices are  volatile\r\n\r\nin  a  free  market.   It also avoids a situation  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  blamed for share price  downturns.   Sir,  in\r\n\r\nshort, this scheme is beneficial to everyone who will receive\r\n\r\nthese shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional measures designed to pump-prime the\r\n\r\neconomy,   eg,   increased  infrastructure   spending,   will\r\n\r\ncertainly create both new business and new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am equally happy that the Government will look at\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  Employment Pass applicants and  adjust  the\r\n\r\nminimum  wage  for Employment Pass holders to  $2,500.   This\r\n\r\nwill  go  some  way  in preventing companies  from  employing\r\n\r\nforeigners   because  they  are  cheaper  than  their   local\r\n\r\nemployees.   This has been a particular ground  of  complaint\r\n\r\nfrom many Singaporean executives who have been retrenched.  I\r\n\r\nhope that this small move will tilt the balance in favour  of\r\n\r\nSingapore executives who have been at times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfairly displaced by foreign Employment Pass holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I listened to the package being unveiled\r\n\r\nearlier,  I was reassured that the Government did not  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  other  extreme of putting forward a very lavish  package\r\n\r\nwhich will give Singaporeans a sense of total reliance on the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I think the package is well-balanced.  It  gives\r\n\r\nthe  right dosage of help to Singaporeans.  I think it  is  a\r\n\r\nvery good package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I once again welcome the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  package  of  measures  offered  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is most welcome and should give fairly sufficient\r\n\r\ncomfort   to  various  sectors  of  our  society,   including\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees, property owners and  tenants,  and\r\n\r\nalso our senior citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be certain sectors of our society which may\r\n\r\nnot  benefit  from  this  package.   This  will  probably  be\r\n\r\nannounced by them, in no uncertain terms, through Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  or  through the press, and I hope the  Government\r\n\r\nwould hear them out and help them, if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, in order to tackle the economic downturn,\r\n\r\nas  expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister, we must  generate\r\n\r\nwealth.   How?  There must be more investments in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nboth foreign investment and local investment.  There must  be\r\n\r\nmore  opportunities  for  the  manufacturing  sector  to   be\r\n\r\nincreased  and  enhanced, both locally  and  globally.   More\r\n\r\nmarkets  must  be  located and nurtured, both  in  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nregion  and  in the world at large.  For this, we  need  more\r\n\r\njoint  ventures  and  good  relations  between  partners   in\r\n\r\nindustry  and  corporations  of  various  nations,  and  also\r\n\r\nbetween various governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services and professional services must\r\n\r\nalso  find  new  areas to expand into.  Various  professions,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  banking sector, must  liaise  more  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours to form liaisons and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoint  ventures, and the Government could come in to  play  a\r\n\r\nmajor role in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Inderjit Singh and other colleagues in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I am also concerned about the swift downturn and  the\r\n\r\noverall  economic crisis in Singapore and, no doubt, in  many\r\n\r\nother  countries  in ASEAN and the world  as  a  whole.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is: what are the fundamental areas which we need  to\r\n\r\naddress  as  soon  as possible to arrest  or,  at  least,  to\r\n\r\nminimise the problem?  I hope the Government and the  private\r\n\r\nsector  would  work hand in hand in a symbiotic  fashion  and\r\n\r\nrevisit basic policies, review these policies critically  and\r\n\r\ncome  up with fresh ideas in order to keep pace with all  the\r\n\r\nchanges  that have taken place globally and locally  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years.   I  am sure, if given  the  opportunities,\r\n\r\nMinisters,  parliamentarians, the civil service, the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  including businessmen, professionals, academics  and\r\n\r\nnon-governmental organisations, could all discuss and come up\r\n\r\nwith some concrete and consensual ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ask why Singapore is doing, on a relative\r\n\r\nbasis, a lot worse in terms of GDP growth.  This year, we are\r\n\r\ntold, it is minus 3%, compared to our usual competitors,  eg,\r\n\r\nHong   Kong,   Korea,   Malaysia  or  Taiwan,   despite   our\r\n\r\nunderstanding that we have stronger fundamentals and policies\r\n\r\nin Singapore, as we are told by the authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is constantly stressing on the need to\r\n\r\nretrain  our  workers.  Whilst this is necessary and  prudent\r\n\r\nfor our economic progress, is there any clear direction where\r\n\r\nthe  new  and growing industries are so that workers can  get\r\n\r\nuseful guidance and, thereafter, make a more intelligent move\r\n\r\nas  to  where  they want to be retrained?  How  much  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment willing to shoulder the cost of such retraining in\r\n\r\nthese uncertain areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those aged 40 to 50 are especially vulnerable when they\r\n\r\nhave  families  to feed and mortgages and other  payments  to\r\n\r\nmake.   Our  citizens and persons working in  Singapore  have\r\n\r\npaid taxes, both direct and quite a lot of indirect taxation.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a rainy day today.  If it is necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  dip into our nation's reserves, the budget surplus or the\r\n\r\ninterest  from  the  nation's reserves,  the  country  should\r\n\r\nassist  its  citizens to retool and tide over this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.   There  should  be  more money  pumped  in  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  areas, including job retraining,  temporary  child\r\n\r\nrelief  for  families who are struggling to  pay  for  school\r\n\r\nfees, food, uniform, textbooks and transportation to and from\r\n\r\nschool.  These are sectors I am sure the authorities can look\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the economic crisis, there may be more cases of\r\n\r\nbankruptcies   and   company  liquidations.    Professionals,\r\n\r\nincluding architects, doctors, lawyers, etc, are not  allowed\r\n\r\nto  practise if they are pronounced bankrupt by  a  court  of\r\n\r\nlaw.   Can  the  laws be reviewed to make  Singapore  a  more\r\n\r\nforgiving  society,  because  persons  may  go  bust  and  be\r\n\r\nbankrupt  not because they are immoral, corrupt or lazy,  but\r\n\r\ndue  to economic circumstances beyond their control?  Can  we\r\n\r\nrelax  our bankruptcy laws if we want to have a more creative\r\n\r\nand risk-taking society?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I also raise the issue of Goods and Services Tax?\r\n\r\nThe  GST is presently 3%.  Can we not temporarily suspend  it\r\n\r\nor  reduce  it to 1% or zero, with effect from November  this\r\n\r\nyear to December 2002?  The GST was introduced, I believe, in\r\n\r\na  sense,  with a lot of flexibility.  So, if the  demand  is\r\n\r\nthere  for flexibility in times of crisis, this is one sector\r\n\r\nwhere  the Government could seriously look into and, if  need\r\n\r\nbe,  increase  it back to 3%, and hopefully  not  more,  when\r\n\r\ntimes are better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the national duties of banks in terms of times\r\n\r\nof crisis?  The Monetary Authority of Singapore gives limited\r\n\r\nlicences  to very few entities for them to practise  banking.\r\n\r\nIn that sense, it is the state's asset that is being given to\r\n\r\nthese  banks  to practise banking.  So when a national  asset\r\n\r\nlike  that  is  given to banks, the banks have  to  now  turn\r\n\r\naround  and contribute to the nation's interest in  times  of\r\n\r\ncrisis.   I  would  suggest,  in  this  instance,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that they must reduce interest rates  to  tide\r\n\r\nthings over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey,  I believe, would have made fairly huge profits in  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years,  and now it is necessary  for  them  to  be\r\n\r\ngenerous and help their customers by reducing interest  rates\r\n\r\non mortgages, loans and overdrafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, we must work hard and work hand in hand with\r\n\r\nother countries, because we live in an inter-dependent world.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to commend the Government's kind  gesture  and\r\n\r\ncare  shown  to our citizens and people staying in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf more could be offered in future, it would be most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope and pray all these measures are sincere and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  genuine gesture and not too related  to  the\r\n\r\ncoming  General Election.  Singaporeans will  have  to  judge\r\n\r\nthat,  not  just  during General Election time,  but  in  the\r\n\r\nmonths and years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom requires that the Government of the day review\r\n\r\nour  current economic policies.  Global events are beyond our\r\n\r\ncontrol.  It could be said that Singapore can do little about\r\n\r\nthat  and, therefore, there is little our Government  can  do\r\n\r\nabout  major crises when they arrive on our shores.  Be  that\r\n\r\nas  it may, let us all do our best, both the proposition, ie,\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government, and the Opposition too,  and  also  the\r\n\r\nacademics,  the professionals and the citizenry as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nand come up with new ideas.  And concrete steps must be taken\r\n\r\nto  tackle  as  best as we can and minimise our economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  I  congratulate  the  Government   for   its\r\n\r\ngenerosity   in  presenting  this  $11.3  billion  off-Budget\r\n\r\npackage announced by the Deputy Prime Minister.  We have been\r\n\r\nthrown  into  exceptional times, and the  adverse  conditions\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  terrorist actions of  11th  September  need\r\n\r\nexceptional   measures   of   succour.    This   package   is\r\n\r\ncomprehensive, covering big business, SMEs, white-collar  and\r\n\r\nblue-collar  workers, the retrenched and the unemployed,  the\r\n\r\nill  and the underclass.  As my colleague, Dr Ong Chit Chung,\r\n\r\nsaid, it leaves no stone unturned.  What is distinctive about\r\n\r\nthis package is that it acknowledges as well the woes of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmiddle   management  middle  class  worker,   the   so-called\r\n\r\n\"sandwich\"  class.   This is much to be  lauded.   Innovative\r\n\r\nmeasures,  such as the New Singapore Shares and the  Economic\r\n\r\nDownturn Relief Scheme, are also praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the NWC recommendations, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said, \"... we should expect wage settlements  to  be\r\n\r\nrestrained,  or  in  many cases frozen.   Workers  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for  lower bonuses, wage cuts through the  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent,  or at best minimal wage increases.\"   This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important message to give at this time when we  realise\r\n\r\ntoo  that  even profitable companies may need to  preserve  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of fat for the bad times ahead, and we should  not\r\n\r\nhave  workers who unrealistically push for higher  increments\r\n\r\nat the risk of losing their jobs in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read recently about some people calling our middle\r\n\r\nclass  the  \"New Poor\".  Some people would like us  to  think\r\n\r\nthat  this so-called \"new poor\" need exceptional help.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot   deny,   Sir,  that  they  need  some  help   in   these\r\n\r\nunprecedented  circumstances.  But in times like  these,  the\r\n\r\nones  truly deserving of exceptional help are not the  middle\r\n\r\nclass.   The  middle class workers who still  have  jobs  can\r\n\r\nlearn  to moderate their expectations and spend more frugally\r\n\r\non necessities and not luxuries.  And they are better able to\r\n\r\npull through than the truly poor that I will be describing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this package is indeed good and we should not\r\n\r\ncriticise  it like the Opposition, who, as usual,  leaves  no\r\n\r\nstones  unturned.  Sir, while it is true that we will  always\r\n\r\nhave  the poor with us, that should not stop us from  helping\r\n\r\nthem.   Some are poor because they are idle or irresponsible;\r\n\r\nsome  are  poor because their skills or education levels  are\r\n\r\nlow;  some  because  of  unplanned  events,  commitments   or\r\n\r\ntragedies  have  drained  their resources;  some  because  of\r\n\r\nsickness  or  disability;  and  some  because  of   lack   of\r\n\r\nopportunity.  I will deal with each of these classes one at a\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the idle. The Government must continue to create\r\n\r\njobs.  This package may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot exactly promise that, but it at least enables the bulk of\r\n\r\ncompanies  to stay afloat so that more jobs are not  lost  in\r\n\r\nthe  days  ahead.  If people are idle because  there  are  no\r\n\r\njobs,  the Government is to blame.  If they are idle  because\r\n\r\nthey shun work, they need to wake up.  No amount of financial\r\n\r\nassistance will help them if they are irresponsible, if  they\r\n\r\nspend  more than they earn.  The Government cannot help  such\r\n\r\npeople.   They must first help themselves.  As  the  Book  of\r\n\r\nProverbs  says, \"A little sleep, a little slumber,  a  little\r\n\r\nfolding of the hands to rest - and poverty will come  on  you\r\n\r\nlike  a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.\"  There should\r\n\r\nbe  no  handouts  to  those whose only activity  is  to  stir\r\n\r\nthemselves out of their sleep to open their hungry mouths  or\r\n\r\nstretch out their empty hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite increasing retrenchment, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower has found some jobs still going a-begging.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthis  may  be  due  to  the imperfect  dissemination  of  job\r\n\r\ninformation,  and  I  welcome the  efforts  to  beef  up  the\r\n\r\nCareerLink  service and CDC services to find jobs  for  those\r\n\r\nwho want to work but perhaps are looking at the wrong places.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand,  if the jobs go a-begging  because  job\r\n\r\nseekers  are  still picky, they must be shaken out  of  their\r\n\r\nunrealistic expectations.  With a perfect storm brewing,  the\r\n\r\nfishermen cannot afford to sit down and do nothing.  They may\r\n\r\nnot  have  the luxury of waiting out the storm, as  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nwould like them to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the skill-less. Some jobs have left Singapore,\r\n\r\nnever to return.  Some people have no education nor skills to\r\n\r\ntake up the jobs available.  Retraining and re-education  are\r\n\r\nindeed  very  important to give these  poor  ones  hope.  The\r\n\r\npackage  has  a very extensive scheme of help for  those  who\r\n\r\nneed  to improve their employability.  Yet, at the same time,\r\n\r\nthe  Government, as the policy implementer, must realise that\r\n\r\nsome people may really be too old or too intimidated to learn\r\n\r\nnew  things in unfamiliar circumstances.  Aptitudes therefore\r\n\r\nhave  to be considered.  I may know that aircraft technicians\r\n\r\nare in short supply but I may not have the aptitude for that.\r\n\r\nAnd what if I choose to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupgrade  to  a skill which, in itself, would become  obsolete\r\n\r\nbefore  I complete my retraining?  Financial help to pay  for\r\n\r\ncourses  and training is good, but not enough.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must make an effort too to match the right  people\r\n\r\nto the right courses of training, and actively encourage them\r\n\r\nto  keep  them on course through counselling and motivational\r\n\r\nmeasures.  This need not always be in the form of money.   In\r\n\r\nservice  jobs, for example, and many service jobs are  crying\r\n\r\nfor  workers, it could be in the form of upgrading the  image\r\n\r\nof  professionalism of certain jobs and changing the  mindset\r\n\r\nof both the served and the serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the unfortunate. This category of people includes\r\n\r\nthose who are struggling to set up new businesses or striving\r\n\r\nto  keep  old  ones  above water because of  September  11th;\r\n\r\npeople who face untoward tragedies like the recent deaths  of\r\n\r\nbreadwinners, people who have been retrenched and people  who\r\n\r\nhave been impoverished by an unexpected turn of events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these just need short-term help, a booster which\r\n\r\nwill  heave them over the unexpected hump.  For some  of  the\r\n\r\nretrenched,  the retraining and re-education being  given  to\r\n\r\nthe   skill-less  may  be  relevant  too.   But  for   others\r\n\r\nretrenched,  perhaps the only help required is  provision  to\r\n\r\nweather the storm till the jobs return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that another way of helping such people is to\r\n\r\nwork  out  a  scheme which allows them a moratorium  on  debt\r\n\r\nrepayments.    The  previous  speaker,  Mr   Chandra   Mohan,\r\n\r\nmentioned the reform of bankruptcy laws and I think we  could\r\n\r\nlook  into  this  too  when  we reform  those  laws.   Viable\r\n\r\nbusinesses may be cash-strapped and close up because they are\r\n\r\nunable  to  resist the creditor pressure.  My  colleague,  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee, referred to banks, for example, who take away\r\n\r\nthe umbrellas when the rain starts coming down, the umbrellas\r\n\r\nthat  they  lend  to you when the sun was shining.   Judicial\r\n\r\nmanagement procedures are costly and not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navailable  to  all  forms of business.  If  businesses  close\r\n\r\nprematurely, more jobs will be lost and more pain  inflicted.\r\n\r\nIn  these  exceptional times, when even the mighty Swiss  Air\r\n\r\ncan  fall, how much hope do the small businesses and  hawkers\r\n\r\nhave?  The business cost reduction exercise announced is wide\r\n\r\nranging  and  very welcome, but my point is  that  more  non-financial measures will also be helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will venture to raise the difficulties of another\r\n\r\ngroup  of  the  unfortunate.  These are the  property  owners\r\n\r\nwhose  most costly asset has gone into negative equity.   The\r\n\r\namount they owe CPF and the bank is more than the amount they\r\n\r\ncan  recover  from sale of their asset.  If they  sell,  they\r\n\r\nwill not be able to find the cash to top-up their CPF and the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  what  they owe to the bank.  Hence,  while  they\r\n\r\nrealise  that  it  is  better for  them  to  downgrade  their\r\n\r\nresidences,  and though they are willing to do  so,  many  in\r\n\r\nfact cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is assistance aplenty for HDB householders with\r\n\r\nschemes which include the Reduced Repayment Scheme, Staggered\r\n\r\nDownpayment Scheme, extension of loan payments and the contra-facility scheme.  Would it be possible for the Government  to\r\n\r\nadd  to  its  package  a  scheme  to  allow  householders  to\r\n\r\ndowngrade  to  reduce their commitments  and  postpone  their\r\n\r\nrepayment  back  into their CPF accounts  (with  interest  of\r\n\r\ncourse) till the sun is shining again?  Could the HDB contra-facility  scheme, or some sort of bridging  loan  scheme,  be\r\n\r\nextended too to landed and HUDC property owners, so  long  as\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are selling is their own residence and  not  some\r\n\r\ninvestment properties?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the sick. The category of poor who most need help\r\n\r\nare  those who cannot help themselves. We have the reputation\r\n\r\nof  having a hard-headed, no-nonsense Government.  Many  even\r\n\r\nthink that we have a hard-hearted, no-sensitivity Government.\r\n\r\nAs  this  package  shows,  this is an undeserved  perception.\r\n\r\nThere  is a whole gamut of assistance measures for those  who\r\n\r\nface medical emergencies at this time.  The 10% rebate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  class  B2 and C charges and subsidised day-care  surgery\r\n\r\nand  the  40%  additional fee assistance for the families  of\r\n\r\nretrenched citizens is a very huge load off their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a rational, level-headed Government when all\r\n\r\naround  us is gloom, panic and paralysis.  We need it  to  be\r\n\r\ndecisive and firm.  Yet, all these do not mean that Ministers\r\n\r\ndo  not have EQ (emotional quotient).  Perhaps, we just  need\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  wear  their  hearts more  obviously  on  their\r\n\r\nsleeves,  more visibly at this period of time.  And  I  think\r\n\r\n17.3%  pay-cut is one such gesture.  Is enough being done  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  sick,  disabled and elderly in this  new  package?\r\n\r\nMaybe,  though  I feel the assistance schemes could  also  be\r\n\r\nextended   to  those  whose  family  members  are  not   just\r\n\r\nretrenched  but  others  who  are  severely,  chronically  or\r\n\r\nterminally  ill.   These are burdens  which  are  beyond  the\r\n\r\nordinary citizens even in good times but at times like these,\r\n\r\nthey  become  onerous and can drive many to  desperation  and\r\n\r\ndeep despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, to put a soft edge to our policies, we need\r\n\r\nmore  representation from the gentler sex  in  policy-making.\r\n\r\nAs  they  say, women hold up half the sky.  God made men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  complementary and a softer touch  is  lacking  perhaps\r\n\r\nbecause we have too few women involved.  On this count, I  am\r\n\r\nvery heartened to hear rumours that the Government party  has\r\n\r\nindeed  selected many women candidates for the next election.\r\n\r\nSome seats in this House may, of course, be vacated for them,\r\n\r\nbut  that  is  the way of things, the political eco-cycle  at\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the softer touch, and here I am just giving an\r\n\r\nexample, should we not have, for example, waived maid  levies\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  are  quadriplegic, or severely  handicapped,\r\n\r\nespecially   if  this  encourages  them  to  be  economically\r\n\r\nproductive?  I know of a quadriplegic who earns his own  keep\r\n\r\npainting  with his mouth.  A large chunk of what he earns  is\r\n\r\nswallowed  up by the maid that he employs to look  after  his\r\n\r\nneeds.  He does not have any family members to help him  and,\r\n\r\nin fact, does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  want to because he is trying very hard to be independent\r\n\r\nand to stay away from an institutional home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, Sir, the deprived. We have some who are poor\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are deprived or bereft of opportunity.   These\r\n\r\ninclude single mothers with young children, who cannot  leave\r\n\r\nhome  to  work;  elderly  persons who are  physically  and/or\r\n\r\nmentally  active  but not trusted with most  types  of  work;\r\n\r\nyoung  and  old in between jobs, perhaps as they are  in  the\r\n\r\nthroes  of  a long course of study; and well-educated,  well-trained people who have come out into the job market  at  the\r\n\r\nwrong time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that there are many loan suspension and grant\r\n\r\nand aid schemes for such people, especially those in full and\r\n\r\npart-time  courses and for the new graduates.   But,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like   to   suggest  some  more  ways   of   creating\r\n\r\nopportunities and I hope the Government will consider these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, for those who can work at home, can we find some\r\n\r\nways  of providing that work to them, such as the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  cottage industries?  For this, perhaps more relaxed rules\r\n\r\nfor home offices/businesses.  For those who are elderly, some\r\n\r\nspecial  schemes for job matching, jobs that  allow  them  to\r\n\r\nkeep their dignity and also schemes to encourage employers to\r\n\r\nlook  for these elderly.  There should be more publicity  for\r\n\r\njob-matching schemes.  There should be continued  efforts  at\r\n\r\npump priming and job creation.  One popular refrain from many\r\n\r\nsmall  businesses is the request to downsize the  Government-linked companies' (GLCs) preserve so that they do not soak up\r\n\r\nall the available opportunities, and perhaps, even to get the\r\n\r\nGLCs  to  boot-strap  the SMEs as they  go  into  new  fields\r\n\r\ntogether.  Lastly, give more Government contracts to SMEs  by\r\n\r\ntendering out Government jobs in smaller chunks so that  they\r\n\r\ncan manage it and, together, we can rebuild the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.12 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, when the DPM was giving his Ministerial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement,  he  rounded up with the remark that  it  was  the\r\n\r\npeople  working  with  the Government that  helped  Singapore\r\n\r\novercome  the  past  crisis.  I completely  agree  with  this\r\n\r\nsentiment.   If  we  look  at all the  crises,  not  just  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but throughout the world, for every crisis, it  is\r\n\r\nthe ordinary men, women and children that suffer the pain and\r\n\r\nmisery.   It  is  the  ordinary people and  citizens  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  that  have  to make the greatest  and  most  painful\r\n\r\nsacrifices.   When  times are good, when the  economy  booms,\r\n\r\nthey  are  the forgotten lot.  We think of the rich  and  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in terms of accumulation of wealth and  position,\r\n\r\nbut not the ordinary people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11th incident is one example. Within\r\n\r\nhours of the collapse of the World Trade Centre, US companies\r\n\r\nwere  announcing  lay-offs.   They  knew  the  buildings  had\r\n\r\ncollapsed  but they also knew how many people  they  have  to\r\n\r\nretrench,  in  terms  of  thousands.  Retrenchment,  throwing\r\n\r\npeople  off to the streets, was the first option for many  US\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Workers had to bear the brunt for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\ncapital and capitalism.  I hope Singapore employers will  not\r\n\r\nfollow  the US example.  Retrenchments must not be the  first\r\n\r\noption.  It must be the last.  I hope people understand  that\r\n\r\nretrenchment does not only affect the worker, it affects  his\r\n\r\nfamily   and   himself  or  herself,  both  emotionally   and\r\n\r\nfinancially.  I am therefore happy that this package actually\r\n\r\nhas  a focus that addresses the concerns of many citizens  in\r\n\r\nthis  country.   The concerns are a sense of job  insecurity,\r\n\r\nfear   of  losing  their  jobs  or  retrenchments,  fear   of\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  getting another job, and the fear  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  have enough money to meet even their basic  needs.\r\n\r\nIn  that  light, assistance to make businesses remain  viable\r\n\r\nwithout resorting to retrenchments too easily is welcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards job creation, I would like to ask whether it\r\n\r\nis  possible to give additional tax incentives to businessmen\r\n\r\nwho  start  business investments now in this  most  difficult\r\n\r\ntime.   I  also hope that the implementation of  this  scheme\r\n\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhindrance-free  and administratively easy,  just  as  it  was\r\n\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the things that I wanted to say have already\r\n\r\nbeen covered.  So I just want to talk about one other aspect.\r\n\r\nWhen we tackle the present crisis, we must not lose sight  of\r\n\r\nlife  beyond  this crisis.  And one of the important  lessons\r\n\r\nthat we can learn from this crisis, or even the US system, is\r\n\r\nthat  even  with  the best of technology, with  the  best  of\r\n\r\nthings that the Americans have, technology alone was not able\r\n\r\nto help them when real disaster and difficulty happened.  All\r\n\r\nthe  talk  about high-tech, small government, was not  there.\r\n\r\nWhen people are in deep crisis and who suffer most, they look\r\n\r\nto  the  government for help.  They look for ordinary  chaps,\r\n\r\nthe  unsung  heroes, the underpaid people, the teachers,  the\r\n\r\nnurses,  the  policemen, the firemen, the counsellors.   They\r\n\r\nwere  important  in  their lives.  The churches,  the  church\r\n\r\nleaders and other religious practitioners were the ones  whom\r\n\r\npeople turn to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do a review of our policies, in terms of\r\n\r\neconomics,  it  is  not just important to look  at  enhancing\r\n\r\neconomic wealth  - it is important, we need money, we need  a\r\n\r\ngood  life  -  but we also need social cohesion, we also need\r\n\r\nwelfare.  So we have to strike a balance between economic and\r\n\r\nsocial  needs, and I hope we keep it that way.  And  in  this\r\n\r\nlight,  I  wish  to  compliment the  leadership  for  showing\r\n\r\nexample by taking the lead in taking a pay cut.  I think this\r\n\r\nis important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that the Government remains\r\n\r\nflexible.  One of the main things I hear for years  was  that\r\n\r\nthere would be no unemployment benefits.   There would be  no\r\n\r\nwelfare benefits.  But today, in this package, there is  some\r\n\r\nrelief  for  people who lose their jobs. You do not  call  it\r\n\r\nunemployment  benefit.  You call it by another name,  but  it\r\n\r\nstill  meets  the need, and this is the flexibility  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded.   And  I hope this flexibility will be  reflected  in\r\n\r\nmany other things when we do a review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the present crisis has reduced our\r\n\r\neconomic capital, but it does not mean that we will  have  to\r\n\r\nreduce our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  capital.  With this package in this  crisis,  we  can\r\n\r\nactually review our policies and increase our social capital,\r\n\r\nand  to come out stronger.   Again, I want to say that I hope\r\n\r\nthat  our  employers will take advantage of  this  relief  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen their businesses.  I hope they will not  use  this\r\n\r\nrelief  as  an example to lay off workers and add on  to  the\r\n\r\npain  and misery of the working people.  And I am sure,  just\r\n\r\nas  we had overcome all past crises, we can work together  to\r\n\r\nreduce pain in this crisis and come out stronger in the world\r\n\r\nafter the crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic measures taken to deal with the\r\n\r\ndownturn are indeed a booster to our economy.  There are also\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  are  taken to deal with the  across-the-board\r\n\r\nproblems and challenges that we will be facing.  I would have\r\n\r\nthought that the DPM would try and see whether we can  put  a\r\n\r\nbit  more money into the pockets of individuals, so that they\r\n\r\nwill be able to boost the economy.  I would have thought that\r\n\r\nhe would have considered, say, rebate on maid levy, rebate on\r\n\r\nchild  care and other indirect taxes, which would have  given\r\n\r\nan immediate boost to the economy.  I hope that he could tell\r\n\r\nus  why he has not considered giving rebate on other indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is really important in the prolonged recession\r\n\r\nthat  we are going to face is the question of social strains,\r\n\r\nand  I think this is a very important issue that we must bear\r\n\r\nin  mind because, in economic recessions, a lot of people are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be affected.  It will cut across ethnic, religious\r\n\r\nand  class  lines.  Therefore, I think it is  very  important\r\n\r\nthat  we have to watch out for these strains.  Especially  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  multi-racial  society,  we  will  have   to   be\r\n\r\nsensitive and to respond effectively to deal with such issues\r\n\r\nthat  could  be  played  up by the  Opposition  parties.    I\r\n\r\nthought Mr Chiam would be around, but he is not  around.   As\r\n\r\nan  Opposition  leader, together with other Opposition  party\r\n\r\nleaders, I hope  they will join the Government to look at  it\r\n\r\nfrom a united way in tackling this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem.   It  is  not  a  problem of  the  PAP  itself,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   in   power  today.   It  is   the   problem   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and I think this is very important  because  we\r\n\r\nare  all  in the same boat, and we cannot afford to rock  the\r\n\r\nboat.   If Singaporeans are going to be divisive and to  hear\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition say that this is a vote buying ploy  that  we\r\n\r\nare doing, then I think they are seriously wrong.  This is  a\r\n\r\nvery serious problem that we are all facing in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge Singaporeans to stand united in tackling\r\n\r\nthis problem in a most cohesive way, because if we do not  do\r\n\r\nthis,  then we will fall apart and Singapore will  crack  up.\r\n\r\nAnd  who  will  lose  at  the end of the  day?   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthemselves  will be the losers.  So I would urge Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  stand  behind  the  Government and  tackle  this  problem\r\n\r\nconcertedly.  And with the will that we have, I  am  sure  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to brave the storm.  So I hope the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  encourage voluntary organisations and other  community\r\n\r\ngroups  to  join  the  CCCs  to tackle  the  problem  at  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots level.  Because this is a problem of the community\r\n\r\nand  everybody has a role to play, and if they can join hands\r\n\r\nand  funding  support can be given to these organisations  to\r\n\r\nalso  tackle the problems of the unemployed, then I think  we\r\n\r\nwill take a concerted approach to deal with the issues at the\r\n\r\nlocal level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we could look at it from the point of\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion, and in the Singapore context, this is  very\r\n\r\ncrucial  for  the survival of Singapore.  And in  hard  times\r\n\r\nlike  this, we must stand united and look forward to tackling\r\n\r\nvarious complex problems and challenges that we are facing at\r\n\r\nthis juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that I would like to bring up is\r\n\r\nthat the number of unemployed people will increase.  And  for\r\n\r\nthem,  unemployment may be prolonged, because  it  will  take\r\n\r\nsome time for the economy to pick up.  With the hollowing  of\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing sector, the older workers and perhaps even\r\n\r\nyounger  workers   -  professionals,  semi-professionals  and\r\n\r\ntechnical persons  -  will all be affected.   It will be  for\r\n\r\nthe first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  that  we will see more long-term unemployed workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think this is likely to happen and I would like\r\n\r\nto  find  out  from  DPM  what are the long-term  contingency\r\n\r\nmeasures   that  we  will  take  should  there  be  long-term\r\n\r\nunemployment  faced  by workers.  I  think  this  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant issue that we need to look at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the Economic Downturn Relief Scheme,\r\n\r\nwhich has been introduced, would provide temporary relief  to\r\n\r\nworkers who are currently unemployed.  I feel that the scheme\r\n\r\nshould   be  a  bit  more  generous  than  the  $200  monthly\r\n\r\nassistance  provided.  It could be reviewed and I  hope  that\r\n\r\nDPM could look at whether the public assistance scheme, which\r\n\r\nis  based on the number of persons in the household, could be\r\n\r\napplied.  It could be calculated on the basis of up  to  four\r\n\r\npersons per household.  In fact, the public assistance scheme\r\n\r\nis  a  bit more generous than the $200 which is at the moment\r\n\r\nset  aside to help the unemployed.  Sir, I think we  need  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  longer  term measures to deal  with  prolonged\r\n\r\nunemployment  affecting workers.  This needs to be  addressed\r\n\r\nand I would like to ask DPM whether Government has thought of\r\n\r\nlong-term measures to tackle this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue we need to look at is the issue of\r\n\r\njob  creation.   With the economic recession, jobs  are  very\r\n\r\nunlikely to be created in the next one year or so.  But there\r\n\r\nis  a  need  to look at how we can absorb some of  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers into the job sector.  I would like to ask DPM whether\r\n\r\nthe  public as well as the Government-linked companies  would\r\n\r\nbe  looking  at some ways in which jobs could be  created  to\r\n\r\nabsorb  some  of  the older workers.  In the longer  term,  I\r\n\r\nthink job creation will become an issue, especially when many\r\n\r\nof  the  industries in the manufacturing sector are going  to\r\n\r\nhollow  out.  I would like to find out whether the Government\r\n\r\nhas  any long-term plans to look at how we could create  more\r\n\r\njobs for people who are coming on stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those are some of the issues that I would like to\r\n\r\nbring up.  The other issue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  I  would like to raise is the waiver of income  tax  on\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits.  Workers who are retrenched or given a\r\n\r\ngolden handshake have to pay tax on their benefits.  It  will\r\n\r\nbe  indeed helpful if tax on these benefits could be  waived.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  ask DPM if the waiver of  income  tax  on\r\n\r\nbenefits   given   to  workers  upon  golden   handshake   or\r\n\r\nretrenchment  could be considered, and this  will  be  indeed\r\n\r\nhelpful for the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  Singapore is clearly in crisis.  This is largely caused\r\n\r\nby  external  factors.   But  I think  besides  the  cyclical\r\n\r\ndownturn,  there are also some structural problems that  will\r\n\r\nneed to be addressed.  I have read through the materials  and\r\n\r\nafter  listening  to the Deputy Prime Minister,  I  find  the\r\n\r\npresent package to be rational, targeted, realistic and quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  I think it is clearly a sincere attempt to  try\r\n\r\nto   help,  although  there  must  be  recognition  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot cure all the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question, therefore, which has been raised in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  is  whether  this is a General  Election  ploy.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a non-partisan Member of the House, I think there\r\n\r\nis  only  one thing that I could see that is potentially  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  inadvertently political, and this is  in  using  the\r\n\r\nCCCs  to  administer assistance for the lower income.   These\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations, as I understand it,  do  not  come\r\n\r\nunder the Opposition Members of Parliament.  But beyond  this\r\n\r\none  point, I really think that the package is not a  General\r\n\r\nElection  ploy.   In  that  sense,  I  would  encourage   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  not  to  play political football  in  this  game.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, I hope, will vote by conscience, even  if  they\r\n\r\ndo take money from the CCCs.  More than that, I disagree with\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member for Potong Pasir, Mr Chiam.  This money would\r\n\r\nnot  be  easily handed out because it is targeted, it is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  that  the CCCs can just give to whoever  says,  \"I\r\n\r\nwould  vote PAP.\"  So I do not think we should take too  much\r\n\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think we should look at the package rationally and\r\n\r\nsee  whether it will help people.  I also, on the same token,\r\n\r\nwant to say that I acknowledge the effort to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlead by example in the political leadership taking a pay cut.\r\n\r\nLet me then turn to the package.  Many things have been said.\r\n\r\nI  find  it generally good but I have some questions I should\r\n\r\nlike to put to the Deputy Prime Minister.  The first of these\r\n\r\nare rather itty-bitty, specific points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on property market. Of all the anti-speculation measures, it has been chosen that the 80% cap on\r\n\r\nloans remains.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  we should not instead trust the market.  The banking\r\n\r\nsector, Sir, has been chastened by what has happened, so have\r\n\r\npurchasers  largely.  I think it should be left  to  them  to\r\n\r\nevaluate risks and that the market and the purchasers have  a\r\n\r\nfree  play with this.  If anything, it should be the  capital\r\n\r\ngains  tax  that is a better tool to keep.  This  80%  margin\r\n\r\nshould not, in a sense, be a sacred cow, I hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second measure I welcome very much is the People for\r\n\r\nJobs  Traineeship  Programme.  When it was  first  announced,\r\n\r\nthere  was a cap on salary assistance of $600 and now it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  moved  to  $2,000 as the maximum, and I  welcome  this.\r\n\r\nThis is something really that people in Parliament called for\r\n\r\nand  it  has now been reconsidered.  And I think the contrast\r\n\r\nto  the  first  point, Sir, is that here we  are  willing  to\r\n\r\nreconsider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on the mismatch of jobs. Sir, it is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  with structural change, there may be unemployment\r\n\r\nin  some  sectors  while jobs go wanting  in  the  other.   I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  Ministry  of Manpower in  taking  a  much  more\r\n\r\nproactive  role  in  trying to match people.   But  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  we should also think of using the private sector  to\r\n\r\nhelp  us - employment agencies, head-hunters, especially  for\r\n\r\nthe  managers  and  professionals  who  may  find  themselves\r\n\r\nunemployed.  I think this is not a sector of the market  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Manpower has much experience, as compared  to\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, regards foreign talent. I too\r\n\r\nwelcome the adjustment in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy.  I generally believe that we should have an open-door\r\n\r\npolicy  for  foreign  talent but I  appreciate  the  need  to\r\n\r\ntighten the criteria.  As far as I understand it, one  change\r\n\r\nis  that the employment pass criteria will now be $2,500,  up\r\n\r\nfrom  $2,000 per month.  I am not here to debate on the  $500\r\n\r\nwith the Deputy Prime Minister.  But the principle of the peg\r\n\r\nis  something that, I think, might be reconsidered.   In  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister's remarks, he mentioned that the $2,000\r\n\r\nfigure  was  approximately the salary of a new  graduate.   I\r\n\r\nwould  put to him that this is probably the wrong peg because\r\n\r\nthis  pegs the entry point for foreign talent to exactly  the\r\n\r\npeople  who are most vulnerable - new graduates.   These  are\r\n\r\npeople who have spent a lot of money and time to get educated\r\n\r\nbut  have  no track record to show and they want  that  first\r\n\r\njob.  So I think, in principle, that peg is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next disappointment, Sir, is about the New Singapore\r\n\r\nShares.  I am confused why it should be tied to CPF.  While I\r\n\r\nwelcome  it so much as a concept, I think that this  must  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  the CPF top-up.  This is particularly so because  CPF\r\n\r\ntop-up,  as  at previous sittings of the House,  was  clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  not  to  have worked  for  all.   There  was  a\r\n\r\nsizeable  number of CPF account holders who did  not  do  the\r\n\r\nnecessary things that would have availed themselves  of  this\r\n\r\ntop-up  scheme.  I think the challenge of the  New  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares  as  a  new idea is to instead value all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand  here  I join the minorities of Members of the House  who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  out in favour of home-makers, and I  would  add\r\n\r\nretirees  too, who contributed to the country  in  the  past.\r\n\r\nHome-makers  really  will  play an essential  role  when  the\r\n\r\nbreadwinners lose their jobs.  They may be the ones who  will\r\n\r\nhold the family and therefore the society together.  And they\r\n\r\nwill be the ones, I hope, who make sure that children get  to\r\n\r\nschools.   I  think  in this situation, Sir,  if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nrecognise the home-makers, we are doing them and ourselves an\r\n\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may broaden the points now. I would like to\r\n\r\nturn  to the nature of the response that is revealed  in  the\r\n\r\noff-Budget measures announced.  In some cases, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures are largely incremental, adjustments up or down by a\r\n\r\nfew  percentage points, and, in other cases,  a  longer  time\r\n\r\nline  is  given.  The first point about the nature  of  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  is  that they create more complex rules.   I  think\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  a  need  to explain and  facilitate  the  new\r\n\r\nprogrammes   for  those  who  need  them.   I   am   thinking\r\n\r\nparticularly of the small and medium enterprises and the less\r\n\r\nwell-educated.  If we make these rules too complex, then only\r\n\r\nthose  who  can  understand and get their act together  could\r\n\r\napply  for them and maybe, Sir, perhaps they do not need  our\r\n\r\nhelp if they can navigate very complex rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, putting the package together is one thing. But I\r\n\r\nwould  call on the Deputy Prime Minister to muster the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  and  others and task to bring this  to  the  ground\r\n\r\nlevel to make sure that they do effectively reach out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than this, Sir, I think that the challenge for us\r\n\r\nis  to  see that the structural change may need Singapore  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  deeper  and longer term look at our strategies.   In\r\n\r\nthis  sense, it is like the oil crisis of the mid-70s.    The\r\n\r\nUSA  and USSR had very different reactions.  The USA saw  the\r\n\r\nneed to cut and prune, not subsidise oil as the USSR did.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we know now who won out in that one.  Crisis demands\r\n\r\na  reaction but it is a vital question how we react and  deal\r\n\r\nwith  problems.   For  many  social  problems,  tensions  are\r\n\r\ninescapable.   We need to come out of this stronger  than  we\r\n\r\nwent  into  it.   So  I do tend to agree  on  the  danger  of\r\n\r\nwelfarism.  But, Sir, I would welcome a trust that people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are now prepared to help themselves.  And, in  this\r\n\r\nsense, I do appreciate such measures as the wage support  for\r\n\r\ntraining being raised from $600 to $2,000.  I think this is a\r\n\r\ngood  sign  of  something  bigger.  Helping  Singaporeans  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  not  a  question of cost but of getting  essential\r\n\r\nthings done, with whatever cost it takes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then to what is not here in the off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures, which I hoped would be there and thought  could  be\r\n\r\nhelped.   Comparing these measures to those  taken  in  1998,\r\n\r\nthere is an absence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  efforts  to  lower cost of operations in  areas  such  as\r\n\r\nTelecoms and port charges.  Sir, I realise that these are, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  free markets and players can set their prices.   But\r\n\r\nthere  are  few players in these sectors and I am asking  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister if he believes they  are  competitive\r\n\r\nenough  worldwide  or,  if not, why were  these  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures also missing from his package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for the longer term, I would ask the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister if it is not timely for Government  to\r\n\r\ntake  efforts  to  review  various  measures  such  as:   (1)\r\n\r\nGovernment  costs and practices, for example, customs,  stamp\r\n\r\nduties by Government in different agencies; (2) the long-term\r\n\r\neconomic strategy, especially regarding SMEs, the development\r\n\r\nof  services  and, of course, strengthening of  our  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy;  and  (3)  to think consciously  of  constructing  a\r\n\r\nsocial  safety  net,  not a traditional  welfare  scheme  nor\r\n\r\nwidespread subsidies, but targeted and sufficient help as  we\r\n\r\nseem to be coming to in these off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perhaps need to articulate our social safety net\r\n\r\nbetter  to understand what it is, what we are trying  to  do.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  the  Nominated Member of  Parliament,  Mr  Thomas\r\n\r\nThomas, suggested that we are actually giving \"dole\"  but  by\r\n\r\ndifferent name.  I think we really need to conceptualise what\r\n\r\nit is we are trying to build.  My own instinct is that we are\r\n\r\ntrying  to create not a safety net which may entangle  people\r\n\r\nbut  a sort of trampoline that can help people, down on their\r\n\r\nluck, bounce up again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, therefore, in this context set out some wishes\r\n\r\nof  what  I  would like to have seen added to  the  list  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  Government  might  consider  if  the  recession   is\r\n\r\nprolonged.  I do not want to break them out into little  bits\r\n\r\nand pieces but to see them in terms of broader strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is, I think, the strategy must be for\r\n\r\nsolidarity  in our society.  And here the first  item  on  my\r\n\r\nwish  list  is  something  that was mentioned  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister as a possibility during his National Day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeech.  This is that he might give double tax deductions for\r\n\r\nthose  who  give  to  Institutions of  Public  Character  and\r\n\r\ncharities.   Sir, I do believe that it is good  to  encourage\r\n\r\nmany-helping  hands even in this time of  crisis.   Companies\r\n\r\nand   individuals  can,  despite  the  crisis,  find  it   in\r\n\r\nthemselves to give money to charities to help others.  If so,\r\n\r\nI  think  they should be recognised by the Government doubly,\r\n\r\nliterally doubly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, in terms of solidarity, I do share a\r\n\r\nconcern  that  race or religious discrimination  might  rise.\r\n\r\nLooking  back again to the downturn in 1998/1999, there  were\r\n\r\nsome  concerns  that  there  were some  incidents  of  racial\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  in  hiring.  Again,  when  jobs  are  scarce,\r\n\r\npeople  may  take  all sorts of criteria into  consideration,\r\n\r\nsome  of  which  are  relevant  and  some  of  which  may  be\r\n\r\nirrelevant.  Here, I would ask the Government to be  prepared\r\n\r\nagain  to use moral suasion to change the minds of employers,\r\n\r\nto  monitor complaints and to even, if the problem  persists,\r\n\r\nconsider legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third item on solidarity, I believe that\r\n\r\nchildren should be our focus.  I hope, Sir, we are beyond the\r\n\r\npoint where young people will come out of school early in bad\r\n\r\ntimes,  in order to try to find a job.  We should have enough\r\n\r\nthat the young will have enough reserves to really invest  in\r\n\r\ntheir own education and Singapore's future.  And I would call\r\n\r\non  the Ministry of Education to especially target schools to\r\n\r\nmonitor  and recommend special assistance programmes  if  any\r\n\r\nchild should face problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning, Sir, next to the professionals. I do believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  professionals need help, and I have mentioned  how\r\n\r\nthe   private  sector  should  be  used  for  job  placement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  we need training, counselling, and  to  really\r\n\r\nrecognise the fact that we are going to deal with a whole new\r\n\r\ncategory  of people who are out of a job.  There  are  people\r\n\r\nwho used to earn, perhaps, I do not know, $10,000 to $20,000,\r\n\r\nand  we  need  to cater to them in a whole different  way  to\r\n\r\nencourage them to take on new roles in society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is whether it is now timely to start\r\n\r\nto fund necessary risks and new directions.  Under this broad\r\n\r\nthrust, I would suggest that one of the things we may need is\r\n\r\na  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise Bank or  Venture  Fund.   I\r\n\r\nappreciate that these off-Budget measures have got an item to\r\n\r\nenlarge  the  existing scheme.  But I share the concern  that\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  presently works through banks  which,  in  their\r\n\r\neffort  to  be prudential, may not understand SMEs fully  and\r\n\r\ntherefore there may be a need to have a SME Venture Fund that\r\n\r\ncan  give  more focus and is willing to take more  risks.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this is a real need, Sir, because small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises are often being a source of new job creation when\r\n\r\nan  economy is restructuring.  An example of this, of course,\r\n\r\nis the USA in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\nSME  Bank can certainly help create jobs, not least for  some\r\n\r\nof the out-of-work bankers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I would like to make is about export\r\n\r\ninsurance.  Some countries, such as USA, do underwrite  risks\r\n\r\nto  a much larger degree than Singapore.  If in this time  of\r\n\r\ncrisis, Singapore companies are to be emboldened to find  new\r\n\r\nmarkets  and  find new products and to go  out,  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  go  further.  The present scheme of  ECICS  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies, I think, is not enough.  We should be prepared not\r\n\r\nto  subsidise them but to share risks with them.  And I think\r\n\r\na  major  Government  statutory  board,  such  as  the  Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, is better able to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, if the strategy is to go towards a\r\n\r\nnew  economy, this crisis may be a good time to help the  new\r\n\r\neconomy  and the Internet companies which have been so  badly\r\n\r\nhit.   Government has done a very good job in creating an  e-Government.  I would ask them now whether we should invest in\r\n\r\nefforts  to  make  an e-private sector for  productivity  and\r\n\r\ngains   in   the   long  run.   Here,  Sir,  it   is   beyond\r\n\r\ninfrastructure but rather to underwrite efforts  in  training\r\n\r\nas well as to align the Government's procurement and approval\r\n\r\nsystems  so  that  companies which  use  Internet  might  get\r\n\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  so  we  could create a market for Internet and companies\r\n\r\nthat use Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two last challenges, Sir, and how we can use this\r\n\r\ndownturn.   The first again is a challenge put  up  by  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh during his National Day Rally speech.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we can improve our service in Singapore.  Really,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that this is a good time for training and that  people\r\n\r\nwill suddenly wake up to the idea that their job is something\r\n\r\nthey  value  and they should be doing much better  than  they\r\n\r\nare.   And  we  should take advantage of this to help  change\r\n\r\nattitudes  of  service staff.  There is after  all  a  higher\r\n\r\nexpectation of people who are willing to spend money in times\r\n\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, which may seem a little light\r\n\r\nhearted, is how to make productive time of this crisis.  This\r\n\r\nis  that we need to cater to leisure in Singapore.  With  the\r\n\r\ndownturn, people have less money to spend.  With the  concern\r\n\r\nabout air travel following the events of 11th September, they\r\n\r\nwant  to  travel less, but there is still need for  families,\r\n\r\nfor  singles,  for everyone, to have a good time.   And  this\r\n\r\ntime,  Sir, is a good opportunity for Government to think  of\r\n\r\nhow  to  synergise and offer Singaporeans to have  affordable\r\n\r\ngood  times  in  Singapore.  Work  with  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nhotels, with statutory boards like Sentosa, and other  things\r\n\r\nshould  be  undertaken to this end.  We should aim  to  offer\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially  in the coming  December  holidays,\r\n\r\nspecial  theme promotions, so that we can have some  of  that\r\n\r\ngood  mood  at  affordable prices and also help our  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I would say that I support the off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Many Singapore companies, especially  the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  are hurting badly because this time around, they  have\r\n\r\nlower  reserves,  having barely recovered from  the  previous\r\n\r\ncrisis  in 1997/1998.  Revenues are down as demand for  goods\r\n\r\nand  services dries up.  The only way for companies out there\r\n\r\nto  survive  this severe downturn is to cut costs drastically\r\n\r\nwhile waiting for demand to revive.  For most companies,  the\r\n\r\nmajor fixed costs are rental and manpower costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Confederation of Industries, of which I am\r\n\r\na Council Member and also Vice-President, came up with a wish-list  three  days ago.  It contains a list of  what  we  feel\r\n\r\nwould  be necessary and helpful to companies to survive  this\r\n\r\ndownturn.   I  am  happy to note that many of these  requests\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken into consideration in the package announced\r\n\r\ntoday.   I  would  like to thank the Government  for  such  a\r\n\r\ngenerous and bold package.  It has generally met expectations\r\n\r\nwhich are high.  It has something for almost everybody,  from\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  to the elderly, from  entrepreneurs  to\r\n\r\nretrenched workers.  I am sure it will assist many  companies\r\n\r\nin  helping them to contain costs and retain as many  workers\r\n\r\nas  possible during this trying time.  However, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  make  the  following comments and  suggestions  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may wish to consider further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on manpower cost cutting. For many companies,\r\n\r\nwage  cost, including CPF contributions by employers, is  one\r\n\r\nof  the  biggest cost items.  I agree with DPM that  the  CPF\r\n\r\nshould not be used as a tool\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  adjustment of short-term labour costs.   In  the  longer\r\n\r\nterm,  however,  the  Government  should  seriously  consider\r\n\r\nreducing  the  CPF  contribution rate from 16%  to  something\r\n\r\nlower,  say,  about  12%.   It is a  significant  saving  for\r\n\r\nemployers  and will help them to retain more workers  and  be\r\n\r\nmore  competitive  in  the long term.   In  the  short  term,\r\n\r\nemployers  of  course  will  take other  measures  to  reduce\r\n\r\nmanpower  costs to a level commensurate with  the  volume  of\r\n\r\nbusiness,  such as salary cuts, shorter work week, compulsory\r\n\r\nno  pay leave, and so on.  To maintain industrial harmony  at\r\n\r\nthe  workplace  at  a time like this, it  is  important  that\r\n\r\nemployers discuss and share their problems and plans with the\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, rental costs. This item is less flexible to\r\n\r\nadjust  unless landlords are prepared to reduce  rentals.   I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  Government's decision to further  increase  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of  property tax rebates.  I urge all  landlords  to\r\n\r\npass this saving to all their tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, financing costs. I am glad to note that DBS bank\r\n\r\nhas  taken  the lead in reducing its prime rate to  4.5%.   I\r\n\r\nurge  other  banks  to  follow  suit.   Interest  rates  have\r\n\r\nremained  rather high for some time, despite the  substantial\r\n\r\nlowering of interest rates in the USA since the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis  year.  More importantly, banks should be more  flexible\r\n\r\nand  understanding at this time of crisis and be prepared  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  loans  to  help  companies  to  ride  out   this\r\n\r\ndownturn.  In this respect, MAS has influence over the  banks\r\n\r\nand  finance companies, and I hope that it will exercise  its\r\n\r\nmoral suasion accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For job creation, new companies must mushroom and\r\n\r\nexisting   companies  must  expand.   SMEs  have   difficulty\r\n\r\naccessing capital at times like this to grow and create jobs.\r\n\r\nThe Government should seriously consider starting a SME bank,\r\n\r\nor a development bank, which has been raised by the SCI at  a\r\n\r\npress  conference  a few days ago, and also  by  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in this House.  Without a development bank,  like\r\n\r\nwhat we had in the 60s and 70s, many of the companies that we\r\n\r\nknow of today\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not have flourished and succeeded.  I am happy to  note\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  will  be  establishing  a  micro-loan\r\n\r\nprogramme to help very small companies.  I will wait for  the\r\n\r\ndetails to be announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, cash-flow management. I thank the Government for\r\n\r\nthe  corporate tax rebates that will certainly help  to  ease\r\n\r\ncash  flows of companies.  To help some companies  tide  over\r\n\r\nthis  period, the Government should allow companies that have\r\n\r\ncorporate tax payments from previous years' profits to  defer\r\n\r\nthese  or  restructure  and pay in smaller  quantums  over  a\r\n\r\nlonger period of time.  The Government should also allow  for\r\n\r\ntax  offset on losses incurred in overseas ventures by  local\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport costs. To help companies reduce their\r\n\r\ntransport  costs,  the Government has reduced  petrol  excise\r\n\r\nduty  by  5%.  This is most welcome.  It should also consider\r\n\r\nremoving  the ERP charges, except during the peak  hours  of,\r\n\r\nsay,  8  am to 9 am and 5 pm to 7 pm.  I drive into  the  CBD\r\n\r\nfrom time to time during off-peak hours and I do not see  any\r\n\r\nheavy  traffic, or traffic jam, at all to justify ERP charges\r\n\r\nduring off-peak hours.  With the ERP system in place for some\r\n\r\ntime  now,  it  is  also time for the Government  to  further\r\n\r\nreduce  road taxes, ARF and import duties for cars and  other\r\n\r\ncommercial vehicles on a more permanent basis.  We are  still\r\n\r\nthe  most  expensive place in the whole world for owning  and\r\n\r\noperating  cars and other commercial vehicles, and these  all\r\n\r\nadd up to the operating costs of companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On GST, I would like to add also here my call for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider suspending temporarily the 3%  GST  to\r\n\r\nreduce cost of transactions and cost to companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the personal side, the Government has been generous\r\n\r\nin  granting an additional 5% rebate for personal income  tax\r\n\r\nfor  the  Year  of  Assessment 2001.   Some  individuals  are\r\n\r\ncurrently encountering difficulties in paying their taxes and\r\n\r\nI   hope   the   Government  will  consider  allowing   these\r\n\r\nindividuals to pay their income taxes from the previous  year\r\n\r\nover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  longer  period of time as this would help to lessen  their\r\n\r\ncash-flow problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On infrastructure projects, I am happy to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would be injecting $3.5 billion into the  economy\r\n\r\nto speed up infrastructure projects.  However, given the open\r\n\r\neconomy  of Singapore, how do we ensure that the benefits  of\r\n\r\nthis  expenditure  and its multiplier effects  will  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  accrue to Singaporeans?  The  Government  may\r\n\r\nwish  to consider schemes for this to be achieved, all  other\r\n\r\nthings being equal.  If there is too much leakage out of  our\r\n\r\neconomic system, our efforts would have been futile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, I would like to suggest some\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Singapore has become quite an expensive  place  to\r\n\r\ndo   business  in,  especially  for  rentals,  transport  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  costs,  compared  to  our  neighbouring  countries.\r\n\r\nMoving up the value-added ladder by being more innovative and\r\n\r\ncreative   will  take  some  time.   In  the  meantime,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should look into more measures to reduce  domestic\r\n\r\ncosts  within our control so that more of our companies  will\r\n\r\nbe able to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  this opportunity to speak.  The people are hurting.\r\n\r\nMore  of  my  residents are coming to see  me  about  housing\r\n\r\nloans,  utilities bills they cannot pay, increasing utilities\r\n\r\nbills, loss of jobs, looking for new jobs, worry about  their\r\n\r\nchildren's education.  Therefore, the measures that  DPM  has\r\n\r\nannounced  are  very welcome.  And those  measures  are  very\r\n\r\nreassuring to the people in Singapore because it demonstrates\r\n\r\nthat the Government understands and cares about how they  are\r\n\r\ncoping with the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased to note that the Government is\r\n\r\nfreezing  the fees for undergraduate and polytechnic tuition.\r\n\r\nI  wish I knew this last night. Because last night, one of my\r\n\r\nresidents  came to me and said, \"I am very worried  about  my\r\n\r\ndaughter.  She is going to the university next year  and  the\r\n\r\nfees are going to increase.\"  And I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassured her that the Government will make sure there will  be\r\n\r\nfee  loans, and so forth.  And if I had known this,  I  would\r\n\r\nhave told her, \"Don't worry, the fees will be frozen for  one\r\n\r\nyear,  and  perhaps longer, and it becomes more  affordable.\"\r\n\r\nSo  I think these are very welcome.  And as a lecturer in the\r\n\r\nuniversity, I am quite sure my students will be very  pleased\r\n\r\nto know that the fees will not be increased for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easing of cash flow of new HDB flat buyers would also be\r\n\r\nvery  useful.  A lot of residents come to me and ask for help\r\n\r\nbecause  they cannot pay the 20% downpayment.  By  staggering\r\n\r\nthe downpayment in two stages of 10% each is very helpful  to\r\n\r\nmany of them.  The utilities bills, as I have said, have been\r\n\r\nincreasing.   The  reduction  of  tariffs  and  extension  of\r\n\r\nutilities rebates will also go a long way to help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses will definitely welcome the improved access\r\n\r\nto  funds  by  the Government introducing an  improved  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise   Finance  Scheme.   But  I  like   to   join   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary colleagues, Mr Leong Horn Kee and  Mr  Lew  Syn\r\n\r\nPau, to call upon our banks to help.  The cost of funds is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important business cost.  A lowering of  this  interest\r\n\r\nrate will go a long way to help reduce this cost element.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is showing a very good example by cutting\r\n\r\nthe  salaries of Ministers, political office holders,  senior\r\n\r\ncivil  servants and also the MP's allowance.  It  shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  understands the suffering and  pain  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   However, the real answer to our current crisis  and\r\n\r\ndifficulties  is  a  strong economy.  I urge  the  Government\r\n\r\ntherefore,  and  I  know they are doing  what  they  can,  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate its full resources to revive the economy  and  to\r\n\r\ngrow  a  strong  economy  that will pull  us  out  from  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I would urge Singaporeans to take the many\r\n\r\nopportunities which are made available by the Government  for\r\n\r\nretraining  and  upgrading for a New  Economy.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  have to be less choosy in selecting the jobs they want,\r\n\r\nor the location of the job they want,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  take  a  lower salary  and  tide  through  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  time.   By working together,  we  will  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblems  that we have today.  With proper planning  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  looking  at the strategy, I  look  forward  to  a\r\n\r\nstronger future for Singaporeans of this generation  and  for\r\n\r\nour children and their children as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  this  off-Budget package.  We  are  able  to  do  so\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our  prudent  management  of  our  finances  and\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at my meet-the-people sessions, three\r\n\r\nmajor areas of concern and request kept recurring:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Requests for jobs;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Concern about the rising electricity and water\r\n\r\nbills, SC&C charges and their current mortgage housing loans;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Inability or problems in meeting their hospital\r\n\r\nbills and education and transport costs and, for the business\r\n\r\ncommunity, they always complain of no business or  very  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had wanted to see how Deputy Prime Minister would\r\n\r\naddress  these  issues,  and I  must  say  that  I  am  quite\r\n\r\ncomforted  by the fact that he has given very good assurances\r\n\r\nas to how these issues would be tackled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around, I can feel the urgency, the worry and\r\n\r\nthe  fear,  more  so  than  in the  previous  1985  and  1997\r\n\r\ndownturns.    This  time,  the  effect  is  more  widespread,\r\n\r\ninvolving  white and blue-collar workers and  involving  many\r\n\r\ncategories of our workforce, from the driver to the  manager,\r\n\r\nyoung  professionals and recent graduates.  In  the  previous\r\n\r\ndownturn,  I remember when we offered jobs to some  of  those\r\n\r\npeople  who  had  no  jobs,  they  turned  it  down.   I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand at that time why they did that, because there  was\r\n\r\na lot of family support.  Many of the members of the families\r\n\r\nhad  jobs.   So the family support was there.  But this  time\r\n\r\naround,  I  notice that they are less choosy and  they  would\r\n\r\naccept whatever jobs that we offer to them.  I can understand\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  recession  must  be  quite widespread.   Not  only  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector is involved, but the other  sectors  are\r\n\r\nalso  involved,  and this has affected other members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  Thus, the family support has shrunk and this created\r\n\r\nthis sense of uncertainty, this fear and this worry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the only way out is job creation and job\r\n\r\npreservation.   To  do that, I think the  Government  has  to\r\n\r\nprovide  that ambience for the business sector to be able  to\r\n\r\ncreate jobs and to preserve the jobs.  Looking at the package\r\n\r\nand  listening to DPM, I know that there is a genuine  effort\r\n\r\nto  achieve these goals.  And this package obviously contains\r\n\r\na  lot  of assistance programmes to do this.  But the man-in-the-street  should  not feel that the Government  is  helping\r\n\r\nthis  sector more than them because, if they will go  through\r\n\r\nthe  package presented, there is a lot for them too.   I  am,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  glad to see many changes made to help  businesses\r\n\r\nto survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember our earlier assessment of the downturn. We\r\n\r\nput  a  lot  of emphasis on cyclical cause for this downturn.\r\n\r\nBut  when I speak to businessmen, they always tell me,  \"Doc,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  structural  element  there\".   This  afternoon,\r\n\r\nlistening to DPM, he has called for structural changes to  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  our  economic health, and I am sure this  would  be\r\n\r\nsupported very strongly by the business community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must be prepared for change in our\r\n\r\nlifestyle.  We have to scale down our expectations  in  terms\r\n\r\nof  expected  income,  job choices, housing,  recreation  and\r\n\r\nspending habits.  No longer can we be too choosy about  jobs,\r\n\r\nexpect  high  income.  We have to earn every  cent,  and  not\r\n\r\nexpect  it.  We have to take on jobs now taken up by  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, including construction work.  We have to review  our\r\n\r\nmaid  employment.  For example, we should encourage  some  of\r\n\r\nour  Singaporeans  who are unemployed to  take  up  part-time\r\n\r\nhousekeeping jobs.  Hourly-paid jobs are also a  way  out  in\r\n\r\nthese difficult times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fear that the foreign worker is taking away a\r\n\r\nlot of our Singaporeans'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs,  and this has been addressed by DPM.  I agree with  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  tightened criteria are very important, because  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  profile  of  the  working  Singaporean   has\r\n\r\nimproved.   There  are  more graduates  and  there  are  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   who   are   tertiary-educated,    and    their\r\n\r\nexpectations are very high.  We send the best of our students\r\n\r\nto  Cambridge,  Oxford, Stanford, etc, to study.   They  come\r\n\r\nback,  their  expectations are high and, therefore,  some  of\r\n\r\nthem  will  feel hurt.  Hence, it is timely that  we  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter set of criteria to employ our foreign workers.  What I\r\n\r\nam  saying  is that we must not make Singaporeans  feel  less\r\n\r\nvalued, and I agree with these stricter criteria now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A targeted approach to those who have lost their jobs is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  I think Mr Chiam got it wrong.  I do not know  what\r\n\r\nhe was saying.  But let me say that no amount of rhetoric, no\r\n\r\namount  of great speeches can make a man happy, especially  a\r\n\r\nbreadwinner, when he has got no job.  Therefore, our approach\r\n\r\nmust  be  targeted.  We must go straight to his problem,  and\r\n\r\nhis  problem is that he needs finances to pay his PUB  bills,\r\n\r\nhis  children's education, his transport bills.  That is  why\r\n\r\nwe have to target it.  So we provide the $200 to them.  It is\r\n\r\none  of  the  various ways that the community is helping  all\r\n\r\nthese people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bukit Timah CDC, all the Members of Parliament in\r\n\r\nthat  CDC  are given a package, a certain sum of  money,  and\r\n\r\nthey disburse this fund accordingly so that there is not  too\r\n\r\nmuch  red  tape.   If there is too much red  tape,  the  poor\r\n\r\nfellow  will  be running all over the place to  collect  that\r\n\r\n$200.   But  that is how we have done it at the  constituency\r\n\r\nlevel,  I  am sure not only in my constituency, not  only  in\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah,  but also in all the other constituencies.   So\r\n\r\nwhen  I heard the hon. new Nominated MP calling the CCC \"this\r\n\r\nnew  animal\",  I was a little bit lost.  This  CCC  has  been\r\n\r\naround for years, and the CCC has been the best body to  dish\r\n\r\nout  these funds to the people.  They know the ground.  Well,\r\n\r\nmaybe she is new.  Let us forgive her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I think the call for retraining is\r\n\r\nimportant, because we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  seize  this  opportunity now.  We must  really  go  and\r\n\r\nentice  our workers to go for retraining.  The new  jobs  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be different.  They are no longer the  same.   And\r\n\r\nthis  special \"People for Jobs Traineeship Programme\" is very\r\n\r\ngood.  We must encourage that and I support it very strongly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package, as presented, is more than reasonable, and\r\n\r\nit will take quite a while for it to sink in.  But I am happy\r\n\r\nthat we are able to respond to this current economic downturn\r\n\r\nwith another package so soon after the first package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all in this together. Everyone will have to chip\r\n\r\nin - the unions, the Government and business.  We will accept\r\n\r\nthe  pay cuts, we will overcome, because we have the resolve.\r\n\r\nWe  have the means, we have the political will and we  are  a\r\n\r\nunited people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam called these off-Budget measures a political ploy. Why should we apologise?\r\n\r\nIf it is a political ploy, so what?  I think there is no need\r\n\r\nto apologise that this package is a political ploy.  There is\r\n\r\nan  election coming, but that should not be the reason for us\r\n\r\nnot  doing this, which is necessary and right.  Moreover,  we\r\n\r\nare using the surpluses saved throughout these five years  in\r\n\r\noffice to help Singaporeans ride through this crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.38 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have spoken on this Ministerial  Statement  and\r\n\r\nhave  supported  it.   As it has been a  long  day,  I  shall\r\n\r\nendeavour to be brief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with what Mr Inderjit Singh said,\r\n\r\nquestioning  the predictive ability of MTI.  I  freely  admit\r\n\r\nthat MTI's predictive abilities are limited.  As the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  day  before yesterday, we have been high  by  too  much\r\n\r\nabout as often as we have been low by too much.  But that  is\r\n\r\nthe  nature of our economy.  It is open, it is very dependent\r\n\r\non  external  conditions.  Nobody can be sure which  way  the\r\n\r\nworld economy will go.  Therefore, we cannot tell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  way the Singapore economy will go.  We can guess,  but\r\n\r\nwe cannot be certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, there was a serious\r\n\r\nquestion what would happen to the US economy.  It had  slowed\r\n\r\ndown.  Was it going to be a V, was it going to be a U?  Would\r\n\r\nthe  recovery come back because it is a cyclical problem,  or\r\n\r\nwas  there a deeper structural issue?  And there was a  range\r\n\r\nof  views  amongst  the best analysts -Morgan  Stanley,  J  P\r\n\r\nMorgan,  Goldman  Sachs - all the people who  have  a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest in predicting what is going to happen.  They put out\r\n\r\ntheir  various opinions, arguing persuasively, some  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  recover  quickly, others that it  would  be  a  deeper\r\n\r\nlonger  haul.  And we were quite concerned about the  matter,\r\n\r\nto  the  extent that GIC had a special study done internally,\r\n\r\ncomparing  all  these  different views  and  analysing  them,\r\n\r\nparticularly a view from Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley  who\r\n\r\nwas  the most pessimistic of them all, with good reason,  and\r\n\r\ntrying  to  come to some conclusion which of these views  was\r\n\r\ncorrect.   And after reviewing all of them, we  came  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that there was not going to be a quick pick-up,  a\r\n\r\nV, but neither was it going to be an indefinite recession, an\r\n\r\nL,  but it would be a U.  A paper was deliberated, discussed,\r\n\r\naccepted and adopted as the basis on which GIC operated  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, on which the Government also made its assumptions and\r\n\r\nplans for the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the best opinions can be wrong. If there are other\r\n\r\nopinions outside, we will try and pick them up, but  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  something  which we can tell for certain,  even  without\r\n\r\n11th September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, it looks gloomy now. We cannot say for\r\n\r\nsure  that it will not pick up within 12 months or 18 months.\r\n\r\nThings  will turn.  Nobody can predict when.  But we  are  at\r\n\r\nthis pass.  It is a grave situation.  We have implemented  an\r\n\r\n$11 billion package to deal with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bundle of measures we have had are the tax\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Some hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers have asked for additional enhancements.  For example,\r\n\r\nDr  Vasoo  asked  for  waiver of income tax  on  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits.   I  am happy to say we agree to that  straightaway\r\n\r\nbecause,  in fact, retrenchment benefits are not  subject  to\r\n\r\nincome tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo also asked for rebates on maid levy and\r\n\r\nchildcare.  We have not done this.  The reason is  that  even\r\n\r\nnow  with the maid levy at a constant level - it has not been\r\n\r\nincreased  - the number of maids has been going up.   In  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of a recession, the demand is still there and we  have\r\n\r\njust  left  the levy as it is.  We have decided  that  rather\r\n\r\nthan  help people with levy, childcare or maids specifically,\r\n\r\nit  is  better for us to reduce income taxes, give you a  tax\r\n\r\nrebate, New Singapore Shares.  The money is yours, the assets\r\n\r\nare  yours, the shares are yours, it is up to you  to  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  you  want to do with them.  If you want to  save  them,\r\n\r\nthat is fine.  If you want to invest them, that is fine.   If\r\n\r\nyou want to use them to hire a maid and pay the levy, that is\r\n\r\nfine also.  It is your choice.  You have the freedom.  Let us\r\n\r\nnot  decide for you that it is good that you have a maid,  or\r\n\r\nit  is  good  that  your child goes to childcare  instead  of\r\n\r\nstaying  at  home  with  your parents and  parents-in-law  or\r\n\r\ngrandparents-in-law.   So we have not  gone  for  maid  levy,\r\n\r\nchildcare, specific items.  We have gone for broad approaches\r\n\r\nwhich  leave  people the maximum flexibility to  decide  what\r\n\r\nthey need, what is their most urgent requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen asked for landlords to be compelled to\r\n\r\npass on their property tax savings to their tenants.  This is\r\n\r\nan  old issue which we have looked at many times because,  on\r\n\r\nprevious  Budgets, we have also had property tax rebates  and\r\n\r\nwe  have  also  wanted it to go through to the tenants.   And\r\n\r\nwhile  we  can do it for JTC, HDB and Government tenants,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not been able to do it for the private sector.  We have\r\n\r\ndecided  it  is  not  wise to do it for  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nbecause  the tenancy agreement is a private contract  between\r\n\r\nthe  landlord  and the tenant.  They settle the  terms,  they\r\n\r\nsettle  the  price.  If the terms are not right,  either  the\r\n\r\nlandlord will kick the tenant out, or the tenant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  quit  and  go  somewhere else.  And  the  next  tenancy\r\n\r\nagreement, which is signed, will take into account the newer,\r\n\r\nlower  property  tax  and the newer,  more  relaxed  property\r\n\r\nmarket.   So we have not compelled it.  Given a soft property\r\n\r\nmarket, there will be pressure on the landlord to pass it  on\r\n\r\nanyway  because if he did not pass some of it on, the tenants\r\n\r\nwill just go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the biggest question on tax which many MPs\r\n\r\nraised  -  Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr  Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan  and Mr Lew Syn Pau - is why not reduce GST.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  money.  With a stroke of the pen, you can waive  and\r\n\r\ndistribute  largesse all around.  It is precisely  the  wrong\r\n\r\nthing  to do.  We want to achieve a certain objective with  a\r\n\r\ncertain budget.  The Government still needs money.  I  cannot\r\n\r\njust  forgive all taxes this year.  The tax has to come  from\r\n\r\nsomewhere.   What  is the least bad tax?  There  is  no  such\r\n\r\nthing  as  a  good  tax because all taxes  are  bad.   Nobody\r\n\r\nvolunteers to pay tax but, of all the taxes we have, I  think\r\n\r\nthe least bad tax is the GST.  It is broad-based, it does not\r\n\r\nweigh  heavily  on the poor or the rich; it  does  not  weigh\r\n\r\nheavily on any particular good; it does not weigh heavily  on\r\n\r\nany  particular  group of companies.  It is uniformly  spread\r\n\r\nover the whole economy and its revenues can be used for other\r\n\r\nworthy purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to achieve a specific objective, I would say,\r\n\r\nraise  money from the GST which is already there and we  will\r\n\r\nuse  that  to  achieve our objective, reduce  business  cost,\r\n\r\nproperty tax, incentivise businesses to profit, corporate tax\r\n\r\nrebate, incentivise individuals and help them have some money\r\n\r\nin  their  pockets, personal tax rebates,  asset  share  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, lower income groups, New Singapore Shares  -  I\r\n\r\nuse  the money, I distribute that.  It is $11 billion.   What\r\n\r\nshould  this $11 billion consist of?  I think we  are  better\r\n\r\noff  having it consists of these specific items, each with  a\r\n\r\nparticular  purpose, rather than reducing the GST which  just\r\n\r\ndistributes money all round without solving any problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I go on to assistance to local enterprises. There\r\n\r\nare  three points.  One, Government should ask banks  not  to\r\n\r\nrecall loans, not to panic, reduce interest rates, mortgages.\r\n\r\nMr  Leong Horn Kee said to keep the umbrella open and  others\r\n\r\nalso  would  like, maybe, bigger umbrellas.  The  very  brief\r\n\r\nanswer is that interest rates are already coming down and you\r\n\r\ncan see the banks reducing their prime rates.  The more basic\r\n\r\nanswer  is  that  if  the Government  advises  banks  not  to\r\n\r\nforeclose   on  their  loans,  to  forebear,  to  lend   more\r\n\r\ngenerously   in  a  downturn,  the  Government  takes   moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility, and if something goes wrong  with  the  bank,\r\n\r\nthen the Government has to answer for it.  The bank will come\r\n\r\nto  the  Government to say, \"I did this.  Now my  loans  have\r\n\r\nturned  bad, you have to bail me out.\"  And that  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious moral hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan said that banks have a national duty\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have  a precious licence.   Firstly,  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  competition  into the  banking  sector  so  these\r\n\r\nlicences are not that scarce.  There are many banks which are\r\n\r\ncompeting  for  the business.  Secondly, the  first  national\r\n\r\nduty  of the bank is not to run into trouble and the way  not\r\n\r\nto  run into trouble, is to make prudent decisions, long-term\r\n\r\ndecisions, but careful ones, hard-headed decisions, assessing\r\n\r\nwhich company is viable and should have its loan extended  or\r\n\r\nrescheduled; which company is not viable, and they better cut\r\n\r\nlosses.   And the shrewd banker is the one who knows  how  to\r\n\r\ncut his losses with a bad customer, but knows how to extend a\r\n\r\nline  and  keep his good customers through an  upturn  and  a\r\n\r\ndownturn.   Some  of our Singapore bankers  are  very  shrewd\r\n\r\nbankers.   Those  of  you who are in the business  will  know\r\n\r\nwhich  are  the shrewdest ones and it shows in  their  bottom\r\n\r\nlines.   I  am  not  a commercial banker and  it  is  not  my\r\n\r\nbusiness to go and tell them whom to lend money to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the SME bank and SME lending terms, in general, I\r\n\r\nhave  a lot of sympathy for the idea that SMEs ought to  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  funds and we should have schemes which will  help\r\n\r\nthem where they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  specific  problems, because they do not  have  a  track\r\n\r\nrecord,  where they cannot borrow because they  do  not  have\r\n\r\nability to prepare the documentation and their justification,\r\n\r\nbut  they  have good business ideas and they should  proceed.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think  setting up a SME bank is  not  a  very  viable\r\n\r\nproposition  because in this day and age, to be a  bank,  you\r\n\r\nhave to be a big bank.  Unless you are a very large bank, you\r\n\r\nare  not able to muster that ability and capability to assess\r\n\r\ncustomers,  to have the economies of scale to lend,  even  to\r\n\r\nSMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the biggest SME lenders in Singapore are big\r\n\r\nbanks,  including foreign banks, and amongst the local  banks\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not small, there are a few who have a  reputation\r\n\r\nfor having a SME clientele.  I do not think it is the size of\r\n\r\nthe  bank which is the problem.  It is the orientation of the\r\n\r\nbank,  whether it is focused on lending this sector, and  has\r\n\r\npeople who understand how this sector works, and can tell who\r\n\r\nis  a  promising entrepreneur and who is just telling a  good\r\n\r\nstory;  or  whether it is not or is unable  to  have  a  feel\r\n\r\nbecause the staff do not speak Teochew, or maybe they just do\r\n\r\nnot  know how the business culture works.  I do not think the\r\n\r\nSME  bank  is a solution.  What we have done with  the  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Finance Scheme plus the micro loans, plus the loan\r\n\r\ninsurance, I think, will help significantly.  The  last  time\r\n\r\nwe  had a problem in 1998, we had expanded these loans.  That\r\n\r\nalready  made a considerable difference.  This time,  we  are\r\n\r\nloosening  the terms further.  Let us see how it  works  out.\r\n\r\nIf we need to, we can do some more later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on local enterprises. Dr Jennifer Lee asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  PWD  Corporation moratorium taking away  projects\r\n\r\nfrom  the private sector.  I think she does not have to worry\r\n\r\nbecause   out   of   $3.5   billion  worth   of   accelerated\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  projects, only about $100  million  worth  of\r\n\r\ncontracts  will  go to PWD Corporation under the  moratorium.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have to abide by the moratorium because  that  is  a\r\n\r\nlegal  obligation.   If  you break that,  then  you  have  to\r\n\r\ncompensate PWD Corporation and apart from the expense of  it,\r\n\r\nit is right that once we have made a commitment, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  stick by that commitment and not lightly  change  it.\r\n\r\nThere are enough jobs to go around.  PWD Corporation is now a\r\n\r\nprivate  company  - $3.5 billion minus $100 million  is  $3.4\r\n\r\nbillion  -  I  think  there  is enough  gravy.   Anyway,  PWD\r\n\r\nCorporation  is  not  a construction  firm.   It  is  only  a\r\n\r\nconsultancy   firm.   Even  if  PWD  Corporation   does   the\r\n\r\nconsultancy,  the actual construction will be  done  by  many\r\n\r\nother players in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, land-related measures. Mr Inderjit Singh asked\r\n\r\nabout  permanent cost reduction for the future, for  example,\r\n\r\non  industrial land because the rebate is temporary and  this\r\n\r\nis  a  longer term problem.  He has a point because, in fact,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  longer  term  problem, because  our  companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are competing against companies which are operating\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and their land prices are going\r\n\r\nto  be lower than ours for a long time to come, and not  just\r\n\r\nfor  these  next one or two years.  So, what do  we  do?   We\r\n\r\ncould  adjust  our industrial land prices down  and  keep  it\r\n\r\nthere for sometime.  That is possible.  But in the long-term,\r\n\r\nit  is not a complete answer because, even if you leave  your\r\n\r\nindustrial land prices at two-thirds of where they are today,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  land in other parts of Asia  which  will  be\r\n\r\ncheaper.   We  cannot match them on price, dollar-for-dollar.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have to do is to match them overall,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nland,  capabilities,  manpower,  skills,  infrastructure  and\r\n\r\noffer  a  value proposition which makes sense for  people  to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore and invest in Singapore.  Even then, it  is\r\n\r\nuphill because the Chinese are building up their capabilities\r\n\r\nconsiderably.  You have heard BG George Yeo talk  about  this\r\n\r\nand  many  of you have visited and seen it too.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nreassess our overall strategies and decide what we can do  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, and if manufacturing possibilities  are  going\r\n\r\nto be more constrained now, what we can do in services, which\r\n\r\nis  the many different types of service industries.  There is\r\n\r\nno  quick  answer.  I do not have a solution  today.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  the Government is studying  and  will  take\r\n\r\nseveral months to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Chiam See Tong also asked\r\n\r\nwhether removing anti-speculative measures will lead to  sky-rocketing   property  prices.   I  think   in   the   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances, that is not likely.  The market is  down.   If\r\n\r\nyou  get  what  the  stock market people  call  \"a  dead  cat\r\n\r\nbounce\",  which means it hits the ground, it bounces  up  and\r\n\r\nfalls  dead  again, that will already be a slight improvement\r\n\r\nfrom where you are.  At some stage, the mood will change  and\r\n\r\nthe  market will take off again.  At that point, we will deal\r\n\r\nwith  that  situation.  We have been through the  cycle  many\r\n\r\ntimes.   I was the one in 1996 who announced the pricking  of\r\n\r\nthe  bubble and in 1998, we had to reverse that and  here  we\r\n\r\nare  reversing  the  last of it.  It will  not  be  the  last\r\n\r\nadjustment  but  you  cannot not do anything  throughout  the\r\n\r\ncycle.   There are adjustments we can make, even though  they\r\n\r\nare not fully effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether we need the 80% rule and\r\n\r\nwhether we can leave it to the market.  The answer is that we\r\n\r\nwould  like to leave things to the market as much as possible\r\n\r\nbut  most countries have a restriction on the degree to which\r\n\r\nyou can lend against property for mortgage loans.  There is a\r\n\r\nreason  for this because, if you lend 100%, the risk  to  the\r\n\r\nbank  goes up.  And if there is a downturn, first, the  buyer\r\n\r\nhas  less equity put in, he has not put his own cash in,  the\r\n\r\nchances  of his saying, \"Let's default.  I will lose nothing.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the bank's money anyway.\" will be greater.  It is  no\r\n\r\nloss, I buy a property, I borrow 100%;  if the value goes up,\r\n\r\nI  collect  the  upside, if the value  goes  down,  the  bank\r\n\r\ncarries the can.  We want him to have 20% standing there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if, in fact, the value goes down and the bank\r\n\r\ndoes  carry  the can with the 20% buffer, the bank  has  some\r\n\r\ncomfort that it will be able to recover the loan.  From  MAS'\r\n\r\npoint of view, from the banking system's point of view,  that\r\n\r\nis  very important.  So I think there is a reason for the 80%\r\n\r\nlimit,  which is valid in an up-cycle as well as in  a  down-cycle,  and  we should not change it just to deal  with  this\r\n\r\ntemporary problem.  There is more to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  issue  than  what  I  have explained.   It  is  quite  a\r\n\r\ncomplicated  matter.   The  developers  have  discussed  this\r\n\r\nseveral times with MAS and MAS will be putting out a somewhat\r\n\r\nfuller  reply and you can study that, and we can  discuss  it\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, acceleration of infrastructure projects. Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn Kee asked for pump priming to include soft projects  for\r\n\r\nlocal companies.  The answer is that we already contract  out\r\n\r\nsoft contracts to the private sector.  For example, the civil\r\n\r\nservice  needs training and development programmes and  these\r\n\r\nare  open  to  competition by all service providers  and  the\r\n\r\nCivil Service College has to compete for the training dollar.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not automatically get their contract, they have  to\r\n\r\ncompete.  They are on a self-funding basis and they  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  better  than  the other suppliers in  order  to  get  the\r\n\r\ncontract.    Furthermore,   the  accelerated   infrastructure\r\n\r\nprojects  already  include soft IT  projects,  like  software\r\n\r\ndevelopment for schools and for hospitals; like the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health's  cancer  registry and the  central  immunisation\r\n\r\nregistry.  These will be open for bidding by local companies.\r\n\r\nWe have included some soft projects there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam wanted pump priming to also include schools. I\r\n\r\nsympathise  with that but, in fact, in terms of  schools,  we\r\n\r\nare already building as many as we need and as many as we can\r\n\r\nbuild.   The  Ministry of Education has  a  regular  planning\r\n\r\npipeline.   The  Fifth  Secondary School Building  Programme,\r\n\r\nwith  $332  million to build seven or eight  new  schools  by\r\n\r\n2005, has started, but no school has been completed yet.   So\r\n\r\nthat is going full steam ahead.  Then, there is the Fifth  JC\r\n\r\nBuilding Programme, which is $139 million, starting in  2002,\r\n\r\nto build three JCs by 2006.  These had already started before\r\n\r\nthis  package, but what is in this package is an acceleration\r\n\r\nof  the  construction of the regional ITE campus.   We  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  that education is an area where it makes sense  to\r\n\r\nbring forward infrastructure construction, and we are pushing\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, queries on employment assistance. Mr Hawazi asked\r\n\r\nhow many older retrenched professionals and executives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  benefit from the People for Jobs Traineeship Programme.\r\n\r\nMOM's  estimate is that the $200 million will support  20,000\r\n\r\nplaces  and, of these, about one-third will go to  retrenched\r\n\r\nprofessionals and executives.  All of them are  meant  to  be\r\n\r\nfor  older workers, if you interpret \"older\" to mean  40  and\r\n\r\nabove.   Of  these older workers, we hope one-third  will  be\r\n\r\nretrenched  professionals and executives, but MOM  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsure  because  we are ramping up the programme from  quite  a\r\n\r\nsmall  pilot project.  There is a lot of interest.   We  will\r\n\r\npush hard to encourage employers to take it.  And I hope  the\r\n\r\nunions  will  also  push from their side to  encourage  their\r\n\r\nunion members to take it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema asked whether training programmes were\r\n\r\neffective in helping retrenched workers.  Mr Chiam See  Tong,\r\n\r\nmore  pungently,  asked  whether retrenched  programmes  were\r\n\r\ndoing  any  good.  According to an MOM and NTUC  survey  last\r\n\r\nyear,  three out of four retrenched workers who took up full-time SRP training were able to secure re-employment within 3-6  months  after  their training.  Mendaki did  a  survey  of\r\n\r\nretrenched workers whom they had sponsored for full-time  SRP\r\n\r\ntraining,  and 70% were re-employed within three months.   In\r\n\r\nthis  downturn, it will take longer.  Jobs are harder to come\r\n\r\nby.   But  at least the results are promising and I think  we\r\n\r\nshould press on with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we come to foreign talents. Mr Simon Tay says\r\n\r\nthat  the employment pass criterion of $2,500, which is about\r\n\r\nthe  starting salary for graduates, may be too low.  I  think\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are looking for is a cut off which is not too  low,\r\n\r\nbut  really we are not looking to price the foreign graduates\r\n\r\nout  of  the market.  We want foreign graduates of a  certain\r\n\r\nquality,  and the $2,500 is really an indication of the  kind\r\n\r\nof graduate we are bringing in and also the kind of job which\r\n\r\nthe  foreigner  is doing.  We found out that  there  was  one\r\n\r\nemployer  who had several employment pass holders  at  $2,000\r\n\r\nwashing  dishes  and plates.  I do not think  he  was  really\r\n\r\npaying  $2,000.  The employer said that he was paying  $2,000\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not know what else the foreign worker might  have\r\n\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing.  But if an employer is really paying $2,500, then I do\r\n\r\nnot think the foreign worker is a bottle or dish washer.   He\r\n\r\nwill be doing a proper job as a proper professional.  And the\r\n\r\nrequirement  is  not  just the salary  but  that  he  has  an\r\n\r\nacceptable degree.  So what we are looking for is the quality\r\n\r\nof the person who comes in, and even if the price is somewhat\r\n\r\nlower,  he  makes a contribution and he adds to  the  mix  of\r\n\r\npeople  available in Singapore to be employed.   And  if  you\r\n\r\nexclude them, you will be worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang says:</b> \"Are these really talents? Why\r\n\r\ndon't  we  exclude them?\"  I read that this was  one  of  the\r\n\r\nplanks of his \"new poor\" manifesto.  So he must be trying  to\r\n\r\nwarm up, thinking that the general elections are coming.  Let\r\n\r\nme  answer  quite directly like this.  If you  kick  out  the\r\n\r\nforeigner, it does not follow that the local will get the job\r\n\r\nfor  more pay.  The company may go.  This year, EDB is hoping\r\n\r\nto   bring   in  $9  billion  of  foreign  direct  investment\r\n\r\ncommitments,  almost  as  much as we  are  spending  in  this\r\n\r\npackage.  It will create 15,000 manufacturing jobs and  7,000\r\n\r\nservice  jobs.   One-third of those  manufacturing  jobs  are\r\n\r\nforeign, somewhat less than that in service, but let  us  say\r\n\r\none-third  of these jobs are foreign.  So 22,000 jobs,  about\r\n\r\none-third foreign, means 7,000 foreign workers.  Do you think\r\n\r\nthat if we said \"thou shall not employ foreign workers\",  EDB\r\n\r\nwill  collect $9 billion of foreign direct investments?  Will\r\n\r\nthey  come?   Or  will they say, \"Thank you very  much.   You\r\n\r\ndon't allow me to recruit foreign workers in Singapore.  I am\r\n\r\noff.   I'll  go to China.  I can get any number of workers  I\r\n\r\nwant.   I  can go to Mexico.  I can try Vietnam.    They  are\r\n\r\nopening  up.\"  Will they come to Singapore?  Because  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have 7,000-odd foreign workers come in with  these\r\n\r\ninvestments,  therefore we are going to create  about  15,000\r\n\r\nmore new jobs for Singaporeans, through EDB's efforts. So the\r\n\r\nforeigners have actually created jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take 7,000 foreigners who are already in\r\n\r\nSingapore and we say, \"you go home.\"  And tell the employers,\r\n\r\n\"You now replace them with Singaporeans  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengineers,  architects, technicians.\"  Will  they?   Or  will\r\n\r\nthey  not  be  off somewhere else, just as the new  companies\r\n\r\nwill be off somewhere else?  So it is quite plausible, it  is\r\n\r\nvery convincing and very persuasive to make this argument  to\r\n\r\nsay  all this is against Singaporean interests, and it sounds\r\n\r\neven  better  in  Teochew.  But if you sit  down  coolly  and\r\n\r\nanalyse it, what we are protecting are Singaporeans.  What we\r\n\r\nmust  manage  is how to use the foreign workers, the  foreign\r\n\r\nprofessionals and the foreign talent to maximum advantage for\r\n\r\nSingapore, and that is what we are trying to do when we raise\r\n\r\nthe  cut  off for the employment pass to $2,500, and when  we\r\n\r\ntighten  up the requirements for skilled work permit  holders\r\n\r\nwho pay lower levy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, help for the lower income and unemployment. Mr\r\n\r\nAng  Mong  Seng and Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked for  extension  of\r\n\r\nUtilities  Save to private property dwellers and S&C  rebates\r\n\r\nand Utilities Save to executive flats, because it stops at 5-room.  I think we should look at the package in totality.  We\r\n\r\nhave  balanced the package.  For the lower income groups,  we\r\n\r\nhave  Utilities  Save.  We have got the New Singapore  Shares\r\n\r\nweighted heavily towards the lower income groups, which means\r\n\r\nthat as you go up to bigger flats, which usually means higher\r\n\r\nincomes  and  higher wealth, the share from this distribution\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be less.  But at the same time, we  have  also\r\n\r\ngranted  income tax rebates, and the higher your income,  the\r\n\r\nmore you are paid, the more tax you have paid, the higher the\r\n\r\ntax  rebate  you are going to enjoy.  So it is a bundle.   If\r\n\r\nyou   look  at  just one side and say, \"Can I have  Utilities\r\n\r\nSave?\", then the 3-roomer will say, \"How about giving me  the\r\n\r\ntax  rebate too?  I didn't pay any tax, but never mind,  just\r\n\r\ngive  me the rebate.\"  So it has to be a bundle, and we  have\r\n\r\ntried to balance the package.  In this case, even though  the\r\n\r\nExecutive flats, the 5-roomers and private property owners do\r\n\r\nnot get very much under the Utilities Save, the Energy Market\r\n\r\nAuthority   intends  to  lower  the  wholesale   prices   for\r\n\r\nelectricity in January.  Electricity prices will  come  down,\r\n\r\nand that will flow through to all the households.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  generally speaking, the bigger households  consume  more\r\n\r\nelectricity.  So if we take it as a bundle, I think  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen fair to everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong asked why charge so much for utilities\r\n\r\nthat there is a need to give rebates.  The answer is that our\r\n\r\nutilities  charges have really gone up and down  with  energy\r\n\r\nprices.  Energy prices have gone up, they are followed up  to\r\n\r\nrecover  the  cost  of the energy.  Energy prices  have  come\r\n\r\ndown,  they  have  gone down to pass on the benefits  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumers.   The  other components of energy  cost  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged  in  Singapore  -   the wage  cost,  financing  cost,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  capital cost.  In fact, they  have  gradually\r\n\r\ncome down.  And as we have corporatised PUB, which became the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power, and now it has become different  generating\r\n\r\ncompanies,   we  have  been  able  to  squeeze   productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements  out  of  Singapore  Power,  which   have   been\r\n\r\nsignificant, because of the very considerable efforts of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and the very close cooperation they have  enjoyed\r\n\r\nwith  the unions in Singapore Power.  And what you are seeing\r\n\r\nin rebates now really are the benefits of the union's and the\r\n\r\nmanagement's   efforts  being  passed  on   to   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nincluding  those who live in Potong Pasir.   So  rather  than\r\n\r\nasking why they were so high before, I think Mr  Chiam should\r\n\r\nbe  grateful  that through the close working relationship  of\r\n\r\nmanagement and unions, we have been able to derive  something\r\n\r\ngood  which we are now sharing with Singaporeans in a  moment\r\n\r\nof need.  Of course, if he does not want it, that can also be\r\n\r\narranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Dr Vasoo asked for more generous EDRS, so did Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia  Khiang.   Generally, there is a request for  more.\r\n\r\nAgain,  more  has to be in the context of the whole  package.\r\n\r\nWe  have many schemes to look after the people.   If you  are\r\n\r\nunemployed, we help you to find a new job, we help you to  be\r\n\r\nretrained for a new job.  If you do get a new job, we subvent\r\n\r\nhalf  your salary for six months, up to $2,000.  We try  very\r\n\r\nhard  to  get  you  in a place where you are  productive  and\r\n\r\nworking, and I think that will work for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion  of Singaporeans.  For a small  proportion,\r\n\r\ndespite everything we do, they will have a problem.   And  if\r\n\r\nall  our  other welfare schemes do not work  -  we have  many\r\n\r\nwelfare  schemes, including health schemes,  rental  schemes,\r\n\r\neducation  schemes   -   then, finally,  comes  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDownturn  Relief Scheme, and we make an arrangement  to  help\r\n\r\nyou  tide over a difficult spot.  So I think you have to  see\r\n\r\nthe  whole  scheme in perspective, rather  than  take  a  $11\r\n\r\nbillion project, pull out one small component and say this is\r\n\r\ntoo  small.  But you must look at the elephant in  the  face,\r\n\r\nyou must not just look at the hair on the tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have the design about right. We have put $20\r\n\r\nmillion  aside.  We have Mr Chan Soo Sen in charge.  He  will\r\n\r\ndole it out to the CCCs according to their need, including to\r\n\r\nCCCs  in opposition wards if they establish their need.   And\r\n\r\nfrom  our  experience, operating in the CCCs, making  grants,\r\n\r\nassessing  cases, we think that we will be able to work  this\r\n\r\nscheme  and  this will make a significant difference  on  the\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, New Singapore Shares. Ms Braema talked about\r\n\r\nreaching  out to the elderly in welfare homes.   Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee  talked  about  Singaporeans  without  CPF  accounts    - homemakers.   I  think  she  means mostly  housewives  and  I\r\n\r\nsuppose a few husbands.  Mr Simon Tay says, \"why tie this  to\r\n\r\nCPF   Top-ups  when  this  whole  arrangement  has  not  been\r\n\r\nsatisfactory?\"  I think it has not been shown that this whole\r\n\r\narrangement is not satisfactory.  What we want to  do  is  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  have some participation on the part of  the  person\r\n\r\nreceiving  the  New Singapore Shares.  It is not  just  manna\r\n\r\nfrom  heaven, you look up and something good falls into  your\r\n\r\nlap.   We  want you to do something.  And what are we  asking\r\n\r\nyou  to  do?  Pay $50 into your own CPF account,  just  as  a\r\n\r\ntoken that you are still here, you are participating, and you\r\n\r\nwant  the  shares.   If you are working, it is  automatically\r\n\r\ndone.   If  you have already participated in the CPF  Top-up,\r\n\r\nwe  will treat it as done, because you have already put  some\r\n\r\nmoney in.  If you have not, we will give you till the end  of\r\n\r\nthe year, and you top-up $50, and we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  give you the New Singapore Shares.  It is your $50  and\r\n\r\nlater on you can withdraw it, but we want that participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the CPF Top-up the last time, I think there were\r\n\r\nabout 200,000 accounts which did not top-up.  Does that  mean\r\n\r\nit  has  failed  or  does  that mean  we  have  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ndiscriminating?  If the person did not make the effort to top-up,  should I give him a CPF Top-up?  Should I give  him  the\r\n\r\nshares?   If  it  is an old person in an old  folks  home  or\r\n\r\nwelfare  home, or if she is a housewife who is not  familiar,\r\n\r\nthen  I think we should make the effort.  We should go, visit\r\n\r\nand  explain  to them, persuade them.  If they cannot  afford\r\n\r\nthe $50, I think somewhere, somebody can afford the $50, help\r\n\r\nthem,  pay  it  in, collect their due share  as  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen.  Similarly, with housewives.  If necessary, we  will\r\n\r\ngo   door   to  door.   In  fact,  all  the  CCCs,  all   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies, are presently in the process of  doing  this.\r\n\r\nDespite  this, if you still do not want to put $50  in,  then\r\n\r\nshould I give you the shares?  I think that they should  stay\r\n\r\nin  a  pool and next time I make a distribution, those people\r\n\r\nwho  do  participate  and put $50 in,  they  should  get  the\r\n\r\nshares.   So  I do not think that just because not  everybody\r\n\r\nhas topped up, that means it was a waste of time on the other\r\n\r\nhand.   In  fact,  you  can  make a  contrary  argument  that\r\n\r\neverybody did it anyway, so there was no point doing  it.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is  also not a valid argument, but  there  is  a\r\n\r\nreason why we want the $50 participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, measures relating to wage cost. Several Members\r\n\r\ntalked  about  using  CPF - Mr Leong Horn  Kee,  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh, Mr Iswaran.  Of course, they all qualify that the  CPF\r\n\r\nis  to  be  used  only in extremis, but I notice  that  their\r\n\r\nvarious  extremes  are all different.  So  just  putting  the\r\n\r\nideas  together,  there are already three or  four  different\r\n\r\ncircumstances in which you would withdraw the CPF.   I  would\r\n\r\nsay, not rule out, but in extremis.  Not extremis under their\r\n\r\ndefinitions and not extreme yet, but in a difficult situation\r\n\r\nit  is  something which we can consider.  I  would  be  quite\r\n\r\nreluctant because it has taken us a long time to build up the\r\n\r\nCPF,  to  reach  40%, to have employers accept  it,  to  have\r\n\r\nworkers used to it, to have a nestegg for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyour  retirement, and when you retire, to be quite  sure  you\r\n\r\nhave  the Special Account which will be there and that  gives\r\n\r\nyou $40,000 in cash or thereabouts, $40,000 in the house, and\r\n\r\nat  least see you through absolute bare requirements.  If you\r\n\r\ntake  it  out now, it is very fast to take down, it  is  very\r\n\r\nslow to build back up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985/86, we cut the CPF 10 percentage points. It\r\n\r\ntook  us into the early 1990s to restore it - seven to  eight\r\n\r\nyears.   This time we cut in 1999, we intended to restore  it\r\n\r\nquickly,  faster  than last time, we reached  six  percentage\r\n\r\npoints, four more to go, now our timetable has been derailed.\r\n\r\nIt  will take us a long time to build this back up again.  So\r\n\r\nI  would not lightly touch this.  On the other hand, I  would\r\n\r\nnot say an absolute impossible.  Never say never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, other issues have been raised by Members. Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee asked for confirmation that the $11 billion is\r\n\r\nalready  accounted for and will not come from  the  reserves.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have  explained in my main statement, the  accumulated\r\n\r\nsurpluses  since this Government took office can finance  the\r\n\r\nwhole   package.   But  after  the  General  Election,  these\r\n\r\naccumulated  reserves  will  be  locked  away  and  the   new\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be starting from scratch and they  will  not\r\n\r\nhave accumulated surpluses.  If by then the economy is strong\r\n\r\nand  the  Government revenues are healthy,  they  might  have\r\n\r\nenough  to fund the package.  If not, then they will have  to\r\n\r\nask   the  President's  permission  to  draw  down  protected\r\n\r\nreserves  to fund the package.  I think we cross that  bridge\r\n\r\nwhen it comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Dr Vasoo and Mr Simon Tay talked about\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  longer  term  strategies  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nchallenges - unemployment, competitiveness, services, and  so\r\n\r\non.   They are quite right.  This is something which  we  are\r\n\r\nworking  on  and I have explained this.  It is not  a  simple\r\n\r\nmatter.   Because Dr Wang Kai Yuen said, \"Well,  we  need  to\r\n\r\narticulate some vision, MNCs to Singapore companies, GLCs  to\r\n\r\nsmall and medium\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenterprises.\"  Sounds good.  And, in fact, not wrong  overall\r\n\r\nas  a  direction, but to go beyond that slogan, to make it  a\r\n\r\nstrategy, to make it work, what are these local companies and\r\n\r\nSMEs going to do?  They are going to do handicraft?  How  are\r\n\r\nthey  going to make a living?  What is this enterprise  going\r\n\r\nto venture into?  These are not easy questions to answer.  If\r\n\r\nyou  took a laissez-faire approach, you would say, just  open\r\n\r\nup, let a hundred flowers bloom, and some of them will become\r\n\r\nbeautiful.   But  in the real world, sometimes  when  you  do\r\n\r\nthat,  you get a lot of weeds.  Sometimes when you  do  that,\r\n\r\nthe  garden does not grow, and you have to add fertiliser and\r\n\r\nhelp  it  to grow, and then see which one succeeds  and  then\r\n\r\npush  those.   We  are investing in biotechnology,  molecular\r\n\r\nbiology.  We are talking about promoting services.  These are\r\n\r\ngeneral  ideas.  Biotechnology, more needs to be worked  out;\r\n\r\nservices,   we   have  done  specific  items  like   banking,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications; others, we are studying.  But they do not\r\n\r\nlend  themselves to glib answers because services are such  a\r\n\r\ndiverse  field,  so many different types of  activities  that\r\n\r\nthere is no single strategy which would work for all of  them\r\n\r\nand  there  are  different complications  which  we  have  to\r\n\r\naccount  for each of the different services we might promote.\r\n\r\nSo these are things which we are working on.  But their point\r\n\r\nthat today we have only dealt with the short-term package and\r\n\r\nthe long-term strategies, which we still have to worry about,\r\n\r\nthat point is well taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I end with Dr Tan Cheng Bock who said, \"No need to\r\n\r\nfear.\"   And  I  think that is right.  We have resources.   I\r\n\r\nthink we have a plan to deal with this.  We have the cohesion\r\n\r\nand  the  resilience  with this.  We know  it  is  a  serious\r\n\r\nsituation.  We have been through such problems before, and we\r\n\r\ncan  manage.   There  is  no cure for  flu,  Mr  Chiam  says.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  it will take time for this downturn to work  through\r\n\r\nand  meanwhile, what you can do is to stay warm,  look  after\r\n\r\nyourselves and try not to make things worse.  If it  is  flu,\r\n\r\nyou drink chicken soup.  But today this package is a lot more\r\n\r\nthan chicken soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to let these work through. You cannot\r\n\r\nrestore the economy to health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  Beyond that, it depends on what we do.  It depends\r\n\r\non  whether  we  can  get  strategies  which  will  work  and\r\n\r\nimplement  them.  And it depends on your having a team  which\r\n\r\nwill  work out strategies and make them work for you and with\r\n\r\nyou.   Mr Chiam says apropos the New Singapore Shares  (NSS),\r\n\r\nthis is vote buying - receiver will be beholden to the giver.\r\n\r\nI  would  say, do not just be beholden to the giver  but  ask\r\n\r\nwhat  is  it  which has enabled the Singapore  Government  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  the surpluses, to have the savings tucked away,  to\r\n\r\nbe   able   in  this  situation  to  render  this   help   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, which is not insubstantial, not  $200,  but  if\r\n\r\nyou  work it out by the time the whole package comes  in  and\r\n\r\nyou have the NSS, it is $2,000-$3,000 per household, and more\r\n\r\nthan that at the lower end.  Which government does that?  Why\r\n\r\nis this Government able to do that?  And how can we make sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore Government continues to be  able  to  do\r\n\r\nthat?   It  is our job to make sure of that, and  I  hope  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam and Mr Low Thia Khiang will help us.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can I seek clarifications, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify, first of\r\n\r\nall,  that I did not say that we should stop allowing foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  to come in altogether.  What I am saying is  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to define what do we mean by \"talent\" and how does  the\r\n\r\npolicy   itself   not  threaten  the  jobs  of  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially at this point in time.  Otherwise, it is going  to\r\n\r\nalienate a lot of people.  From the reply of the DPM, he said\r\n\r\nthat EDB is going to have $9 billion FDI and we will bring in\r\n\r\nprobably two-thirds of the total employment created by  these\r\n\r\ncompanies and one-third will be foreign talents.   If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot allow these companies in with foreign employees, they may\r\n\r\ndecide to go somewhere else, eg, China.  And it seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  allowing  foreign workers to be employed by  companies,\r\n\r\nwhich  are coming here to invest, seems to be the only factor\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  able to attract investments.  So what  is  the\r\n\r\nfactor which actually attracts investors to invest here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  how important is the policy of foreign talent?  Can  the\r\n\r\nDPM explain to us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Government has decided to\r\n\r\ntighten  the issuance of employment pass and also  raise  the\r\n\r\nceiling from $2,000 to $2,500.  But there is a problem.  Even\r\n\r\nwithout  raising it, there is this existing  problem.   While\r\n\r\nyou  set a target to say that to qualify for employment pass,\r\n\r\na person must be paid, let us say, $2,000 or even $1,500, how\r\n\r\ndo  you  make sure that an employer will not have  a  private\r\n\r\nagreement  with  a  worker?  Instead of  paying  $1,500,  the\r\n\r\nemployer  pays his worker $1,000 or $800 and makes  him  wash\r\n\r\ndishes.  This was what the DPM said.  How do you prevent that\r\n\r\nfrom happening?  Because I think that has been happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is: how do you also make sure that\r\n\r\nemployment  pass  holders come in for the  specific  jobs  of\r\n\r\nemployment and they do not go into some other areas or  part-time  jobs  or  take  up jobs in other sectors  as  well  and\r\n\r\ncompete  with  other Singaporeans?  These are real  concerns,\r\n\r\nespecially at this point in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I have in my speech said that perhaps the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should actually also look at cost of living,  how\r\n\r\nto  cut  the  cost  of  living of  Singaporeans  during  this\r\n\r\ndownturn.  Besides the help, what about the cost of living?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope DPM will touch on these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I establish\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Low Thia Khiang supports the policy of bringing  in\r\n\r\nforeign  talent to Singapore, whatever these other qualms  he\r\n\r\nmay  have  about  specific implementation problems?   But  he\r\n\r\nsupports  the idea that we need foreign talent and we  should\r\n\r\nbring them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  the need to bring in foreign talent.  I have made  this\r\n\r\nquite  clear  in  my speech.  I said we understand  it.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is: how do you go about it and does the policy  not\r\n\r\nin  a way threaten and alienate Singaporeans, and how do  you\r\n\r\njustify the need?  That is another point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I have made my explanation and I\r\n\r\nasked him whether he believes me that if you do not allow  in\r\n\r\nforeign workers in a reasonable proportion, EDB will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  bring investments in.  Does that mean that  we  are\r\n\r\ndependent  on foreigners?  To some extent, yes.  But  if  you\r\n\r\nlook  at  the City of London, which is the greatest financial\r\n\r\ncentre  in  the world, there are very few Englishmen  working\r\n\r\nthere.   There  are  Japanese,  Koreans,  French,  Americans,\r\n\r\nAustralians, a few Englishmen, Scotsmen.  So if you said  you\r\n\r\nwanted  only  Singaporeans to be employed, can you  become  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre?  You go to New York.  You walk  along  the\r\n\r\nstreets  -  all  shapes  and sizes of  human  kind,  colours,\r\n\r\ndresses and languages.  That is why they are a vibrant  great\r\n\r\ncentre,  the  Big Apple.  If you go to Silicon Valley,  there\r\n\r\nare  East Europeans, Israelis, Indians, Koreans, PRC Chinese,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  Japanese.  That is why the Silicon  Valley  is\r\n\r\nthe powerhouse for IT and electronics for the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do we want to become like that or not? We have\r\n\r\npractical problems managing.  I put it at $2,500, he may make\r\n\r\na  side deal with his employer.  I put it at $10,000, he  may\r\n\r\nstill  make a side deal with his employer.  He goes off  duty\r\n\r\nin   the   evening.   Instead  of  going  home  and  watching\r\n\r\ntelevision, he decides to go and wash cars.  Can  I  stop  it\r\n\r\ncompletely?   No.   Can  I police it  and  catch  it  and  do\r\n\r\nsomething about it when we find it?  Yes.  How can we be sure\r\n\r\nthat the person who comes in is not a bottle washer?  We have\r\n\r\nto  assess the quality of his degree, the sort of company  it\r\n\r\nis,  whether it is a reputable company, what sort of jobs the\r\n\r\ncompany claims it is doing, and after that we will visit  the\r\n\r\ncompany once in a while just to make sure whether he is  next\r\n\r\nto  the  bottles being washed or whether he is  sitting  down\r\n\r\nreally  designing something in front of a screen.  There  are\r\n\r\nno  cast  iron  solutions to this.  This is  something  which\r\n\r\nevery  country has to deal with, even countries which totally\r\n\r\nshut   out  foreign  workers,  like  Japan.   And  they  have\r\n\r\nIranians,  they have all sorts of strange people who  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  underground  economy  and  without  which  the  Japanese\r\n\r\neconomy could not work properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are problems we have. I am glad that Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang  has  made it quite clear.  He  is  not  against\r\n\r\nbringing  in  foreign workers.  We share his  objective  that\r\n\r\nthis should not cause problems for Singaporeans and should be\r\n\r\nfor  the overall good of Singaporeans.  But we cannot promise\r\n\r\nthat every Singaporean who feels he has been out-competed  by\r\n\r\na foreigner will get redress.  That is not possible.  Because\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  reasons  why a  particular  person  may  be\r\n\r\npreferred or not preferred, may find a job or not find a job,\r\n\r\nand cost is only one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what we are doing about the cost of living, I do\r\n\r\nnot  understand what Mr Low Thia Khiang means.  I suggest  he\r\n\r\nread  the  Executive Summary again which I have  distributed.\r\n\r\nWe  have  distributed New Singapore Shares.   We  are  giving\r\n\r\nservice  and  conservancy rebates.  We are  giving  Utilities\r\n\r\nSave  rebates.  We have got electricity charges about  to  be\r\n\r\ntrimmed.   We have frozen university fees.  We are suspending\r\n\r\nrepayment of the loans.  Any Singaporean who is in difficulty\r\n\r\ncan  get help and we have promised to do that.  Then we  have\r\n\r\nalso  cut hospital charges.  So these are things we are doing\r\n\r\nto  address  the problem of the cost of living in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  not a problem of things becoming more expensive.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  you look at the figure, for the  whole  of  this\r\n\r\nyear, our inflation is less than one-and-a-half percent.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  prices have been down every month since May,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nCPI.   But it is a problem of people not having quite as much\r\n\r\nto  spend because bonuses are down, salaries are cut, and you\r\n\r\nhave less money to spend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what do I do? I cannot give you the same money as\r\n\r\nyou had last year when it was a 10% growth year.  But if,  as\r\n\r\na  result of this tightening, you do not have enough for your\r\n\r\nbus  fares,  through the EDRS, through the other schemes,  we\r\n\r\nwill  make  sure  that  you  will not  go  without  what  you\r\n\r\nabsolutely need.  The frills, we cannot ensure.  But what you\r\n\r\nabsolutely need, you will not go without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay: May I just ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nabout the double tax deductions for charities, an idea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Prime Minister during his National Day Rally\r\n\r\nspeech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is not in this package.
