The notice was to the  effect\r\n\r\nthat  the Leader of the House would move the motion\r\n\r\non Monday, the 19th day of December, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the House nevertheless appeared to have taken the view that the motion was of such\r\n\r\nurgency  and  of  such  importance  that   he   was\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  bring the matter to  the  House  for\r\n\r\ndebate  immediately relying on  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nparagraph (e) of Standing Order No. 30 which  reads\r\n\r\nas follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`30.

Members</b> will recollect that I stated that I\r\n\r\nwished  to  be  satisfied on two  points  before  I\r\n\r\npermitted  the Leader of the House to proceed,  the\r\n\r\ntwo  points being, firstly, whether in view of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  yesterday was a day  allotted  for  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of Supply, the motion could be  taken  on\r\n\r\nsuch  a day and, secondly, whether the motion could\r\n\r\nproperly   be  moved  without  notice   under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of paragraph (e) of Standing  Order  No.\r\n\r\n30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, the relevant Standing Order\r\n\r\nas I indicated yesterday is Standing Order No. 85,\r\n\r\nparagraph (2) of which reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) On a day allotted to the business of Supply,\r\n\r\nthe  business  of Supply shall stand as  the  first\r\n\r\norder,  and  so long as the business of Supply  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  completed, no business  other  than  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of Supply shall be taken after 3  p.m. or\r\n\r\nbefore  8 p.m., and except in pursuance of Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  No. 21 (Adjournment on a definite matter  of\r\n\r\nurgent  public  importance) no business  of  Supply\r\n\r\nshall  be  taken  after 8 p.m.,  whether  an  order\r\n\r\nexempting business from interruption under Standing\r\n\r\nOrder No. 4 (Exempted Business) is in force or not,\r\n\r\nunless  the Assembly otherwise orders on the motion\r\n\r\nof  a Minister moved at any time between 7 p.m. and 7.30  p.m. to  be  decided  without  amendment  or\r\n\r\ndebate.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there can be no doubt that a motion\r\n\r\nof the nature proposed to be moved by the Leader of\r\n\r\nthe House is an item of business within the meaning\r\n\r\nof  the  term \"business\" used in paragraph  (2)  of\r\n\r\nStanding  Order  No.  85, and therefore  under  the\r\n\r\nterms  of that paragraph, the motion could  not  be\r\n\r\ntaken  on  any  day allotted for  the  business  of\r\n\r\nSupply between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. but could be taken\r\n\r\nbefore  3  p.m. and/or after 8 p.m., in the  latter\r\n\r\ncase,  upon  a  resolution under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nparagraph  (1)  of Standing Order No.  4  that  the\r\n\r\nproceedings thereon be exempted from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1 (Sittings of the Assembly),\r\n\r\nin order that the motion could be debated after the\r\n\r\nmoment of interruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, the question of notice, it\r\n\r\nis  a  well  established principle of Parliamentary\r\n\r\npractice that before a complaint is made against  a\r\n\r\nMember  he  should  be given notice  beforehand  in\r\n\r\norder  that  he  should know the substance  of  the\r\n\r\ncharge  against  him and in order that  he  may  be\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity of being in the House in  his\r\n\r\nplace to be heard, if he so desired, in explanation\r\n\r\nor  exculpation. When, however, a Member is  guilty\r\n\r\nof  an offence in the view of the Assembly, that is\r\n\r\nto say, guilty of an offence committed by him while\r\n\r\nhe  is  in the House during its sitting, and it  is\r\n\r\nthought  necessary  to  take  action  against   him\r\n\r\nimmediately, then, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  such notice would be necessary, and proceedings\r\n\r\ncould be taken against him forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the principle I have enunciated,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it appears to me that the provision  in\r\n\r\nStanding  Order  No. 30 whereby a  motion  for  the\r\n\r\nsuspension  of  a  Member could  be  moved  without\r\n\r\nnotice  must  be taken, in fairness to  the  Member\r\n\r\nconcerned,  to have reference to a case  where  the\r\n\r\nMember  is guilty of an offence in the view of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  In  such an event, the  Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nthemselves   provide  for  the  procedure   to   be\r\n\r\nfollowed.  The relevant Standing Order is  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder No. 56, paragraph (1) of which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`56. -(1) Whenever a Member has been named by the\r\n\r\nSpeaker  or by the Chairman, immediately after  the\r\n\r\ncommission  of  the  offence  of  disregarding  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of  the  Chair, or of  persistently  and\r\n\r\nwilfully  obstructing the business of the  Assembly\r\n\r\nby abusing the rules of the Assembly, or otherwise,\r\n\r\nthen,  if  the offence has been committed  by  such\r\n\r\nMember in the Assembly a motion shall forthwith  be\r\n\r\nproposed  by a Minister or Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\npresent  \"That Mr... be suspended from the  service\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly\", and the Speaker shall forthwith\r\n\r\nput  the  question  on that motion,  no  amendment,\r\n\r\nadjournment  or debate being allowed; and,  if  the\r\n\r\noffence  has  been  committed in Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole   Assembly,  the  Chairman  shall   forthwith\r\n\r\nsuspend the proceedings of the Committee and report\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances to the Assembly; and the Speaker\r\n\r\nshall on a motion being made as aforesaid forthwith\r\n\r\nput the same question, no amendment, adjournment or\r\n\r\ndebate  being allowed, as if the offence  had  been\r\n\r\ncommitted in the Assembly itself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have formed the opinion, therefore, that the\r\n\r\nmotion for the suspension of a Member mentioned  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  (e)  of Standing Order No.  30  must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  refer to the motion to suspend described\r\n\r\nin the paragraph I have quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from what I have said the motion proposed to\r\n\r\nbe  moved by the Leader of the House is, of course,\r\n\r\nmore than merely a motion to suspend the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim. It also seeks a resolution of the  House\r\n\r\ncondemning  the  Member for Hong  Lim  for  certain\r\n\r\nconduct alleged, in the motion, to be dishonourable\r\n\r\nand  unbecoming of an elected representative of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, therefore, it is my considered\r\n\r\nopinion that this matter is clearly a matter  which\r\n\r\ncalls  for appropriate notice to be given not  only\r\n\r\nto the hon. Member concerned but also to other hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House. I therefore rule  that  the\r\n\r\nmotion cannot be proceeded with forthwith and  does\r\n\r\nrequire the requisite notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the notice already given, the motion will\r\n\r\naccordingly  be  set  down  for  Monday,  19th   of\r\n\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR PUBLIC SERVICES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES FOR 1961</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee\r\n\r\nof Supply [6th Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES, 1961</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Development Estimates.

However,  I\r\n\r\nwould like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  remind the House, and in particular the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill, that even if the Federation  should\r\n\r\nhave    their   own   international   airport,    a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of air traffic will still  pass\r\n\r\nthrough   Singapore.  We  are  in  the   privileged\r\n\r\nposition  that  we  have  an international  airport\r\n\r\nlocated almost within eyeview of the seaport.  With\r\n\r\nsuch  a  favourable location, it is important  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  seek  not  to  diminish  but  to\r\n\r\nincrease   its   prestige   as   an   international\r\n\r\ncommunication centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans for development of the international\r\n\r\nairport  at Paya Lebar have been thoroughly studied\r\n\r\nby  me  when the Department came under my  control.\r\n\r\nEstimates  made  in 1959 to spend  $60  million  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment  on the Paya Lebar Airport  have  since\r\n\r\nbeen considerably cut down. The requirements for  a\r\n\r\nhangar  runway  extension  and  passenger  terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding amount to only $6.5 million. The amount of\r\n\r\nmoney  spent on these facilities should be  clearly\r\n\r\ndistinguished     from     that      spent      for\r\n\r\ntelecommunications.      The       amount       for\r\n\r\ntelecommunications is $2.2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that in these days, when jet\r\n\r\nplanes  are flying at a speed of about 400  to  600\r\n\r\nmiles  per hour, we should be able to detect  these\r\n\r\nplanes   several  miles  before  they   arrive   at\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, in fact, one of the functions of Air\r\n\r\nTraffic Control to direct aircraft at what altitude\r\n\r\nand   at   what  distance  they  should  fly   into\r\n\r\nSingapore. Without telecommunications, it will  not\r\n\r\nbe  possible  to  do so. And in  Singapore  we  are\r\n\r\nparticularly   faced  with  the  problem   of   \r\n\r\nco-ordinating civil and military aircraft. As  Members\r\n\r\nare  aware, there are altogether four airfields  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - one  civil airfield  and  three  military\r\n\r\nairfields, the military airfields being at  Changi,\r\n\r\nTengah  and  Seletar. Military  aircraft  are \r\n\r\njet-powered aircraft. Civil aircraft today are also \r\n\r\njet-powered aircraft. Changi airfield is very close  to\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar airfield, and it has happened at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimes  that  military aircraft  have  mistaken  the\r\n\r\ncivil  aerodrome as Changi airfield and vice versa.\r\n\r\nUnder  these  conditions, it is essential  that  no\r\n\r\naccidents  and  no collisions should occur  between\r\n\r\nfast  flying aircraft, and the only way to  prevent\r\n\r\nthese collisions is to use the latest technological\r\n\r\nadvances in telecommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have radar aid, and it is proposed to\r\n\r\ninstall radar costing $1.1 million at Paya Lebar to\r\n\r\nassist Air Traffic Control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very careful in estimating demands\r\n\r\nfor  extension  of the runway. Let  me  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  there  are two considerations  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  the runway. One is strength  and  the\r\n\r\nother is length. As far as the strength of the Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  runway  is concerned, all airline  operators\r\n\r\nare  satisfied that its structural strength fulfils\r\n\r\ntheir requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting of the International Civil Aviation\r\n\r\nOrganisation  in  January 1959 in Rome,  there  was\r\n\r\nsome form of general consensus of opinion that  the\r\n\r\nrunway for all airfields where the first generation\r\n\r\njets,  the  Boeing  707  and  the  D.C.8.  will  be\r\n\r\nlanding,  should  have at least a length  of  9,500\r\n\r\nfeet.  In January this year, the International  Air\r\n\r\nTransport   Association  -I.A.T.A.  -reviewed   the\r\n\r\nposition, and considered that there should  be,  in\r\n\r\nfact, a length of 10,000 feet, plus 500 feet \r\n\r\nclear-way at each end, totalling 11,000 feet. In February\r\n\r\nthis  year, a Pan-American Airways jet survey  team\r\n\r\ncame to Paya Lebar to examine the facilities of the\r\n\r\nairport. It came to the conclusion that the  runway\r\n\r\nat  Paya  Lebar  was adequate for  existing  sector\r\n\r\nlengths,  although it may be insufficient for  full\r\n\r\neconomic operation where the stage lengths  of  the\r\n\r\nBoeing   707  aircraft  exceed  1,500  miles.   All\r\n\r\naircraft  which fly from Singapore have a range  of\r\n\r\n1,500  miles.  Djakarta, Bangkok.  Manila,  Saigon,\r\n\r\nRangoon,  Ceylon, Hongkong and Calcutta, all  these\r\n\r\nairports are within 1,500 miles. The only sector on\r\n\r\nwhich the Boeing 707 does not carry a full pay-load\r\n\r\nis  the Singapore-Darwin sector; this sector having\r\n\r\na distance of 1,820 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, there are conflicting views\r\n\r\non   runway   requirements  by  different   airline\r\n\r\noperators, depending upon the type of aircraft they\r\n\r\nused.  We have today the first generation  jets  in\r\n\r\nthe  Comet,  the Boeing 707 and the D.C.8.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  predicted that in 1964 the second  generation\r\n\r\njets will appear. One of them is the V.C.10, and it\r\n\r\nhas  been  stated  by  the manufacturers  that  the\r\n\r\nV.C.10  will  be  able to utilise  the  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport  on  the existing length of 8,000  feet  on\r\n\r\nfull pay-load from Karachi to Singapore. In 10 to 15  years'  time, it is predicted in  the  technical\r\n\r\njournals  that supersonic aircraft will make  their\r\n\r\nappearance.  As  aircraft designs  improve  and  as\r\n\r\naircraft engines improve, the length of runway  for\r\n\r\ntake-off need not be as long as is the demand  made\r\n\r\nby  the  airline operators today. In fact,  at  the\r\n\r\nFarnborough  air  show this year, it  was  reported\r\n\r\nthat  an  experimental  aircraft  came  flying  in,\r\n\r\nstopped in mid-air, and landed down vertically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we consider the requirements and the developments of the airport, we have to\r\n\r\nlook pretty far ahead, and we have to keep in touch\r\n\r\nwith modern developments. We should not, therefore,\r\n\r\nconsider  developments just for next  year  or  the\r\n\r\nyear after. We should consider what will happen  to\r\n\r\nthe  developments that we put up now at the airport\r\n\r\nin five years' time, in ten years' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

In other words, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is a hidden subsidy in regard to this housing\r\n\r\nloan  to  the  Housing Authority.

That is to say,  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding and the cost of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, if I may draw, the attention\r\n\r\nof  the Minister.

Hitherto, the main item of\r\n\r\nsubsidy  which  the Government  has  given  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority is by way of  a  very  long-term\r\n\r\nloan - a   60  years'  loan - so  that  the   cost   of\r\n\r\namortization will be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious thing about the policy of the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government - I  do  not  want  to  make   a\r\n\r\npolitical  point here, but it is a fact that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  multiplicity  of  rents  charged  for\r\n\r\npractically similar accommodation. Partly, this was\r\n\r\ndue to the fact that houses were built at different\r\n\r\ntimes  and  costs  varied at different  times.  But\r\n\r\nthere was also the tendency for rents to go down as\r\n\r\npolling day came nearer. But, be that as it may the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  has represented to  the  Government\r\n\r\nthat  there is a case for subsidy. They base  their\r\n\r\nargument on three grounds:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It is the general practice in many countries\r\n\r\nto   provide  either  direct  subsidy,  by  way  of\r\n\r\nallocation from the revenues, or indirect  subsidy,\r\n\r\nby way of remission of rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Housing Board say that the are providing a\r\n\r\nnumber  of services by way of maintenance of  roads\r\n\r\nand  properties which are, in fact,  services  they\r\n\r\ncould  have  expected the City Council  to  provide\r\n\r\nsince they pay the full rates to the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Housing Board is an agency of Government\r\n\r\nin  the  implementation of its social policies.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, it is not a money-making concern.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not rent out its dwellings to those  who  can\r\n\r\npay the highest rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking all these three factors into account,\r\n\r\nit  does seem to me, at any rate, that they have  a\r\n\r\ncase for subsidy. Then, of course, you want to  see\r\n\r\nhow  the subsidy is calculated. I, for one, believe\r\n\r\nthat if any subsidy were to be given to the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard,  it should be an open one. It should  appear\r\n\r\nas  an item in the Budget. But the matter is, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  an extremely complex one,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  sure  that whatever  the  basis  of\r\n\r\ncalculation of the subsidy, it should be  one  that\r\n\r\ncan  lend itself to long-term calculation, so  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  not  saddle future governments  with \r\n\r\nincreasing amounts of subsidy as a result of what  we\r\n\r\ndo now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, while we are on the financial\r\n\r\naspect of this matter, might I ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  (this  is a loan to the Housing  Authority\r\n\r\nand I take it the loan will carry some interest) if\r\n\r\nhe could inform the House of the terms of the loan,\r\n\r\ndates  of repayment, and such like things connected\r\n\r\nwith the loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The loan has not been\r\n\r\nnegotiated  yet.

However, I would like  to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  we  all  know that there  is  a  housing\r\n\r\nshortage. I was surprised that 91 terrace houses at\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru. 16 units at the Queenstown flats,  and\r\n\r\n13  units at the St. Michael's Road flats were left\r\n\r\nvacant.  We were told this by the Minister  on  the\r\n\r\n16th  of  November. When I asked whether  the  high\r\n\r\nrents  had  anything  to  do  with  it,  you   will\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir, you very aptly reminded us  that  I\r\n\r\nwas not to go into details because we were debating\r\n\r\nthe  speech  of the Hon. the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nand  we  were dealing with general principles.  Now\r\n\r\nthat this debate is on housing, may I point out  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister (I will not go into details) that the\r\n\r\nrents  that  have been asked from the fire  victims\r\n\r\nare  in  some cases nearly 40 per cent higher  than\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are  paying now. I do understand,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   the  present  rents  they  are  paying   are\r\n\r\nsubsidised by the Government to the extent of their\r\n\r\npaying  $25  (I  think the rent  is  $30)  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  subsidising $5. I also  understand,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  this cannot go on forever, but,  seeing\r\n\r\nthat  this is a case of fire victims who have  lost\r\n\r\neverything  in  the fire, could  the  Minister  not\r\n\r\nextend  this privilege to them? Moreover, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  always  criticized  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  for building expensive houses  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  rents  have  to  be  high.  If  I  am  rightly\r\n\r\ninformed, Sir, this project at Tiong Bahru is not a\r\n\r\ncreation of the previous Government. The plans that\r\n\r\nhave  been  put up for that have been scrapped  and\r\n\r\nnew plans have been made by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  Government and houses are built  according\r\n\r\nto the present Government's plans. That is why I am\r\n\r\nsurprised,   Sir,   that  the  buildings   are   so\r\n\r\nexpensive. For a much inferior building which, as I\r\n\r\nhave said the other day, offers no separate kitchen\r\n\r\nand  bathroom  facilities, the people  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncharged  nearly  40  per cent more  than  what  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government had been charging all along for\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. flats down at the old Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Sir, as I have said, I have had\r\n\r\ncomplaints from 135 people whose names, particulars\r\n\r\nand  addresses I have, and if the Hon. the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development will be so kind - I do not\r\n\r\nwant  to  bore  the  House  - as  to  grant  me   an\r\n\r\ninterview, I am prepared to come with some of these\r\n\r\npeople and place the case before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is a more recent complaint, Sir,\r\n\r\nabout  S.I.T. flats.

It  was,  of  course,\r\n\r\nunfortunate that the houses were burned out but  it\r\n\r\nwas  very  fortunate for them that that happened  a\r\n\r\nfew weeks before polling day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the one\r\n\r\nhand, it may be correct, but on the other hand,  it\r\n\r\nis  not. The fire victims were treated as a special\r\n\r\ncase.  At  the  time  the fire victims  were  given\r\n\r\nflats, there were other people who were also  given\r\n\r\nflats. They were not charged rents similar to those\r\n\r\ncharged to the fire victims.

No offer had yet been\r\n\r\nmade  to  the  fire victims at that  time.  So  the\r\n\r\nquestion of high rent did not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of fire victims now being\r\n\r\noffered high rental flats or housing units in Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  Fire Site. Sir, it was the intention of  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government to start this Tiong Bahru  Fire\r\n\r\nSite  scheme to build units so that they  would  be\r\n\r\navailable to the fire victim families at low  rent.\r\n\r\nAs   an   interim   measure,  566   families   were\r\n\r\naccommodated  in  one-room and  two-room  flats  at\r\n\r\nspecial  rentals of $25 and $35 respectively.  Sir,\r\n\r\naccording  to the Housing Board, these  rents  were\r\n\r\ngiven  to the fire victims at a very heavy subsidy.\r\n\r\nThe  economic rentals of the flats at Kallang  that\r\n\r\nwere rented out to the fire victims at $25 and  $35\r\n\r\nworked  out  at $73 and $77 a month. Sir,  you  can\r\n\r\nimagine the amount of subsidy the Government had to\r\n\r\npay for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing   these  fire  victims.  The   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten said that there was only a  subsidy  of\r\n\r\n$5. Perhaps her mind is a bit clearer now about the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  the  Government has  to  pay.  From  these\r\n\r\nfigures, it is clear that the subsidy for the flats\r\n\r\nrented  out  to the 566 families amounted  to  more\r\n\r\nthan half the full cost of these units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the question of these units that were put\r\n\r\nup  in  the Tiong Bahru Fire Site. When the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  took over, the plans drawn  up  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government were already  in  an  advanced\r\n\r\nstage.  In order not to delay the project,  it  was\r\n\r\ndecided  to  proceed with the scheme as  previously\r\n\r\nplanned, but with modifications in order to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  cost per unit as much as possible and, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, to provide a larger number of units  on\r\n\r\nthe  same area of land. The original scheme was  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a total of 740 units at a total  cost  of\r\n\r\nabout $4.8 million. The revised scheme provides for\r\n\r\na  total  of  1,025 units at a total cost  of  $5.3\r\n\r\nmillion.  It  will be seen that for  an  additional\r\n\r\ncost of $0.5 million, an additional 285 units - about\r\n\r\n40 per cent more - will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the modifications, Sir, it was found that\r\n\r\neconomic rentals for the units would still be quite\r\n\r\nhigh, namely, $40 for one-room flats, $45 for \r\n\r\ntwo-room  fiats and $68 per month for three-room  flats\r\n\r\nor  terrace houses. To let these flats or units out\r\n\r\nat low rentals within the means of the fire victims\r\n\r\nas  proposed by the previous Government would  mean\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  would  have  to   meet   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  subsidy covering at  least  half  the\r\n\r\nactual  cost  of  providing the  units - a  scale  of\r\n\r\nsubsidy  which  is quite unthinkable.  Accordingly,\r\n\r\nthe   present  Government  decided  that  the  more\r\n\r\nsensible  course  would  be  to  make  these  units\r\n\r\navailable to the public at economic rentals and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the fire victims and other members  of\r\n\r\nthe lower income group a new basic type of low-cost\r\n\r\nunit that can be rented out at $20 per month. It is\r\n\r\nexpected  that 900 of these units will be available\r\n\r\nat  Tiong Bahru next year and these will be offered\r\n\r\nto   the   fire  victims  in  the  first  instance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvictims of the fire are being given first option to\r\n\r\noccupy  the  units that are completed at  the  fire\r\n\r\nsite if they are prepared to pay economic rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be said that the Tiong Bahru fire\r\n\r\nvictims  would suffer hardship as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's decision to let out these Tiong  Bahru\r\n\r\nFire Site units at economic rentals. Those families\r\n\r\nhave  been  given flats at Kallang at  special  low\r\n\r\nrentals. In addition, each victim has received cash\r\n\r\nrelief of $90. All the fire victims, however,  will\r\n\r\nbe  eligible to apply for the $20 units  when  they\r\n\r\nare completed at Tiong Bahru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaints on lighting. Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  past, the Singapore Improvement Trust had been\r\n\r\nlavish in the matter of providing lighting for  the\r\n\r\nflats  so  that  at night when we passed  by  these\r\n\r\nmulti-storey flats, we saw a blaze of  lights  even\r\n\r\ntill  the  early  part of the morning - till  6  a.m.\r\n\r\nThis, however, cost the Board a considerable sum in\r\n\r\nthe  electricity  bill  and  burnt  bulbs.  As   an\r\n\r\neconomic measure, the Board is now providing, on  a\r\n\r\ntrial basis, only lights on the staircase and  also\r\n\r\none light in the centre of the access corridor, and\r\n\r\nall  other lights have been taken off. This is only\r\n\r\nan experiment to reduce costs to the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, about bulbs belonging to the tenants\r\n\r\nthat  have been taken away by the Board, I  am  not\r\n\r\naware of this, but I will look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems\r\n\r\nquite obvious that the Minister meant that the fire\r\n\r\nvictims  would be able to apply for the  $20  flats\r\n\r\neven  though  they refuse what is offered  to  them\r\n\r\nnow.  There are fire victims who have been  offered\r\n\r\nthese  present flats at Tiong Bahru, and there  are\r\n\r\nothers who have not been offered.

He has also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  a  two-room unit would cost  the  Board\r\n\r\n$2,700  and for a three-room unit $4,200. I hope  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  taken him down wrongly.

On\r\n\r\nthat  basis, Sir, it would appear that  a  two-room\r\n\r\nunit  will be let at $37 and a three-room  unit  at\r\n\r\n$47.  Assuming  that the cost  per  unit  has  some\r\n\r\nrelation to the rent, it would work out that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the House has also been informed by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance that the monies which will  be\r\n\r\nutilised  by the Housing Board will all  be  monies\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them on loan, the interest on which  has\r\n\r\nnot  yet  been fixed, and the manner of  repayment,\r\n\r\nwhether by annual repayments or in what manner  the\r\n\r\nloan should be paid, has not yet been determined by\r\n\r\nGovernment.

That  is  not\r\n\r\nquite a small undertaking, Mr Speaker, Sir,If the\r\n\r\nGovernment could complete 9,000 units next year,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they would have done very well, and I should\r\n\r\ncongratulate them. But the building of these  units\r\n\r\nis a huge undertaking. Not only is it a question of\r\n\r\nbricks  and mortar and land, it is also a  question\r\n\r\nof  providing services for these houses before they\r\n\r\nbecome   habitable.  Services  mean  water,  light,\r\n\r\nsewerage, and things like that which go to make  up\r\n\r\nmodern living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I have the assurance of the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development that he has  in  this  matter\r\n\r\nconsulted  the City Council, or whoever runs  these\r\n\r\nservices  now, and that they will be in a  position\r\n\r\nto  supply  him  with  water, the  light,  and  the\r\n\r\nsewerage facilities that he needs for these  12,000\r\n\r\nunits?   And   could  the  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment   also   indicate  to   the   House - the\r\n\r\nMinister, of course, is aware that in so far as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision of light and water is concerned, the City\r\n\r\nCouncil adopts a certain policy with regard to  the\r\n\r\npublic  at large - whether the City Council  also  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to adopt the same policy with regard to  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  water  and  light  for  the  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\ndispose  of the first of the three points  made  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park? As I understand it, his\r\n\r\ncontention was that, unless the rate of interest is\r\n\r\nsettled  between Government and the Housing  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  Board  itself will not be able to  compute  an\r\n\r\neconomic rent, because payment of interest and more\r\n\r\nparticularly  the funding operations  of  the  loan\r\n\r\nwould  be a major item of cost. If that is correct,\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Housing Board did take as  a  basis  for\r\n\r\ncomputation-and   that   has   been   accepted   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  -is  the current practice  of  allowing\r\n\r\nthem  a fairly extensive period of repayment in  60\r\n\r\nyears.  This  is the thing that really reduces  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  amortisation. We  can  hardly  grant  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board less generous terms than those in the\r\n\r\npast,  but  in the event we require that  they  pay\r\n\r\ninterest  at market rates and on repayment  periods\r\n\r\nnormal  to  such loans, then, of course, they  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay more for interest because of  funding\r\n\r\noperations which would be more, but that will  have\r\n\r\nto be offset by a corresponding subsidy, so that it\r\n\r\ncomes to the same at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said just\r\n\r\nnow  that  the plan was to built 12,000 units,  and\r\n\r\nout  of  these, 9.000 are expected to be completed.\r\n\r\nAs  regards  light and water and arrangements  with\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council, I shall be glad to  supply  the\r\n\r\ndetails  to  the Member when they are available  to\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Part 2 of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  \"The Tasks Ahead\", page  29,  it  is\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A human being has three basic needs namely,\r\n\r\nfood, clothes, and housing.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, during the Budget debate we have\r\n\r\nalready  touched on the position of the  first  two\r\n\r\nneeds, food and clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Government with a policy of soaking\r\n\r\nthe poor, the standard of living has gone down;  in\r\n\r\nother  words, less income means less food and  less\r\n\r\nclothing.

It is estimated that Singapore needs to\r\n\r\nproduce  10,000  units of housing  for  the  public\r\n\r\nannually [in other words, a minimum of 10,000 units\r\n\r\nof flats for the people of Singapore].'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, when I took charge of public  housing\r\n\r\nin  June 1959, we immediately started to reorganise\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. on a semi-war footing.

This is an idea of how  we  carried  on\r\n\r\nwith building. The officers-in-charge had to give a\r\n\r\ntime-table  for every project which we put  up.  We\r\n\r\nstarted in June, immediately after taking over  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. Among the many projects was the Kampong  Koo\r\n\r\nChye  project. Each project had a time-table.

Some of the votes were,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, on specific schemes like the Kampong  Koo\r\n\r\nChye Fire scheme, the Kampong Tiong Bahru Fire Site\r\n\r\nscheme,  and  even  these  specific  schemes  which\r\n\r\namounted  to about $7\u00bd million were being  frozen\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Finance. Despite protestations,\r\n\r\nas  usual, the Minister for Finance turned  a  deaf\r\n\r\near.  So, on the 13th August, 1959, I wrote to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provision of Funds for Low Cost Housing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Keng Swee,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already intimated to you on several\r\n\r\noccasions,  my  Ministry will require  considerable\r\n\r\nfunds   to  carry  out  the  Government's  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing programme.

So on the 9th\r\n\r\nNovember, I had to write again for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>`9th November, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to your letter of 17th October.\r\n\r\n1959,  informing  me that you are prepared  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance to make available a  total  of  $15\r\n\r\nmillion  for S.I.T. housing for this year  and  the\r\n\r\nnext. There are a number of points I should like to\r\n\r\nraise  for  clarification. Firstly,  is  it  to  be\r\n\r\nassumed  that  the  $15  million  includes  the  $7\r\n\r\nmillion  which has been provided for S.I.T. housing\r\n\r\nout of previous loans granted by the Government? If\r\n\r\nthis  is  so,  then the new money  which  is  being\r\n\r\nprovided  for  S.I.T. housing schemes  is  only  $8\r\n\r\nmillion.  Secondly,  I must presume  that  the  $15\r\n\r\nmillion  is  not intended to cover the two  special\r\n\r\nGovernment housing schemes for which special  funds\r\n\r\nwere  provided by the previous Government,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  Kampong Tiong Bahru and the Kampong  Koo  Chye\r\n\r\nschemes.  As  you  are  no doubt  aware,  money  is\r\n\r\nprovided for the two schemes as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                         $\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (a) Kampong Koo Chye scheme          569,000\r\n\r\n (b) Kampong Tiong Bahru scheme     4,800,000\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  understand  that the $569,000 for (a)  has  been\r\n\r\nreleased  for  expenditure. But  out  of  the  $4.8\r\n\r\nmillion  for (b), that is, the Kampong Tiong  Bahru\r\n\r\nscheme,  only a total of $1.2 million  has  so  far\r\n\r\nbeen  made  available, leaving a  balance  of  $3.6\r\n\r\nmillion  yet to he made available. In any case,  it\r\n\r\nseems to me desirable that funds provided for these\r\n\r\ntwo  schemes  should continue to be  kept  distinct\r\n\r\nfrom  the  loan  funds  to be provided  for  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhousing  projects  for two reasons.  In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  these  are special Government  projects  to\r\n\r\nhouse fire victims which S.I.T. have been asked  to\r\n\r\nundertake.   Secondly,   donations   from    public\r\n\r\ncontributions,  the  City  Council  and  the   U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  totalling  about  $181,000   for   the\r\n\r\nKampong  Tiong  Bahru scheme and $206,000  for  the\r\n\r\nKampong Koo Chye scheme are involved in the scheme.\r\n\r\nIn order that I may have a clear idea of the extent\r\n\r\nof  funds  I shall have available for my Ministry's\r\n\r\nhousing schemes, I shall be grateful for your early\r\n\r\nclarification of the two questions raised above.

It appears to me that we are now going on  to\r\n\r\nanother  matter concerning the duties  of  the\r\n\r\nex-Minister  for  National Development. We  are  going\r\n\r\naway from the matter before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As far as I could gather, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational Development is inquiring whether it was in\r\n\r\norder  or  relevant for a Member to touch  on  past\r\n\r\nexpenditure when dealing with expenditure for 1961.\r\n\r\nTo  my  mind,  it  is relevant to  try  to  draw  a\r\n\r\ncomparison between what has been done, what has not\r\n\r\nbeen  done,  and what will be done  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly to decide whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthe amount to be voted for 1961 is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without the\r\n\r\nbasic  necessity of life - money - nobody can do  much,\r\n\r\nhowever  hard  we  work. So  since  money  was  not\r\n\r\nforthcoming, and despite the fact that most of  the\r\n\r\ncontracts had been signed with the contractors,  we\r\n\r\ncould not start work. Instead, what was done was to\r\n\r\nstart  a Commission of Inquiry into building rather\r\n\r\nthan to provide the money which the Government  had\r\n\r\ndeposited, paying interest, and refusing to lend it\r\n\r\nto the S.I.T. and also refusing the S.I.T. to float\r\n\r\nits own loans. Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that there\r\n\r\nare  tens  of  thousands of people  who  have  been\r\n\r\nwaiting  for years and years queuing up for  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nflats. It is these flat-seekers who are the persons\r\n\r\nwho  suffer.  To my knowledge, some  of  them  have\r\n\r\nwaited  for five to six years, and even  until  now\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  get  a  flat. We hope  that  the  $34\r\n\r\nmillion  which  has  been  earmarked  in  the  1961\r\n\r\nEstimates  for loan to the Housing Authority  would\r\n\r\nnot be meant just for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npropaganda  purposes but would be meant really  for\r\n\r\nbuilding  flats. In the past one and a half  years,\r\n\r\nthere was no construction by the Government at all,\r\n\r\nexcept  opening hospitals and markets built by  the\r\n\r\nformer  Government or the former City Council.  The\r\n\r\nonly  new construction of this Government had  been\r\n\r\nseveral  community  centres and opening  the  Telok\r\n\r\nPaku  Rest  House - a  former  house  built  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and which was just whitewashed.  But  we\r\n\r\nhope  from  now  onwards that the  Government  will\r\n\r\nhonestly and sincerely build flats for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this going to be the\r\n\r\ncase? The 8,000 over units which the S.I.T. is  now\r\n\r\nbuilding and which are in the process of completion\r\n\r\nwere  built  and  started in  1959.  As  far  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, the Minister for Finance is  still  not\r\n\r\nyet sure of his new housing plans; whether they are\r\n\r\ngoing to have standard types of a one-room flat, or\r\n\r\na  two-room flat, or a multi-room flat. A  decision\r\n\r\nhas  not  yet  been made. I urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nleave  the  matter of housing to the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development who is the best authority  and\r\n\r\nwho is the best portfolio in charge of the subject,\r\n\r\nrather  than  a Minister for Housing  who,  we  see\r\n\r\ntoday,  is  the  real person who runs  the  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority. Mr Speaker, Sir, the earlier a decision\r\n\r\nis  made, first, on the sites, and secondly, on the\r\n\r\nplans of the flats, the better it would be for  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore,  instead  of  arguing   and\r\n\r\ndisputing  on small and minor technical issues  for\r\n\r\nwhich we have to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think I am going to enjoy\r\n\r\nmyself.

Sir,  I\r\n\r\nput  it to you that this is purely a figment of his\r\n\r\nimagination. In one instance, I knew what  happened\r\n\r\nbecause  he got into an awful jam, and he sent  his\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to me to sort out the  mess\r\n\r\nhe had landed himself into. And briefly it is this.\r\n\r\nHe  was  uncertain how he could tender for  a  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial sum, some $600,000 or so, and he wanted\r\n\r\nto  know whether the approval of the Senior Tenders\r\n\r\nBoard  was  necessary.  I  told  his  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary that it was necessary, and that  if  they\r\n\r\nproceeded with it, then they may have to  face  the\r\n\r\nwrath   of   the  auditors,  the  Public   Accounts\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  so  forth.

By\r\n\r\nthe  time October came, and that was when he really\r\n\r\nthought he was done in, he was worried.

We were on talking terms then,  Mr\r\n\r\nKandasamy.  Sir,  and  the letter  quite  naturally\r\n\r\nstarted  in  endearing  terms  which  will  not  be\r\n\r\ntolerated today. The letter reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>`Dear Keng Swee,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our recent conversations I have discussed\r\n\r\nwith you our 5-year plan for housing. We propose to\r\n\r\nbuild  about 80,000 units of flats within the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years and we have confidence that it  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.  The total amount of funds required is  about\r\n\r\n$400  million. However, I feel that if the Treasury\r\n\r\ncan  get  $300  million it is  sufficient  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  because some of the flats can be sold  and\r\n\r\nin the meantime certain rents can he collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the land in the 5-year plan are now in\r\n\r\nthe  possession  of the S.I.T. and I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat  you  will agree with me that every  endeavour\r\n\r\nmust  be  made  to  complete this 80,000  units  of\r\n\r\nhouses within the next five years.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And enclosed was the Minister's five-year housing\r\n\r\nprogramme.

Sir,  anyone  capable  of  doing  elementary\r\n\r\narithmetic will find that all that has been done in\r\n\r\norder  to get $400 million is to multiply a  figure\r\n\r\nby  another figure to get the answer. This is  done\r\n\r\n23  times. The only mathematical operations  needed\r\n\r\nare multiplication and addition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw,  has  for some time been pestering  me  for  a\r\n\r\nphotostat  machine costing some $600, and  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  yet  come to an agreement because we  have  to\r\n\r\nassess  whether  he needs this particular  machine.\r\n\r\nThe   impasse   may  be  ended   by   sending   the\r\n\r\nOrganisation  and Methods Branch to  have  a  look.\r\n\r\nNow,  for  a small sum of $600, Sir, we do  try  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  whether  there is a  need  for  such  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Here you have a monstrous  demand  for\r\n\r\n$400  million  on this rag of paper.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndescription  of  what type of  houses  are  to  be\r\n\r\nconstructed,  what  is the rent, what  consequences\r\n\r\nwill  follow, what are the subsidiary costs by  way\r\n\r\nof  markets, creches, and schools. When I  received\r\n\r\nthis,  I  thought, well, perhaps this  was  just  a\r\n\r\nsummary  of  some  grand  master  plan,  which  the\r\n\r\ndespatch  clerk  in his Ministry had  forgotten  to\r\n\r\nsend  along. On inquiry, I was told that  this  was\r\n\r\nthe plan. This was the $400 million plan. Obviously\r\n\r\nit  was  impossible to treat this application  with\r\n\r\nother  than  contempt.  Nevertheless,  we  were  on\r\n\r\nspeaking terms then, Mr Kandasamy, Sir, and I  did\r\n\r\nask  him, \"Let us have some more details.\" I waited\r\n\r\nfor  some time, until November, but no details were\r\n\r\nforthcoming.  By that time we were aware  that  the\r\n\r\nposition, so far as public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing went, was serious; that, in fact, the whole\r\n\r\nmachinery had run to a standstill. Hence my request\r\n\r\nto  him in November. \"For God's sake, get going  on\r\n\r\npublic  housing. Never mind the plan. We can  check\r\n\r\non that later.\" Far from being grateful that he got\r\n\r\naway  with  substantial sums of money, he  had  the\r\n\r\neffrontery  now to complain that he  had  not  been\r\n\r\ngiven his just due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that in any government, in any\r\n\r\ncountry, be it the most backward, if a Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of housing were to ask for $400 million  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of a scrap of paper, copies of  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  distributed  to Members, I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nreasonable  response that that Minister could  have\r\n\r\nexpected  was to have been packed up  to  a  mental\r\n\r\nhome to have his head examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it gives me no pleasure to dwell on the\r\n\r\ninadequacies  and follies of a former  Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government whose stupidities at that  time  we\r\n\r\nwere  responsible for.

I cannot  remember  having\r\n\r\ninstructed  him for this purpose, but I believe  it\r\n\r\nmust be about the 100 units of houses for the Malay\r\n\r\nsettlement in Jalan Eunos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister for Finance has said that\r\n\r\nthere  had been no plan and that he does  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat this was all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here a list of all contracts which had been accepted and their\r\n\r\nrespective dates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenstown. 26th October, 1959, 160 units,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Tiong Bahru, Phase I, 26th August. 1959,\r\n\r\n91 units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Tiong Bahru Fire Site, Phase II, 7th\r\n\r\nDecember. 1959, 470 units,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenstown, Contract 4, 10th December, 1959, 331\r\n\r\nunits,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Koo Chye Fire Site, 15th August, 1959, 192 units,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jalan Eunos Malay Settlement, 10th November, 1959, 120 units,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacPherson Road, 20th October, 1959, Piling Contractor, 2,360 units,\r\n\r\n<br><br>making a total of 3,732 units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh Keng Sweet On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I know whether the hon. Member\r\n\r\nwas reading from an official document or a copy  of\r\n\r\nan official document?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> That is not a point\r\n\r\nof order. It is a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  so  much. The schemes which were prepared  and\r\n\r\nready  to go out to tender by the end of the  month\r\n\r\n(that  is,  December 1959) and early the  following\r\n\r\nmonth  (that is, January 1960) were in  respect  of\r\n\r\n3,241  units,  making a total  of  6,973  units  by\r\n\r\nFebruary 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwas  trying  to confuse the matter by shifting  the\r\n\r\nissue.  He has learned a lot of debating techniques\r\n\r\nfrom the Prime Minister. What I was trying to drive\r\n\r\nat  just  now  was not on the $415 million  scheme.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a  different issue. It can  come  up  for\r\n\r\ndebate  at some other time-if I am still here.  But\r\n\r\nwhat I am raising today is the immediate issue  for\r\n\r\n1959  and  1960 -  the $7\u00bd million  voted  by  the\r\n\r\nformer  Government  on specific projects  like  the\r\n\r\nKampong  Tiong Bahru Fire Site and the Kampong  Koo\r\n\r\nChye  Fire  Site.  The Minister  for  Finance  even\r\n\r\nrefused  to  release this small sum of  money - $7\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that\r\n\r\nhe did not see the plans. In all the world, I never\r\n\r\nheard of a Minister for Finance who wants to use  a\r\n\r\nmicroscope to see whether the houses will stand  or\r\n\r\nnot.  As a matter of fact, I did not see the  plans\r\n\r\nmyself.  That  is the work of architects.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  we engage them for. They do the planning  and\r\n\r\nthe specifications, and they see whether the houses\r\n\r\ncan last or not. That is not for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just for clarification. The same\r\n\r\narchitect  who  is  now the head  of  the  Building\r\n\r\nSection of the present Housing Authority and who is\r\n\r\nputting  up a new five-year programme is  the  very\r\n\r\nsame  person who drafted and put up this  five-year\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  80,000 units.  I  promise  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir, that  the  houses  will  not\r\n\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one thing is clear. The Government is not\r\n\r\nsincere  in its planning programme, but  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat with all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressure against them now, they will start thinking\r\n\r\nit over and start building from now onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I despair of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim as to whether there is any spark  of\r\n\r\nhuman  reasoning in his mind. On the one  hand,  he\r\n\r\nboasts  of the fact that he has put up an  enormous\r\n\r\nnumber  of houses. On the other hand, he blames  me\r\n\r\nfor  not  having  given him enough money  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses.  I cannot follow the argument of  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember.  Either one statement is true or the  other\r\n\r\nis true. I am not interested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am not  interested  in\r\n\r\nwhether  his houses will collapse or not.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  point.  But when you ask for  substantial\r\n\r\nsums of money, it is necessary to back that request\r\n\r\nwith  full  details, not with a one-page  five-year\r\n\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nsaid that the same architect who did that piece  of\r\n\r\nwork  is  in  charge  of  the present  Government's\r\n\r\nhousing programme. It may well be so, but that does\r\n\r\nnot  excuse  the  hon. Member for putting  up  that\r\n\r\natrocious  piece  of  work  and  when  pressed  for\r\n\r\ndetails  he was unable to produce them.  Either  he\r\n\r\nhad  concocted this whole $400 million out  of  his\r\n\r\nown  mind - I  will not be surprised if that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase - or  he was unable to get across to  his  staff\r\n\r\nwhat exactly was wanted to substantiate his request\r\n\r\nfor  money. That is the important thing, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, In the case of the present  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National Development, it has been possible  for\r\n\r\nmy  colleague the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nand myself, as Minister for Finance, to get on very\r\n\r\neasily  whenever there are difficulties. There  are\r\n\r\ncertain  complicated  problems.  I  refer  to   the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  subsidy  which  was  left   to   our\r\n\r\nrespective  officers to solve  at  the  preliminary\r\n\r\nstage. There is the question of steering the course\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding   operations  to  fit  into  the   general\r\n\r\nframework   of  industry.  These  and  many   other\r\n\r\nquestions  are  relevant  to  budgeting   for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure. These  questions  can  be\r\n\r\nresolved   at   present   simply,   politely    and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.  But in the old  days,  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible.  The Member for Hong Lim either terrified\r\n\r\nthe staff out of their wits - there was a failure  of\r\n\r\ncommunication between himself and his  professional\r\n\r\nadvisers - or  he was unable to understand  what  the\r\n\r\nTreasury and the Minister for Finance wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have given the House sufficient details\r\n\r\nto  show  that the principal reason why he did  not\r\n\r\nget the money he asked for-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

And yet eventually he\r\n\r\ngot more than he asked for, and indeed more than he\r\n\r\ncould spend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say this in conclusion, Sir? All the things\r\n\r\nthat  the hon. Member has been saying are  just  to\r\n\r\nexplain to the public his dismal failure, his inept\r\n\r\nbungling when he was in charge of public housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nmention  that  at the time when my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, was not on  speaking  terms\r\n\r\nwith  the  ex-Minister for National Development,  I\r\n\r\nwas on friendly terms with him. I used to speak  to\r\n\r\nhim quite often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, $415 million is a very\r\n\r\nbig  sum  of money. If you will look at  the  first\r\n\r\npage  of the Estimates, you will see that the total\r\n\r\nrevenue  that we hope to collect for next  year  is\r\n\r\n$344  million, and our expenditure is $347 million.\r\n\r\nNow, $415 million is a very, very big sum of money.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember a single occasion when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe ex-Minister for National Development said to me\r\n\r\nthat  he was finding it difficult to get money  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  were differences between him  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. Nothing like that  was  ever\r\n\r\nsaid  to  any of us. I have been his colleague;  he\r\n\r\nhas  been  with  us; we have been  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committee of the  Party  and  we\r\n\r\nhave been members of the Cabinet. The first time  I\r\n\r\never  knew  that there was a plan for $415  million\r\n\r\nwas when I read it in the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You and I must have read it at the\r\n\r\nsame time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We read it at the same time. It was\r\n\r\nthe  first  time  I  knew about  this,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has a duty to discharge. There are many of us who want various things. But\r\n\r\nhe  is  the Minister who has to find the money.  On\r\n\r\nmany  occasions I tried to apply to him  for  money\r\n\r\nand  I  sometimes tried to get away with it, but  I\r\n\r\nnever succeeded. That is the way we have to do  our\r\n\r\nwork.  It  is his duty. He is the watchdog.  He  is\r\n\r\nlooking  after the taxpayers' money. And we respect\r\n\r\nhim  for  it.  We  cannot  expect  him  to  approve\r\n\r\neverything that we want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said publicly - in the way that the\r\n\r\nex-Minister   for   National  Development   made   his\r\n\r\nannouncement - and it did not involve such a big  sum\r\n\r\nthat  we  wanted  to build a court in  the  Kallang\r\n\r\narea. There has been a lot of work done with regard\r\n\r\nto  that  small item of expenditure. I  thought  we\r\n\r\ncould  get  a court house built for, say, $600,000.\r\n\r\nOn  a number of occasions, I have had meetings with\r\n\r\nGovernment  architects,  architects,  and  so   on.\r\n\r\nVarious  plans  have  had to  be  drafted.  Various\r\n\r\narchitects have had to be met. I met them myself. I\r\n\r\ndiscussed  the project with them. But they  advised\r\n\r\nthat a court could not be built unless for a larger\r\n\r\nsum of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are priorities and\r\n\r\nthey  are  considered by the Standing Committee  on\r\n\r\nPublic Works, They have ruled that for the present,\r\n\r\nbecause the sum involved is over $1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion,  they cannot give priority for the  court.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to accept it. That is the way we have  to\r\n\r\nwork  in the Government. We cannot just say,  \"Look\r\n\r\nhere,  I want the sum of $415 million. I must  have\r\n\r\nit.\"  That  is  not  the  way  any  government  can\r\n\r\noperate. Unfortunately for us, that is the way  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development had always  been\r\n\r\nacting when he used to be our colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir,I was\r\n\r\ndisappointed when the Member for Hong  Lim  made  a\r\n\r\npassing remark that he may not be here. So in  view\r\n\r\nof  that, I think I had better say what I  have  to\r\n\r\nsay now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a man experienced in planning houses and\r\n\r\nin  planning the housing programme. But if this  is\r\n\r\nall  that is required to be a house planner,  I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure, when the Member for Hong Lim intends to\r\n\r\nbuild  a house the next time, and if he will employ\r\n\r\nme   on  a  project  like  the  Kampong  Koo   Chye\r\n\r\nscheme - 219  units  to  be  built  in  1959  at   an\r\n\r\nestimated  cost of $900 each - that I am  capable  of\r\n\r\ndoing  this sort of thing myself without any  great\r\n\r\neffort.  And where the Member for Hong Lim said  it\r\n\r\ntook two weeks, I can do this sort of thing between\r\n\r\nnow  and tea-time and give him projects perhaps for\r\n\r\nthe next 20 years on that basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think he can interrupt when I\r\n\r\nhave finished what he has to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That  was  Albert  Einstein   who\r\n\r\ncompressed  a  lifetime of work in  a  very  simple\r\n\r\nformula  which,  I am told by Dr Toh,  who  is  an\r\n\r\neminent  scientist,  is E=MG2, which  produced  the\r\n\r\natom  bomb  and also provided the means  of  atomic\r\n\r\nenergy.  And here we have a little piece  of  paper\r\n\r\nwhich  would  produce thousands of  housing  units.\r\n\r\nThat,  Sir,  is  not  a plan which  requires  great\r\n\r\ningenuity on the part of any Minister to produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I could produce a plan like this\r\n\r\nin  half  an hour. In fact, I am gratified to  know\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister for Finance rejected this offer,\r\n\r\nand  I  would  be  horrified if  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance had given any Minister $400 million on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  a  paper like this. In  fact,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim has been trying to  present  a\r\n\r\npicture  of  the  Finance Minister which  seems  to\r\n\r\nimply that he is an avaricious man who holds on  to\r\n\r\nhis wealth and does not want to disburse his funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me give a definite illustration of how\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance works. Once upon a time  I\r\n\r\nsaid, \"I and the Minister for Finance get on like a\r\n\r\nhouse  on  fire.\" I may now say like two houses  on\r\n\r\nfire.  But when my Ministry asked for a few million\r\n\r\ndollars for television - and this is one part of  the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence that went on; I did  not  bring  the\r\n\r\nrest  as  there  are some three or  four  files  on\r\n\r\nthis - the Minister quite rightly wanted to know  how\r\n\r\nI  intended to spend something like $4 million.  It\r\n\r\nwas  a  long  correspondence calling  for  detailed\r\n\r\nplans.  So  I  can quite understand, when  somebody\r\n\r\nasks for $400 million, why the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nfights  shy  of approving money on the basis  of  a\r\n\r\ndocument which is not even worth the price  of  the\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one last point; earlier the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  claimed that by the time he left he had  plans\r\n\r\nin progress for some 6,700 units by February 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister, who was then acting as the Minister for National Development, revealed in\r\n\r\nthis  House  after making intensive  investigations\r\n\r\nthat  by  the time the former Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment left, only some 821 housing units  were\r\n\r\nin  process  of construction. And I am quite  sure,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  if  any of these plans had materialised \r\n\r\n- there is a well-known proverb which says that  the\r\n\r\nhen  which  lays even a small egg will  cluck  very\r\n\r\nloud,  as  loud as one which lays many eggs - and  if\r\n\r\nthere  had  been many houses completed  or  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of being completed, we would have heard  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal about it in the Press. But the fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  I cannot remember any housing estates or  big\r\n\r\nconstructions being proclaimed open by  the  former\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole\r\n\r\nhousing  policy  of the P.A.P. for five  years  was\r\n\r\nbeing  put forward to the people in less than  2\u00bd\r\n\r\npages.

It does appear a little bit confusing to\r\n\r\nhave  dental  huts, dental clinics, school  clinics\r\n\r\nand  the whole lot.

In the course of the next four\r\n\r\nyears,  it is proposed to group the various schools\r\n\r\ntogether  and provide dental service to  the  whole\r\n\r\nisland of Singapore.

In areas  where  schools\r\n\r\nare  congregated together, it is our  intention  to\r\n\r\nsave  on  overhead expenditure and staff emoluments\r\n\r\nby building a single dental clinic to cover 4, 5 or\r\n\r\n6 schools. It is because the Ministry of Health has\r\n\r\nthe convenience and the interests of the people  at\r\n\r\nheart that we make such definitions and build  such\r\n\r\ndifferent units of dental institutions to serve the\r\n\r\npeople.

Perhaps the Minister for Finance could  tell\r\n\r\nthe  House what has happened to those eight or nine\r\n\r\ncompanies  who  have had this favourable  treatment\r\n\r\nfrom the Government. Beyond that, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nalso  said  that there were a number of people  who\r\n\r\nhad   made   applications  to  start  projects   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  believe  the  Jurong  Site  is  also\r\n\r\nintended  for  such people. Could the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance tell the House whether the Jurong Site will\r\n\r\nbe  ready  for economic development, in  the  sense\r\n\r\nthat it will he able to receive these people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho will help in the industralisation of Singapore.\r\n\r\nOr  what  are the plans of the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard to spend this $40 million for the year 1961?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first\r\n\r\ntake  the point of the Member for Farrer Park  that\r\n\r\nnothing  is  being done in the way  of  encouraging\r\n\r\nindustralisation in Singapore. Sir,  in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  I  did give details of  the  number  of\r\n\r\napplications  we  have  had  for  pioneer  industry\r\n\r\nstatus  and  the  scope  and  magnitude  of   these\r\n\r\nproposals. This part of my Statement seems to  have\r\n\r\nescaped the attention of the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nand perhaps I may be excused if I were to read this\r\n\r\npassage  again. I say in column 18 of the  Official\r\n\r\nReport dated 29th November, 1960, Vol. 14. No. 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The rate of industrial expansion has shown\r\n\r\nimprovement since the last budget. There are now no\r\n\r\nless  than  54  projects under  various  stages  of\r\n\r\nconsideration  for  the award  of  pioneer  status.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six  projects can be considered to  be  firm\r\n\r\nproposals  and  gazette  notifications  have   been\r\n\r\nissued  or will soon be issued in respect of  those\r\n\r\nthat  qualify  for  pioneer  status.  The  two  oil\r\n\r\nrefineries have already been awarded pioneer status\r\n\r\nand  construction work has commenced. Some  of  the\r\n\r\nnew  industries for which pioneer status  is  being\r\n\r\nconsidered include the manufacture of a wide  range\r\n\r\nof   consumer   goods  such  as   condensed   milk,\r\n\r\nchocolates,  toothpaste, garments, matches  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. Among the major proposals are flour milling,\r\n\r\ntextile weaving and a steel rolling mill. The total\r\n\r\ncapital involved in all these projects is well over\r\n\r\n$100  million, and when they are in operation, they\r\n\r\nwould   provide  employment  for  more  than  2,500\r\n\r\nworkers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then I went on to say something about projects that\r\n\r\nwere still in their exploratory stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Farrer Park wants to have\r\n\r\ndetails as to what stages these industrial projects\r\n\r\nhave  reached, I shall be very happy to supply them\r\n\r\nto  him  provided  he wants this information  as  a\r\n\r\nMember   of   the   Assembly  and   provided   this\r\n\r\ninformation will not be used -as I am sure it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  used-for  any professional  purposes.  The\r\n\r\nreason is that when a firm or concern or a group of\r\n\r\npersons  decide  to  explore the  possibilities  of\r\n\r\nlaunching  a new enterprise, they are very  anxious\r\n\r\nthat there should be some secrecy about it. We have\r\n\r\nexperienced, at least on one occasion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere   premature  publicity  had  prejudiced   any\r\n\r\nprospect of development. But I do assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park that these are genuine  proposals\r\n\r\nmade to us - as far as we can judge - in good faith by\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  the capital  and  the  means  to\r\n\r\nestablish these industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have also made it clear that I do not\r\n\r\nconsider  that the volume of investments  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  so  far received is anything like the  volume\r\n\r\nthat we do need. And, if I may quote from my Budget\r\n\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In normal circumstances, industrial expansion of\r\n\r\nthe  scale  I  have  described  can  be  considered\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. However, in the present situation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with its population explosion, much  more\r\n\r\nis  required. An expansion of at least 2 to 3 times\r\n\r\nthe  present  rate  would be necessary.  Much  more\r\n\r\nneeds  to be   done  to accelerate  the  growth  of\r\n\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  do not think that the Member for Farrer Park can\r\n\r\nsay  that  we are making any extravagant claims  on\r\n\r\nwhat  has been achieved by our policy. But it  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  gross  exaggeration to say that nothing  has\r\n\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of any industry surely is\r\n\r\na  very  long and complicated process. If,  say,  a\r\n\r\nmanufacturer decides that he wants to open such and\r\n\r\nsuch a factory, there are many stages which he  has\r\n\r\nto  go through. He has to form a company; he has to\r\n\r\nraise the share capital; he has to acquire land; he\r\n\r\nhas  to  meet the requirements of the Master  Plan;\r\n\r\nthere  are  health regulations involved,  as  there\r\n\r\noften  are; he has to meet the health by-laws;  and\r\n\r\nif  there  is  a fire hazard, he has  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements laid down by the Fire Brigade, and  so\r\n\r\non  and  so  forth. Even when all  the  preliminary\r\n\r\ncalculations have been made - calculations  of  cost,\r\n\r\ncalculations  of  market, calculations  of  output;\r\n\r\nwhen  all  these have been made - the sheer physical\r\n\r\nwork  of starting a project would take anything  up\r\n\r\nto  two  years or more. And let us not forget,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that in 1959, before the  elections,\r\n\r\nthere was a complete standstill of the economy, and\r\n\r\nfor months after that too; and as a result of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscare   campaign  carried  out  by  the  opposition\r\n\r\nParties,  there  was  a  widespread  reluctance  to\r\n\r\ninvest. But I can assure the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nthat  we have passed that stage and we are  now  in\r\n\r\nthe  position  to say that the first initial  steps\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken  and that the response  has  been\r\n\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Economic Development Board, in the\r\n\r\nfirst  part of my speech I did say that it was  the\r\n\r\nintention  of Government to set up this Board  this\r\n\r\nyear, and that we would approach the World Bank for\r\n\r\nassistance  in  getting the top  personnel  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard. Getting the money is an easy matter; we have\r\n\r\nfinances and we can quite easily spare $40  million\r\n\r\nfor  the Board. But more important than money,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, are the men who are to use the money.\r\n\r\nWe  approached  the World Bank nearly  a  year  ago\r\n\r\nimmediately after the last Budget speech,  and  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank have cast the net far and wide in search\r\n\r\nof  top-level personnel who could be of  assistance\r\n\r\nto  us  in  establishing and running  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. We require different  types  of\r\n\r\nmen.  We  want  a  person  who  has  experience  in\r\n\r\nindustrial financing and who can evaluate the worth\r\n\r\nof a proposition when it is put to him by potential\r\n\r\ninvestors.  We need a person who has experience  as\r\n\r\nan  industrial consultant to act as adviser to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in initiating a programme of industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth.  We  need different types of engineers  who\r\n\r\ncan  advise  industry  and who  can,  if  need  be,\r\n\r\ndevelop  industrial projects which can be submitted\r\n\r\nto the potential investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But above all, because our situation is so\r\n\r\ncomplex  and  so  difficult, we  need  men  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest calibre. It is necessary to have men of the\r\n\r\nhighest  calibre  because  whatever  industries  we\r\n\r\nestablish  in  Singapore, they must  be  industries\r\n\r\nthat are competitive by world standards. The market\r\n\r\nin Singapore and even the Pan-Malayan market is not\r\n\r\nlarge enough to sustain major industrialisation  of\r\n\r\nmany   lines.   It  is  therefore  necessary   that\r\n\r\nindustrialisation    in   Singapore    should    be\r\n\r\ncompetitive in the export markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I think it would be useful for me to\r\n\r\nsay  a  few words about the progress that  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved in making recruitment to the top personnel\r\n\r\nof  the  Economic Development Board.  Although  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank had been most helpful, we were not  able\r\n\r\nfor  some  considerable  time  to  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  that  they made  fitted  into  our\r\n\r\nneeds.  They  recommended a number of persons,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  I  went to the United Kingdom last  August  I\r\n\r\ntook  advantage of that occasion to interview  some\r\n\r\nof  these  men. And my assessment was that although\r\n\r\nthese people are competent in their own fields  and\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  useful officers  if  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board had already been a going concern,\r\n\r\nthey lack the experience and the high quality,  the\r\n\r\ncreative  ability  which  is  needed  when  we  are\r\n\r\nstarting  a  new  project.  Accordingly,   to   our\r\n\r\ndisappointment,  we  were  unable  to  accept   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations then made up to that  date  by  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank. Then I went to Washington and discussed\r\n\r\nthe  subject with top officials of the  World  Bank\r\n\r\nitself.  The  idea  was discussed  that  a  certain\r\n\r\nprofessor  teaching  in the Israeli  Institutue  of\r\n\r\nTechnology in Haifa would be a suitable candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to know this professor myself, when I\r\n\r\nvisited  Israel  sometime  ago.  He  had   a   very\r\n\r\ndistinguished  record  in  the  Netherlands   Civil\r\n\r\nService  and,  if I remember correctly,  was  their\r\n\r\nadvisor  on organisation and served in the capacity\r\n\r\nas  industrial consultant. In addition to  teaching\r\n\r\nat the Israeli Institute of Technology in Haifa, he\r\n\r\nwas  also one of the industrial consultants of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Israel. The World Bank  thought  the\r\n\r\nnomination  a  good  one. It  so  happened  that  a\r\n\r\ndelegation of the Israeli Finance Ministry  was  in\r\n\r\nWashington  around that period, and it  was  agreed\r\n\r\nthat an approach could be made to this Professor to\r\n\r\naccept   appointment  as  Head  of   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it became clear that when we went to\r\n\r\nWashington, our policy of recruiting to a post  and\r\n\r\naccepting applications from whoever was willing  to\r\n\r\ntake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the job was a wrong policy, because if a man is\r\n\r\nreally  outstanding he would already be  performing\r\n\r\nsome  useful work either in private industry, in  a\r\n\r\nlocal authority, or in government, and the men  you\r\n\r\nwould get would either be mediocrities or, at best,\r\n\r\nless competent secondraters. You would not get your\r\n\r\ntop-level man, and that is the type of man we want.\r\n\r\nSo  the  Professor being engaged in teaching duties\r\n\r\nin Israel and engaged in a consultative capacity to\r\n\r\nthe   Israeli  Government,  we  had  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and  negotiations  with  the   Israeli\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  am very happy to  announce  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  these negotiations are successful  and\r\n\r\nthat Professor Cahen would be released next year to\r\n\r\ntake  up  duty in Singapore as Head of the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. He will be arriving in Singapore\r\n\r\nin February for preliminary talks, and he will take\r\n\r\nup his substantive appointment in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also surveyed the field for good technicians\r\n\r\nand   engineers  who  are  not  only  skilled   and\r\n\r\nexperienced   in   their   specialist   field    of\r\n\r\nengineering,  but  who have had experience  in  the\r\n\r\nplanning   of  industries  and  the  promotion   of\r\n\r\nindustries. And I am very happy to announce to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  we  have succeeded  in  obtaining  the\r\n\r\nservices  of  Mr Jangbir Singh to be Head  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Division  of the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard.  Mr  Singh  has  a  distinguished  academic\r\n\r\ncareer.  He  took First-class Honours in Mechanical\r\n\r\nEngineering in the University of London and won the\r\n\r\nBramwell  Gold Medal. He has many years' experience\r\n\r\nin the Planning Commission of the Indian Government\r\n\r\nand currently is Head of the Industrial Division of\r\n\r\nE.C.A.F.E.   Both   E.C.A.F.E. and   the   Indian\r\n\r\nGovernment were kind enough to release his services\r\n\r\nfor  work  in Singapore for a period of  two  years\r\n\r\ncommencing March next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have pressed on with\r\n\r\nrecruiting our local talent. And here again we have\r\n\r\nmet  with  perhaps  more success than  we  deserve.\r\n\r\nToday  I  am informed by the P.S.C. that they  have\r\n\r\nselected  perhaps  the most outstanding  mechanical\r\n\r\nengineer  to be produced by this country.  He  too,\r\n\r\nlike Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJangbir   Singh   took   First-class   Honours   in\r\n\r\nMechanical Engineering in the University of  London\r\n\r\nand won the Bramwell Gold Medal. There is also hope\r\n\r\nof   getting   a  chemical  engineer   trained   in\r\n\r\nAustralia, who has considerable experience  in  his\r\n\r\nline  and  who  has  won the  degree  of  Ph.D. in\r\n\r\nchemical engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the alternative open to us a year ago was to\r\n\r\npress  on  and  just get on with  the  job,  taking\r\n\r\nwhatever  men we could. We decided that if  we  had\r\n\r\ndone  so,  perhaps we could have started the  Board\r\n\r\nmuch  earlier  than  we  did.  But  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecided on a policy of putting quality of men above\r\n\r\neverything  else. Hence this delay in  getting  the\r\n\r\nBoard  going.  But  I think this  policy  will  pay\r\n\r\ndividends in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also sought expert advice pending the\r\n\r\nformation of our own panel of technicians. We  have\r\n\r\nsought expert advice from the United Nations,  and,\r\n\r\nas  the  House knows, the United Nations have  sent\r\n\r\ntwo  teams of experts, one on the establishment  of\r\n\r\nan  integrated steel industry in Singapore, and the\r\n\r\nother  a general industrial survey team. Perhaps  I\r\n\r\nmay  say  a  few words about the work of these  two\r\n\r\nteams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the team to study the establishment of\r\n\r\nan  integrated  steel industry  in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  had despatched  an  eminent  steel\r\n\r\ntechnologist  in Mr P. L. Schereschewsky.  But  he\r\n\r\nwas  merely the vanguard of a much larger  team  to\r\n\r\ncome.  He  has submitted his preliminary report  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government which has been studied, and I  will\r\n\r\nsay  no  more  than  that it  gives  a  picture  of\r\n\r\nrestrained optimism. It is feasible in his opinion.\r\n\r\nThere are certain difficulties, both technical  and\r\n\r\neconomic, that have to be overcome. Later next year\r\n\r\nhe  will return to Singapore with a fuller team  of\r\n\r\nexperts  in all technical processes connected  with\r\n\r\nthe steel industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the United Nations general industrial\r\n\r\nsurvey  team, they have completed their preliminary\r\n\r\nfindings, and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreceived  the  report only yesterday.  Naturally  I\r\n\r\ncannot claim, in the short time available to me, to\r\n\r\nhave  digested  all  that is said  in  the  report,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is a lengthy report. I would  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  commission was headed by a most able  man - Dr\r\n\r\nWinsemius - who has a distinguished career both as  a\r\n\r\ncivil  servant and as an entrepreneur. He has taken\r\n\r\na  very  realistic approach to this problem.  About\r\n\r\nhis recommendations, so far as I can reveal them, I\r\n\r\nmay  say  that  it is an open question  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  publish this report because there are  many\r\n\r\npoints  of advice on policy and industrial strategy\r\n\r\nwhich   we  think  we  should  keep  to  ourselves.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  so  far as I can  make  public,  his\r\n\r\nrecommendations fall into two broad groups.  First,\r\n\r\nthe  immediate  future, and second,  the  long-term\r\n\r\nview.  For  the immediate future, he recommended  a\r\n\r\ncrash  programme of industrialisation to absorb  as\r\n\r\nmuch  of  our  unemployed workers as  possible.  He\r\n\r\nrecommended  that we pay special attention  to  our\r\n\r\nposition as the fifth biggest seaport in the world.\r\n\r\nHe thought that more Singaporeans could he employed\r\n\r\non board ocean-going ships than is now the case. He\r\n\r\nhas, on his own initiative, met various ship-owners\r\n\r\nand  asked  them whether or not they  could  employ\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans. And he has advised Government on\r\n\r\nhow  we could bring about a much greater employment\r\n\r\nof  workers  on  board  ships plying  international\r\n\r\nroutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other project on which he has advised us to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  in the immediate future is  to  extend\r\n\r\nthe  ship-breaking  industry, because  this  is  an\r\n\r\nindustry  that has a ready market, and in the  case\r\n\r\nof Singapore, a ready supply of ships to be broken.\r\n\r\nFurther,  it  is  an  industry that  employs  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  workers with a very  small  amount  of\r\n\r\ncapital investment. If the Member for Hong Lim were\r\n\r\nhere, I would perhaps go into a dissertation on the\r\n\r\nship-breaking industry, in particular  the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Member for Hong Lim did his  utmost  to\r\n\r\nstifle this industry. However, he is not here to be\r\n\r\nat  the  receiving end, and I will merely say  that\r\n\r\nthe  proposals  of the U.N. team are being  studied\r\n\r\nwith great care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have more than a sporting chance, much\r\n\r\nmore than a sporting chance, of making a success of\r\n\r\nit in the immediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the long-term future. Of course,\r\n\r\nthis  depends  on having your Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  set up which has funds and men to lend money\r\n\r\nto the industry that wants to be set up here; which\r\n\r\nhas  technicians to assist our industry to work out\r\n\r\nnew  projects;  and which has men  who  can  go  to\r\n\r\nintending  investors  with a  case  that  has  been\r\n\r\nexamined  and worked out-a proposition  which  they\r\n\r\ncan accept or at least examine with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific technical reports of the U.N. team\r\n\r\nhave  not all been completed, but it is likely that\r\n\r\nby  March  or  April next year, we  will  have  the\r\n\r\ntechnical   reports  from  the  U.N. team.   These\r\n\r\ntechnical reports will lay down what industries can\r\n\r\nbe  established in Singapore, taking  into  account\r\n\r\nthe  market  for  the product, the sources  of  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials,  the  supply of power, skilled  workmen,\r\n\r\nroads  and so forth. Then, of course, we have  also\r\n\r\nasked the Japanese Government to design a plan  for\r\n\r\nthe  development  of the Jurong Industrial  Estate.\r\n\r\nBut  since  this  particular item  deals  with  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board, perhaps  I  will  deal\r\n\r\nwith it when we come to the second amendment.*\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (2), standing in the name of Mr A.P.

One, of course, is our present port  area,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Harbour Board, and the other one  is\r\n\r\nat Jurong. With this in view, we have decided that,\r\n\r\nif there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  a substantial rate of industrialisation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there must be an area reserved for these\r\n\r\nindustries  which have access to deep-sea  vessels,\r\n\r\nsimply  because  there  are  no  raw  materials  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Whatever  raw materials  our  factories\r\n\r\nneed  must be imported from overseas. To cut a long\r\n\r\nstory  short,  Mr Speaker, Sir, after  I  returned\r\n\r\nfrom   Japan,  I  was  greatly  impressed  by   the\r\n\r\ntremendous expansion of the Japanese industry,  and\r\n\r\naccordingly, I have decided that it may be  a  very\r\n\r\ngood idea to ask the Japanese Government to send  a\r\n\r\nteam  of  industrial  planners  and  engineers   to\r\n\r\ndevelop this plan for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made, for the purposes of a five-year\r\n\r\nplan, a preliminary rough plan as regards the area,\r\n\r\nthe  siting of wharves, railways, and so on and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  The Japanese team, which included  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir  top planners in the Japanese Ministry,  came\r\n\r\nhere  some time ago, and they have submitted  their\r\n\r\npreliminary report. In their opinion, the scale  on\r\n\r\nwhich we are thinking is rather on the low side; we\r\n\r\nwanted  an  area of 5,000 acres, and  they  thought\r\n\r\nthat  that  was  much too small. They  have  nearly\r\n\r\ntrebled  the size of the site and are making  plans\r\n\r\nfor the larger area. The U.N. experts on industrial\r\n\r\nplanning  thought that we should plan for a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod  and have marked off an area five times  the\r\n\r\narea  we  originally intended.  Anyway,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nimagine  that within the next five years  we  shall\r\n\r\nhave  enough industries to fill, say, 25,000 acres.\r\n\r\nI  doubt that very much. It will take some time  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the design because a lot of the  details,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the topographic map, the soundings of  the\r\n\r\nsea  and the straits off Jurong, have not been made\r\n\r\nin   detail  and  to  the  specification  that  the\r\n\r\nJapanese planners need. Various departments of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  such  as  the Survey  Department,  the\r\n\r\nMaster Attendant's Department, the P.W.D., the Land\r\n\r\nOffice and so on are embarking on a crash programme\r\n\r\nto get the data in time for the Japanese experts to\r\n\r\ncomplete their final detailed plans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearly enough.

The second one, sub-head 11,\r\n\r\nwhich   you   are  taking  together,   relates   to\r\n\r\ntelevision works and buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first, as you know. Sir, a couple\r\n\r\nof  months  ago,  two  experts  from  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Corporation  came  here  and  made  a\r\n\r\nreport,  and  our project for television  is  based\r\n\r\nmore  or less on their recommendations. I can state\r\n\r\nbriefly  what will be the nature of the  television\r\n\r\noutfit. Firstly, the studios will be sited at Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because it is cheaper to do so,  though\r\n\r\nwe are told that perhaps in future years television\r\n\r\nmight have to be a completely separate outfit.  But\r\n\r\nfor  the  next  few years, we find  it  cheaper  to\r\n\r\noperate  it  as  part of Radio  Singapore,  so  the\r\n\r\nstudios  will be sited at Radio Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\ntransmitter will be sited at Bukit Batok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures which were submitted were roughly\r\n\r\nestimated  by the Japanese experts. So there  might\r\n\r\nhave  to be some alterations one way or the  other.\r\n\r\nBut $2,740,000 is the rough figure given to us, of\r\n\r\nwhich  we  propose to spend $1,300,000 in 1961.  We\r\n\r\nalso  have a plan for the training of the necessary\r\n\r\nstaff  for  television both for the  technical  and\r\n\r\nprogramme sides. This plan is being worked out  and\r\n\r\nit  involves  the training of some of the  existing\r\n\r\nstaff  in  Radio Singapore for television work  and\r\n\r\nalso the recruiting from outside for the purpose of\r\n\r\ntraining.  As  far  as  the  actual  channels   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it is intended to start  off  with  two\r\n\r\ntransmissions to operate initially for four hours a\r\n\r\nday in all the four languages.

The   types   of\r\n\r\nprogrammes  will  be, first, educational,  possibly\r\n\r\nfor  schools; and, second, the transmission of news\r\n\r\nin  the  nature  of newsreels relating  to  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  because  we  can  get  them  from  foreign\r\n\r\nagencies, and also local news in the form of films,\r\n\r\nsports and cultural performances. In fact, we  hope\r\n\r\nto  relate television to the National Theatre where\r\n\r\nperformances  can  both be shown for  the \r\n\r\ntheatre-going  audience as well as broadcasts which can  be\r\n\r\nviewed in the homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain type of programme will be introduced.\r\n\r\nFor  example, I am told that sports programmes  can\r\n\r\nbe broadcast in all the languages in the sense that\r\n\r\nthey  are visual and most of them need very  little\r\n\r\ncommentary. You might even have to experiment  with\r\n\r\ntwo   or   three  commentators  chipping   in   and\r\n\r\nintroducing a few sentences to help the  viewer  to\r\n\r\nunderstand what is going on. But as regards certain\r\n\r\nother   types   of  programmes,  especially   local\r\n\r\nprogrammes  Chinese, Malay and  Tamil - the  bulk  of\r\n\r\nthem  will  have to be produced here because  these\r\n\r\nare  not  available from abroad in these languages.\r\n\r\nSome of the films, for example, instructional films\r\n\r\ncan  be  put across by using sub-titles and can  be\r\n\r\nbroadcast  in  English  with sub-titles  in  Malay,\r\n\r\nChinese and Tamil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in licence fees, I cannot\r\n\r\ngive  the  precise details but I can give  you  the\r\n\r\nbasis  on  which the fees have been worked  out  in\r\n\r\nother  countries. By and large, I  understand  that\r\n\r\nyou  can increase by about 20 to 30 per cent of the\r\n\r\nexisting  fees,  but  that  depends  on  how   long\r\n\r\ntelevision  shows are going to be put  on.  We  may\r\n\r\nstart on a small scale with each language programme\r\n\r\nfor  only  one  or two hours a day, and  as  we  go\r\n\r\nalong, we may have to increase the length of  time.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have to work out the fees in terms of  what\r\n\r\nour  ultimate showing time will be. On that  basis,\r\n\r\nthere is a table which has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  worked  out but I cannot give details  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat the actual fees will be.

KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first, the expenditure of over $4\r\n\r\nmillion on television is no more a waste of  public\r\n\r\nfunds  than  spending money on libraries,  museums,\r\n\r\nart   galleries  and  radio,  because   television,\r\n\r\nespecially in a multi-lingual society like ours, is\r\n\r\na    powerful   and   effective   instrument    for\r\n\r\ntranscending language barriers and also because  in\r\n\r\ntelevision we have a medium using visual images and\r\n\r\nto  that  extent we can overcome language barriers.\r\n\r\nFurther,   it  is  a  very  effective  medium   for\r\n\r\neducational purposes. I was in Japan a  few  months\r\n\r\nago. One of the things that were told to me by  the\r\n\r\nteachers there was that, as a result of television,\r\n\r\nthe powers of comprehension of a child increased by\r\n\r\nsomething  like  100  per  cent.  Because   through\r\n\r\ntelevision a child can realise what a desert  looks\r\n\r\nlike, what Paris looks like, and what a green  belt\r\n\r\nof tropical forest looks like. The children can see\r\n\r\nhistorical  episodes  and they  can  get  a  better\r\n\r\nimpression of what they can only read in books  and\r\n\r\nimagine themselves. So there is no doubt about  the\r\n\r\nvalue  and  effectiveness  of  television,  because\r\n\r\nevery country today realises that television is  as\r\n\r\nessential as radio and the many other types of mass\r\n\r\nmedia.   Therefore,  I  do  not  agree   with   the\r\n\r\ncontention that we cannot afford to spend this  sum\r\n\r\nof money on television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government intends to sustain\r\n\r\ntelevision  by  introducing  commercial  programmes\r\n\r\ninto  television. In fact, the experts are  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that, instead of the odd $4 million going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown the drain, it will bring in revenue to justify\r\n\r\nthat  expenditure, apart from the effectiveness  of\r\n\r\ntelevision   in   educating  and   increasing   the\r\n\r\nintellectual and cultural level of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question whether we should hand\r\n\r\nthis  over  to a corporation, I see no  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis.  For  many years the radio has  been  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of this Government, and in the hands of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  government  and  many  other  governments\r\n\r\nbefore.  There is no particular reason  why  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  put  it  into  the   hands   of   a\r\n\r\ncorporation.  Because at this stage we  think  that\r\n\r\nthe Government can use television or any other mass\r\n\r\nmedia  effectively  to achieve  certain  objectives\r\n\r\nwhich we have in mind, including the creation of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture and a Malayan consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr\r\n\r\nThio Chan Bee and Tun Lim Yew Hock:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head D47 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I would like  to  say  that\r\n\r\nPulau Senang, which is in the neighbourhood of  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands, is an island which originally had\r\n\r\nuseful  materials for the people  of  the  Southern\r\n\r\nislands.  For  example,  according  to  information\r\n\r\ngiven  to me, there is plenty of fish in the waters\r\n\r\naround  Pulau Senang, and the islanders often  went\r\n\r\nthere  to  catch  fish. Moreover, this  island  has\r\n\r\ntrees which provided the islanders with material to\r\n\r\nconstruct kelong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Pulau Senang island has now become a\r\n\r\nprotected area, the islanders have been deprived of\r\n\r\nthe fish and the trees. I do not question that. But\r\n\r\nI  wish to draw the attention of the authorities to\r\n\r\nthe  prohibition to fish in the waters and to being\r\n\r\nchallenged by the guards on the island.  This  does\r\n\r\nnot   mean   that  I  am  protesting  against   the\r\n\r\nprohibition  to  land on the island,  as  it  is  a\r\n\r\nprotected  area, but I feel that fishermen  who  go\r\n\r\nthere  in search of fish could be distinguished  as\r\n\r\ndwellers   in  the  Southern  Islands,   as   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood is fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to this matter, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncould   appreciate  the  difficulties   which   the\r\n\r\ndwellers of the Southern Islands face.

It has  prepared  figures\r\n\r\nfrom   statistics,  and  owing  to  the  population\r\n\r\nincrease,  it  is  felt that the Government  should\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  build the equivalent of  19  schools\r\n\r\neach  year,  14  of which would be  primary  and  5\r\n\r\nsecondary, and which, if all these 19 schools could\r\n\r\nbe  erected each year, would take in an anticipated\r\n\r\nenrolment of 40.000 per year. As I said earlier  on\r\n\r\nduring  the  Main Estimates debate,  a  responsible\r\n\r\ngovernment  should not avoid the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nproviding  education  for its  citizens,  and  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is proceeding along those lines. In  the\r\n\r\npast,  it  is  true that aided schools have  played\r\n\r\ntheir   part  in  providing  education  where   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has failed. But I think the  time  must\r\n\r\nsoon   come  when  Government  must  shoulder   its\r\n\r\nresponsibility to provide education for as many  as\r\n\r\npossible in its schools. But it does not mean  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  push  out aided schools if they  wish  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and erect new buildings, for which capital\r\n\r\naid  will still be available. But I must warn those\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  aided  schools  that  we  are  only\r\n\r\nreserving $1 million per annum as capital  aid  for\r\n\r\naided  schools, because we cannot do it both  ways.\r\n\r\nWe  ourselves go in for a large building  programme\r\n\r\nof  about $11 million a year and, at the same time,\r\n\r\noffer millions of dollars to aided schools. So with\r\n\r\nthat  as  a conditional qualification, we  will  be\r\n\r\nvery  pleased  if  aided schools will  continue  to\r\n\r\nbuild new schools where this dollar-for-dollar  aid\r\n\r\nwill be available, but it is only restricted to  $1\r\n\r\nmillion per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  agree  that it is only  right  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  the one to shoulder the main responsibility for\r\n\r\nthe   education  of  the  children  of   Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it was with great reluctance  that  when\r\n\r\nthe Government approached the aided schools for the\r\n\r\nuse  of  available classrooms in the afternoon,  we\r\n\r\nagreed,  because we realised that  by  agreeing  to\r\n\r\nexpansion at this time it would mean an increase in\r\n\r\nour  own problems. I do not think, Sir, that  aided\r\n\r\nschools want to compete with Government schools  in\r\n\r\nexpanding  their  facilities, because  economically\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  in a position to compete  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But if because of circumstances  a  few\r\n\r\naided schools are compelled to go further and start\r\n\r\nbuilding   schools   because   of   this   enforced\r\n\r\nexpansion, would the Government make available  any\r\n\r\nof  their  sites,  at the cost that  they  acquired\r\n\r\nthem,  to enable the aided schools - I must say  that\r\n\r\nonly  a  few of them would be able to do  that -  to\r\n\r\nbuild  new  buildings or new schools  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsolve their own problems? Of course, the Government\r\n\r\nwould  give them a dollar-for-dollar grant, but  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  in  practice usually the aided  schools\r\n\r\nhave to spend more than what Government gives them.\r\n\r\nBut   sites  are  difficult  to  find,  and   since\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  gained almost a  monopoly  on  the\r\n\r\nsuitable sites, then we hope, if the aided  schools\r\n\r\nfind  it  necessary to ask Government  for  aid  in\r\n\r\nhaving  a  few of the sites marked for acquisition,\r\n\r\nthe Government would give the necessary assistance.\r\n\r\nI  wonder  whether the Minister could  give  us  an\r\n\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsubject to what I have said just now, I am prepared\r\n\r\nto  give  the assurance.

Here again, it has been the practice\r\n\r\nin  the  past  for aided schools to  build  schools\r\n\r\nwhich are of a much higher standard than Government\r\n\r\nschools.  I think that is a very peculiar state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.

It takes some time to plan  for\r\n\r\na   school  and  to  really  see  it  coming   into\r\n\r\noperation.  But,  in any case,  under  the  1959/60\r\n\r\nbuilding programme, two secondary schools have been\r\n\r\nreserved  for the Malay medium, the first of  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  at  Aljunied, which should be  ready  for\r\n\r\noccupation in September 1961. The second  one  will\r\n\r\nbe  at  the  junction of Wilkinson and  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nRoads, which will be known as the Kallang Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool, but which, unfortunately, because of piling\r\n\r\ndifficulties, will not, I think, be available until\r\n\r\nAugust 1962. As for the 1961 building programme, we\r\n\r\nhave not made any definite provisions yet. We shall\r\n\r\nbuild  the  schools and if we find that the  demand\r\n\r\nfor   a   particular  language  medium  school   is\r\n\r\nrequired,  then it is reserved for that  particular\r\n\r\nlanguage medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, Sir,\r\n\r\naccording  to the explanation given,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nMalay secondary school to be built for 1961, but it\r\n\r\nwill  be considered according to future demands.

I  feel  it is necessary  for  a  secondary\r\n\r\nschool to be built in Pasir Panjang, especially for\r\n\r\nthose  students who live there. I know it is  quite\r\n\r\nfar  for them to go to and from their schools, and,\r\n\r\ntherefore. I would like the Minister, in  his  plan\r\n\r\nfor   next  year,  to  consider  building  a  Malay\r\n\r\nsecondary school at Pasir Panjang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

I feel that this is necessary because there\r\n\r\nare many children who have to go out of the area to\r\n\r\nattend school. It would be better if a school could\r\n\r\nbe built in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, the point\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Member for the Southern Islands is\r\n\r\nvery  much in the minds of Government. In fact,  in\r\n\r\nthe  building  of  schools, we are endeavouring  to\r\n\r\nbuild primary schools in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   city  areas  and  secondary  schools  in  the\r\n\r\noutlying  areas, so that the younger children  will\r\n\r\nnot  have to travel too much by bus, but the  elder\r\n\r\nboys  could move more freely when they go by public\r\n\r\nvehicles.  We  also  plan to have  our  schools  so\r\n\r\nsituated  as  to meet the needs of the  population.\r\n\r\nThat is why in congested areas the schools would be\r\n\r\nmulti-storey - a six-storey school at Silat Road and\r\n\r\na  10-storey  school  at the  Selegie/Short  Street\r\n\r\nsite.  It  is our intention, therefore,  since  the\r\n\r\nfirst  two Malay secondary schools would be in  the\r\n\r\neastern region of the island of Singapore, i.e. at\r\n\r\nthe  junction  of  Mountbatten and Wilkinson  Roads\r\n\r\nplus Aljunied Road, that the third secondary school\r\n\r\nwould  very  likely be on the western side  of  the\r\n\r\nisland, which would be around Pasir Panjang. But  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  will  first find a site  and  then  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will build it around these parts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that also would be the answer to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kembangan. It is  very  likely\r\n\r\nthat  the  secondary school which we will build  at\r\n\r\nJalan  Kaki Bukit - we are already going to  build  a\r\n\r\nprimary  school there and we have an area  reserved\r\n\r\nfor  a secondary school - may be turned into a Malay\r\n\r\nsecondary  school. I think sometimes it  is  a  bit\r\n\r\ndifficult  to pinpoint a certain area  and  say  we\r\n\r\nwould  like  a  school to be built  there,  because\r\n\r\nsometimes  it is not possible to acquire  the  site\r\n\r\nfor  certain  reasons. But we  shall  endeavour  to\r\n\r\nbuild  as  close  as possible in  areas  where  the\r\n\r\ndemand has to be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  just  now  said  that  in  certain  very\r\n\r\ncrowded  areas, he proposed to have erected  \r\n\r\nmulti-storey buildings for schools. If these multi-storey\r\n\r\nbuildings   are  to  be  used  by  primary   school\r\n\r\nchildren,  I wonder if it is a good thing  for  the\r\n\r\nsmall  children  to be in such schools,  because  I\r\n\r\ntake  it  that it necessarily implies the provision\r\n\r\nof  lifts.  The  experience of housing  authorities\r\n\r\nwhere  multi-storey  flats have  been  erected  and\r\n\r\nlifts provided even where adults live, has not been\r\n\r\nvery  satisfactory. That is the  first  point  that\r\n\r\noccurs to me, Mr Kandasamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is what provision the Minister\r\n\r\nproposes  to make in respect of playing fields  for\r\n\r\nthese  multi-storey  sites. Is  he  proposing  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be a common user of  playgrounds  in\r\n\r\nrespect of these multi-storey buildings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, as to the first point\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Farrer Park, here again it\r\n\r\nis  a question of choice between what is ideal  and\r\n\r\nwhat is practical. These are days when, because  of\r\n\r\nland  shortage, flats are being built for citizens;\r\n\r\nwhereas  in the past, everyone could have a  little\r\n\r\nplot of land a little away from town, perhaps,  and\r\n\r\nhave  all the advantages of living space. So it  is\r\n\r\nnot something new for the citizens of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  staying  in flats that are \r\n\r\neither 7-storey,  9-storey or even 11-storey, and the children will  be\r\n\r\nliving in such fiats. It can be safely assumed that\r\n\r\nadequate precautions would be taken regarding the \r\n\r\noperation  of lifts and even for teachers  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  children when they  move  up  in  these\r\n\r\nlifts.  This  multi-storey school  where  the  lift\r\n\r\ndifficulty  would arise will be the one at  Selegie\r\n\r\nRoad, because the one in Silat Road, although it is\r\n\r\na six-storey school, will have the approach road to\r\n\r\nthe  third  floor. So it is a question  of  walking\r\n\r\neither  three  flights up or walking three  flights\r\n\r\ndown. So I think the Selegie/Short Street 10-storey\r\n\r\nschool building could be regarded as a sort  of  an\r\n\r\nexperiment. If it is proved successful, then we may\r\n\r\nconsider   building   more  of  such   multi-storey\r\n\r\nschools;  but  if  it  does  not  prove  to  be  as\r\n\r\nsatisfactory as we had hoped for, then it could  be\r\n\r\nconverted,  I think, to a post-primary  school  for\r\n\r\nchildren who are in their teens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question posed by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park has escaped my notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Playgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Playgrounds.

Further requests were also  made\r\n\r\nby  the  residents  of a forgotten  kampong - Kampong\r\n\r\nPaya  - for  a  bridge  and an approach  road.  Here\r\n\r\nagain,  nothing  happened. If I may  say  something\r\n\r\nabout   this  forgotten  kampong,  it   is   almost\r\n\r\ncompletely  surrounded  by marshy  land.  The  only\r\n\r\napproach  road  there is mostly unusable  in  rainy\r\n\r\nweather  due to prolonged flooding.
