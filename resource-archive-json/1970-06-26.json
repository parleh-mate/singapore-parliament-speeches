We must maintain a free flow of traffic\r\n\r\non    our    roads.   This   is   the   unavoidable\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the Ministry of  Communications.\r\n\r\nHowever,   as  far  as  this  amendment   Bill   is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  there is limited scope for solving  the\r\n\r\ntraffic problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill contains provisions which deal only\r\n\r\nwith  the  load  of vehicles, the  control  of  the\r\n\r\nemission of smoky exhausts, the compulsory  wearing\r\n\r\nof   crash  helmets,  the  enhancement  of  certain\r\n\r\npenalties  and  so on. This is only  a  superficial\r\n\r\nattempt   to   solve  our  traffic   problem.   The\r\n\r\nfundamental  problem  of traffic  congestion  still\r\n\r\nremains.  For example, the revision of  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport system, the widening of our roads and the\r\n\r\nsafety of road users -these problems have not  been\r\n\r\ntouched   upon.  Nevertheless,  since  the  traffic\r\n\r\nproblem  is  becoming worse and worse,  even  these\r\n\r\nminor measures are helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the International Seminar on Road Safety, which was held in the Republic and which ended yesterday, tried to find solutions to minimise road accidents. It is expected that this seminar will make many recommendations so that we and other governments\r\n\r\nwill benefit from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now touch upon certain provisions in the Bill. One of them relates to the compulsory wearing of crash helmets by motor cyclists. This is a very good provision because it will ensure their safety. It will also reduce the rate of fatal accidents among them. The fact that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has compelled them  to  wear  crash\r\n\r\nhelmets  has resulted in a great demand  for  these\r\n\r\nhelmets  and, because of this, the price of helmets\r\n\r\nhas gone up. This will impose a great burden on the\r\n\r\nusers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  these  helmets. I hope the Minister will  adopt\r\n\r\nmeasures to ensure that the price of crash  helmets\r\n\r\nis reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clause in this Bill provides that certain\r\n\r\ncategories of traffic offenders will have to pay  a\r\n\r\ncomposition fine of $50 instead of the present fine\r\n\r\nof  $20.  Although the increase in the  composition\r\n\r\nfine will act as a deterrent on the regular traffic\r\n\r\noffenders,  it  is,  however, in  my  view,  a  bit\r\n\r\nexcessive. If it is only a very minor offence, such\r\n\r\nas  parking in a non-parking area or waiting beside\r\n\r\na  white line, then a fine of $50 in such cases  is\r\n\r\nvery unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, taxi drivers will be the people most affected by this regulation because they spend most of their 24 hours on the road in order to earn their livelihood. If the fine is increased to this extent, their livelihood will be made more difficult. In view of this, I suggest that in the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of such legislation,  consideration\r\n\r\nshould  be  given to the merits of each  case.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  those minor cases which I have  mentioned\r\n\r\nshould not fall within the ambit of this provision.\r\n\r\nBut  in the case of rash and inconsiderate drivers,\r\n\r\nspeedsters  or those who dash past traffic  lights,\r\n\r\nthereby endangering the lives of other people,  the\r\n\r\npunishment  should be adequate in order  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat such people obey the traffic rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment Bill reminds me of the policemen on traffic duty and their attitude towards their work. Perhaps this may not have any direct bearing on this Bill, but I wish to mention the traffic police in passing. If the Minister for Communications cannot answer my points. I think the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Defence will do so. I have  received\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  members of the  public  that  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  police are on the road not to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nfree   flow  of  traffic,  but  to  catch   traffic\r\n\r\noffenders.  They  hide  behind  pillars  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces and keep watch on passing vehicles. Why  are\r\n\r\nthey  doing  this?  They do it because,  by  hiding\r\n\r\nthemselves from the motorists, they will be able to\r\n\r\ncatch those who break the traffic rules, take  down\r\n\r\nthe numbers of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicles,  send  them summonses and probably  bring\r\n\r\nthem  to  court.  Of course, I agree  that  traffic\r\n\r\noffenders  must be brought to book and  dealt  with\r\n\r\naccording to the law. This is part of the duties of\r\n\r\nthe traffic police. But I think you will agree with\r\n\r\nme,  Sir,  that  they have more  onerous  and  more\r\n\r\nimportant  duties to perform, i.e., the maintenance\r\n\r\nof  a  smooth  and orderly flow of traffic  on  our\r\n\r\nroads.  It is not their duty to hide behind pillars\r\n\r\nand  other  places to catch traffic  offenders.  If\r\n\r\nthey  do  this,  how can they direct  the  flow  of\r\n\r\ntraffic? This attitude is not correct and should be\r\n\r\nrectified  accordingly. I do not know  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned agrees with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though this amendment Bill is very limited in scope, it is by all standards a necessity aimed at promoting the free flow of traffic and ensuring the safety of pedestrians so that the roads will no longer remain, as the saying goes, the mouth of the tiger. In view of this, I\r\n\r\nsupport this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I thought there was going\r\n\r\nto be a further debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J.

But  at  the\r\n\r\ninvitation  of  the Minister for Communications,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say a few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that I agree with the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang that this Bill has a limited application?\r\n\r\nIt  is,  however,  an earnest of  the  Government's\r\n\r\ndesire  to improve the conditions of road  traffic.\r\n\r\nBut   in  respect  of  specific  aspects  of   such\r\n\r\nconditions, this Bill relates to action to be taken\r\n\r\nagainst  excessive  emission of smoke.  It  ensures\r\n\r\nsafety for those on motor cycles, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  gives  power to the Government to  take  action\r\n\r\nagainst    those   vehicles   that   are    causing\r\n\r\nobstruction.  But  the question  of  road  traffic,\r\n\r\nsafety, observance of regulations, I think,  has  a\r\n\r\nwider  reference.  Any  motorist  can  notice   the\r\n\r\nflagrant flouting of traffic laws in the very short\r\n\r\ndistance  that  he  takes  to  cover  the   minimum\r\n\r\njourney. I think this flouting of traffic laws will\r\n\r\nresult  in  the  law  itself  being  brought   into\r\n\r\ndisrespect. The whole problem of road safety,  road\r\n\r\ncourtesy, and road traffic has to be viewed in  its\r\n\r\ntotal  context. It is hoped that there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nvigorous  attempt  to instil into  our  citizens  a\r\n\r\nrespect  for the laws of the road and  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsocial  discipline where the use  of  the  road  is\r\n\r\nconcerned. This Bill does indicate that  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  certain amount of education preceding  the\r\n\r\nintention now to implement rigorously those aspects\r\n\r\nwhich,  as I have said, relate to excessive  smoke,\r\n\r\nto  the use of crash helmets and to obstruction.  I\r\n\r\nwould   earnestly  ask  the  responsible  Ministers\r\n\r\nconcerned to think of a serious campaign to educate\r\n\r\nroad-users on their responsibilities and, following\r\n\r\nthis education campaign, to implement as rigorously\r\n\r\nother  aspects of traffic laws as those which  this\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to  implement in respect  of  what  is\r\n\r\ncontained here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally, say, Sir, that besides the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  simple implementation, there  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion of furnishing our police officers with the\r\n\r\nnecessary  equipment and manpower to do  their  job\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall, I would like to answer the comment made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang on the price of crash helmets\r\n\r\nhaving gone up since Government decided to make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory for learner drivers of motor cycles  and\r\n\r\nscooters to wear crash helmets. It is true that the\r\n\r\nprice  has moved up somewhat compared to the  price\r\n\r\nexisting  prior to the announcement  by  Government\r\n\r\nthat  it would be necessary for motor cyclists  and\r\n\r\nscooterists to wear crash helmets. But  before  the\r\n\r\nGovernment announcement was made, it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible  for  importers to bring in crash  helmets\r\n\r\nwhich looked nice but would riot pass the test  and\r\n\r\nthe  specifications  which would  be  necessary  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to be approved. Although the  cost  of\r\n\r\nsuch a test would not have materially increased the\r\n\r\nprice,  I  think  ii is probably because  too  many\r\n\r\npeople decided to rush to buy the crash helmets  at\r\n\r\na  certain  given  time. We  feel  that  any  price\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  import of  such  goods  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething we would like to impose on the commercial\r\n\r\npublic, and we shall allow the free play of  supply\r\n\r\nand demand to operate. However, we are aware of the\r\n\r\npossibilities that, if we are to impose  compulsory\r\n\r\nwearing of crash helmets suddenly for 100,000 motor\r\n\r\ncyclists  and  scooterists, the price  will  really\r\n\r\njump  very high. That is why, in implementing  this\r\n\r\npolicy,    we    have   tried   to   stagger    the\r\n\r\nimplementation. We first started off with those who\r\n\r\napplied  for  provisional licences  for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime.  That was November last year. It was  at  the\r\n\r\nrate of 1,000 a month. It was only in February this\r\n\r\nyear  that  we said that all learner drivers  would\r\n\r\nneed  to  wear these crash helmets and  that  would\r\n\r\ninvolve  10,000 people. We are allowing as much  as\r\n\r\nanother  10  months, i.e., January  of  next  year,\r\n\r\nbefore  we  require every motor cyclist or  pillion\r\n\r\nrider  to  wear a crash helmet. And the  number  is\r\n\r\n100,000.  So  we are allowing these  100,000  motor\r\n\r\ncyclists this much time to buy crash helmets and to\r\n\r\nget used to wearing them. I think that is as far as\r\n\r\nwe can go in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is very unhappy about\r\n\r\nthe   increase  in  fines  for  traffic   offences,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  increase  in  the  composition  of\r\n\r\noffences  from  $20 to $50. Nobody  likes  to  have\r\n\r\nfines  increased. But unfortunately we  have  found\r\n\r\nthat,  as I explained in my Second Reading  speech,\r\n\r\nalthough more than 7,000 people have paid their $20\r\n\r\nfine,  yet quite a lot of motor vehicles with smoky\r\n\r\nexhausts are running on Singapore roads and  making\r\n\r\nit very difficult for those who follow behind them.\r\n\r\nIt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  most  uncomfortable and I think  it  is  rather\r\n\r\nruinous to health. Although we have had a period of\r\n\r\neducation,  there does not seem  to  be  very  much\r\n\r\nimprovement,  so  we  have no  alternative  but  to\r\n\r\nincrease the fines. Only when it hurts their pocket\r\n\r\ndo  these  offenders begin to maintain their  cars,\r\n\r\ntaxis  or buses properly. The fine is quite costly.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is $50 a week, it will go up to $200  in  a\r\n\r\nmonth, whereas an ordinary maintenance check  would\r\n\r\nprobably cost $10 or $20 and it should be good  for\r\n\r\na few months. I can only transmit the Member's plea\r\n\r\nto  my colleague, the Minister for Defence, who  is\r\n\r\nin  charge of the traffic police, for his  officers\r\n\r\nto  use  their discretion and not be  too  hard  on\r\n\r\nbooking those owners of vehicles that emit smoke on\r\n\r\nthe  road.  We  hope to see less and less  of  such\r\n\r\nsmoky exhausts before the year is out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Katong's comment on the\r\n\r\nflouting  of  road  traffic laws  and  regulations,\r\n\r\nunfortunately  it  is true that it  takes  time  to\r\n\r\neducate road users. It looks as if we would have to\r\n\r\nspend some time on road education and, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  increase  the penalties for  those  breaking\r\n\r\ntraffic laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to draw attention to\r\n\r\nthe  comment from both Members that this particular\r\n\r\namendment Bill is very limited in scope. It is  so.\r\n\r\nI  admit  it, But I would like to say that it  will\r\n\r\nnot be very long before we have another sitting  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  to consider a White Paper  on  the  re-\r\n\r\norganisation of road transport in toto.  The  draft\r\n\r\nis  ready and, unless it is cut down, it runs to 50\r\n\r\npages.  So  I  think there will be a  lot  of  good\r\n\r\nreading  in it and, I hope, good debating  material\r\n\r\nwhen  it is tabled in the House and we can  have  a\r\n\r\nvery lengthy session on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL SERVICEMEN (EMPLOYMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, direction of employment is not something new. It was introduced by Government in December 1963 to assist persons adversely affected by confrontation to obtain alternative employment. Members will agree with the principle that first\r\n\r\npriority  must be given to our discharged  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  to fill job vacancies in the  Republic,\r\n\r\nand Government has rightly given an undertaking  to\r\n\r\nassist  all  discharged  national  servicemen  find\r\n\r\nsuitable  employment  in  the  public  or   private\r\n\r\nsector.  This  Bill  is  to  give  effect  to   the\r\n\r\nprinciple  I have enunciated and to the undertaking\r\n\r\nwe have given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a Job Placement Department in\r\n\r\nthe  Central Manpower Base in the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nInterior  and  Defence. It has been  assisting  our\r\n\r\ndischarged    national   servicemen   in    finding\r\n\r\nemployment suitable to the skills they have  learnt\r\n\r\nand  the  training they have received while serving\r\n\r\nwith the Singapore Armed Forces. Wherever possible,\r\n\r\ndischarged national servicemen are placed  in  jobs\r\n\r\nrelevant to their abilities, skills and experience.\r\n\r\nThis is very important as, upon completion of full-\r\n\r\nrime national service, they are transferred to  the\r\n\r\nReserves which form the bulk of our Armed Forces in\r\n\r\nan   emergency  and,  therefore,  a  continuity  in\r\n\r\nexperience  and skill is necessary. I must  say  we\r\n\r\nhave been most successful in job placement. A total\r\n\r\nof  98  per  cent of those discharged in 1969  have\r\n\r\nfound  jobs. In fact, at times we cannot cope  with\r\n\r\nthe demand from employers for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndischarged  national servicemen. I understand  that\r\n\r\nmost  of the national servicemen who have had  some\r\n\r\ntechnical training in the Armed Forces are  offered\r\n\r\njobs by prospective employers even before they have\r\n\r\ncompleted  their national service. For  this  happy\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs, I must express our gratitude  to\r\n\r\nthe  first  few  hundreds  of  discharged  national\r\n\r\nservicemen who have proved to employers  that  they\r\n\r\nare  better  than  average  workers  and  are  well\r\n\r\ndisciplined and not afraid of hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will now empower the Minister to direct\r\n\r\nby  order  published  in Government  Gazettes  that\r\n\r\nspecified   categories  of  employers  shall   not,\r\n\r\nwithout  the consent of the Director of  Employment\r\n\r\nappointed under this Bill, engage or re-engage  any\r\n\r\nemployee   otherwise  than  from  among  registered\r\n\r\npersons.  A registered person is a person  who  has\r\n\r\ncompleted full-time national service and whose name\r\n\r\nis for the time being on the register to be kept by\r\n\r\nthe Director of Employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, a register will be kept wherein\r\n\r\nparticulars  relating  to  the  qualifications  and\r\n\r\nskills  of  such  discharged  servicemen  will   be\r\n\r\nrecorded.  By  this  means,  there  will  be   made\r\n\r\navailable  to  employers a  reservoir  of  manpower\r\n\r\nresources  consisting  of a  representative  cross-\r\n\r\nsection  of  our  young population possessed  of  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  skills and experience from which  they\r\n\r\ncan draw to meet their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employer is unable to find a suitable\r\n\r\nperson   from   among   the   discharged   national\r\n\r\nservicemen  to fill any vacancy in his concern,  he\r\n\r\nmay,  upon the presentation of reasonable  grounds,\r\n\r\nbe  exempted to fill such vacancy with non-national\r\n\r\nservicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharged national servicemen should, within\r\n\r\nseven  days  upon securing employment,  notify  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of this fact so that correct  statistics\r\n\r\nwill be maintained; otherwise, they will disqualify\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  will  not  be  given  priority  of\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employer who contravenes the provisions of\r\n\r\nany order made under the Bill will be guilty of  an\r\n\r\noffence punishable, on conviction, by a fine not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexceeding  $2,000, and in respect of each  employee\r\n\r\nso employed in contravention thereof, by a fine not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $50 for each day on which that  employee\r\n\r\nis employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said we have been quite successful in\r\n\r\nfinding   suitable  jobs  for  discharged  national\r\n\r\nservicemen.

It  will  only be  enforced  when  the\r\n\r\nnecessity arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  had  assumed that the  necessity  for  the\r\n\r\nintroduction    of    the    National    Servicemen\r\n\r\n(Employment) Bill stems from the difficulties  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior and Defence might have\r\n\r\nexperienced  in placing ex-national  servicemen  in\r\n\r\nemployment,  but now the Minister apparently  tells\r\n\r\nus  that this is not so. The Bill will be placed on\r\n\r\na  contingency basis. The Bill assumes somehow that\r\n\r\nthe  required  skills from the national  servicemen\r\n\r\nare  forthcoming, and that the employers  can  find\r\n\r\nfrom  among the ranks of the ex-national servicemen\r\n\r\nthe  kinds of skills that they want. Similarly, the\r\n\r\nnational servicemen would accept the jobs which are\r\n\r\nreadily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforthcoming. In that kind of situation,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that compelling the employers to accept those\r\n\r\nnational servicemen would amount to a very economic\r\n\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have any firm figures to show the extent\r\n\r\nto  which the ex-national servicemen have  or  have\r\n\r\nnot acquired the kinds of technical expertise which\r\n\r\nwill put them readily in employment. It seems to me\r\n\r\nthat  if they have not acquired anything else other\r\n\r\nthan  the ability to shoot straight, then they  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be at a disadvantage when they come out of\r\n\r\nservice.  Instead  of, or in addition  to,  looking\r\n\r\ntowards a Bill compelling employers to engage or re-\r\n\r\nengage   only   registered  persons,  perhaps   the\r\n\r\nMinister   might  consider  means  by  which   more\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen could be given  the  necessary\r\n\r\nskills,  either  during or on completion  of  their\r\n\r\nnational    service.    In    addition,     perhaps\r\n\r\nopportunities for further formal education might be\r\n\r\nmade   available  by  a  preference   in   granting\r\n\r\nbursaries, scholarships and loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One further handicap that I feel some ex-national\r\n\r\nservicemen might experience is the lack of  fluency\r\n\r\nin  English.  Indeed, with the  foreign  investment\r\n\r\norientation of our industrialisation, I would think\r\n\r\nthat people who are not fluent in English would  be\r\n\r\npenalised.   This   problem  extends   beyond   the\r\n\r\nimmediate one of ex-national servicemen. It applies\r\n\r\ngenerally  to graduates of non-English schools.  If\r\n\r\nlanguage  is  the  barrier, then  perhaps  remedial\r\n\r\ncourses  in  English might be conducted within  the\r\n\r\nnational service period and/or upon completion.  If\r\n\r\nother  measures are necessary, perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\nmight  consider  the  provision  of  subsidies   to\r\n\r\nemployers  to  provide in-plant  training  for  ex-\r\n\r\nnational servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point, perhaps worthy of consideration,\r\n\r\nis  the employment of ex-national servicemen in the\r\n\r\npublic  sector to which this Bill is not  directed.\r\n\r\nWhile  I am sure that the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nis  co-operating fully in giving preference to  ex-\r\n\r\nnational servicemen, I am told that, in some cases,\r\n\r\nprocessing of applications by the P.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntakes  up  to three months, which is a long  enough\r\n\r\nperiod  to  demoralise any ardent defender  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic's freedom. Perhaps steps ought to be taken\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the administrative apparatus of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to lend my support to\r\n\r\nthis   Bill,   because  clearly   our   ex-national\r\n\r\nservicemen  are deserving of special  consideration\r\n\r\nfor their service to the Republic. However, I would\r\n\r\nstrongly  invite the attention of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence to the matter of the employability  of  ex-\r\n\r\nnational servicemen, especially those who have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  given  training in specific skills,  and  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  might be taken to  provide  further\r\n\r\neducation  and  English language  proficiency.  The\r\n\r\ncombination of Ministerial exhortation,  the  stick\r\n\r\nprovided  by  this  Bill, and my proposed  remedial\r\n\r\ncarrots should be, hopefully, redeeming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this Bill is aimed at ensuring  that\r\n\r\nour  ex-national servicemen will  be  able  to  get\r\n\r\njobs.  Nobody  will quarrel with this.  However,  I\r\n\r\nhave  certain  comments to make on the  details  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill, and I hope the Minister will clarify the\r\n\r\nfew points I am making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this Bill does not compel all those\r\n\r\nnational   servicemen  who  have  completed   their\r\n\r\nnational service to register. I would like to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  those  who have completed  their  national\r\n\r\nservice  but  who have not registered according  to\r\n\r\nclause  4  of the Bill will be at liberty  to  seek\r\n\r\njobs.  Will  any  person be able  to  employ  those\r\n\r\nunregistered   persons   who   nevertheless    have\r\n\r\ncompleted their national service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a Labour Exchange at the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour where those people who  want  to\r\n\r\nseek   jobs   can  register.  This  also   includes\r\n\r\ndischarged national servicemen. Under this Bill,  a\r\n\r\nregister will be kept by the Director of Employment\r\n\r\nwherein  the qualifications of discharged  national\r\n\r\nservicemen will be recorded. According to the Bill,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunless there are other arrangements, employers will\r\n\r\nhave to recruit persons who are registered with the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Employment  in  the  first  instance.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  those persons who have registered  with\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   of  Labour  will  not   have   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  get  jobs. I would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether this Bill, after it is passed, will  affect\r\n\r\nthe Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to know whether the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned have, before  drafting  this\r\n\r\nBill,  considered reorganising the Labour  Exchange\r\n\r\nat  the  Ministry of Labour in order to look  after\r\n\r\nthose who have completed their national service.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that making use of the Labour Exchange at  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour for employment purposes will  be\r\n\r\nmore   suitable,   because   everything   will   be\r\n\r\ncentralised. Moreover, we will save expenses  which\r\n\r\nwill be incurred in setting up a new Register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all along there has been a shortage of labour. Whenever the commercial and industrial sectors want to employ persons, they have difficulty in doing so. I fear that after this Bill is passed, the commercial and industrial sectors will find it unnecessarily cumbersome to\r\n\r\nrecruit  workers.  Should these things  happen,  it\r\n\r\nwill   be   an   impediment  to  the  progress   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  in  our  country.  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned will clarify the few points that\r\n\r\nI have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am happy to learn the happy state of affairs\r\n\r\ndescribed by the Minister for Defence so  that  the\r\n\r\nBill,  when  passed, may not need  to  be  enforced\r\n\r\nimmediately.   This  Bill  requires  employers   to\r\n\r\nrecruit   workers  from  amongst  the   ex-national\r\n\r\nservicemen  in  the  first instance.  The  Bill  is\r\n\r\nbefore us, I believe, because many of our young men\r\n\r\nwho are called up for national service, as well  as\r\n\r\ntheir parents, feel concerned lest they lose out in\r\n\r\nthe  competition  for jobs to  those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nsimilarly  called, to non-citizens  and  to  girls.\r\n\r\nThis Bill demonstrates to them,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  a  concrete  manner, that the Government  fully\r\n\r\nrecognises    the   contribution   that    national\r\n\r\nservicemen   make,  directly  to   our   Republic's\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  indirectly  to  our  prosperity  and\r\n\r\nwelfare. It assures them that they do not  have  to\r\n\r\nstand at the back of the queue when they seek  jobs\r\n\r\nin civilian life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to learn that employers in the\r\n\r\nprivate sector already realise the worth of our ex-\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen. It must stand to reason  that\r\n\r\nin  a  small country such as ours, we cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  waste our most valuable resource- manpower. Our\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces not only impart to their men\r\n\r\na  training that promotes physical fitness,  mental\r\n\r\nalertness,  discipline  and self-reliance,  but  it\r\n\r\nalso  improves  their  education  and  skills.  The\r\n\r\nS.A.F, make  men out of boys and turn  out  better\r\n\r\ncitizens,  more  productive workers  and  potential\r\n\r\nleaders of our community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our young ex-national servicemen have already\r\n\r\nproved to be valuable assets to their employers,  I\r\n\r\nhope that this law need not be enforced. But in the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  Mr  Speaker,  I  beg  to  support   the\r\n\r\nNational Servicemen (Employment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  main aim of this Bill is to ensure that  those\r\n\r\nwho have completed two years' national service will\r\n\r\nbe  given  priority in employment. This is,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  a very wise measure because, as we all know,\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen have taken  part  in  national\r\n\r\nservice  training  in the national  interest.  They\r\n\r\nhave been trained militarily in order that they can\r\n\r\nshoulder the great responsibility of protecting our\r\n\r\ncountry, our lives and our property. Therefore,  to\r\n\r\nthose  who have sacrificed so much for the national\r\n\r\ninterest  and  who have spent time  and  energy  on\r\n\r\nmilitary training in the defence of our country, it\r\n\r\nis  only right that we should look after them  when\r\n\r\nthey have completed their national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers, therefore, have a part to play in\r\n\r\nthis respect. If the national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservicemen are sure of getting jobs after their two\r\n\r\nyears'  training,  then members of  their  families\r\n\r\nwill  have  no  worry about national service.  This\r\n\r\nwill  enable the national servicemen to concentrate\r\n\r\nmore  on  their  training. In this way,  they  will\r\n\r\ncontribute more to national defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding what I have said, I have certain misgivings about the administration of this Bill. With the increase of national servicemen in years to come, the task of the Director of Employment, as provided in this Bill, will be made increasingly difficult.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is bound to be some delay  in  the\r\n\r\nplacement of jobs for the national servicemen. So I\r\n\r\nwould  like  the  Minister  concerned  to  exercise\r\n\r\nproper supervision over the work of this department\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that it is efficient and effective  and\r\n\r\nthat  there is proper liaison between the employers\r\n\r\nand the department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, Mr Speaker, at the present\r\n\r\nmoment  there is some delay in placing  a  national\r\n\r\nserviceman in a job. For example, after two  years'\r\n\r\ntraining  a national serviceman should be  given  a\r\n\r\njob  as  soon  as  possible by  the  Government  or\r\n\r\nthrough the Government. But in some cases there  is\r\n\r\na  delay of two to three months. I do not know what\r\n\r\nthe  reason  is, but there is an undeniable  delay.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  should take  steps  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation to ensure that there is no delay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to raise with the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  is  this.  There  are  certain\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  recruited  from  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  I  do  not  know  whether  they  are  paid\r\n\r\naccording to salary scales provided in the National\r\n\r\nService  Regulations or whether  they  continue  to\r\n\r\ndraw  the same salary as they have drawn in private\r\n\r\nemployment.  If  it  is the practice  to  pay  them\r\n\r\naccording to the rates of pay given in the National\r\n\r\nService  Regulations, then  they  are  at  a  great\r\n\r\ndisadvantage, and I would like to ask why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Mr Speaker, this is a good Bill in\r\n\r\nprinciple, because it looks after the interests  of\r\n\r\nour national servicemen in respect of employment. I\r\n\r\nsupport it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, shall answer\r\n\r\nthe  last  speaker  first,  i.e.,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang. I will appreciate it very much if he can\r\n\r\ntell  me of a system whereby a national serviceman,\r\n\r\nwho is discharged today, can rightaway be placed in\r\n\r\na job tomorrow, it is inevitable that there must be\r\n\r\nsome  delay in placing national servicemen in jobs.\r\n\r\nUsually  we  have  very  early  notification   from\r\n\r\nemployers of the type of skills that they  require.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we have to match the requirements of  the\r\n\r\nemployer with the qualifications and experience  of\r\n\r\nour  discharged or about to be discharged  national\r\n\r\nservicemen. When that is done, we have to write  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers  and send these national  servicemen\r\n\r\nfor interview. At the same time, we have to ask the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen whether  they  do  want  jobs,\r\n\r\nbecause some of them, as I have said just now, have\r\n\r\nprobably  been offered jobs or have found  jobs  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own. All this takes time. Therefore,  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  find  a  system to match the skills  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements so that the national servicemen can be\r\n\r\nsent  to  the  employers on  the  day  after  their\r\n\r\ndischarge. I think all of us will he most  grateful\r\n\r\nand very happy for the Member's advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether national servicemen\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid the same salary that they have  been\r\n\r\ngetting  while  working outside, we  have  our  own\r\n\r\nscales  of pay in the Armed Forces. In the  private\r\n\r\nsector different employers have different scales of\r\n\r\npay.  And  if  we were to accede to the  suggestion\r\n\r\nmade  by the Member for Sembawang - that we  should\r\n\r\npay  the national servicemen the same pay that they\r\n\r\nhave  been getting outside -then my Paymaster  will\r\n\r\nprobably  have  to include the hundreds  of  salary\r\n\r\nscales in the private sector. That, I think, is not\r\n\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Delta - as I have said,\r\n\r\nthe  system is working quite well now. We are  able\r\n\r\nto  place 98 per cent of the ex-national servicemen\r\n\r\nwho  were discharged in 1969 in jobs. Also  because\r\n\r\nof  the  shortage of labour now, it would be  quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary to enforce the Bill. That is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason why I have said that it is not the intention\r\n\r\nof this Ministry to enforce this Bill even after it\r\n\r\nhas been passed by Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether we can make use of the\r\n\r\npresent Labour Exchange to do this work, I think it\r\n\r\nwould  not be possible for the Labour Exchange,  as\r\n\r\nit  is  constituted at present, to work efficiently\r\n\r\nas  a  job placement unit, in the M.I.D, just  now,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Ministry  has a  complete  record  of\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen with us.  Therefore,  when  we\r\n\r\nreceive the job specifications, it is easier for us\r\n\r\nto  marry  them to the requisite skills  among  the\r\n\r\ndischarged national servicemen, Otherwise  we  have\r\n\r\nto  send  the whole lot of particulars of  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  to  the  Labour  Exchange   where   the\r\n\r\nadministration  is probably not  so  au  fait  with\r\n\r\nmilitary  reports. This will cause  further  delay,\r\n\r\nand greater annoyance to the Member for Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the principle here is that first\r\n\r\npriority  for employment is to be given to national\r\n\r\nservicemen. We all hope the day will not come  when\r\n\r\nthe  demand for labour will drop so that those  who\r\n\r\nhave not done their national service will also have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to be gainfully employed.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment things are going on all right. We are  able,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  said,  to  place all  our  ex-national\r\n\r\nservicemen  in jobs. I have already indicated  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing to prevent a national serviceman\r\n\r\nfrom seeking a job of his own if he wants to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members n general, and the\r\n\r\nMember for Whampoa in particular, there is a  joint\r\n\r\nM.I.D./ Technical Education Committee looking  into\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of giving training to  ex-national\r\n\r\nservicemen  who have had no training in any  skills\r\n\r\nwhatsoever while they were in the Armed Forces.  As\r\n\r\nfor improving their fluency in English, in fact, in\r\n\r\nthe  Armed  Forces  at  the  moment  a  conscripted\r\n\r\nnational serviceman is given 180 hours' tuition  in\r\n\r\nany language he desires. But we are looking further\r\n\r\ninto it. When we first started. If a serviceman was\r\n\r\neducated  in  English, he was given the  choice  to\r\n\r\ntake up either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  or  Malay. If he was Chinese educated,  he\r\n\r\nwas given the choice to learn English or Malay. But\r\n\r\nafter having worked on it for some time, I think  a\r\n\r\nbetter method now will be to improve the fluency of\r\n\r\nthe  language  in which the national serviceman  is\r\n\r\neducated.  Let  us say a boy has  a  Secondary  III\r\n\r\neducation  in  English.  The  time  will  be   more\r\n\r\nusefully  spent  if he can improve his  fluency  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  within the 180 hours of tuition,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  he  comes  out  he will  be  more  fluent  in\r\n\r\nEnglish,  Mandarin, or Malay, or whatever  language\r\n\r\nhe is educated in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill, if enforced, compels an employer to register with us, so that first priority will be given to national servicemen for employment. But at the moment in the public sector - in the Public Service Commission, the Ministry of Health, and every other Ministry - we have given\r\n\r\nfirst  priority  to  national servicemen.  That  is\r\n\r\ncovered  administratively. This is a promise  which\r\n\r\nwe have made, and we are keeping it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have replied to all the questions raised\r\n\r\nor  the  doubts that have arisen in  the  minds  of\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Some of the contributions made  to\r\n\r\nthe   Committee  were  most  valuable  and  several\r\n\r\nsuggestions were accepted. Amongst these were -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the reduction of the period of practical\r\n\r\nexperience    in    engineering    required     for\r\n\r\nqualification under section 8 (c) from three  years\r\n\r\nto two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the widening of the powers of the\r\n\r\nProfessional Engineers Board to include  the  power\r\n\r\nto  suspend an engineer from practice for a  period\r\n\r\nnot   exceeding   one  year  under   any   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances set out in section 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the increase of the penalties that an\r\n\r\nunregistered  person will be liable  to  face  upon\r\n\r\nconviction for practising or holding himself out as\r\n\r\na professional engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report was published on 15th\r\n\r\nJune,  1970,  as Paper Parliament 3  of  1970.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Bill as now tabled  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse  incorporates  the  recommendations  of   the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Minister for Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment has just moved the Third Reading of the\r\n\r\nBill.  I  will now avail myself of this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  express my support of it, looking at it from  a\r\n\r\nslightly different angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My views on this Bill are applicable also to\r\n\r\nBills  of a similar nature. This Bill, when  it  is\r\n\r\npassed  by Parliament, will have certain safeguards\r\n\r\nfor professional engineers in the execution of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir professional duties. Their social status will\r\n\r\nbe  enhanced.  I feel that in this respect  we  are\r\n\r\nahead  of  many  other countries. However,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who are in the engineering profession\r\n\r\nwill  not  just  look to the legal  protection  and\r\n\r\nneglect their obligation to our people. I would say\r\n\r\nthe  aim  of  the Bill is not just to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  a  certain group  of  people  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety by having their interests protected by law,\r\n\r\nbut   it  should  also  enable  the  engineers   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  obligations and  duties  to  our\r\n\r\nsociety  and  their part in nation  building.  They\r\n\r\nhave  an obligation towards the people in assisting\r\n\r\nto  bring  prosperity to the country in the  coming\r\n\r\nyears. We are a democratic society, and anybody who\r\n\r\nwants  to  enjoy the protection of his  rights  and\r\n\r\ninterests   should  also  take  upon  himself   the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and duties  towards  society.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, professional engineers  are  not  an\r\n\r\nexception.  We have expressed this basic  principle\r\n\r\nin  introducing this Bill, I hope that after it  is\r\n\r\npassed.  It  will be able to bring about  a  better\r\n\r\nspiritual  liberation  and a  liberation  of  their\r\n\r\nminds  so that in their own way they may also  make\r\n\r\ntheir  contribution towards the livelihood  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will agree with me, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  there  are many professional  people  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry  who  in  the  past  have  paid  too   much\r\n\r\nattention  to  their own occupations and  neglected\r\n\r\nthe  demands  and the requirements of  the  general\r\n\r\nmasses.  At the same time, some of them  have  also\r\n\r\nforgotten the general interest of the country. They\r\n\r\nonly   look  after  their  own  interest  and   the\r\n\r\nsalvation  of  their  own existence.  They  form  a\r\n\r\nretarding force in our society. If we do  not  take\r\n\r\nsteps   to  remedy  this  situation,  we  will   be\r\n\r\ndisappointing   our   people.   Let    professional\r\n\r\nengineers  take  this  Bill  as  a  beginning,  and\r\n\r\nrectify  this  situation by  earnestly  discharging\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities towards  the  people.  They\r\n\r\nwill  understand that in the new society they  have\r\n\r\ncertain obligations towards the people. This should\r\n\r\nbe the basis and correct emphasis of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee benefited from the various\r\n\r\nviews expressed in the representations. It received\r\n\r\nrepresentations    from    professional     bodies,\r\n\r\nindividuals and members of the public. This  showed\r\n\r\nthat  they  were interested and had  faith  in  our\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Professional Engineers Board\r\n\r\nto  be set up under the Bill will not have an  easy\r\n\r\ntask,  for example, in the investigation  into  the\r\n\r\nqualifications   of  professional   engineers   and\r\n\r\nclassifying them. I hope the members of  the  Board\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to carry out the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill smoothly and efficiently, though their task is\r\n\r\ndifficult.  I  hope  they  will  also   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration the representations which  were  made\r\n\r\nto  the  Select  Committee in the course  of  their\r\n\r\nwork.  I  am sure their duties are not easy  but  I\r\n\r\ntrust  that with extra care they will be successful\r\n\r\nin their task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a professional engineer expressed\r\n\r\ncertain  views  on  the  Bill.  He  said  that  the\r\n\r\npenalties  for  certain people  who  infringed  the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of  the  Bill  should  be   increased.\r\n\r\nLegislation has been made to increase the penalties\r\n\r\nto  deal  with offenders, Of course, I do not  deny\r\n\r\nthe  necessity for penalties. But what I would like\r\n\r\nto  say is that, although it might be necessary  to\r\n\r\nlegislate   in  order  to  provide  for  penalties,\r\n\r\nlegislation to penalise the offenders  of  the  law\r\n\r\nshould  be  such  as  to aim  at  helping  them  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between right and wrong so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill be able to do the right thing in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me, finally, to quote something which was said in the press recently. We, as legislators and as Members of Parliament, are not like Tse Ker Liang, a sage in ancient Chinese history, and, at the same time, the people are not simpletons. Our legislation should always aim at\r\n\r\nsafeguarding society, and not only the interest  of\r\n\r\na  certain  group of people. Since  this  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  is given the protection of the law,  it  is\r\n\r\ntheir  bounden  duty to contribute  their  services\r\n\r\ntowards  the  people. Otherwise, when  finally  the\r\n\r\npeople  deliver their judgment on us, we will  have\r\n\r\nbeen marked as failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have nothing further to add\r\n\r\nexcept  to  thank the Member for Crawford  for  his\r\n\r\ncontribution  in  the  Select  Committee  and   his\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed.\" - [Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Four o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
