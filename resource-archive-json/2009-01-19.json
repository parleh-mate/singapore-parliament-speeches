Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first set out the broader context against which the Government's loan support schemes exist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are facing a broad-based global economic downturn and the Singapore economy is in a recession. Loans may decline further in the coming months.&nbsp; This happened during the Asian Financial Crisis and is likely to happen now as well.&nbsp; Demand for loans will moderate with businesses scaling back investment and expansion plans.&nbsp; Banks will become more cautious with business prospects of borrowers turning more uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been knock-on effects here from the global financial turmoil. Bond and equity market issuances have thinned substantially, and the foreign banks operating in Singapore, which collectively&nbsp; make up more than 40% of our domestic credit market, were affected by the crisis in the US and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The actions taken by governments and central banks in Europe and the US to recapitalise bank and guarantee bank borrowings have improved confidence in the international financial system and that of individual banks, although there remain significant stresses and uncertainties ahead. Our local banks, on the other hand, are not <p align=left>Column: 1039<p>facing a capital or liquidity crunch and their capital adequacy ratios more than meet MAS' requirements. Overall, the interbank market in Singapore continues to function normally; commercial cost-of-funds is low and our financial system remains fundamentally sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Government's loan schemes aim to complement commercial lending by helping viable but riskier companies access credit. We work through the banking system by sharing a sizable portion of the default risk. These schemes have been in place for many years, and loan commitments had increased even before additional enhancements took effect in December 2008. They rose by around 50% to over $1.0 billion in 2008, compared to $680 million in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against a backdrop of economic downturn and greater risk aversion, we moved pre-emptively in December to further enhance our loan schemes. We increased government risk sharing from 50% to 80%, raising loan quantum limits, introducing a Bridging Loan Programme (BLP) for working capital needs, and reducing interest rates by 1.25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These enhancements have been in place for less than&nbsp;two months.&nbsp; It is too early to assess their effectiveness but preliminary indications are promising.&nbsp; Participating banks have reported an increase in applications with almost 500 applications submitted in December alone. Many of these applications are still being processed by the banks.&nbsp; Approved loans increased by 30% in December 2008 compared to December 2007 (from $62 million&nbsp;to $80 million). Working capital loans increased while asset based loans saw a dip. This is not unexpected, with businesses cutting back on fixed asset investments amidst the unfavourable economic climate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1040<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our next challenge is to heighten awareness of these schemes and assist SMEs in applying for them.&nbsp; Many SMEs may be unfamiliar with the process. SPRING has therefore organised a pipeline of financing seminars in collaboration with the business chambers and industry associations. To facilitate SME loan applications, SPRING, together with our&nbsp;five Enterprise Development Centres and the Singapore Business Federation, has just launched the Financial Facilitator Programme.&nbsp; Under this programme, the six centres will provide financial advisors to advise SMEs on financing strategies and loan applications.&nbsp; SMEs can seek professional financial advice at these centres at no charge. Companies requiring assistance should approach the EDCs for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While efforts are being made to help support access to business credit, companies still have the prime responsibility to furnish the relevant data for their applications and to show that their businesses are viable and bankable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only natural, in any recession, that companies seeking loans are questioned in more detail and their applications are scrutinised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Member Mr Zaqy Mohamed has asked how MTI intends to work with banks to relax their lending criteria for the financing schemes, and whether we set conditions on the disbursement of such loans by the banks.&nbsp; We do not have disbursement requirements nor do we influence the bank's risk assessment.&nbsp; It is important that the banks do the proper due diligence in ensuring that loans are extended to companies with viable business propositions.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also why we do not set utilisation targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is also not in a good position to lend to enterprises directly. We do not have the expertise and are not well placed to do so. Credit risk assessment is best done by the professionals in our <p align=left>Column: 1041<p>financial institutions, who have the necessary domain knowledge. Our preferred approach is to share a significant portion of the financial institutions' risks, up to 80%, and defray some of their administrative costs. This not only encourages more lending, but also ensures that our public funds go to deserving companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government loans, therefore, play a targeted role; they are not intended to replace commercial lending.&nbsp; Our primary objective remains to assist viable but riskier companies access credit which they would otherwise be unable to get at reasonable rates during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since implementation of the enhancements, feedback from the business community has been positive. They have welcomed the move to increase risk sharing by the Government, the increased quantums as well as reduced interest rates. There has been continued feedback on the need for working capital and difficulties in securing such loans. We are assessing this and will revise our schemes in line with the situation.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I thank the Minister for his answers.&nbsp; I have the following supplementary questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he mentioned that about $80 million was approved.&nbsp; I want to know&nbsp;how much this constitutes as a percentage of the total amount that was applied for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second supplementary question concerns the process by which&nbsp;businesses need to submit their applications.&nbsp; I hope it can be further simplified and that businesses do not need to submit very voluminous type of applications and very complicated business plans to support their applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1042<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related to this, I would also like to ask what is the average time taken to evaluate and process these applications, because time is of the essence for these credit-starved businesses, and we certainly do not want a case that when approval is given, it is a day late for the companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last supplementary question is to ask the Minister whether he is aware that some financial institutions have not renewed the credit facility on maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this may not be seen as a cut back of facilities, I think the impact can be quite significant.&nbsp; I would like the Minister's response&nbsp;on this.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, let me explain, as I did in my answer earlier, that the whole credit situation is a very diverse situation.&nbsp; Essentially, the commercial loan constitutes about $160 billion, but a large proportion of this is really to the bigger companies&nbsp;&ndash; the multi-nationals and the mid-sized companies.&nbsp; The SMEs' share constitutes about $40 billion.&nbsp; Even within these large amounts, we also have to look at the sectoral composition of these loans.&nbsp; Many of these loans are for development and construction, and many of these, in fact, grew very significantly during the bull run&nbsp;in the last two to three years, and that has increased the size of the loan market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's share of this market at $1 billion is not a very significant share.&nbsp; Really, we have to depend on our financial system.&nbsp; As I said, by and large, our financial system remains intact.&nbsp; But we must expect that during a period of recession that the banks themselves will be more stringent in their lending criteria and&nbsp;in their scrutiny, and there will be some cut back in the loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1043<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the times when credit was reasonably easy, SPRING did not monitor the ratio of applications versus approvals.&nbsp; We only took in the data from the banks based on loans approved.&nbsp; So I do not have the data comparing the past history of the success of approvals.&nbsp; Now, of course, we are collecting this data because it is something that we are sensitive to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the process, we agree that it should be as simplified as possible, and we are working together with the participating&nbsp;financial institutions to make sure that the process is simplified.&nbsp; And, similarly, time taken should not be unduly long. But I must add a word of caution.&nbsp; It depends really on&nbsp;the borrower's&nbsp;level of relationship with the banks.&nbsp; If&nbsp;he has already built up a very long-standing relationship with the bank, the relationship manager knows&nbsp;his business very well.&nbsp; So when he comes back to renew&nbsp;or to extend&nbsp;his loan or to have this new credit facility that has been enhanced, it is not a problem.&nbsp; That was the feedback that we got.&nbsp; For some of the SMEs that have taken advantage of the Government's schemes&nbsp;&ndash; the LEFS, LIS, micro-loan, etc&nbsp;&ndash; and they have built up this relationship with their banks, when we expanded the scheme and they renewed or expanded the scheme with the banks, there was very little problem.&nbsp; The problem comes when a borrower is building a new relationship with the bank and&nbsp;he has to explain to the bank the nature of&nbsp;his business and&nbsp;his business plans, and the loan officer must develop a good understanding of his operations and also a good assessment of&nbsp;his prospects going forward.&nbsp; So we cannot dictate time.&nbsp; This must be left to the banks and also to the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last question is on the renewal of credit facilities.&nbsp; Anecdotally, the&nbsp;evidence <p align=left>Column: 1044<p>of the feedback given to us is that many of the banks in Singapore, both the local banks and the foreign banks, targeted SMEs in a significant way in the last few years.&nbsp; They have built up the loan portfolios for the SMEs.&nbsp; So we are starting off from a position of greater strength&nbsp;than, say, five years ago.&nbsp; Five years ago, I think the penetration of the access of credit by our SMEs&nbsp;in the banking system was less.&nbsp; This time round, I think we have a better base to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, it also means that when some foreign banks, for example, have to cut back on the credit facilities because of instructions from their head office, the impact now reaches out to some of our SMEs who previously had not had the access through the foreign banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another feedback we got is that some of our SMEs, in fact, work through both local and foreign banks.&nbsp; And the typical approach is that their credit facilities with the local banks&nbsp;are secured on very concrete collateral, whereas their relationship with the foreign banks is based on accounts receivable.&nbsp; So when situations get tighter, that is, in fact, the first facility that gets cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are some of the feedback that we are getting and we are working together with the various banks to see how we can make the system better and still ensure credit is available to our companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the global economic environment has deteriorated significantly since the middle of last year.&nbsp; The Singapore economy has entered a recession.&nbsp; We have already seen three consecutive quarters of negative quarter-on-quarter GDP growth and two consecutive quarters of negative year-on-year GDP growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economic downturn has spread to all the key sectors of our economy.&nbsp; The sectors that have been hardest hit by the crisis are those most exposed to the external economic environment, such as manufacturing, tourism, transport and wholesale trade, as well as sentiment-sensitive sectors such as financial services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, non-oil domestic exports fell by 7.9% last year. The fall was especially steep in the last few months of 2008.&nbsp; Non-oil domestic exports declined by 20.8% in December.&nbsp; Container throughput and sea cargo handled in December contracted by 13% and 18% respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This contraction in exports is being experienced by many other regional economies too.&nbsp; For instance, exports from Taiwan and South Korea declined by 40% and 17% respectively in December, while Malaysia saw a 5% decline in its exports in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1047<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outlook for 2009 is&nbsp;a difficult year.&nbsp; Consumer demand in our key export markets, such as the US and Europe, will remain weak.&nbsp; Our manufacturing sector is therefore likely to continue facing a slowdown this year.&nbsp; Regional trade will also slow down further, which will drag down the sectors relating to transport and wholesale trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial services sector will also experience a sharp slowdown because of the impact of the financial crisis.&nbsp; Although our banks have largely escaped the direct impact of the crisis because of their low levels of exposure to distressed assets, the crisis has hit the sentiment-driven segments of the financial sector which include the trading of stocks, shares and bonds, foreign exchange trading as well as fund management activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domestically-oriented sectors of our economy will also experience moderation in growth.&nbsp; Weaker consumer sentiments among Singaporeans have affected the retail sector and the property market. Retailers and restaurants are seeing slower business as consumers are reining in discretionary spending. Private home prices fell for a second consecutive quarter at the end of 2008 according to advance estimates from the URA, hurt by a drop in investor sentiments amid the growing economic downturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are some sectors which are still showing positive growth.&nbsp; The construction sector and supporting activities, such as architectural and engineering services, have benefited from a strong pipeline of projects that were awarded in the past two years. The information and communications sector has also been resilient,&nbsp;as it is supported by major public sector IT initiatives and growth in international call volumes. The <p align=left>Column: 1048<p>healthcare and education sectors are also showing steady growth.&nbsp; However, these sectors collectively make up slightly less than 10% of our economy, and their growth will not be able to compensate for the declines in the other sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area which gives us some optimism is the pipeline of investments.&nbsp; I think some of you may have heard EDB's announcement just this morning about the investment commitments last year and their projections for this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah has asked about the employment outlook for 2009.&nbsp; The strong employment growth which we have enjoyed in recent years will ease significantly.&nbsp; Unemployment and retrenchments will rise. The labour market has already softened in the second half of 2008.&nbsp; We expect employment growth to further weaken and job losses to increase, in tandem with the economic slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, new jobs will still be generated from the growth sectors. For example, the construction sector is likely to continue hiring this year.&nbsp; In addition, the healthcare sector will continue to grow over the next two years with the development of healthcare facilities, such as the opening of the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.&nbsp; The civil service will also continue hiring: the Ministry of Education recently announced that it will be recruiting more than 7,000 teachers and support staff in 2009, while the Ministry of Home Affairs is looking to fill more than 1,000 vacancies across the various Home Team departments.&nbsp; In the tourism sector, the Integrated Resorts have already started their hiring efforts and are expected to provide more than 20,000 job opportunities over the next few years.&nbsp; And I have also referred to the EDB's announcement this year. EDB estimates that with the new investments coming on-stream, becoming operational this year, these will generate about 6,000 new jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1049<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me assure Mdm Halimah that we are closely monitoring the economy to identify the sectors vulnerable to retrenchments.&nbsp; In collaboration with our tripartite partners, the Government has already implemented the $600 million SPUR programme to help our workers retrain and upgrade their skills, so as to remain employable and employed during and beyond the economic downturn.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> &nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;&ndash; he mentioned some figures&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what is the total number of jobs expected to be created this year.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister, of those numbers of jobs created, how many of these jobs will be for&nbsp;PMETs and how many for non-PMETs.&nbsp; And what is the expected unemployment rate for this year?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; I hope Members will appreciate that during this period of great uncertainty, it is very hard for us to be making these projections with a great deal of uncertainty.&nbsp; What we have done is to develop a bottoms-up approach, look at all the different sectors and&nbsp;identify the job opportunities in each sector and also to develop a programme to see how Singaporeans can be trained or&nbsp;retrained to fit into these sectors.&nbsp; So, in my answers, I have mentioned several of these sectors and, if you add them up, I think this will give&nbsp;Members a general feel of what is available in those sectors that we have identified.&nbsp; Of course, in the rest of the economy, there will be some growth, some job creation as well as some retrenchments and cut back.&nbsp; I think the situation is evolving and will become clearer over time.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Minister painted a very grim picture of the economy with Singapore entering a recession.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister for his assessment on when he thinks Singapore can get out of the <p align=left>Column: 1050<p>recession?&nbsp; We are aware that much depends on the global situation.&nbsp; But can I ask the Minister for his sense of the economic projection?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp; I was about to use the same answer as I had just now, that we are facing quite an uncertain future.&nbsp; What I can say is that the recession that we are facing now is quite different from the recession that we faced before.&nbsp; If you look back, in 1985 and&nbsp;1986, that recession&nbsp;was because of our cost structure becoming uncompetitive.&nbsp;The main cause was domestic, and when we made the changes and&nbsp;righted ourselves, I think there was a rebound.&nbsp; In 1998, it was a financial crisis in Asia.&nbsp; The rest of the world managed to grow reasonably well although we were quite close to the epicentre of the Asian financial crisis and therefore sectors like our financial services and our share market was very adversely affected,&nbsp;but the rest of the economy was&nbsp;less affected.&nbsp; So when the Asian financial crisis was resolved, the rest of the economy pulled out and we rebounded quite quickly.&nbsp; Similarly for the 2001 recession, that was largely an IT bubble and also a major correction in world stock market.&nbsp; 2003 was also a very narrow recession created because of SARS.&nbsp; What we are facing today is actually quite unprecedented.&nbsp; First of all, it is a global downturn.&nbsp; It is a huge de-leveraging process.&nbsp;There have been global imbalances built up over the years and&nbsp;now it is righting itself.&nbsp; So the whole external demand has declined sharply.&nbsp; There is very little we can do to try and mitigate the impact of such a major decline in the external demand.&nbsp; Secondly, the global financial markets are affected. As you know, financial systems are crucial to the workings of&nbsp;a global economy.&nbsp; So I think these two characteristics make this a very sharp recession.&nbsp; The positive thing is that, of course, in terms of the financial crisis, we are further away from the epicentre.&nbsp; The epicentre is in US and&nbsp;Europe, not in Asia.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1051<p> But, nonetheless, we are facing the aftershocks&nbsp;and the repercussions of those difficulties.&nbsp; If you look at the reports that have come out, the consensus in most reports among&nbsp;economists and analysts is that the most optimistic forecast is for the US and the European economies to recover only in the second half of this year.&nbsp; So we cannot expect to see anything earlier than that.&nbsp; And the second thing we ought to note is that most analysts do not expect a sharp recovery,&nbsp;they expect a very slow recovery.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What is&nbsp;his comment on that?&nbsp; I would also appreciate&nbsp;his comment on the other question about the number of jobs that has been created for PMETs?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our approach has been a very pragmatic one.&nbsp; We look at the different sectors.&nbsp; You will not see robust job growth in the same way that we had seen in the last three years.&nbsp; But there will still be a significant job growth,&nbsp;as I mentioned, in the various sectors, like&nbsp;tourism with the IRs.&nbsp; We also have a very strong pipeline of investments, and EDB is confident that these investments <p align=left>Column: 1052<p>will generate 6,000 jobs this year.&nbsp; So if you add it up, it is a significant number of jobs that will be sufficient to cater for new school leavers.&nbsp; They are definitely more than 30,000 jobs all in.&nbsp; But what we are not sure of is the retrenchments that will likely to take place in the existing economy and also the retraining requirements, as companies restructure and some companies have to cut back.&nbsp; We are very conscious of the difficulties faced by the PMETs, and I think we have got specific programmes to target this group of Singaporeans to enable them to retrain for the jobs that are available.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:POLITICAL APPOINTMENT HOLDERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS--><p align=left>Column: 1052<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For an officer in the MR4 grade, the individual performance bonus quantum can range from&nbsp;zero to 14 months.&nbsp; A performance bonus of&nbsp;nine months was used to compute the 2008 norm salary package (of $1.92 million) for a typical officer on MR4.&nbsp; So nine months was the norm used to compute the salary for the benchmark comparison purposes.&nbsp; However, the actual amount awarded would vary with the officer's performance.&nbsp; In 2008, the actual performance bonus paid out for this grade ranged from&nbsp;six to 10 months, with an average payout of 8.33 months or $455,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For SR9, the individual performance bonus quantum can range from&nbsp;zero to 8.5 months, with 4.5 months used for computing the 2008 norm salary for a typical officer.&nbsp; In 2008, the actual performance bonus ranged from&nbsp;zero to 6.5 months, with an average payout of 4.82 months or $86,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above figures are 2008 salaries.&nbsp; This year, we will see a drop in total annual salaries.&nbsp; In November 2008, the Government announced that salaries for political, judicial and statutory appointment holders and Administrative Officers will see a drop&nbsp;of&nbsp;up to 19% in 2009.&nbsp; Total annual salaries at the MR4 grade will fall by 18% to $1.57 million and salaries at the SR9 level will fall by 12% to $353,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, Mr Hwang does not make clear what data (which would help in penal research) that he is referring to as not having been published. &nbsp;Second, law enforcement agencies such as the Singapore Police Force and Central Narcotics Bureau do publish crime and drug offence statistics regularly. &nbsp;Where there is public interest to be served, additional relevant information is collected and disseminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it should be noted that Home Team departments also undertake qualitative and quantitative research, often in collaboration with&nbsp;independent researchers, on topics relating to crime, punishment and criminal behaviour.&nbsp; Further, as a matter of practice, assistance is also given to researchers, including students, who wish to do <p align=left>Column: 1056<p>serious research and such research has been done.&nbsp; To suggest to that, there are&nbsp;inadequate published statistics and that that has prevented proper research&nbsp;is therefore quite untenable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now deal with the second of his assertions&nbsp;&ndash; has a lack of statistics led to&nbsp;our penal system being unprincipled?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the basis of his assertion&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that we do not publish statistics&nbsp;&ndash; is itself not clear, this further conclusion is equally questionable.&nbsp; Further, any objective analysis of our penal system will show that the system is based on sound practical philosophy and principles, which have been made clear several times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we take a tough stand on crime, we also believe strongly in compassion and rehabilitation.&nbsp; These principles underpin our approach to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) principles of prescribing punishment and sentencing;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) treatment and rehabilitation of prisoners when they are in prison; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) reintegration of ex-offenders back into society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with punishment and sentencing.&nbsp; The Government's approach to prescribing punishments is a matter of public record.&nbsp; During the Second Reading (in 2007) of the amendments to the Penal Code, our approach was again restated clearly.&nbsp; In brief summary, these are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) the type and quantum of punishment should provide sufficient flexibility to the Courts to mete out an appropriate sentence in a particular case;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) the prevalence of the offence;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;the proportionality of the penalty to an offence, taking into account its seriousness; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1057<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;the relativity in punishment between related offences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On sentencing, our Courts have set out the applicable principles. &nbsp;Our former Chief Justice, Mr Yong Pung How, had published over 882 judgments during his time on the Bench,&nbsp;several of which relate&nbsp;to criminal offences.&nbsp; Our current Chief Justice has been&nbsp;equally prolific.&nbsp; Subordinate Court judges publish <I>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts,</I> which is a sentencing guide,&nbsp;making accessible the sentencing approach for a wide range of offences.&nbsp; This approach is not based exclusively on either deterrence or retribution alone.&nbsp; Rather, the approach to sentencing an offender is to consider both these aspects, and also take into account other considerations such as potential for rehabilitation, suitability of the punishment for each individual offender and the nature of the offence committed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, both in prescribing punishments and sentencing offenders, much thought has been given to how justice can be best secured for each individual offender.&nbsp; The Government is also at present exploring Community Based Sentencing options, which will further equip our penal framework with the best tools to advance justice in each particular case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with treatment and rehabilitation of prisoners in prison.&nbsp; As stated earlier, we believe strongly in rehabilitation and we believe that&nbsp;that process&nbsp;should start even while the sentences are being served.&nbsp; Thus, during incarceration, inmates who are genuinely willing to change are given education, training and rehabilitative opportunities that will better help them&nbsp;reintegrate into society after their prison sentences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our focus on reintegration of ex-offenders back into society continues <p align=left>Column: 1058<p>after the prisoners are released.&nbsp; The Yellow Ribbon Project (YRP), set up to create awareness on giving second chances to deserving ex-offenders and generate acceptance of ex-offenders back into the community, has been widely lauded by international experts, and has received an honourable mention at the 2007 United Nations Grand Award.&nbsp; Coupled with the YRP was the setting up of a Yellow Ribbon Fund which contributes to the development and implementation of reintegration programmes for ex-offenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key measure of the success of our rehabilitation and reintegration programmes is our recidivism rate, which is now one of the lowest in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example of the successful rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for offenders is the Home Detention Scheme. &nbsp;Deserving inmates are released earlier, at the tail-end of their sentences and placed on electronic monitoring to work or study.&nbsp; Prisoners on Home Detention have lower recidivism rates compared to the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, far from being unprincipled, our penal philosophy has been carefully thought through and has been articulated publicly several times.&nbsp; Theoretical arguments on our penal policy, bereft of any reference to these key aspects in our system, may make for good sound bites.&nbsp; But they do not have any real merit.&nbsp; In evolving our policies, we take into account the views of parties involved in the administration of justice, including the courts, law enforcement agencies, civic interest groups, the legal profession, academia and the Law Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now deal with Mr Hwang's final assertion relating to capital punishment.&nbsp; His suggestion is that publication of detailed statistics will lead us to a possibly conclusive answer to the debate on capital punishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1059<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debate on capital punishment, Sir, is not going to be settled on the basis of statistics.&nbsp; Leaving aside the fact that it is not clear, from what Mr Hwang says, as to what statistics are said to be lacking, I should point out that all capital punishment cases are matters of public record in Singapore and the media usually widely covers such cases.&nbsp; Each criminal case heard before a court is also a matter of public record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of capital punishment itself, the reality is that there is no universal consensus on such punishment, and there is unlikely to be any such consensus, anytime soon.&nbsp; Serious and bitter debate on capital punishment has raged on in many countries.&nbsp; The philosophical and ideological chasms that separate the proponents and opponents of capital punishment are quite unbridgeable.&nbsp; Both sides marshal powerful arguments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On an issue like this, the Government has to take a stand.&nbsp; And the Government believes that death penalty should be retained.&nbsp; A <I>Straits Times</I> survey conducted a few years ago reported that 95% of Singaporeans supported the retention of the death penalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our firm position on crimes and the considerable benefits of such a stand to our society can be illustrated by reference to the drug situation.&nbsp; In a region where drug is a very serious problem, Singapore has kept the problem very much under control and is in fact almost unique in battling it successfully so far. Members know that in the last 15 years, the drug situation has been getting from bad to worse in many countries, both in this region, and in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why have we succeeded so far, when so many others have not?&nbsp; It is because we took a practical, hard headed approach to the problem and tackled it <p align=left>Column: 1060<p> decisively.&nbsp; In this context, the introduction of the death penalty for drug trafficking has, we believe, had the deterrent effect.&nbsp; There are no widely prevalent syndicated drug activities linked to organised crimes in Singapore, in contrast to the hierarchical and organised drug syndicates and cartels in various countries.&nbsp; As a result of our policies, thousands of young people have been saved from the drug menace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans appreciate the safe environment here. &nbsp;And the international community has taken note of our success in maintaining law and order.&nbsp; In 2008, the Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Singapore first in personal security and private property.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

So, would the Minister not agree that actually we are not that transparent when it comes to data like this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1061<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;in actual fact, we do not really know how much crime there is in Singapore because all our statistics gathered are based on reported crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder&nbsp;whether the Minister would agree that we could actually gather more statistics on victimisation in the population rather than just to rely on reported crime statistics which may not tell us the dark figure of crime.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam:</B> &nbsp; Let me take the second question first, which I am having some difficulty understanding.&nbsp; Ms Lim says our statistics&nbsp;are based on reported crime and that may not give the true picture.&nbsp; How would we assess unreported crime in the absence of the agencies knowing exactly what has happened?&nbsp; The agencies can only go on the basis of what is reported to them.&nbsp; And my assumption is that in a place like Singapore where people are well-educated and know their rights, if there is something that troubles them, they will go to the police.&nbsp; In fact, the position has been that they go to the police rather more than they should.&nbsp; So, really, I have difficulty answering that question beyond what Ms Lim has said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards&nbsp;her first question as to whether we are quite opaque, I have read Mr Hwang's article and I did not get the impression that he was pointing to any particular statistic as being absent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask this question in the context of the thesis he put forward.&nbsp; He said that we do not publish adequate statistics and that has prevented a proper penological research.&nbsp;&nbsp;How in the world would publishing details on ethnic composition on aggregated basis help in such penological research?&nbsp; As a matter of common sense, if&nbsp;one wants to do any research,&nbsp;he needs to go down to the ground and get access to the specific prisoners which, obviously, as a matter of confidentiality, prisons cannot publish and make available to the whole world at <p align=left>Column: 1062<p>large.&nbsp; So, it just does not make sense.&nbsp; People do ask to do serious research and that kind of research can only be done by getting access to the prisoners themselves, specific areas to be looked into, and that is usually allowed by the prisons.&nbsp; When a serious researcher makes a request, that&nbsp;request is allowed, and often the prisons do collaborative research with such researchers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But we cannot put our heads in the sand and hide important social facts which need serious study.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe what he is saying here is that there should be more transparency about the ethnic composition when it comes to certain kinds of offences.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam:</B> &nbsp; Sir, may I answer the&nbsp;point on victimisation surveys first.&nbsp; As regards issues of victimisation in the context in which Ms Lim spoke about, we have agencies&nbsp;that intervene in these areas, for example, of minors and&nbsp;sexual <p align=left>Column: 1063<p>offences directed against people who are particularly vulnerable.&nbsp; There are specific Government agencies and&nbsp;departments that deal with it.&nbsp; And even in the absence of reporting, these issues come to light insofar as the agencies have intervened effectively and know about it.&nbsp; But my personal belief, based on what I have read, is that both in Singapore and in other countries, if people keep certain matters away from the government authorities, it is very difficult to access them.&nbsp; That is the point that I was making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in a highly urbanised situation like in Singapore, both with our people knowing very substantially their rights and with a number of Ministries involved in actively intervening in the social sphere, from the context of schools and MCYS, we are more likely to know what is happening.&nbsp; And we are likely to have a pretty good idea of what is going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the point about lack of statistics specifically directed on ethnicity, the point I was making is in the context of doing serious research, what is the topic of research that is being identified, and public availability of data will help.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had earlier made the point if anyone wanted to do a study, eg, on ethnicity and crime, it is not a very difficult issue at all.&nbsp; The number of prisoners by ethnicity would be made available and they can go down and they can do a research study, that is not a problem.&nbsp; That and other kinds of research have been done.&nbsp; These are not matters that are kept private but there is usually little sense in making this generally publicly available.&nbsp; The question here that Ms Lim would have to distinguish is, if&nbsp;she wants the data for purposes of study, it would be made available, and all&nbsp;she&nbsp;has to do is to make&nbsp;a request and go down and conduct her research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is an entirely separate question&nbsp;whether these have to be published as a <p align=left>Column: 1064<p>matter of general practice, for example, on the number of&nbsp;prisoners by ethnicity.&nbsp; It sometimes could lead to a misinterpretation of data.&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;an example.&nbsp; Amnesty International suggested that more foreigners are hung in Singapore compared with locals.&nbsp; A study over five years, if&nbsp;we aggregate the data, shows that about 101 Singaporeans were hung compared to 37 foreigners.&nbsp; But if we broke that down on an annual basis,&nbsp;we could get a misleading interpretation.&nbsp; So, aggregated data, any serious researcher would know, is often not very useful for proper serious research.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:MIS-SELLING OF STRUCTURED PRODUCTS BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS--><p align=left>Column: 1064<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I thank the five MPs for raising these questions.&nbsp; It gives MAS the opportunity to update the House on this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp;recapitulate, MAS has set out a three-step dispute resolution process to ensure the fair and impartial handling of complaints by the relevant financial institutions (FIs).&nbsp; A wide range of investors bought these products.&nbsp; There were different FIs involved and the circumstances under which investors made these investments also varied.&nbsp; Therefore, each complaint had to be assessed individually on its merits.&nbsp; The FIs' decisions have been based on an assessment framework developed in consultation with the independent parties (IPs) appointed by the FIs.&nbsp; Both the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) and the Securities Investors Association of Singapore (SIAS) have said that they are supportive of this process and regard it as being in the best interest of investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process established by MAS was designed to achieve three main outcomes.&nbsp; First, to ensure that there is a consistent and rigorous process for the review of the complaints by the FIs.&nbsp; Second, to ensure a fair basis of decision, with the FI and investor taking due responsibility.&nbsp; Third, that the offers of settlement made to affected investors be regarded as reasonable and credible in the circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS gave an update on 16th January 2009 on the handling and resolution of complaints for DBS High Notes 5, Lehman Minibond Programme Notes and Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the progress made by the FIs and the results of the FIs' review of the complaints, as overseen by the IPs, I am of the view that the&nbsp;process put in place by MAS has achieved these outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1067<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all, the 10 FIs that sold DBS High Notes 5, Lehman Minibond programme notes and Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner notes received 5,381 complaints as at 14th January 2009.&nbsp; All complaints received on or before 14th December 2008 have been considered by the FIs'&nbsp;internal review panel, apart from a small number of complainants who have declined to be interviewed and cases where the FIs are still obtaining further information.&nbsp; The FIs are in the process of communicating the outcomes from the reviews of complaints to the individual investors.&nbsp; This could take a few weeks, as FIs intend to communicate with&nbsp;the investors face-to-face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I welcome the support from SIAS and CASE for the three-step dispute resolution process.&nbsp; They have also given useful advice to investors to take a practical and realistic view when considering any offer of settlement they may receive.&nbsp; They have also highlighted to the FIs the importance of handling communications to investors promptly and making sure that investors fully understand the terms of any settlement offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the review of individual complaints by FIs, based on the cases decided by the FIs as of 14th January 2009, 58% of complainants will receive&nbsp;full or partial settlement.&nbsp; This comprises 25% of complainants receiving full settlement and 33% receiving partial settlement.&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong has asked out of these offers of settlement how many are for \"vulnerable investors\".&nbsp;&nbsp; While MAS has asked the FIs to pay particular attention to&nbsp;this priority group of complainants based on some general characteristics, such as age, education and investment experience, a single characteristic such as age or education alone does not determine if an investor will be vulnerable to being mis-sold the products.&nbsp; For instance, someone with <p align=left>Column: 1068<p>little formal education may be a successful businessman.&nbsp; The person may have prior investment experience or could have invested in structured products jointly with, say, a younger family member.&nbsp; Nevertheless, all these cases were carefully reviewed by the FIs using the same assessment framework as for all other complaints.&nbsp; The FIs have told MAS that the outcome from the review process for investors who are elderly with little income, low levels of formal education and little investment experience is that most of them have been offered full or partial settlement.&nbsp; For the few cases among this group who do not receive any offer of settlement, the IPs together with the FIs have informed MAS that they have reviewed these cases and are satisfied that there are good grounds for the FIs' decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, this is a fair result.&nbsp; The process has worked as intended.&nbsp; The FIs have been responsible and co-operative in their overall efforts to ensure a fair resolution for affected investors.&nbsp; The independent parties have acknowledged the FIs' efforts in ensuring that the process is fair and rigorous, and that investors' interests are upheld.&nbsp; This reflects well on the way that the FIs involved have responded to the requests from MAS and to their commitment to upholding fair dealing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me provide more details on the settlement offers made by the FIs.&nbsp; For DBS High Notes 5, 8% of complainants will receive offers of full settlement, and 16% will receive offers of partial settlement.&nbsp; For the Lehman Minibond Programme Notes which were sold by banks and one finance company, 34% will receive offers of full settlement and 41% will receive offers of partial settlement; for those sold by stockbroking firms, 1% will receive offers of full settlement and 12%&nbsp;will receive offers of partial settlement.&nbsp; As for the Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner Notes sold by <p align=left>Column: 1069<p>stockbroking firms, 2% will receive offers of full settlement and 9% of partial settlement.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The differences in the settlement figures reflect the varied target profiles of customers&nbsp;of the various FIs and their different business models.&nbsp; For example, stock broking firms mostly performed the role of executing transactions on instructions from their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Pinnacle Notes Series 9 and 10, it was announced on 14th November 2008 that these notes would be subject to early redemption.&nbsp; I have been informed that the&nbsp;five FIs that sold Pinnacle Notes Series 9 and 10 have received 471 complaints as at 14th January 2009.&nbsp; MAS is in contact with these FIs to ensure that they handled investors' complaints according to the serious and impartial process that these FIs have already set up to deal with complaints relating to the earlier notes that I mentioned.&nbsp; Mr Hwang Soo Jin has agreed to oversee the complaints resolution process of the securities brokers for Pinnacle Notes Series 9 and 10.&nbsp; The other FIs are in the process of appointing independent persons to oversee the complaints handling processes for these notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors who consider they have a genuine claim that they were mis-sold the product or that the product was misrepresented to them should follow the same three-step process to resolve their complaints.&nbsp; Investors should first lodge their complaints directly with the FI that sold them the product.&nbsp; They should then provide full details of the case to the FI to allow the FI to make a fair assessment of the case.&nbsp; Finally, they can choose to accept the decision of the FI or refer their complaint to FIDReC where a fast track process has been put in place to deal with such cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the cases referred to FIDReC.&nbsp; Mr Singh and Mdm Phua have <p align=left>Column: 1070<p>asked about the FIDReC process and&nbsp;for an update.&nbsp; Investors who are not satisfied with the outcome of &nbsp;the FIs' review of their complaints may choose to have their complaint referred to FIDReC.&nbsp; Should an investor decide to refer his case to FIDReC, any offer from the FI will no longer be available to him.&nbsp; FIDReC will consider the merits of each case, including all relevant evidence presented, whether in written or oral form.&nbsp; The decision of FIDReC is binding on the FI but not on the investor.&nbsp; Investors should bear in mind that the outcome from the FIDReC process could be more or less favourable than the outcome of the FIs' review of the complaint.&nbsp; If an investor is not satisfied with the outcome of FIDReC, he may pursue other options for recourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at 14th January 2009, there have been a total of 227 cases received by FIDReC.&nbsp; These cases are a subset of the total number of complaints lodged with the FIs.&nbsp; Fifty-five of these cases relate to the DBS High Notes 5, 136 cases to the Lehman Minibond Programme Notes, 30 cases to the Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3&nbsp;LinkEarner&nbsp;Notes and&nbsp;six cases to the Morgan Stanley Pinnacle Notes Series 9 and 10.&nbsp; These cases are currently being processed for mediation and, when necessary, for adjudication.&nbsp; Two cases have been successfully mediated so far.&nbsp; The time taken to resolve any particular complaint will depend on factors such as the complexity of the dispute and when the parties involved are available for meetings or hearings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh and Mdm Phua have also asked for an update on investigations by MAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has announced that it is looking into any FI-wide issues,&nbsp;such as the selling practices and policies within each FI, as part of its formal investigations.&nbsp; The investigations cover, among other matters, the FI's due diligence into the structured notes, the procedures used at the point of sale, including how the FI ensured that the notes&nbsp;were sold to <p align=left>Column: 1071<p>clients whose investment objectives and risk tolerance matched the risk profile of the notes, and the training and supervision of relationship managers.&nbsp; Where in the course of its investigations MAS identified issues relevant to the FIs' assessment of individual complaints, MAS has worked with the independent parties overseeing the complaint resolution process to ensure that these were incorporated into the complaints assessment framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS will be communicating its preliminary findings to the CEOs of the financial institutions involved.&nbsp; As part of due process, MAS will give the financial institutions a reasonable opportunity to respond to its preliminary findings before making a final decision.&nbsp; Until MAS' findings are finalised, it will not be appropriate for either MAS or the parties involved to comment further on the matters under investigation as it could be prejudicial to the investigation and the parties involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has also enquired whether MAS has planned any new measures with regard to the sale of structured products.&nbsp; MAS has previously announced that it would undertake a review of the regulatory regime in light of these developments.&nbsp; The review is in progress and MAS will conduct a public consultation on the proposals by mid-March 2009.&nbsp; The review will consider stronger suitability requirements for certain type of products, clearer product labelling and simpler descriptions of the features and risks of products so that they are more readily understood.&nbsp; Proposals being considered include enhancing the regulatory regime for advertising and marketing materials and introducing product summary documents.&nbsp; There are already requirements that the sale of investment products in banks is to <p align=left>Column: 1072<p>be undertaken only by financial advisers who are not to perform any bank counter staff functions.&nbsp; However, the review will also examine whether any enhancements should be made to ensure there is an even clearer separation between a bank's traditional deposit-taking business and its investment products sales and marketing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked whether the Government will consider specific legislation to reduce or streamline the current legal complications arising from the recovery of investments linked to Lehman Brothers.&nbsp; The review being conducted by MAS is also looking into possible measures to address the legal complications that have been noted in relation to the Lehman Minibond Programme Notes.&nbsp; One proposal being considered is introducing a requirement for the appointment of an approved trustee with prescribed powers for certain investment products such as structured notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;reviewing its current regulatory and supervisory approach, however, MAS will have to be careful not to come&nbsp;up with overly prescriptive rules which may not serve all investors.&nbsp; MAS' current approach is intended to allow Singaporeans a wider choice of investment options to cater to their diverse needs.&nbsp; MAS is studying the specific refinements that need to be made carefully so that hasty changes are not made, which could bring&nbsp;along unintended consequences in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area where there is more work to be done is in investor education.&nbsp; Much has been achieved through the MoneySENSE programme, with the support of CASE, SIAS and various financial industry associations.&nbsp; However, these efforts will have to be stepped up.&nbsp; MAS is working with various stakeholder groups, in particular those representing investors' interests, such as CASE and <p align=left>Column: 1073<p>SIAS, as well as the relevant tertiary institutions.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Throughout this process, we have found that the&nbsp;roles of independent persons&nbsp;have been a very positive one.&nbsp; First of all, we have an overall assessment framework and the independent persons (IPs), working together with individual FIs, have been able to help in the process to make sure that the cases are properly investigated, that the assessment framework is enforced and there is consultation between the IPs and the FIs to make sure that&nbsp;cases, especially those cases involving the so-called vulnerable investors, are carefully reviewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IPs also helped MAS&nbsp;make sure that there is consistent and rigorous assessment throughout all the FIs because we must recognise that there are many FIs and institutions involved and this involved 5,000 over cases of complaints.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;would say that the whole process worked out very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the second question about people who have not complained, in fact many of the FIs have taken the initiative in combing through those who have not complained and where cases which they classified as worthy of compensation and settlement, they have in fact approached them.&nbsp; But those who have not complained, it is up to them if&nbsp;they want to proceed on this three-step process.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, my first question is, how many of the investors&nbsp;who received partial or no compensation had been&nbsp; recorded as opting for the so-called option 4 in the sale process, that is, the no advice option, which on paper will&nbsp;seem to have absolved the adviser of the responsibility of ensuring that the product was suitable for the investor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my second question relates to the information that has been disclosed which has been aggregated across all FIs divided into categories.&nbsp; So what is the breakdown of the resolution of complaints by each individual FI?&nbsp; This information will&nbsp;assure Singaporeans that each of the FIs have indeed been fair in their approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my third question: what was the total amount of compensation paid out?&nbsp; In particular, what was the total amount of compensation for the 1,282 investors who received full compensation and what was the total&nbsp;amount for those who received more than 50% compensation.&nbsp; This is important to assure Singaporeans that the FIs did not only compensate those investors with small claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my fourth question: MAS has explained, and the Minister has explained, that dissatisfied investors can proceed to FIDReC.&nbsp; Can the Minister confirm whether legally-trained employees of financial institutions can represent them before FIDReC whereas investors cannot be legally represented?&nbsp; If so, how would MAS ensure that the FIDReC process would be fair to&nbsp;investors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my final question: MAS has announced, and the Minister has explained, that there will be a public consultation&nbsp;in March after feedback with the CEOs of the FIs.&nbsp; Can the Minister <p align=left>Column: 1075<p>assure Singaporeans that the full findings of MAS' investigations will be made public, subject to confidentiality concerns?&nbsp; Can the Minister also&nbsp;confirm whether investors can wait until those full findings are released before deciding whether to accept the compensation offers from the FIs so that they can make a fully informed decision?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first question, obviously if those who opted for option 4, which is&nbsp;the no advice option, if we have excluded them I think the figures would have been much lower.&nbsp; So I think the figures included even those who opted for no advice option, but I do not&nbsp;have the figures right here with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question on aggregated numbers and the breakdown of each FI&nbsp;&ndash; what I have given is what is&nbsp;a useful breakdown in terms of the character of the review.&nbsp; There is a distinction between the FIs and the finance company versus the stock-broking companies.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my response, the stock-broking companies generally just execute the instructions given to them.&nbsp; They do not&nbsp;undertake a full financial advisory role so their responsibility is much less and therefore again this is reflected in the outcome.&nbsp; So if you look at the outcome for the Lehman Minibonds by the FIs, 75% received full or partial settlement, which I believe is a very fair outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, on the total amount,&nbsp;it is not possible for us to give the total amount-compensated right now because, as I said, the FIs are in the process of making the offers individually and some may turn down or not all will accept.&nbsp; So the final outcome of the compensation will really depend on who finally takes up the compensation that is offered to them.&nbsp; The FIDReC process&nbsp;does both a mediation process as well as an&nbsp;adjudication process, and&nbsp;I think if you go <p align=left>Column: 1076<p>on to the website you will find that it is a very equitable process.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The FIs and the&nbsp;IPs look at every case&nbsp;on its own merits.&nbsp; So even though we found it useful to have what we call \"vulnerable groups\" to make sure that this is given priority in the review, actually, on the ground, every case is looked at.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those which are not vulnerable are assessed on its own merits and the numbers show that many of them are also given full compensation and partial compensation.&nbsp; It is not meaningful to categorise \"non-vulnerable\" because, as I have explained in my response, each specific criterion, like age, education or size of investment, does not, in itself&nbsp;determine the merits.&nbsp; It is the overall combination of, first, what is the risk assessment of products versus the risk profile of the person to make sure that there is matching and, therefore, there is no inappropriateness in the products sold to the person.&nbsp; Then, in assessing whether it is inappropriate or not,&nbsp;we have to look at the person's ability to make his investment decisions, his education, his track record and the way he has been investing his funds. So it is a holistic assessment of each case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Hong Kong's approach versus ours, I know we are similar. There are pros and cons in proceeding in different ways.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have decided that we should do this in a deliberate manner.&nbsp;The fact that we have resolved the 5,000 over cases in a very rigorous and fair manner shows that the process works,&nbsp;whereas, in Hong Kong, the resolution of such cases is still pending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second part of the regime itself and the processes, again, MAS believes in doing this in a deliberate manner with proper consultation.&nbsp; As I have mentioned in my response, there are&nbsp;some ideas of what to do and we are putting them&nbsp;up for feedback both to the FIs as well as to the general public.&nbsp;When we have assessed the feedback, then we would make a decision.&nbsp;I think this process serves us well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1078<p>\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I just want to ask the Minister whether&nbsp;the FIs are required&nbsp;by MAS to inform the investors of the reasons for rejection or partial settlement?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;the communication process is a two-way process.&nbsp; The investors would ask and the FIs would respond accordingly.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:RETRENCHED AND UNEMPLOYED WORKERS--><p align=left>Column: 1078<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>RETRENCHED AND UNEMPLOYED WORKERS</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp; <B>Mr Ong Ah Heng</B> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower in light of the impending recession (a) what is the Ministry's projected number of retrenched workers and unemployment rate for 2009; (b) which sectors and industries are likely to contract and which will create jobs; and (c) what measures are being planned to help the retrenched and unemployed workers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12.&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim</B> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) in the last 12 months, what is the percentage and number of Singapore citizens, permanent residents and foreigners who lost their jobs at all levels (unskilled to professional levels); (b) what measures has or will the Government put in place to induce employers to retain Singaporeans as opposed to foreigners in any downsizing exercise; and (c) whether the Government will reduce the number of work passes in the various categories issued to foreigners so as to increase the employment opportunities for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong) (for the Minister for Manpower)</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;may I have your permission to take Question Nos. 11 and 12 together?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Yes.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&#65279; <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562\" name=\"GENERATOR\"> <LINK title=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" href=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> &#65279;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I think it would be useful for me to&nbsp;provide an update on the employment situation and outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1079<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced earlier this month that it expects the Singapore economy to grow between -2.0%&nbsp; and 1.0% in 2009.&nbsp; The Minister for Trade and Industry has&nbsp;given an update earlier.&nbsp; Consequently, we expect job growth to slow down significantly this year and unemployment to rise.&nbsp; In fact, employment growth has begun to slow down in the second half of 2008 and more so in the fourth quarter. The overall unemployment rate for 2008, which will be released at the end of January, will be higher than the 2.1% in 2007, which was a record low in 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the&nbsp;nine-month period, from January to September 2008, a total of 6,418 workers were retrenched.&nbsp; Figures for the fourth quarter of 2008 will only be available at the end of January.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we expect the number of retrenchments to rise significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008.&nbsp; Based on the voluntary notifications provided by&nbsp;companies, about 4,800 workers were retrenched in the fourth quarter of 2008, and another 3,300 could be retrenched over the next few months.&nbsp; These are numbers based on notifications by companies. The actual numbers may be higher and we will know the numbers by the end of January based on our surveys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the 6,418 workers who were retrenched in the first three quarters, about 70%&nbsp;were locals, comprising Singapore citizens (SCs) and permanent residents (PRs).&nbsp; However, many employers release their foreign workers through early termination of contracts rather than retrenching them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of&nbsp;redundancies, which is the sum of early terminations and retrenchments, presents a more complete picture of the impact of job losses on locals and foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in terms of redundancies, locals constituted about two-thirds of the <p align=left>Column: 1080<p>7,478 redundancies in the first&nbsp;three quarters of 2008, while foreigners constituted one-third, roughly the same as the local-foreign proportion in our workforce. Amongst these, 56% of these redundancies came from the Production and Transport Operators, Cleaners&nbsp;and Labourers occupational group, while the&nbsp;Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) made up&nbsp;32%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of retrenchments and early termination of contract could increase further over the next few quarters, as more companies restructure their operations to respond to the economic downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to 30,000 workers were retrenched in 1998 due to the Asian Financial Crisis, and about 26,000 workers were retrenched during the economic downturn in 2001.&nbsp; If our economy&nbsp;contracts sharply this year, it is possible that retrenchments could reach these levels seen in previous recessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade that rely heavily on external demand and regional movement of goods and services, may be more affected. The financial services sector is also likely to see more job losses. However, new jobs will still be generated from certain sectors in the economy, such as construction, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, public administration and the integrated resorts.&nbsp; For example, the integrated resorts are expected to add some 20,000 jobs to the economy over the next one or two&nbsp;years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Ms Lim have also asked how the Government is helping local workers and whether we can reduce the number of foreign workers to improve the employment opportunities for locals.&nbsp; Sir, we will monitor the situation closely and continue to carefully calibrate companies'&nbsp;access to foreign workers.&nbsp; On the supply side, the Dependency Ratio framework helps to ensure local employment since <p align=left>Column: 1081<p>companies'&nbsp; access to foreign workers is dependent on the number of local workers that they employ. The foreign worker levy, on the other hand, helps to moderate demand for foreign workers. &nbsp;However, even in a downturn, there will still be a need for foreign workers, especially in jobs that Singaporeans are unable or are unwilling&nbsp;to&nbsp;fill, such as those in the construction sector. Foreign workers help keep companies competitive against global competitors and keep jobs within Singapore.&nbsp; If companies are required to retrench only foreign workers, they may be forced to close down, or move to countries where they can have unlimited access to even cheaper labour; this will result in more job losses and, in turn, affect Singaporeans who work for these companies. This is a lose-lose outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more effective is&nbsp;to enhance the employability of local workers. This will not only give them an added advantage over foreign workers but will also benefit the companies that employ them. This will be&nbsp;a win-win strategy. For this reason, we institutionalised the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme to help the lower income and older workers. The tripartite partners are also working together to save jobs for locals.&nbsp; For example, the tripartite partners rolled out the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) on 1st December 2008 to help companies cut costs and save jobs as well as to build up our workforce capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPUR provides enhanced course fee funding and absentee payroll, but these benefits are only for local workers, therefore making it worthwhile for companies and employers to send their local workers for training during the downturn and save cost as well as save jobs at the same time. We&nbsp;recently expanded SPUR to over 800 courses, up from 150 when it was first launched.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1082<p> This means that employers now have more options when sending their local workers for relevant training. With SPUR, companies are encouraged to retain local workers in managing the current downturn and positioning themselves for the economic recovery. As of 15th January 2009, more than 170 companies have committed to tap on SPUR to train nearly 8,000 workers. In addition, another 2,100 locals who are mostly retrenched or unemployed have signed up at our CET Centres for SPUR programmes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also released the Tripartite Guidelines for Managing Excess Manpower on 19th November 2008, to encourage companies to adopt flexible work arrangements to help contain costs and avoid retrenchments.&nbsp; The response has been very encouraging, with over 90 companies already implementing the recommendations in the guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the retrenched and unemployed, MOM, WDA and the unions have been working closely with companies to help them find suitable jobs.&nbsp; We have enhanced the job matching capabilities of the Career Centres, by building up a comprehensive job bank with jobs sourced from industries, as well as economic agencies such as EDB.&nbsp; Locals who are retrenched or unemployed may also be eligible for training allowance when they enrol for training under SPUR.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The upcoming Budget will be an expansionary one, with additional measures to help households and businesses cope with the downturn, as well as to develop our longer term competitiveness and capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tripartite partners will work&nbsp;together to encourage employers and&nbsp;workers&nbsp;to adopt the tripartite guidelines as well as the NWC guidelines and to make full use of the training support and <p align=left>Column: 1083<p>opportunities available under SPUR. This way,&nbsp;we will be able to ride out this downturn and emerge stronger and more resilient.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>: Order.&nbsp; It is almost 3.00 pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<I>Pursuant to Standing Order No. 22(3), Written Answers to Question Nos.&nbsp;13-18, 21, 24, 26, 29-30, 34 and&nbsp;36-41 on the Order Paper are reproduced in the Appendix*.&nbsp; Question Nos.&nbsp;19-20, 22-23, 25, 27-28, 31-33, 35&nbsp;and 42 have been postponed to the sitting of Parliament on 22nd January 2009</I>.]</p>\r\n</div></span><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr>*Cols. 1163-1194.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS--><p align=left>Column: 1083<p>\r\n<P><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><strong>BILLS INTRODUCED</strong>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div></P>\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc.

They also enhance the supervisory and enforcement powers of MAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1085<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MAS consulted the industry and the public on the proposed amendments and draft Bill in 2006 and 2007.&nbsp; MAS has incorporated feedback received into the Bill, where appropriate, and in line with MAS' regulatory objectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill implements these amendments. &nbsp;In October, in response to questions by Members on the procedures to enhance safeguards for retail investors, I announced that MAS is conducting a separate review to examine the issues regarding the sales and marketing of structured products.&nbsp; Just now&nbsp;during Question time, I updated Members on the progress of this review so far.&nbsp; MAS will conduct public consultation on the proposals arising from this review in March and, therefore, these proposals are not covered in this set of amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the key amendments in the Bill.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;begin with the changes to the rules on capital markets licensing and business conduct.&nbsp; There are five key changes in this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Capital markets licensing and business conduct</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, is to have a continuing licensing regime for corporate licence holders.&nbsp; Under the current SFA, capital markets services (CMS) licence holders have to renew their licences every three years. &nbsp;The Bill introduces a continuing licensing regime for these licence holders where licence holders will not have to renew the licences, to reduce their administrative burden.&nbsp; However, MAS will supervise licence holders on a continual basis, and have the power to revoke licences, if necessary.&nbsp; This brings the CMS licence holders in line with other MAS-regulated institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, which are already operating under a similar continuing licensing regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1086<p>\r\n<p><I>Representative Notification Framework&nbsp;</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second change is on the introduction of a Representative Notification Framework.&nbsp; Currently, only representatives of CMS licence holders need to apply for a licence from MAS to conduct regulated activities.&nbsp; This is not a requirement for representatives of financial institutions exempted from holding a CMS licence, such as&nbsp;banks and insurance companies.&nbsp; This is not desirable as it creates distortion in the recruitment and retention of representatives.&nbsp; It is also difficult for consumers to check if an individual is allowed to conduct certain regulated activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that all representatives, regardless of the institution they work for, are placed under the same regime, the Bill introduces a Representative Notification Framework.&nbsp; This will apply equally to representatives of CMS licence holders as well as&nbsp;representatives of financial institutions exempted from holding a CMS licence.&nbsp; Under this framework, financial institutions will have to notify MAS when they intend to employ someone to conduct a regulated activity.&nbsp; The financial institution will be responsible for ensuring and certifying to MAS that their representatives are fit and proper.&nbsp; Financial institutions and their directors can be held liable for making false or misleading statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of this framework, MAS will maintain a public register of representatives on its website.&nbsp; This register will list information on their representatives, including the type of regulated activities they are allowed to conduct, which institution they&nbsp;work for, and any formal regulatory action taken against them by MAS.&nbsp; Consumers will be able to use the public register to check on the individuals they deal with.&nbsp; Financial institutions can also use this public register to conduct reference checks on potential employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1087<p>\r\n<p><I>Control of take-over of CMS licence holders</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third change is on control of take-over of CMS licence holders.&nbsp; The Bill introduces a new requirement for potential controllers of a CMS licence holder.&nbsp; They will need to obtain MAS' approval before entering into arrangements that&nbsp;would give them effective control of such licence holders.&nbsp; A person has effective control when he acquires directly or indirectly more than 20% of a CMS licence holder's shareholding or voting power. &nbsp;Trust companies and insurance companies, which are regulated by MAS, are subject to similar requirements.&nbsp; MAS will also have powers under certain circumstances, to order&nbsp;people to relinquish effective control, or stop a person from being a party to an arrangement that could result in the person obtaining effective control.&nbsp; For example, MAS would be able to exercise these powers where a person is not, or ceases to be, a fit and proper person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Prohibition order regime</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth change is on the prohibition order regime.&nbsp; Under the SFA, MAS can issue prohibition orders to CMS licence holders and their representatives. &nbsp;This is to help ensure that only suitable persons conduct regulated activities.&nbsp; However, there are gaps as MAS is not able to issue prohibition orders to other persons.&nbsp; This will be remedied under the Bill.&nbsp; MAS will be empowered to issue prohibition orders to the following additional persons:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;exempt financial institutions and their representatives;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;persons previously licensed or exempted from holding a CMS licence by MAS;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1088<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;persons who were previously an appointed, provisional or temporary representative;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;an officer or ex-officer of a CMS licence holder or exempt CMS licence holder; and<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;persons convicted of conducting regulated activities illegally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the SFA, MAS may issue prohibition orders where MAS believes a person has contravened the SFA, or when a person has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty.&nbsp; The Bill provides MAS additional powers for issuing prohibition orders.&nbsp; MAS will be able to issue prohibition orders to persons who have been ordered by the court, or who have entered into a civil penalty settlement agreement with MAS, to pay a civil penalty for market misconduct.&nbsp; Prohibition orders can also be issued to persons who have been removed, at MAS' direction, from the office or employment of a CMS licence holder.&nbsp; MAS will also be able to ban persons issued with prohibition orders from directly or indirectly managing or influencing the business of CMS licence holders or exempt CMS licence holders.&nbsp; For example, MAS will be able to prevent a person from acting as a director or being a substantial shareholder of these financial institutions.&nbsp; These amendments will better enable MAS to keep out unsuitable persons from the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Regulatory assistance to foreign regulators</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth change is to provide regulatory assistance to foreign regulators. &nbsp;A number of the CMS licence holders and exempt CMS licence holders conducting SFA regulated activities are part of larger foreign corporate groups.&nbsp; Foreign regulators may wish to inspect them as part of their consolidated supervision. &nbsp;The Bill will clarify that a <p align=left>Column: 1089<p>foreign regulator that wants to inspect such financial institutions in Singapore will have to obtain MAS' approval. This will align the SFA with the Banking Act which has a similar requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Market misconduct enforcement framework</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn next to amendments related to the investigation framework for market misconduct.&nbsp; There are three key changes in this section.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is the ability to transfer evidence between the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)&nbsp;of the Singapore Police Force and the MAS.&nbsp; Currently, a market misconduct case is taken up by either CAD or MAS at the onset of an investigation, based on the <I>prima facie</I> evidence.&nbsp; The CAD investigates when criminal proceedings are likely, while MAS investigates cases when civil penalties appear appropriate.&nbsp; As the investigation progresses, it may sometimes be necessary for one agency to transfer the matter to the other, based on their preliminary findings.&nbsp; For example, during its investigations, if MAS finds that the case warrants criminal prosecution, MAS will&nbsp;transfer it to CAD.&nbsp; Similarly, CAD may refer cases where civil penalties are more appropriate to MAS.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill provides for transfer of evidence between CAD and MAS, so that the agency taking over the investigation does not have to expend resources to re-investigate the case all over again. This will eliminate duplication of efforts.<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Corporate derivative liability</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second change is on corporate derivative liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will introduce a new concept of attributed liability for market misconduct offences.&nbsp; Currently, a company may not be liable when its employees commit market misconduct.&nbsp; For example, if an employee of an asset management company engages in insider <p align=left>Column: 1090<p> trading using company funds, the company would be liable only if the employee was a director or a secretary of the company, or a person employed in an executive capacity.&nbsp; A company may therefore avoid liability by delegating decisions to lower level employees.&nbsp; The amendments address this by making a corporation, partnership or limited liability partnership liable in certain circumstances.&nbsp; Where it is proven that the market misconduct by an employee, officer, partner or manager has been committed with the consent or connivance of an entity, the entity may be subject to criminal liability.&nbsp; Civil penalty liability would be imposed where the entity has, through its negligence, failed to prevent or detect the employee's market misconduct.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Disgorgement by persons who benefit from contravening trades conducted on their behalf&nbsp;</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third change is on disgorgement by persons who benefit from contravening trades conducted on their behalf.&nbsp; The Bill&nbsp;also introduces a new remedy for affected investors of trades that contravene the market conduct provisions of the SFA.&nbsp; A person who is not party to such illegal trades may sometimes benefit from the profits made.&nbsp; Let me explain with an example.&nbsp; A broker may have used a client's trading account without the client's permission to conduct insider trading.&nbsp; The profits from this illegal trade are credited to the client's account.&nbsp; The broker, as the contravening party, is liable to affected investors for losses incurred.&nbsp; However, he is not in possession of the profits made.&nbsp; It is the client that has made the profits. &nbsp;The client should not be allowed to keep the profits, even though he was not party to the market misconduct.&nbsp; To do so would mean depriving affected investors of an opportunity to recover their losses.&nbsp; The new remedy will allow MAS or affected investors to apply to court to order a person not privy to the illegal trade or <p align=left>Column: 1091<p>market misconduct to disgorge any gains made from the illegal trades.&nbsp; The gains will be paid into the court.&nbsp; The court will then assess all affected investors' claims and distribute the sum equitably.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a court will have the discretion not to order disgorgement if the court considers that the circumstances make it unfair to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Notification of changes in shareholdings of directors, Chief Executive Officers and substantial shareholders and offers of investments</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the amendments related to changes in the shareholdings of directors, CEOs and substantial shareholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal obligations for reporting of interests by directors and substantial shareholders of listed corporations are currently found in both the SFA and the Companies Act.&nbsp; Under the Companies Act, directors and substantial shareholders are required to notify the listed corporation of their interests and changes in interests.&nbsp; Under the SGX listing rules, the listed corporation is in turn required to notify investors.&nbsp; The aim of these reporting requirements is to ensure that the market and investors are kept informed of any changes in shareholdings of directors and substantial shareholders on a timely basis. &nbsp;There are also obligations for directors and substantial shareholders under the Companies Act and the SFA to notify the Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill streamlines and consolidates all notification requirements for directors and substantial shareholders in relation to their interests in listed corporations in the SFA. Directors and substantial shareholders will need to report their interests or changes in interests to the listed corporation, which in turn will inform <p align=left>Column: 1092<p>investors of any such changes.&nbsp; The notification requirement is extended to any CEO who is also not a director.&nbsp; The current obligation for directors and substantial shareholders to separately report changes to the SGX will be removed.&nbsp; While these amendments streamline the current requirements, they will not reduce the amount of information disclosed to the market and investors.&nbsp; Similar amendments are also being made to the disclosure requirements for interests in listed business trusts and real estate investment trusts (REIT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Lowering minimum investment threshold amount for prospectus exemption</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second key change is on the lowering of minimum investment threshold amount for prospectus exemption.&nbsp; Currently, offers of investment must be accompanied by a prospectus.&nbsp; The SFA allows offers to be made without a prospectus if the minimum investment amount for the offer is at least S$200,000.&nbsp; This means that&nbsp;each and every investor must invest at least S$200,000 for each transaction before the offer can be made without a prospectus.</p>\r\n</P></span></div> \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to industry feedback, MAS will lower this minimum investment amount to S$100,000.&nbsp; S$100,000 is a very significant sum of money.&nbsp; MAS considers that a person who is willing to invest S$100,000 or more in a single transaction would possess, or have the ability to get access to, sufficient financial information to protect his own interests.&nbsp; The S$100,000 minimum investment amount is in line with thresholds set in other jurisdictions, eg, the European Union's threshold is set at EUR50,000, while Hong Kong's is set at HK$500,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enhancements to the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) Regime</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third change is on enhancements to the Real Estate Investment Trusts <p align=left>Column: 1093<p>(REIT) regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the enhancements being made to the REIT regime.&nbsp; Singapore's REIT market has developed substantially in recent years.&nbsp; Amendments are being made to ensure appropriate rules are in place to govern mergers and privatisations of REITs.&nbsp; With these amendments, the Takeover Code will apply to REITs.&nbsp; The Bill will also allow an offeror making a general offer for units in a REIT to compulsorily acquire the units of the dissenting minority.&nbsp; The offeror can do so if he has obtained acceptances of 90% or more of the units offered.&nbsp; Minority unitholders will also be able to require an offeror to acquire their units if the offeror has acquired 90% or more of the total units in the REIT.&nbsp; Similar amendments will be made for business trusts in the Business Trusts Act.&nbsp; These provisions being introduced mirror the compulsory acquisition provisions in the Companies Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also introduces a new provision to protect REIT unitholders.&nbsp; A REIT unitholder will be able to apply to court for an order to seek judicial redress in cases of oppression, unfair discrimination or prejudice.&nbsp; This remedy is currently available in the Companies Act and the Business Trusts Act, and should&nbsp;similarly be afforded to REIT unitholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Markets and clearing facilities</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to the amendments that deal with Singapore's markets and clearing facilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approved exchanges and designated clearing houses are systemically-important parts of our financial system.&nbsp; Any failure or disruption in these markets and clearing facilities would undermine financial stability and public confidence.&nbsp; Following a general review of its powers to deal with emergencies across the financial sector, MAS has assessed that it is important to extend its existing emergency powers under the SFA to deal <p align=left>Column: 1094<p>with events that would impact approved exchanges and designated clearing houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, MAS will be allowed to appoint statutory advisers.&nbsp; These advisers are to provide advice to an approved exchange or designated clearing house on the proper management of its business.&nbsp; The power to appoint statutory advisers can be triggered in emergency circumstances.&nbsp; One such circumstance would be where the exchange or clearing house is likely to become insolvent.&nbsp; Another would be where the entity is being mismanaged to the detriment of MAS' regulatory objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, MAS will be given powers to obtain information from any person in emergency circumstances to maintain the safe and efficient operation of a designated clearing house.&nbsp; For example, MAS may require information necessary for it to order the liquidation of positions held with a clearing house.&nbsp; This will complement MAS' existing powers in respect of approved exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Regulatory flexibility to deal with market innovation</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me now to turn to the final category of amendments to the SFA.&nbsp; This touches on enhancing regulatory flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The definitions of \"securities\" and \"futures contracts\" are being amended.&nbsp; MAS will have the power to prescribe or exclude products as securities.&nbsp; The power to prescribe products as securities, in particular, will allow MAS to bring new products within its regulatory ambit under the SFA in a timely manner.&nbsp; MAS currently has the power to prescribe new contracts as \"futures contracts\".&nbsp; The proposed amendments will give MAS the power to also exclude contracts from the definition of \"futures contract\".&nbsp; These amendments will enable MAS to act more efficiently on market developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1095<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, to conclude,&nbsp;the financial landscape is constantly changing.&nbsp; Good regulation is about balancing the needs of the financial markets and the investing public.&nbsp; MAS will keep our regulatory regime under review to ensure that the transparency and integrity of Singapore's financial system is upheld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill comes&nbsp;during the time of great turmoil in the global financial markets.&nbsp; World financial systems have failed and today no one knows what&nbsp;the right financial model will be for the future.&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is about&nbsp;two years in the making, and I am sure many of the changes proposed already need changing for us to be able to manage the financial markets in the future.&nbsp; We learned many lessons not only from the failure of Wall Street and other major financial markets of the world but also close at home where the sale of structured products in our financial institutions demonstrated some weaknesses in the Securities and Futures Act, the&nbsp;issue that we discussed during Question Time just now.&nbsp; I therefore urge the Minister&nbsp;to as quickly as this Bill gets passed&nbsp;start&nbsp;the review process of the next set of changes.&nbsp; We hear that MAS is already doing this, and I hope that&nbsp;he can come back and implement them&nbsp;as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the one area the public will demand&nbsp;of us and which deserves&nbsp;special scrutiny is on whether there is sufficient oversight over the products on sale and the people that they are sold to.&nbsp; There is a strong view among people on the <p align=left>Column: 1096<p>ground that we need to tighten the regulations surrounding this.&nbsp; Many unsuspecting or vulnerable people got sold products that they should not have been sold.&nbsp; In this Bill, among the things we are doing is altering the definition of &ldquo;securities&rdquo; (in section 239) and &ldquo;futures contracts&rdquo; (in section 2) of the Act.&nbsp; In this change, MAS is given the ability to prescribe products as securities and the power to exclude certain products from the list of securities or futures contracts.&nbsp; To give this change meaning in the present context, we need to ensure that the regulator is vigilant and takes the initiative to review the products out there, as well as the institutions selling them, instead of just scrutinising new products that institutions intend to place on the market.&nbsp; So we should review all the current products that are already out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I&nbsp;would like to move&nbsp;now to&nbsp;the comments on this Bill.&nbsp; I have some specific and some general comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The replacement of the licensing regime for representatives under the SFA with a notification regime&nbsp;is achieved by the amendments (and consequential amendments proposed) by clauses 17 to 39 of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My comments are, first of all,&nbsp;the Bill modifies the current requirement of renewing a Capital Markets Services licence every&nbsp;three years, which poses some administrative and compliance pressure on the&nbsp;industry.&nbsp; The switch to a perpetual licensing scheme&nbsp;makes this compliance much easier and is a positive move to assist the financial institutions at a time when&nbsp;institutions are under pressure on the business side and as competition heats up around us, and as we try to grow ourselves as a financial centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also good because it is similar to the perpetual licensing regime that <p align=left>Column: 1097<p>governs banks and insurance companies and&nbsp;rationalises the systems governing the different parts of our financial infrastructure.&nbsp; So they were different in the past and I am glad that we are rationalising right now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;in the recent structured products saga, we have heard from members of the public who feel that they have not been well served by financial advisers or people who have persuaded them to invest in the instruments.&nbsp; We must remain vigilant that once licensed, there is some continuing oversight over these professionals.&nbsp; We must balance the reduction in oversight with mechanisms that allow the public to have better information about the licence holders and their backgrounds and competence, an accessible means to raise concerns about the licence holders, and the ability on the part of&nbsp;MAS to investigate and suspend or revoke the licence as appropriate.&nbsp; It should not be that once it is perpetual, we do not come back and review the licence holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MAS can collect information on licence holders and the activities to which their licences relate (as proposed in the re-enacted&nbsp;section 94) and also publish this information (as proposed in the new&nbsp;section 94(2)).&nbsp; In the age of the Internet, and given the important end of protecting the public by giving them information about the licence holders, I would like to recommend that MAS consider, as a best practice, publishing at least the basic information about licence holders and their allowed fields of activity, on a page linked to main website, MAS website, and that this information be accessible by the public without charge.&nbsp; Also, where a representative has had a prohibition order made against him, it would be important to have this information publicly accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed new section 99C(1) also provides for collection of information on <p align=left>Column: 1098<p>the representatives.&nbsp; This will ensure that the financial industry professionals who have a record of action taken against them will not be able to continue acting with impunity and harming the financial interests of members of the public and the institutions that deal with them.&nbsp; I would suggest that, as a best practice, the MAS make it a practice of publishing the information collected pursuant to its powers in section 99C(1), which it is allowed to do&nbsp;under section 99C(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having information that is easily publicly accessible will add teeth to the requirement imposed by the proposed new regime of all representatives having to be registered.&nbsp; Knowing that your status can&nbsp; easily be checked will be a sure way to incentivise people from becoming legitimate licence holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The move to make all representatives here subject to licensing requirements (as&nbsp;proposed by the new section 99B, as amended in&nbsp;clause 36 of the Bill) is a positive one that will simplify matters not just for professionals wanting to work in the financial industry in Singapore but also for&nbsp;members of the public who deal with them.&nbsp; The provision allowing a person to be licensed as a temporary representative (which is proposed under&nbsp;section 99F) would in theory allow talented financial practitioners from other countries to come here and work for short periods of time&nbsp;on a limited assignment basis.&nbsp; I would caution, however, that in the current period of job losses, particularly in Wall Streets and other European financial markets,&nbsp;we are likely to see an inflow of financial practitioners seeking their fortunes here while they ride out the downturn elsewhere.&nbsp; The MAS should therefore exercise strict control on the practitioners it allows to practise here as temporary representatives, and push them as far as is practicably possible to make them committed to become at least provisional representatives (under the <p align=left>Column: 1099<p> proposed section 99E) pending their sitting for the examinations to become appointed representatives as&nbsp;proposed under section 99D.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important provision to safeguard the public is the proposed new section 99H, which requires principals to lodge documents certifying that they think their proposed representatives are fit and proper persons for the appointment in respect of the regulated activity, as defined in section 99H(1)(b).&nbsp; Although there is a requirement for the institutions to keep records of documents on the basis of which they certify such representatives as fit and proper, the issue might be that this certification is very subjective because it is done by the financial institutions and&nbsp;this certification may not be standardised across the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The certification is also a one-time certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore have&nbsp;three suggestions for improvements here.&nbsp; First, I would suggest some kind of periodic confirmation of certification.&nbsp; Although the legal effect would be the same as the initial certification, the periodic certification would keep the importance of&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;operating in the minds of the leading executives at the financial institutions about the importance of the certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I suggest that&nbsp;MAS be given the power to audit the certification to see whether the institutions have a process in place and exercise proper judgment when certifying representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third suggestion relates to the examinations.&nbsp; Under the proposed amendments, representatives have to take an examination before they can become approved.&nbsp; My question is: is MAS involved in the setting of the curriculum for these examinations or at least having an oversight of it, and reviewing the <p align=left>Column: 1100<p>stringency of the examinations?&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that as in&nbsp;other professions, such as the legal profession, a compulsory ethics component be included in the examinations, in addition to the product knowledge and rules and regulations components which&nbsp;are the requirements right now.&nbsp; These will make the examinations and&nbsp;curriculum in sync with what the current context demands of us. &nbsp;MAS could even consider footing some of the cost for the training and examinations in the interest of upholding standards.&nbsp; So we can support institutions that do these examinations by funding them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, where the representative that&nbsp;is being certified has worked with institutions that hit troubled times due to improper market conduct or dubious sales practices, the financial institutions employing and certifying them should be cautioned to take extra care when reviewing their status and in certifying them.&nbsp; MAS, perhaps, should get involved in cautioning them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The powers&nbsp;of MAS under the proposed&nbsp;sections 99M and 99N are comprehensive and should provide comfort to the public that the regulator has the teeth to keep representatives&nbsp;straight.&nbsp; The powers in section 101A in particular and their effect as set out in the proposed&nbsp;section 101B are also important in this regard.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In the current financial meltdown, we have seen that many of the culprits of the problems caused in the US operated with near impunity and outside of effective regulatory oversight. This amendment, I hope, will prevent such a lax regime from developing here. The ability to make a <p align=left>Column: 1101<p>prohibition order against a person who has been ordered to pay a civil penalty is a useful pressure mechanism against such a person as well as a protective mechanism for the public, as in the proposed section 101A(1)(f).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of MAS to make prohibition orders under the new section 101A, with the powers to revoke or suspend a licence holder's licence if such an order is in force (under the new re-enacted section 95(2)(h)), is an important power and I am glad to see this included in the amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest that if a Prohibition Order has been made, this also be reflected in the publicly available information on licence holder&nbsp;&ndash; the suggestion that I made earlier. I also note that from the proposed&nbsp;section 101A that there may exist an interim period between the making of a Prohibition Order under that section, and the revocation or suspension of the licence holder's licence. In that interim period, and after, it is critical that the public has this information so that they can take steps to protect themselves. It may also be that a Prohibition Order does not lead to revocation or suspension of the licence under the proposed re-enacted section 95, as the MAS would have to give the licence holder the right to be heard before doing so (as stated under&nbsp;section 95(4)). In that event, there may be a situation of some loss of reputation to the licence holder or to the institution because of the revelation of the information.&nbsp; However, I think it would be best to err on the side of protecting the public. Licence holders will just have to be that much more careful before exposing themselves to situations where their licences are threatened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also note that the Prohibition Orders seem to be perpetual. From the Bill, there are a variety of situations where the Prohibition Orders can be made. I suggest that the Prohibtion Orders be <p align=left>Column: 1102<p>time-based, with the possibility of an extension where appropriate. Further, where the infraction is less severe, these Prohibition Orders should be treated differently from those where there have been&nbsp;offences of dishonesty&nbsp;and fraud leading to the Prohibition Orders. For both of these categories,&nbsp;especially for the former, I would suggest some process of rehabilitation and re-admission as a representative. This will allow us to keep our talent base here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on the issue of fund raising, while I generally support the changes under clause 67 which amends&nbsp; section 240, I would like to ask the Minister why clause 73, which amends section 275 to reduce the minimum investment amount required for offers made to certain accredited and other persons from $200,000 to $100,000, is necessary. I worry that this reduction may open up a pool of unsophisticated customers that representatives may be tempted to target. We have seen from the recent structured product saga, particularly the Lehman Minibonds, there were those that we called \"vulnerable customers\" who had invested more than $100,000.&nbsp;One of my residents invested $110,000, and I consider them as not in the know.&nbsp; I think reducing from $200,000 to $100,000, at this point of time, does not seem to be&nbsp;a right move. Can the Minister please explain the reason for lowering this floor amount?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 236L, which is introduced by clause 61, allows MAS to apply to the Court for an order for disgorgement of benefits. Under sub-section 4, it is proposed that the Court will not make such an order if the party against whom it&nbsp;is sought is innocent of knowledge and did not have a reasonable suspicion that the benefit he gained was due to a contravention such as specified in section 236(1).&nbsp; And then there is the word \"and\" &ndash;&nbsp;and if he has changed his position after receiving the benefit.&nbsp; This cumulative requirement of innocence <p align=left>Column: 1103<p>and change of position is not rational to me. If someone is innocent of&nbsp;such a knowledge, then why should we require that his position&nbsp;be changed before we make an&nbsp;order for disgorgement? Similarly, if he is not innocent of such knowledge, why should it matter that he has changed his position after that? I would recommend therefore that the requirement be limited to innocence of knowledge of contravention only, without the additional requirement of change of position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on&nbsp;balance, I support this Bill, although I hope the Minister will respond and, if necessary, make modifications to the Bill as I have outlined, in view of revelations of the fragility of the financial infrastructure that have come out as a result of all the recent events in the financial industry.&nbsp; And as I have&nbsp;mentioned, I hope that we will quickly follow with another amendment to put in place all the lessons that we have learnt in the recent saga.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> &#65279; <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562\" name=\"GENERATOR\"> <LINK title=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" href=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. The Minister has explained that this Bill does not address the issues raised as a result of the structured product issue. Even so, I hope that this House will bear with me as I point out some of the changes that I think should have been&nbsp;included in this Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Securities and Futures Act (SFA) was enacted in 2001, to introduce a disclosure-based regime. The idea is that such a regime will empower investors to make informed decisions. I think it remains undisputed that, on the whole, this is preferable to a merit-based regime, where the regulator decides on the products that may be offered on the market. But that is the general rule. There are, of course, exceptions&nbsp;&ndash; situations where rigid insistence on the disclosure-<p align=left>Column: 1104<p>based regime could be more due to dogma than merit, where even the most transparent of disclosures would not be adequate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This idea of an exception is not radical. The SFA itself permits a differentiated approach for products that are limited to so-called \"accredited persons\" under the Act, which includes high net worth individuals&nbsp;&ndash; meaning individuals with net personal assets exceeding $2 million or annual incomes exceeding $300,000. So, at one end of the spectrum, we have different treatment for sophisticated investors. Why should we also not have different treatment at the other end of the spectrum, to protect unsophisticated investors as well? Indeed, logic dictates that at the margins, a one-size-fits-all approach is likely to be inadequate, and that differentiated treatment is likely to be required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let us go further, beyond the ambit of the SFA. Let us look at the CPF Investment Scheme, for a very clear example of a regulator adopting a differentiated approach in terms of products that are deemed to be too risky for investment.&nbsp; This House recently debated the limits on Town Councils' powers to invest their sinking funds in high-risk products. We make all these decisions for Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why is the regime under the SFA so different? While we should seek to preserve the maximum investment freedom of individuals under the SFA, that cannot be at the price of suitable protections. So, the question is really about the limits of the disclosure-based regime, about where we should draw the line. I would frame the question thus: are there products that are inherently unsuitable for sale to retail investors over the counter, regardless of the level of disclosure made?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are really two aspects to this question. Firstly, are there investment products that are so complex, that it <p align=left>Column: 1105<p>would never be possible to have meaningful disclosures to justify their sale to retail investors. Disclosures have to be meaningful for the disclosure-based system to work. &nbsp;As one Mr Ng Kwong Yee pointed out in his letter to the <I>Straits Times Forum</I> on 14th October 2008, \"It seems the current disclosures serve more to indemnify financial institutions than inform investors in their very complicated and technical method.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in its report on Lehman-related structured products, explicitly recognised that \"investors will not read and understand copious documentation, which is often designed more for the protection of the issuer than for the enlightenment of the customer.\" Surely we also need to recognise this simple fact of life and then address it, instead of continually asking investors to read the documentation and make informed decisions, knowing that the documentation is such as to make that&nbsp;realistically impossible for most or almost all retail investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, disclosures, as they are presently made, are really a one-size-fits-all approach to complying with the SFA's requirements. But&nbsp;most 70-year-old retirees will have a lot of trouble understanding credit default swaps, reference entities and credit events. They can all be disclosed.&nbsp; They can all&nbsp;be written in bold on the front cover of the document, but would the retiree understand? Would even a 30-something working professional understand? I, for one, am quite sure, I would not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much has been said about a&nbsp;statement in bold printed on the front cover of High Notes and Minibonds prospectuses, stating that investors may lose all of their investments. But this bold statement, in and of itself, cannot be adequate to satisfy the obligation for adequate disclosure, without being accompanied by either a quantification of the risk of total <p align=left>Column: 1106<p>loss, or an explanation of the ways in which such loss may occur.&nbsp;A mere disclosure cannot be enough&nbsp;&ndash; it must be a meaningful disclosure. And when investment products are being sold over the counter to retail investors, and disclosures are put in documents that run into the hundreds of pages, can it ever be possible to have a meaningful disclosure for products as complicated as these structured products were?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No less than Prof. Ivan Png, a former Nominated Member, has confessed to not being confident that he fully understands the Minibonds, in his newspaper articles on the subject of structured products. And Dr Oliver Chen from the NUS Risk Management Institute and Dr Anand Srinivasan from the NUS Business School have stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"A key consideration in deciding whether such structured products should be marketed to retail investors should be whether the risks involved can be readily understood. Some structured products, whose risks are very difficult to understand, may never be suitable for retail investors.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just repeat that&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;\"some structured products, whose risks are very difficult to understand, may never be suitable for retail investors.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Dr Oliver Chen and Prof. Png are far more learned and know much more about financial matters than I can ever hope to know. If even the experts find these structured products complex and difficult to understand, what hope is there for common people like&nbsp;me, much less the retiree uncles and aunties who have always kept their money in fixed deposits? Can disclosures, however transparent, ever justify the sale of such complex products to retail investors over the counter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second aspect is this.&nbsp; Can investment products&nbsp;that are&nbsp;so high-risk <p align=left>Column: 1107<p>or so unfair to investors that they should not be sold, especially to retail investors over the counter, regardless of the disclosures made? On 31st October 2008, the <I>Straits Times</I> carried a report on a forum organised by DBS for High Notes 5 investors the day before. DBS reportedly admitted at the forum that the product was not high-risk, that on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest risk, the product should be between 8 and 9. That makes High Notes 5 an immensely high-risk product. It should not&nbsp;have been sold to investors then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for unfair products, Minibonds are a striking example. Minibond investors had essentially insured the issuer, Lehman Brothers, against the risk of a credit event by the reference entities. So not only did Lehman Brothers make money from structuring and selling the Minibonds, it also insured itself against its own investment risks, a state of affairs that was not explicitly disclosed as such in the pricing statement&nbsp;or prospectus. Given the potential returns from the Minibonds, in the range of a few percentage points, was this wholesale transfer of risks to&nbsp;investors justifiable? Was it fair? Should such products ever be permissible for sale to retail investors over the counter? In the case of the Minibonds, the disclosures were not clear. But even if they had been transparently clear, should that make a difference to the issue of whether to allow the Minibonds to be sold to retail investors over the counter, given how inherently unfair they are?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My views should be clear. I do believe that some products can be so complicated that the disclosures can never be adequate for over-the-counter sales to retail investors, and that some products can be so high-risk or so unfair that they should not be sold over the counter to retail investors. Just look at the Minibonds. They are an extremely clear case in point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1108<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am sure that some people will say that investors need to take responsibility for themselves, that if they do not understand a product then they should not buy it. I think this is too simplistic a view, and also smacks of hubris. I myself have never bought structured products, because I did not understand them. I did not understand where the money was being made, and I did not know who was making the money and so I concluded&nbsp;&ndash; perhaps cynically, but certainly correctly&nbsp;&ndash; that it would not be the investors who are making the money. But I thank my lucky stars for my good fortune and my relative risk averseness to have been spared. I certainly do not put it down to any special intelligence on my part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role of regulation is not so much to protect people like the Members of this House, whom I am sure are intelligent and sophisticated enough to take care of ourselves, but to protect the gullible, the unsophisticated, the vulnerable. We can and must maintain a balance between maintaining a flexible regulatory regime that as a rule does not substitute the regulator&rsquo;s decision for individuals&rsquo; decisions, and building in sufficient differentiated treatment to protect those who need such protection. We cannot veer too much to either end, whether for ideological or other reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have chosen my words carefully&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;overly-complex, overly-risky and overly-unfair products should be prohibited from over-the-counter sales to retail investors. I am not advocating an outright prohibition, but rather that such products be disqualified from over-the-counter sales to retail investors. A retail investor who really wants to purchase such products should still be permitted to do so through other channels. This would preserve freedom of choice and mitigates the problem of moral hazard, while preventing repeats of the structured products saga, or at&nbsp;least making them rather more unlikely.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1109<p>Over the past two decades or so, we have seen that the ingenuity of financial engineering knows no bounds.&nbsp; The financial crisis would have curtailed the excesses of financial institutions in creating products that were once praised as being innovative, but are now clearly reckless and exploitative.&nbsp; But rest assured, the financial engineers will return, and we absolutely need to make sure that our regulatory regime is able to guard Singaporeans against their worst abuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill&nbsp;currently before this House does not address these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope that MAS will draw the correct lessons from this structured product debacle, and do what needs to be done to protect consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I thank the two MPs for supporting the Bill.&nbsp; Let me try and explain the changes and respond to the queries raised.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on Mr Inderjit Singh's&nbsp;query on widening the definitions of \"securities\" and \"futures\".&nbsp; This allows MAS to respond to the classes of products that come into the market, but not to review individual products.&nbsp; So our general regime still remains the same.&nbsp; As Mr Siew Kum Hong says, it is a disclosure-based regime, and we think that that is fundamentally the right approach.&nbsp; But we have different classes of products that come into the market and therefore MAS needs the power to be able to define them whether they are \"securities\" or \"futures\".&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Inderjit Singh, this is not intended to review specific individual products but classes of products, eg, new types of warrants being classified as part of the \"securities\" that we will regulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, is the perpetual licensing regime.&nbsp; I am glad Mr Singh supports this <p align=left>Column: 1110<p>because it reduces administrative costs.&nbsp; I would like to reassure him that a perpetual licensing regime does not mean that MAS will not regulate the system.&nbsp; It is not just giving&nbsp;an individual&nbsp;a licence and we forget about him.&nbsp; There will be continuous licensing, regulation and monitoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me explain.&nbsp; There are two categories. One is the licence holders which are really the entities.&nbsp; I take his suggestion that there ought to be some kind of disclosure of what kind of regulator activities the licence holder can be involved in, and I am sure that is somewhere in the website.&nbsp; If it is not, we will put it out there.&nbsp; The second group is really the representatives.&nbsp; These are the individuals and, as I explained in&nbsp;my Second Reading speech, we have this register which will be publicly available.&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that Mr Inderjit Singh talked about, disclosure and letting people know&nbsp;the person is qualified to act as a representative, are taken into account.&nbsp; For the public register, whether there are prohibition orders or black marks against these people, these will all be in the register.&nbsp; The prohibition order is made public.&nbsp; That is the intention.&nbsp; It is time based, usually it is for five years, but the period will be indicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a balance between making it public so that people know the record but, at the same time, giving a chance for people to be rehabilitated and go back into the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the definition and certification of \"fit and proper\", the whole idea of having this continuous system and having this public register is to put the onus on the entities&nbsp;&ndash; the licensed holder or the financial institutions&nbsp;&ndash; so that when they employ the representatives, they have to be responsible, and the onus is on them to make sure that they are fit and proper.&nbsp; MAS, together with the stakeholders, of course, has a guideline of what are the <p align=left>Column: 1111<p>criteria for deeming people fit and proper.&nbsp; And I would like to assure Mr Inderjit Singh that this is a continuous system.&nbsp; It is not that when&nbsp;an institution&nbsp;employs somebody,&nbsp;it makes an assessment, but we expect the institution, in certifying that the person is fit and proper, to do so on a continuous basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh also talked about temporary representatives.&nbsp; I think this is the flexibility we have so that qualified professionals can work in Singapore for short periods for projects or for certain deals.&nbsp; And then if they want to be here on a more permanent basis, then of course they become provisional or permanent.&nbsp; Again, the onus is on the entities who employ them.&nbsp; They cannot just come on their own.&nbsp; They are likely to come in being an employee of an institution.&nbsp; So they would be assessed and certified by the institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of the minimum investible sums coming down to $100,000, as I explained in my Second Reading speech, this is a relaxation in line with other jurisdictions but, at the same time, it is quite an onerous requirement, because what we are saying is every individual investor must invest no less than $100,000.&nbsp; So, it is not like the Minibond case where&nbsp;we have a range of investors, like some&nbsp;of your constituents may have&nbsp;invested more than $100,000, but others may have invested $50,000 or $20,000. So that will not qualify and therefore a prospectus is needed.&nbsp; For prospectus that is not&nbsp;needed, each and every investor must invest more than $100,000.&nbsp; So it is quite an onerous requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the point about disgorgement, I think we want to have a fair system where people who have benefited from it, even though they are not directly involved in&nbsp;illegal trade, should disgorge the <p align=left>Column: 1112<p>proceeds of the illegal trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though&nbsp;a person&nbsp;may not know of the trade,&nbsp;because the profits are the proceeds of an illegality, he should not be allowed to retain the profits unless there has been a change of position such that it is unfair to make him disgorge the profits.&nbsp; So that is the reason why there is&nbsp;the word&nbsp;\"and\" and not&nbsp;\"or\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me respond to Mr Siew Kum Hong's points.&nbsp; Essentially, as I mentioned in my Second Reading speech, these amendments do not take into account what MAS is doing in reviewing the risk assessment and the sales process of&nbsp;structured products, the issue that he is very concerned with.&nbsp; I am sure we will come back to the House again when we make changes in the risk classification and the sales process of structured products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The House has just debated on the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2008.&nbsp; The amendments in the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill 2008 are similar in part to the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2008. &nbsp;It has the same objectives of enabling MAS to respond more quickly to new market developments, and enhancing the supervisory and enforcement powers of MAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key amendments that have been made in the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2008,&nbsp;which will be replicated in the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill 2008, relate to the amendments on capital markets licensing and business conduct. Specifically, these are in relation to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;continuing licensing regime for financial advisers' licence holders;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I, therefore, support the amendments in this Bill that affect the amendments in the Securities and Futures&nbsp;(Amendment) Bill which we have&nbsp;just covered a while ago.&nbsp; I will, therefore, limit my comments to the points that were not covered under the SFA.&nbsp; I have one main concern and that regards the investigative powers of MAS.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am especially concerned about the new section 70A(6) which makes it an offence by a person if such a report by MAS was disclosed to him, unless he can prove that it was contrary to his desire, which means that he did not desire to receive it even if someone had sent him without his choice,&nbsp;and that he took suitable steps to surrender the report and destroy the copies of the report that he got.&nbsp; The offence is proposed to be punishable by a fine of $50,000 or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that this may be the most convenient disincentive to put in place, it must have some semblance to what is&nbsp;practical and what is reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we cannot criminalise people merely because of the action of other people. &nbsp;In this case, if a report was sent to this person without his choice, without <p align=left>Column: 1115<p>him knowing about it, he is liable.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;we are building&nbsp;a safeguard,&nbsp;these people then have the ability to exonerate themselves by pointing to their own conduct after the disclosure is made to them.&nbsp; The starting position itself, in my opinion, is bad, that they are exposed to a liability not through their own action.&nbsp; I would therefore urge that this provision be reviewed in the change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, where MAS has investigated the person and released a report to that person as is provided for in the new sections 70A and 71A, which is amended by clauses 33 and 34 respectively.&nbsp; In this change, there is an obligation of confidentiality such that without approval, this report cannot be disclosed by the investigated person to his legal counsel.&nbsp; I believe that this is too restrictive.&nbsp; Once a report is released by MAS, it is likely that MAS has had sufficient time to form a view on the conduct it is investigating.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is not fair to have these additional restrictions to the person.&nbsp; And we should also align this with the criminal law generally where, I am told, that as soon as the investigative authorities form a view, there is no further need for&nbsp;restrictions on the person under investigation from seeking advice.&nbsp; Advice from competent professionals could also be key to an early and voluntary remedial action taken by the investigated person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on&nbsp;balance, I support the Bill as a necessary addition to our financial architecture to try to change the landscape here, and I hope that my comments will be taken into consideration as we put the changes in place.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As with the Securities and Futures Act, these amendments to the Financial Advisers Act (FAA)&nbsp;do not incorporate<p align=left>Column: 1116<p> any of the lessons from the structured deposit saga.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I will say a few words about what amendments I think this Bill should have included in&nbsp;light of that, but did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two broad points to make, corresponding to the two components that are necessary for a successful functioning regulatory regime, namely, the regulations that are in place and the enforcement of those regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The FAA, as it currently stands, represents a rule-based approach to regulation.&nbsp; This is to be contrasted to a principle-based approach.&nbsp; The Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK is widely recognised as the foremost practitioner in the world of the principle-based approach.&nbsp; So what exactly is it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the FSA website and I quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Principles-based regulation means, where possible, moving away from dictating through detailed, prescriptive rules and supervisory actions how firms should operate their business.&nbsp; Principles-based regulation means placing greater reliance on principles and outcome-focused, high level rules as a means to drive at the regulatory aims we want to achieve, and less reliance on prescriptive rules.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sitting of this House on 20th October 2008, my colleague, Mr Gautam Banerjee, asked about whether we should move towards a principle-based approach. &nbsp;The response of the Minister then expounded on the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in the sale process, including investors, but did not touch on the merits of Mr Banerjee's suggestion.&nbsp; I will now attempt to explain some of those merits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two approaches are not either or, or&nbsp;mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Instead, jurisdictions which practise the principle-based <p align=left>Column: 1117<p>approach, such as the UK, Taiwan and Malaysia, do so in combination with the rule-based approach, seeking to strike an optimal mix of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the FAA, as it currently stands,&nbsp;seems to be primarily, if not almost exclusively, rule-based in&nbsp;a single-minded focus on the various steps that are required in the sale process.&nbsp; We set the objective of ensuring that an investor has been properly advised by a financial adviser, but we do not make that the sole requirement.&nbsp; Instead, we have prescriptive rules on the steps that a financial adviser must take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, has this rule-based approach been sufficient or effective to protect investors against mis-selling? &nbsp;I think the ongoing saga of the Lehman-linked structured products has shown up the flaws in this sort of mechanical, tick-the-box, rule-based approach.&nbsp; The financial institutions (FIs) involved may have followed the letter of the rules, but it is clear that they have disregarded the spirit in many, if not most, of the cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is therefore encouraging that MAS had asked FIs&nbsp;not to be overly legalistic in resolving the complaints, that request by MAS implicitly suggests that FIs could have avoided responsibility if they did choose to be legalistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently read an article in&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> on 10th January 2009, about the scandal surrounding Satyam Computer Services of India.&nbsp; There was a quote, from the head of a prominent local audit firm that&nbsp;really resonated with me, which was:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"In real life, the rules are a lot of form and no substance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;quote has nothing to do with structured products,&nbsp;but it highlighted a fundamental truth about frameworks and processes and forms and disclosures.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 1118<p>can have all the rules in the world, we can require financial advisers to jump through all sorts of hoops in the sale process in an effort to ensure that investors' interests are appropriately protected, but we would still be missing the woods for the trees if we do not understand that the rules are just the ends to the means, and not the ends in themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An exclusively rule-based approach is fundamentally unsound, so long as financial products are sold by sales persons who are remunerated by commission.&nbsp; Sales people being what they are, they&nbsp;will&nbsp;always seek to close&nbsp;a sale in such a way as to comply with the rules with minimal effort by them. &nbsp;It is important to understand that and to have the right regulatory approach in response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this, I do not seek to impugn sales persons.&nbsp; I spent one year working as the in-house legal counsel in a sales company, and my current employer's sales team is one of my internal clients. &nbsp;They are not better or worse than other people simply because they work in sales. &nbsp;They are simply intelligent human beings; so they will behave according to how they are incentivised. And when they are incentivised by commissions, they will always seek the path of least resistance in closing that sale, so as to get at that commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why an exclusively rule-based approach is deficient.&nbsp; The smart sales person&nbsp;will always figure out how to work the system, how to get what they want while not breaking the letter of the rules.&nbsp; When the rules focus only on the different steps to take, the forms to be completed, the boxes to be ticked, then the smart sales person will simply take those steps, complete the forms and tick the boxes in the way that requires the least effort.&nbsp; The question of proper advice for the investor becomes irrelevant to the closure&nbsp;of that sale.&nbsp; Instead, if the objective is to ensure that investors are properly advised,<p align=left>Column: 1119<p> then the operative rule must be that financial advisers properly advise them.&nbsp; When that is the letter of the rule that financial advisers have to abide by, there is little wriggle room left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of writing this speech, I have come across a number of very good suggestions of possible refinements to the existing regime.&nbsp; These include the elimination,&nbsp;or at the minimum,&nbsp;a stringent restriction of the so-called Option 4 (no advice option) in the sale process, a cooling-off period for the sale of investment products, disclosure of the commissions and fees earned from the sale of investment products&nbsp;&ndash; similar to what takes place for insurance products&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and even a separation of general banking and investment sales functions in banks, as has been recommended in Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these are refinements to existing rules, and they preserve the primacy of the rule-based approach. I believe that it is necessary to introduce principle-based regulations as well, particularly in regulating the sale process.&nbsp; The principle-based approach is not a panacea but is certainly essential.&nbsp; Otherwise, ingenious sales persons will simply find new ways to comply with the rules while continuing to sell investment products that are not in investors' best interests.&nbsp; And we will eventually see a repeat of what happened with the Lehman-linked products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now turn to my second broad point, which is much shorter. &nbsp;Quite apart from having the correct regulations in place, the regulator must also be willing and able to vigorously enforce these regulations.&nbsp; Businesses being what they are, the language that they understand best is the language of money, and surely the MAS has to speak the same language to make sure that the regulations are complied with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1120<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that the investigations by MAS are still ongoing, I will leave it at that. &nbsp;I will only add that this episode has resulted in widespread cynicism amongst the investing public about the MAS' willingness to enforce the law vigorously, to stand up to the FIs and to protect investors.&nbsp; Rightly or wrongly, the fact remains that this is a widely held view. This cannot be a healthy state of affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is by now very clear that there has been at least some mis-selling by FIs. I therefore urge the MAS to take strong enforcement action in this regard, to demonstrate that breaches of the law will be punished in accordance with the law.&nbsp; This is the only way to restore public confidence in the regulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not the first time that investors who only wanted to renew their fixed deposits were misled into purchasing investment products that were unsuitable&nbsp;for them. &nbsp;Almost a decade ago, unit trusts were the investment product <I>du jour</I>.&nbsp; Stories abounded of uncles and aunties who wanted to renew their fixed deposits being pressured into buying unit trusts, including narrowly focused, high risk technology funds.&nbsp; With the stock markets then in the frenzied throes of the dot-com craze, technology funds looked like the best things since sliced bread.&nbsp; Well, when the dot-com&nbsp;bombed, these uncles and aunties lost huge chunks of their investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that sound familiar?&nbsp; Of course, it does. We had a rule-based approach then, and we have a rule-based approach now.&nbsp; And if we keep our rule-based approach without augmenting it with principle-based regulations, we will hear the same story 10,&nbsp;20 years in the future.&nbsp; I assure Members that so long as we rely exclusively on a form-filling, tick-the-boxes, rule-based approach to regulating the sale process, this will happen again, and again, and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1121<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have more cases like that of Mr Ling Jun Zhi and his wife, retirees who put their life savings of $100,000 into Minibonds.&nbsp; Or Mr Ang, a 68-year old retiree who put $600,000 of life savings in DBS High Notes 5, when he had merely wanted to renew his fixed deposit.&nbsp; Or Mrs Chong, who invested a total of $100,000 in Minibonds, being her life savings and half of her husband's CPF savings. She subsequently suffered a nervous breakdown upon finding out what the collapse of Lehman Brothers meant for her.&nbsp; Worse, her relationship with her husband was adversely affected.&nbsp; When asked what her plans for the future were, she said, \"What is there left to plan? There's nothing left for me to plan anymore?&nbsp; Or Ruth, a 38-year-old lady diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, who had invested the $20,000 meant for her parents in Minibonds.&nbsp; The FI knew about her medical condition, and still went ahead to sell the Minibonds to her.&nbsp; Because of the loss of this sum, she had to go back to work early against her doctor's wishes, instead of recuperating and recovering from her chemotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope all of these victims have been offered&nbsp;full compensation.&nbsp; These are the most clearly heart wrenching cases.&nbsp; But there are many other victims, whose situations may not be quite as dramatic, but whose lives have similarly been adversely affected beyond their worst nightmares.&nbsp; If MAS provides all the necessary information and facts and figures, we can calculate the financial cost to investors of this whole debacle.&nbsp; But what about the human cost?&nbsp; How do we quantify that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do not adopt more principle-based regulations, if MAS does not take vigorous enforcement action against those who have breached the law, such egregious mis-selling will occur again.&nbsp; The precise form of mis-selling will change, and the investment products involved will differ. But it will happen.<p align=left>Column: 1122<p> And by not learning our lesson from this episode, we will be guilty of having allowed it to happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment Bill, currently before this House, does not address these issues.&nbsp; I hope that when the findings and recommendations of the MAS come to be debated in this House, those recommendations will include the introduction of principle-based regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the two MPs for their comments on the Bill.&nbsp; Let me address the points raised.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh was concerned about the investigative powers of MAS.&nbsp; Let me assure him that under section 70A(6), it is intended to deal with those situations where somebody comes across a report which is a secret report,&nbsp;he ought to surrender the report back to MAS.&nbsp; The onus is on him to do so unless, of course, he has the desire to keep the report, then he is liable.&nbsp; If he is not and he has taken efforts to surrender or destroy the copies of the report, then I think that is the way for him to justify his action.&nbsp; So this provision is similar to what is available in the Banking Act.&nbsp; It is to ensure that if a secret report&nbsp;is&nbsp;passed to you by somebody,&nbsp;you should hand it back to the relevant authorities and not keep&nbsp;or propagate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue is on how to preserve confidentiality, and I think this is very important because confidence and confidentiality is at the heart of financial services.&nbsp; And here the intention is that when there is a report and there is an obligation of confidentiality,&nbsp;the report should not be disclosed.&nbsp; But if the investigated person wants to seek legal or other financial consultants' advice, then, of course MAS could grant him permission to show those reports to his advisers.&nbsp; So I think there are enough safeguards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1123<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to thank Mr Siew Kum Hong for his very comprehensive speech about the value of&nbsp; rules-based versus&nbsp;principle-based regulation.&nbsp; As we all know in the real world, in the practical world, it is neither of the ends of the spectrum.&nbsp; We need certain principles to set the framework and then, of course, we need rules or guidelines to be able to make sure that these principles are adhered to.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I believe the way the MAS dealt with the Lehman Brothers' bonds shows how this is done.&nbsp; To the credit of the financial institutions, they put to practice what they believe in and that is the principle of fair dealing and I think the outcome shows that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also thank Mr Siew for his suggestions on how to improve the regime.&nbsp; Some of the ideas that he put out is what I have also explained as the kind of measures that MAS is considering and is putting&nbsp;out for public consultation in March, and that is, to&nbsp;consider whether there ought to be a cooling-off period, to look at the incentive structure of the sales process, to separate the financial advisers' processes versus the deposit taking processes in the banks.&nbsp; So these are the same kind of the measures that we are thinking about.&nbsp; And, of course, I have also mentioned&nbsp;during Question Time&nbsp;that MAS is completing its investigation report and is currently in the process of giving the FIs&nbsp;a chance to respond to the report.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;let us&nbsp;not jump the gun.&nbsp; When the investigation is completed, I am sure we will have another chance to debate the proposed amendments to our regulatory regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Senior Minister, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill seeks to incorporate into the Insurance Act&nbsp;a framework for nomination of beneficiaries in respect of insurance policy proceeds.&nbsp; This framework will give policy owners clear, simple and economical means to decide on how the proceeds from their insurance policies should be disbursed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also aims to clarify the insurable interest requirement relating to life insurance policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Insurance Act does not contain provisions for the nomination of beneficiaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case law suggests that when a policy owner names his spouse and/or children as beneficiaries of an insurance policy effected on his own life, section 73 of the Conveyancing and the Law of Property Act (or the CLPA) will automatically create a statutory trust in favour of the <p align=left>Column: 1125<p>beneficiaries.&nbsp; The creation of such a trust implies that the policy owner will irrevocably lose all rights and control over the insurance policy concerned, including payouts made when he is alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if the policy owner nominates someone other than his spouse and/or children, no nomination will be recognised under section 73 of the CLPA.&nbsp; Since there is presently no provision for nomination of other types of beneficiaries in the Insurance Act, the status of such nominations is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, there have been concerns over the apparent ambiguity and inflexibility in the application of section 73 of the CLPA to insurance policies. For this reason, the Insurance Act will be amended to introduce a framework for nomination of beneficiaries in respect of insurance policy proceeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing this Bill, MAS has consulted the industry and the public on the policy positions as well as on the draft Bill.&nbsp; Inputs received were carefully considered and have been incorporated into the Bill where relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the key features of the nomination framework for insurance policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Nomination of beneficiaries framework</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the nomination framework, insurance policy owners will be able to choose whether or not to make nominations.&nbsp; If they choose to nominate, they then have the option of making either a revocable or an irrevocable or trust nomination.&nbsp; Nominations may be made at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n <I>Revocable nominations</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a revocable nomination, the policy owner will be able to unilaterally change his nomination at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 1126<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any payout from the insurance policy made while the policy owner is alive will be paid to him; payouts will only be made to the beneficiaries upon the policy owner's death.&nbsp; Hence, should the insurance policy pay out benefits in the event of the policy owner's illness or disability, he will be able to use these monies to meet his financial needs.&nbsp; For minor beneficiaries, a parent or guardian who is not also the policy owner can give discharge for payments received from insurers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any legal entity may be nominated in a revocable nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Irrevocable (trust) nominations</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An irrevocable nomination will create a statutory trust in favour of the beneficiaries, similar to the regime under section 73 of the CLPA.&nbsp; Once a trust is created, the policy owner will lose all rights and control over the insurance policy concerned.&nbsp; In exchange, the statutory trust will protect the policy proceeds against claims from the policy owner's creditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An irrevocable nomination can only be changed with the consent of all beneficiaries or a trustee who is not also the policy owner.&nbsp; Once an irrevocable nomination has been made, all payouts from the insurance policy, whether made during the policy owner's lifetime or after his death, will go to the beneficiaries.&nbsp; As with revocable nominations, a parent or guardian of a minor beneficiary who is not also the policy owner can give discharge for these payments.&nbsp; Such a parent or guardian can give consent on the minor's behalf for revocation of the nomination as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an irrevocable nomination is a serious undertaking which cannot be <p align=left>Column: 1127<p>unilaterally reversed, only the policy owner's spouse and/or children can be nominated as the beneficiaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy owners should only make irrevocable nominations if they are prepared to give away the insurance policy proceeds completely to the beneficiaries.&nbsp; They need to be aware that they will not be able to unilaterally change their nominations later on even if their family circumstances change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Scope of the nomination framework</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy owners may make nominations only in respect of (i) life policies and (ii) accident and health insurance policies that have death benefits.&nbsp; This is because only such policies have a savings and investment element for which nominations will be meaningful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nomination framework will not apply retrospectively.&nbsp; As such, insurance policies with existing nominations will continue to be subject to the laws in force at the time the nomination was made.&nbsp; For instance, policy owners will not be able to change or revoke existing nominations falling under section 73 of the CLPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<I>Insurance policies paid for with Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurance policies purchased under the CPF Investment Scheme and Dependants' Protection Scheme will be eligible only for revocable nominations.&nbsp; This is because an irrevocable nomination would cause the policy owner&nbsp;who is a CPF member to lose control over any insurance policy proceeds paid out during his lifetime, which would not be in line with CPF Board's policy that members must retain complete ownership of their retirement funds as long as they are alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><p align=left>Column: 1128<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annuities purchased under the Minimum Sum Scheme will be carved out from the nomination framework altogether to enable CPF Board to retain full control over the disbursement of proceeds from such policies.&nbsp; On the other hand, annuities purchased under the Minimum Sum Plus Scheme will be deemed no different from any other insurance policy as they are paid for with cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Insurable interest requirement</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the above amendments to introduce the nomination of beneficiaries framework, other substantive amendments to the Insurance Act relate to the insurable interest requirement for life insurance policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person is said to have an insurable interest in something when the occurrence of the insured event would cause that person to experience a loss, suffer a diminution of a right recognised by law or incurring a legal liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy owners of life insurance policies are required to have an insurable interest in the life assured (ie, the person being covered) under the policy.&nbsp; This is to minimise the risk of someone purchasing a life insurance policy on an unrelated person and then causing the latter's death in order to collect the insurance payout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the concept of insurable interest remains relevant, it is unnecessarily restrictive with regard to trust structures.&nbsp; As a trustee is deemed not to have an insurable interest in the settlor and the beneficiaries of a trust, the requirement of insurable interest prevents life insurance policies from being issued in respect of trusts.&nbsp; Individuals are therefore unable to include such policies in their trusts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, to facilitate the inclusion of such policies in trust structures, the Insurance Act will&nbsp; be amended to allow life insurance&nbsp; policies to be issued in respect of trusts where insurable interest <p align=left>Column: 1129<p>would have been recognised between two parties within the trust structure were it not for the existence of the trust.&nbsp; In other words, the law will allow a \"see through\" of the trust to determine whether the insurable interest requirement is satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the nomination of beneficiaries framework contained in this Bill will clarify the current uncertainty surrounding the disbursement of insurance policy proceeds.&nbsp; It will provide policy owners with a clear, simple and economical way to decide how their policy proceeds should be paid out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Business Registration Act provides the basic regulatory framework for unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships.&nbsp; The proposed amendments in the Bill will update the legislation and harmonise certain provisions of the Business Registration Act with the equivalent provisions in the Companies Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now go on to highlight the main amendments proposed in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Registration of professionals and professional firms</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 4 of the Business Registration Act to empower the Minister to make regulations to prescribe any person or class of persons to which the exemption under section 4(1)(g) will not apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, section 4(1)(g) exempts professionals and professional firms from registering under the Business Registration Act if they carry on business which under the provisions of law can be exercised only by those who possess certain qualifications prescribed by law.&nbsp; Examples of such professional businesses include law firms, doctors and architects.&nbsp; However, professional practices set up as corporations or limited liability partnerships are required to register with the <p align=left>Column: 1131<p>Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) under the Companies Act and Limited Liability Partnerships Act respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this amendment, professional practices that are registered as businesses (sole proprietorships or partnerships) will be required to register with the Registrar, if so prescribed by the Minister.&nbsp; This will facilitate a consistent treatment for professional practices across the various legislations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enforcement of injunctions granted under the Trade Marks Act</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the Companies Act was amended to allow the Registrar to direct a company to change its name if the use of the name has been restrained by an injunction granted under the Trade Marks Act.&nbsp; Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 13 of the Business Registration Act to allow the Registrar to do likewise for business names, bringing the Business Registration Act in line with the Companies Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now go on to the other amendments.&nbsp; Clause 6 repeals and re-enacts section 29 of the Business Registration Act such that the sum to be collected for compoundable offences will not exceed half of the amount of the maximum fine that is prescribed for the offence, or $5,000, whichever is the lower.&nbsp; This is to align the section with the equivalent provisions for the composition of offences in the Limited Liability Partnerships Act and the new Limited Partnerships Act.&nbsp; The rest of the amendments are of a technical nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, these amendments will bring the Business Registration Act in line with other existing legislation, such as the Companies Act.&nbsp; This is consistent with our policy to provide a more efficient <p align=left>Column: 1132<p>means of registering businesses and a more conducive regulatory environment for businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mrs Lim Hwee Hua].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.51 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore intends to accede to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment.&nbsp; The two Treaties are commonly referred to as the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol establish an international <p align=left>Column: 1133<p>legal regime to facilitate aircraft-asset leasing and financing.&nbsp; They aim to overcome the problem of obtaining secure and readily enforceable rights in aircraft and aircraft equipment or what are collectively known as aircraft objects.&nbsp; Such aircraft objects are items of high-value, yet are mobile and without any fixed location.&nbsp; By establishing a harmonised, transparent and efficient legal framework governing such transactions, they create greater certainty amongst intending financiers as to the efficacy of their rights.&nbsp; This helps to lower the risks and, therefore, costs of lending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me highlight the key features of the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, they provide for the creation of an international interest in aircraft objects which is recognised in all Contracting States.&nbsp; This facilitates the securing and enforcing of rights in aircraft objects in the Contracting States which now share a common legal framework in this respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a set of rules are laid down to govern speedy relief pending final determination of a creditor's claim, and the priority of competing interests and assignments of such interests in aircraft objects.&nbsp; At the same time, there are safeguards for debtors to ensure that remedies are exercised in a commercially reasonable manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, an electronic International Registry is established for the registration of international interests which gives public notice of such an interest to third parties and protects the priority of the holder of that interest in insolvency proceedings against the debtor.&nbsp; Interested parties may now search and obtain information on who has security interests in such aircraft objects.&nbsp; Importantly, the creditor with a duly registered interest is now able to preserve <p align=left>Column: 1134<p>his priority against subsequently registered interests or unregistered interests as well as&nbsp;the debtor's insolvency administrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in effect, such a legal regime gives intending creditors greater confidence in their decision to grant credit on highly mobile capital-intensive assets.&nbsp; It enhances the credit rating of equipment receivables and reduces borrowing costs to the advantage of all interested parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's accession to the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol would facilitate the financing of aircraft objects here by providing greater legal predictability and assurance of lower risk.&nbsp; These would&nbsp;directly translate into lower lending costs and better lending terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the current downturn, in the longer term, we would benefit from opening the local aircraft financing and leasing industry to a growing global market in other Contracting States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol are flexible in allowing variation in some of their provisions which Contracting States must decide upon and choose by making the necessary Declarations when acceding to the Treaties.&nbsp; I would like to elaborate on the key provisions which Singapore intends to vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol set out an array of remedies available to the creditor when a debtor defaults or in the event of debtor insolvency.&nbsp; We intend to choose to dispense with the requirement for the creditor to seek leave of court when exercising such remedies.&nbsp; This manner of 'self-help' will give financiers the maximum degree of assurance of their ability to recover possession of an aircraft object following a debtor default or upon the commencement of insolvency proceedings on the debtor.&nbsp; But there will be <p align=left>Column: 1135<p>safeguards in the form of specific procedures which the creditor will be required to follow in order to prevent abuse of such an arrangement.&nbsp; These are spelt out in the relevant sections of the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol, and will be further expanded in subsidiary legislation to this Bill in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, under the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol, we will declare that non-consensual rights or interests will have priority over any registered international rights.&nbsp; Essentially, we want a right or an interest in an aircraft object that is recognised and enforceable under Singapore laws to have priority over a registered international interest in that same aircraft object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to give effect in Singapore to the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol.&nbsp; Apart from providing for the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol to have the force of law in Singapore and for the making of regulations as are necessary or expedient, the Bill makes certain consequential amendments to the Bills of Sale Act (Cap. 24) and the Companies Act (Cap. 50) to align all three legislations on the governance of aircraft object leasing and financing, so as to avoid any conflict between the unique provisions of the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol and those of existing laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed&nbsp;to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is because such sums are traditionally put aside by deceased persons, when alive, to eventually benefit their family. Hence, to leave them out of the computation would under-compensate the dependants.&nbsp; The current method of assessment, which is based largely on the annual or monthly sum given to the dependants, is inadequate where there is divergence between what the deceased actually gave and what he could afford to give, or where the deceased preferred to reinvest the moneys instead of disbursing them to his dependants. This amendment will bring us in line with the approach taken in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, USA and Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the definition of \"dependant\" will be extended to cover a \"former wife\".&nbsp; This will enable ex-wives who have been supported by the deceased prior to his death pursuant to maintenance orders to file dependency claims when their ex-husbands die.&nbsp; Indeed, these ex-wives may still be dependent on the deceased at least for some time after the marriage has ended.&nbsp; Such a right for ex-wives is also found in the laws of UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><I>Refining our approach to bereavement damages</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, section 21(4) of the Civil Law Act under the heading of&nbsp; \"Bereavement\" currently provides that the court may order defendants in fatal accident claims to pay $10,000 in damages for bereavement.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> I thank Ms Sylvia Lim for supporting the Bill,<p align=left>Column: 1142<p> including the increase of the bereavement claims from $10,000 to&nbsp;$15,000.&nbsp; As I said in my speech, it can be further amended, if necessary, in the future, by Ministerial Order.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to monitor and see whether this&nbsp;sum will remain appropriate over time.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the main thrust of her speech&nbsp;really is to argue, once again, for the lowering of the age of voting to 18.&nbsp; This, as she has said, is not a new issue for, indeed, Prof. Jayakumar had explained in the House in the COS debate in 2007,&nbsp;almost two years now,&nbsp;as to why, in Singapore, we should keep the age of voting as 18.&nbsp; And, indeed, we also have issued replies in the media on this point.&nbsp; Firstly, in Singapore, the approach we take is not to have a single threshold age of majority for all purposes.&nbsp; Different ages are stipulated for different activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a person can be charged as an adult when he turns 16.&nbsp; Before that, he is a juvenile in the eyes of the criminal law.&nbsp; Then a person needs to be at least 18 years before he can drive or buy an alcoholic drink or cigarettes.&nbsp; On the other hand, he must be 21 years before he can marry without parental approval, donate a body organ, make an Advance Medical Directive, or a will, or qualify as a member of some professionals such as being a lawyer, public accountant or engineer.&nbsp; In short, there is no single threshold for all these activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the&nbsp;approach that our laws take is a gradual increase in rights and responsibilities leading up to the age of 21,&nbsp;at which stage nearly all the limitations link to age are removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, a person may generally adopt a child only when he is 25 years old.&nbsp; So, in that sense, there is taking into account the age, and linking the age to the question of maturity of a person before the law says he can do something.&nbsp; This approach, as Prof. Jayakumar had explained in this House, is a pragmatic and,indeed, a <p align=left>Column: 1143<p>sensible one as each activity calls for different considerations,&nbsp;and its significance and impact vary.&nbsp; This approach has worked well for us, and there is no compelling need to change it.&nbsp; Indeed, the common law&nbsp;age of&nbsp;majority, which is pegged&nbsp;at 21 years, continues to apply to activities that involve significant personal responsibility such as the ones listed earlier, and voting is one such activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House well knows&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I am sure Ms Lim well knows this too&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;we take elections in Singapore very seriously.&nbsp; Hence, unlike many other countries, we make it compulsory.&nbsp; Typically at 21 years, a person would be either&nbsp;working or pursuing tertiary studies.&nbsp; He would be in a better position at that age than at age 18 years to assess the quality of a candidate and&nbsp;his promises as well as form considered views on the national issues at stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;As voting is a very important matter that involves choice and choice that only an individual can make personally,&nbsp;there is a need for a voter to have the necessary maturity to decide for himself or herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has worked for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it is because we take this differentiated and pragmatic approach of assessing what is the appropriate age for each activity without necessarily linking it with the other restricted activities that the Government can now review and assess the age of contractual capacity objectively.&nbsp; What should be the appropriate age for this particular activity?&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my Second Reading speech, having considered this issue carefully, having taken into account feedback on the ground, and also&nbsp;the number of young people, who are under 21 now, who approach ACRA asking whether they can do business,&nbsp;we have decided that we should de-link the age of majority and lower it to 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1144<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Madam, this gradual process of progressively increasing rights and responsibilities of an individual up to the age of 21 as the age of majority when nearly all restrictions are removed has worked well for us, and we should keep it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As a result, creditors receive a smaller dividend payout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a debtor facing a bankruptcy application can avoid bankruptcy by entering into a voluntary arrangement&nbsp;(VA) with his creditors.&nbsp; This arrangement is, however, court-based, requiring the debtor to obtain the Court's sanction at various stages of his proposal, as well as the support of creditors holding at least 75%&nbsp;in value of the debts.&nbsp; Hence, whilst the VA&nbsp;may be useful to debtors who manage businesses&nbsp;or who have large debts and&nbsp;whose proposals may not be so straightforward, it is cumbersome and costly for debtors who are wage earners with smaller debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a debtor has a regular income and his debts are not large, a better alternative would be to have a non court-based approach that gives him a reasonable opportunity to pay off all or some of his debts through a repayment plan over a period of time.&nbsp; By avoiding bankruptcy through this debtor-driven scheme, the intention is that the debtor will keep his job and apportion part of his monthly income towards&nbsp;repaying his debts.&nbsp; The aim is that creditors will receive no less than what they would have otherwise received, had the debtor gone into bankruptcy.&nbsp; The benefit for the debtor is that if he successfully meets his financial obligations under the repayment plan, he will avoid the stigma and <p align=left>Column: 1146<p>restrictions of bankruptcy.&nbsp; But the point is he has to do his part; eg, adjust his lifestyle or spending habits so that repayments are made.&nbsp; Hence, these amendments to the Bankruptcy Act to introduce the Debt Repayment Scheme&nbsp;(DRS).&nbsp; They take into consideration the feedback we had received from a public consultation on an earlier version of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, as the DRS is intended to be a pre-bankruptcy scheme, we propose to insert its provisions under a new Part VA of the Bankruptcy Act.&nbsp; Let me now take the House through the salient features of this new Part VA inserted by clause 8 of the Bill and&nbsp;I will refer to the other key amendments of the Bill where relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Salient features of the Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Division 1 &ndash; Preliminary<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division 1 of the new Part VA defines the various expressions used in the DRS.&nbsp; Specifically, under the scheme, all unsecured and liquidated liabilities would be taken into account in determining a debtor's debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Division 2 &ndash; Proposal for DRS&nbsp;<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division 2 covers how a debtor is considered for the DRS and a debt repayment proposal formed and approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the High Court can make a bankruptcy order against a debtor if the total unsecured debt under a bankruptcy application, whether filed by the creditors, either singly or jointly, or by the debtor through a self-petition, exceeds $10,000. So, I would like to make&nbsp;a point of clarification here which is that a debtor who owes several creditors in total more than $10,000 can be made a bankrupt even though the debt owed to each creditor is less than $10,000.&nbsp; Under the DRS, if the debtor meets certain criteria, the Court will adjourn the bankruptcy <p align=left>Column: 1147<p>application for up to&nbsp;six months, and refer the matter to the Official Assignee (OA).<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria to be eligible for the DRS are as follows. First, the debtor's unsecured debts, whether the bankruptcy application is filed by a single creditor or by several creditors or by himself, total $100,000 or less. &nbsp;In setting this limit, we sought to balance the objective of helping a sincere wage-earning debtor meet his financial obligations&nbsp;&ndash; bearing in mind his ability to make payments pursuant to the DRS&nbsp;&ndash; and the need to ensure that his creditors are treated fairly for their forbearance in obtaining a bankruptcy order against the debtor.&nbsp; And our assessment is that $100,000 would be an appropriate amount for an average wage earner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, of the current stock of bankrupts, about 42% of them had debt liabilities of $100,000 or less when they were made bankrupt.&nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;five years, the average number of bankrupts per year was about 3,200.&nbsp; Hence, based on this first criterion alone, ie, $100,000 or less,&nbsp;about 1,300 debtors would be eligible to be considered for the DRS every year.&nbsp; But, of course, some will be eliminated from consideration as they would not be employed because they need to be a wage-earner or if the debt had been&nbsp;incurred arising from business-related debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in the preceding&nbsp;five years, the debtor must not have been a bankrupt, or on a VA or the DRS.&nbsp; This is because the DRS is designed to help wage-earners who have genuinely fallen into financial difficulty.&nbsp; It is not intended to be a scheme that debtors can use repeatedly to avoid repaying their debts in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the debtor, at the point of the bankruptcy application, was not a sole <p align=left>Column: 1148<p>proprietor or a partner in a business partnership.&nbsp; Sole proprietors and partners are excluded as they are unlikely to be assured of a regular income stream to see through a debt repayment plan under the DRS.&nbsp; These debtors are also likely to require new credit in the course of their business.&nbsp; These recurring debts would cause the total debts to exceed the proposed $100,000 limit and make it difficult to apportion a fixed amount towards regular debt repayment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 56B empowers the OA to review the suitability of a debtor for a DRS based on the factors above.&nbsp; If the debtor qualifies, the OA will administer and supervise his affairs through an administrator from the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office&nbsp;(IPTO). Section 56C requires the creditors to file their proofs of debt and the debtor to file a Statement of Affairs and a debt repayment plan not exceeding&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; In deciding on the maximum length of repayment period, we sought to ensure that the time required for the debtor to obtain a fresh start was balanced against the time needed for creditors to recover some, if not all, the debts owed to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 56D empowers the OA to examine the debt repayment plan proposed by the debtor and to make the appropriate modifications to ensure that the interests of the creditors are not prejudiced. The OA will then call for a meeting of creditors, which the debtor must attend, for them to provide any input or information to the Administrator.&nbsp; The OA will consider this input in deciding whether to approve the plan as it is or after further modifications.&nbsp; If the debtor or any creditor thinks that the approved plan unfairly prejudices his interests, he may appeal to an Appeal Panel.&nbsp; The Appeal Panel will either confirm the OA's approval of the plan or make appropriate modifications to it and its decision will be final.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><p align=left>Column: 1149<p>\r\n<I>Division 3 &ndash;&nbsp;Commencement &amp; Administration of the DRS</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a DRS commences, section 56F prevents creditors from commencing or proceeding with any action against the debtor for any outstanding debt provable under the scheme except with the leave of the Court.&nbsp; The OA will distribute the debtor's repayments to the creditors on a <I>pari passu</I> basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 56H allows the OA to modify an approved plan if there is a material change in the financial situation of a debtor; eg, when a debtor becomes the beneficiary of a large inheritance, which changes his debt repayment capability, if more debts are proven after the DRS commences or if the debtor changes job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most of these modifications, the repayment period for the modified plan cannot exceed&nbsp;five years. However, in&nbsp;two situations when specific new debts are proven amounting to less than $50,000, the repayment period may be extended by up to another&nbsp;two years, that is to say, up to&nbsp;seven from five years. &nbsp;The first involves claims for a shortfall after a secured creditor realises a security.&nbsp; For example, the debtor may default on his monthly repayment for a housing loan which has his house as collateral.&nbsp; The lender may decide to sell the house, and file a claim for any resultant shortfall.&nbsp; The second situation involves contingent and unliquidated liabilities that crystallise after the DRS effective date.&nbsp; For example, the debtor may be the guarantor for a friend's loan contract signed before the DRS' effective date.&nbsp; If his friend defaults on the loan, the DRS debtor then becomes liable for the value of the loan under the terms of the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Division 4 &ndash; Cessation of the DRS</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the debtor completes the repayment plan, section 56N empowers the OA to issue him a certificate of completion.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1150<p>When this happens, the debtor will be released from all his debts&nbsp;which are proved under the DRS, which thereafter ceases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are a few scenarios where the DRS would be considered to have ceased but with the debtor not deemed to have completed the scheme, remaining liable for debts under it.&nbsp; I have described the first scenario above where specific new debts more than $50,000, surface in the two situations highlighted.&nbsp; The debtor is then issued a certificate of inapplicability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second scenario is where the debtor does not abide by the terms of the repayment plan or fails to fulfill his duties under it. Section 56M then empowers the OA to issue the debtor a certificate of failure.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third scenario is when the debtor completes the DRS, but it is subsequently discovered that the debtor had failed to disclose all his property, had not informed the OA of the disposal of his property, or had obtained the approval or modification of his debt repayment plan by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of material facts.&nbsp; Section 56O then empowers the OA to revoke the certificate of completion that had been issued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the OA issues a certificate of inapplicability or a certificate of failure, or revokes a certificate of completion, a debtor will be presumed to be unable to pay off his debts.&nbsp; Any creditor who has proved his debt under the scheme may then rely on this presumption to commence bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor in respect of that debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary,&nbsp;the Debt Repayment Scheme seeks a \"win-win\" outcome for both a debtor and his creditors.&nbsp; On one hand, the creditors are likely to receive at least the same amount if not more than what they would receive had the debtor <p align=left>Column: 1151<p>gone into bankruptcy.&nbsp; On the other hand, the debtor will get an opportunity to remain in employment. &nbsp;In addition, if he dutifully meets his financial obligations under the repayment plan, he will be able to avoid the stigma of bankruptcy and have a fresh start.&nbsp; In addition, the DRS will imbue in debtors the responsibility and discipline needed to avoid future financial embarrassment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I beg to move.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The present Bankruptcy Act was enacted in 1995, repealing the earlier Act, to improve the administration of the affairs of bankrupts and to protect creditors' interests without stifling entrepreneurship.&nbsp; I am happy to note that this Bill will introduce a debt repayment scheme to allow wage-earning debtors with unsecured debts of less than $100,000 to avoid bankruptcy by repaying his/her debts in accordance with a debt repayment plan.&nbsp; I laud this pro-active approach as it will not only help wage earners with smaller debts to avoid the social stigma and restrictions that follow bankruptcy but also help small and medium enterprises to continue to survive in the current economic crisis.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I support the introduction of the Bill, I wish to highlight another area of the law and related policy which I hope the Minister would review and re-examine as it is encountered by many undischarged bankrupts.&nbsp; There was a <I>Straits Times</I> article not too long ago that had highlighted this problem of bankrupts leaving&nbsp;Singapore without the requisite approvals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1152<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This problem appears to be quite widespread amongst the bankrupts in Singapore.&nbsp; I have personally encountered some such cases at my Meet-the-People sessions.&nbsp; Many bankrupts have complained to me on the highly onerous and often cumbersome rigmarole which the Official Assignee imposes on them before they can embark on any travel outside of Singapore (including Malaysia).&nbsp; Inevitably, these bankrupts have found it very hard to find jobs in Singapore due to the stigma of bankruptcy.&nbsp; They therefore extend their search overseas and more often than not, those with experience and skills are most sought after.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the jobs often require them to work outside Singapore and to travel as well.&nbsp; Prior permission from the Official Assignee is needed before the offer could be accepted but often times the approval is not&nbsp;granted or granted in time, before the offer lapsed.&nbsp; I humbly ask the Minister to seriously consider the plight of these bankrupts who genuinely want to leave Singapore to embark on decent work to make a living and to repay their debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is particularly true of those who were sole breadwinners in their family prior to their bankruptcy and&nbsp;could have fallen into the bankruptcy trap because they had guaranteed loans or stood as sureties for their spouses, loved ones or friends, and could not meet the repayment obligations.&nbsp; Let me relate a true case encountered at a MPS before I became an elected MP.&nbsp; A wife stood as guarantor for her husband's bank loans.&nbsp; When his business failed, both were made bankrupts.&nbsp; The husband disappeared and she was left to support&nbsp;five schooling children alone.&nbsp; She took on several odd jobs.&nbsp; Once, she was offered a well-paid job by an employer from a third world country that needed her to travel every now and then.&nbsp; She applied for approval to travel but did not always get the duration that she needed.&nbsp; In one of these applications, she misread and misunderstood the period approved and committed <p align=left>Column: 1153<p>about 33 technical offences of travelling without approval.&nbsp; After representations made on her behalf, the prosecution proceeded with a few of the charges.&nbsp; She was jailed for&nbsp;three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that rules be eased to allow genuinely motivated bankrupts greater latitude because if they continue not to be able to support their families, they would eventually break down and suffer mental distress or depression.&nbsp; The whole family suffers along with them.&nbsp; Besides society, their own family members including their children also look down on them as they blame them for the loss of comfort and lifestyle.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very common reason offered by these bankrupts for travelling without prior permission was that they had encountered so much delay, uncertainty and red tapes, including being looked down or humiliated by the Official Assignee's staff processing their application.&nbsp; Hence, rather than wring their hands in despair waiting for rejection and end up even poorer and with no prospect of having their bills paid, they might as well take the risk of being caught later and seize the opportunity extended to them, so that they can earn the money, support their families and, hopefully, have some money to discharge themselves from bankruptcy.<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the high-tech that our Government is equipped with, I suggest that the Official Assignee allow such approvals to leave jurisdiction to be obtained online and approvals granted could be contemporaneously or simultaneously routed to or updated with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).&nbsp; If both the Official Assignee's computer system and the ICA's database system can be synchronised (just like&nbsp;OSCAR for update of NRICs and Police Gazette for screening of criminals), bankrupts can then be <p align=left>Column: 1154<p>prevented from leaving Singapore at the very first instance.&nbsp; This will avoid the embarrassing situation of arrest and the full brunt of the law being brought to bear upon their return.&nbsp; Currently, by allowing them out of Singapore's checkpoints, the impression that these bankrupts have is that they are allowed to travel as they are not stopped when they attempted to leave the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, the Official Assignee should be more transparent by giving clear reasons for rejection of overseas travel, so that whatever conditions that may be lacking could be addressed and satisfied.&nbsp; This would be more productive in today's competitive world.&nbsp; We should make the best use of our manpower and not let these undischarged bankrupts -&nbsp;many of whom are able, educated, talented people -&nbsp;be demoralised, sink into depression and gradually disappear into oblivion.&nbsp; We should not be afraid of \"exporting\" them and letting them return to the corporate world to start all over again, as I believe the true entrepreneurs amongst them will surely make a comeback.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are living examples of individuals who have bounced back to being successful.&nbsp; One good example would be Mr Fong Kah Kuen who is currently the Chief Operating Officer of listed company Xpressprint Holdings who bounced back from near bankruptcy when he managed to get his debt restructured.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the bankruptcy laws against bankrupts who leave jurisdiction without permission from the Official Assignee attract punitive punishments.&nbsp; I am proposing that the authorities take a proactive stance so that would-be or potential offenders against this provision of the Bankruptcy Act do not commit the offence (especially for the genuine cases) through a simple way of enhancing the immigration exit and entry systems.&nbsp; This will avert time wastage and man hours expended in conducting investigations and prosecutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1155<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, I take cognisance of the creditor's predicament.&nbsp; As such, it is imperative for the Official Assignee to examine each application for leaving Singapore by bankrupts carefully, expeditiously and with sound judgement and reasoning, so that we can balance the interests of the debtor and&nbsp;the creditor, thereby serving societal interests as well.&nbsp; Where we encounter sincere and genuine bankrupts (based on their background, circumstances, current situation and the amount of debt owing), we should try to help them get back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Madam, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Madam, it makes sense to have a pre-bankruptcy scheme to allow someone in debt a last chance to clear his debts.&nbsp; By avoiding bankruptcy and its restrictions, the debtor can continue to be economically productive with a higher probability of clearing his debts.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I have two questions about the Bill.&nbsp; The first question relates to what kind of debtors can qualify for the Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS).&nbsp; The proposed section 65(7) has excluded sole proprietors and partners from the scheme.&nbsp; This means that those from smaller or unincorporated businesses who incurred business debt are not considered suitable.&nbsp; Madam, I think this exclusion will rule out cases of business people who are running their businesses responsibly but have met with some temporary liquidity problems.&nbsp; In the current economic climate especially, these problems could arise from difficulty in collecting payments from customers or clients, or failing to get credit due to credit tightening by lenders.&nbsp; If the scheme is meant to provide some support for those with temporary difficulties who have the potential to return to the black, surely we should consider such people for the DRS.&nbsp; In the Second Reading speech, the Senior <p align=left>Column: 1156<p>Minister of State mentioned that the scheme was restricted to wage earners with regular income.&nbsp; However, even if we were to include sole proprietors and partners in the scheme, each case will have to be assessed by the Official Assignee anyway and a viable plan discussed with creditors as well.&nbsp; If the plan is then deemed to have merits, why not?&nbsp; In any case, if the debtor defaults on the plan, all bets are off, and the bankruptcy proceedings can still be carried on.&nbsp; It seems to me that we may be defeating a real benefit of the scheme if we withhold it from our smaller businesses who are facing real pressures today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, my second question relates to the composition of the Appeal Panel.&nbsp; The proposed section 56Q refers to the Appeal Panel who can decide whether to overrule the Official Assignee's decisions on debt repayment plans.&nbsp; There was public concern raised during the consultation about who would be part of the Panel and whether they were independent.&nbsp; The Ministry's written response was that more details of the Panel would be given in the Bill, but all that the Bill states currently is that the Panel would be appointed by the Minister.&nbsp; Could the Senior Minister of State comment on this?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, I want to thank both Ms Ellen Lee and Ms Sylvia Lim for supporting the DRS scheme.&nbsp; They have certain concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Ms Lee, it&nbsp;is essentially on travel, and Ms Sylvia Lim raises two points, which I will address later.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the point about travel.&nbsp; Indeed, this is not a new issue.&nbsp; This is something that has been raised in this House before,&nbsp;particularly during&nbsp;COS, and each time we have given our replies and, indeed,&nbsp;gone back to the Official Assignee to ask him to see whether he <p align=left>Column: 1157<p>can further improve and fine-tune the system in light of the feedback that is received.&nbsp; But before I go into some of these improvements, I should say that, as in other countries, under our laws, bankrupts are required to obtain the prior approval of the Official Assignee (OA) before they can travel and it is for a good reason,&nbsp;a key reason of which is to enable him to effectively monitor the bankrupt's movements, so that he can properly administer the bankrupt's affairs for the benefit of his creditors.&nbsp; Such monitoring will prevent the bankrupt from hiding income earned or acquiring or disposing his assets overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ms Lee recognises, the OA seeks to strike a fair balance between the bankrupt's interest and those of his creditors.&nbsp; As much as there are bankrupts who complain that their requests to travel have been denied, there are also creditors who complain that some bankrupts travel too freely.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the bankrupts are aware of this requirement -&nbsp;whether bankrupts&nbsp;do in fact willy-nilly travel without knowing that they are breaching this requirement&nbsp;travel&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I think that is point that she has made&nbsp;&ndash; the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office (IPTO) has taken a number of measures to achieve this.&nbsp; This is one of the areas where improvements have been made over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the briefings which every bankrupt is required to attend, and this has been going on for some time, IPTO now also highlights these responsibilities and restrictions on its information materials and website.&nbsp; Also, starting from mid-2007, IPTO has been writing to persons facing bankruptcy proceedings, ie, even before they are adjudged&nbsp;bankrupts, to inform them of the responsibilities and restrictions should they subsequently be made bankrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, this is done at least two weeks before the making of the bankruptcy order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Ms Lee that bankrupts who genuinely want to travel overseas to <p align=left>Column: 1158<p>work should be given an opportunity to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, as she suggests, since 2002, IPTO has facilitated this process by providing bankrupts with an online travel application service on its website.&nbsp; Moreover, since June 2003, applicants who have been cooperative in the administration of the bankruptcy estates are granted immediate permission to travel upon the submission of the online application.&nbsp; Furthermore, the OA readily grants approval for compassionate reasons or when it is shown that such travel enables the bankrupt to earn income for the benefit of his creditors.&nbsp; The statistics bear this out because last year (2008), some 45,329 applications to travel were made.&nbsp; Of these, 14,541 were for the purposes of employment, and of these applications for travel for employment purposes, 91% were approved.&nbsp; Hence, the bankrupts who had complained to Ms Lee are really a minority.&nbsp; And the key reason why the rest were rejected was because the bankrupt had failed to provide sufficient documentary evidence of employment overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point that Ms Lee makes is on the perceived treatment of bankrupts by some IPTO officers in handling these applications.&nbsp; Now and then, we do receive feedback like this, sometimes at the MPS.&nbsp; First, I should say that I can empathise that bankrupts and IPTO officers are often in difficult conversations regarding travel rejections and other bankruptcy affairs.&nbsp; Bankrupts can face difficult and sometimes demanding questions which they may feel sensitive or even embarrassed about.&nbsp; However, bankrupts should be assured that IPTO officers have nothing against them personally.&nbsp; I think they must be professional in their approach.&nbsp; And the officers are aware of the need to handle such applications with civility and the right attitude.&nbsp; So this is an assurance I <p align=left>Column: 1159<p>can give Ms Lee in response to her feedback.&nbsp; Also, where applications to travel are turned down, IPTO does so for good reasons.&nbsp; If the bankrupt has been uncooperative in the administration of his estate in bankruptcy, eg, he has not been making regular contributions to his bankruptcy estate for the benefit of his creditors, his applications are likely not to be approved.&nbsp; I understand that bankrupts whose applications are rejected are informed of the reasons which will give them an opportunity to remedy the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On what Ms Lee says&nbsp;about punitive punishments imposed on bankrupts who travel without permission, the OA will press for prosecution only after a careful consideration of all the relevant circumstances.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a bankrupt, however, chooses to knowingly flaunt the law despite being given sufficient notice of the responsibilities and restrictions on travel, in view of the bankruptcy, then the OA will be required to take the necessary enforcement action against him to ensure that the laws underpinning our bankruptcy regime remain credible. And that is why several prosecutions were conducted against such&nbsp;egregious&nbsp;offenders late last year, which were highlighted&nbsp;in the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee suggests that measures be put in place to prevent all bankrupts from leaving Singapore in the first instance.&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think the current approach of placing the onus on the bankrupts to apply for approval, having of course informed them of this requirement&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;thus exercising personal responsibility on their part, and where IPTO's&nbsp;processes have been streamlined to expedite consideration of this request,&nbsp;coupled with prosecution of egregious offenders&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;is a better approach.&nbsp; We have about 26,000 bankrupts.&nbsp; It will not be practical or indeed necessary to tack them at the checkpoints to prevent them from leaving <p align=left>Column: 1160<p>Singapore. Indeed, that may slow down the processing of checkpoint clearance to the detriment of the many other travellers. What we have implemented is to screen bankrupts regularly for offences of unauthorised travel with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, in response to Ms Lee, it is important to bear in mind that the OA needs to balance the legitimate interests of creditors and the genuine needs of bankrupts in the administration of bankruptcies, including this area of travel.&nbsp; Where there are good reasons to support applications for travel, there is no reason why the OA will reject such applications.&nbsp; However, for our bankruptcy administration to remain credible, the laws in place need to be observed and enforced against those who breach them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lim supports the DRS but would like to see the DRS having a wider reach to include debtors, like people in a partnership or sole proprietorship who may be doing business. As I have explained in my speech, a key requirement of the DRS is that there should be a regular stream of income.&nbsp; Do not forget that here we must also consider the creditors' interest. The creditors are, in a sense, forbearing to sue because, indeed, a bankruptcy petition would have been made and then the court looking at all the criteria, if the criteria are satisfied, would send it to the Official Assignee to consider&nbsp;more carefully, get more information to see whether or not the DRS is the best route to take.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think&nbsp;we should have this balanced approach where the creditors would have some assurance that if they proceed with the DRS, they would get a regular income monthly over a certain period of time which may last over five years.&nbsp; As we know, if you are in business, it would be difficult to assure that.&nbsp; Even the most well-meaning of businessmen will have to face situations when their cashflow will be up or down, or they will have other <p align=left>Column: 1161<p>costs that they will have to meet&nbsp;in the course of doing their business. So it is better to keep it&nbsp;focused, targeted&nbsp;and directed at debtors who have a regular income.&nbsp; Indeed, this is one of the key objectives of the Debt Repayment Scheme, which is to keep a debtor or a potential bankrupt in a job. That is how I started my speech, because we know that once he loses&nbsp;the&nbsp;job, it is difficult for him to get back into one, once he has been declared&nbsp;a bankrupt.&nbsp; Indeed, like I have said in my speech, the potential reach of the DRS, even excluding this group, is already very wide, perhaps 800 or 1,000 to start with.&nbsp; I think we should let the OA do his job well in conjunction with these people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point&nbsp;she made is on the Appeal Panel.&nbsp; The Appeal Panel will be manned by outsiders who are experienced people, people in the marketplace who are experienced in the field, for example, insolvency practitioners or certified accountants.&nbsp; I think the OA also has plans to invite, for example, former Official Assignees who can come and man this Appeal Panel.

More recently, MOM together with our tripartite partners, launched the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) on 1st December 2008 to help companies cut costs and save jobs, as well as build up our workforce capabilities. SPUR provides enhanced course fee funding and absentee payroll, but these benefits are only for local workers, therefore making it worthwhile for employers to send their local workers for training during the downturn and save costs at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked about companies' compliance with our labour laws and work permit regulations. Companies employing foreign workers must comply with these laws regardless of the economic situation. If they employ foreign workers, they are expected to provide&nbsp;jobs for these workers. If employers have no or insufficient work and are no longer in a position to take care of their well being, they should repatriate the workers. Apart from acting on complaints from workers and the public, MOM also proactively inspects foreign workers' quarters to surface any cases of unacceptable housing, workers without&nbsp;having jobs&nbsp;or who have not been paid by their employers. Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) or Employment Act (EA), employers can be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed up to&nbsp;six months if they breach the work pass conditions, such as failing to provide acceptable housing for their foreign workers. In addition, the Ministry will also debar errant employers from employing foreign workers in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employment agencies are important intermediaries that play a useful role in the protection of foreign workers. Last year, the Ministry reviewed the employment agency <p align=left>Column: 1165<p>licensing regulations to prohibit EAs from offering incentive payments or rebates to employers as consideration or inducement for hiring foreign workers through them. This serves to prevent foreign workers from being exploited and being made to bear the cost of such incentive payments and rebates in order to secure employment in Singapore. Employment agencies that are found to have breached licence regulations are liable to have their licence revoked and their security deposit of $20,000 forfeited.&nbsp; We have also been working with foreign embassies here with regard to errant agents in the source countries.&nbsp; MOM will continue to review the employment agencies' industry, and will be engaging industry members on ways to better protect foreign workers.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1165<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:INTAKE OF FOREIGN WORKERS-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>INTAKE OF FOREIGN WORKERS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Reduction-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Reduction)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Fatimah Lateef </B>asked the Acting Minister for Manpower in light of the economic recession and foreign workers not having proper jobs and accommodation (a) whether there are plans to reduce the intake of foreign workers and the number of work permits to be issued; and (b) whether the reduction will be a possible consideration for the next one to two years with a plan to pick up again gradually during recovery and upturn in the economic climate.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#65279; <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562\" name=\"GENERATOR\"> <LINK title=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" href=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \r\n\r\nWith the economic downturn, the inflow of foreign workers will also slow down.&nbsp; However, even in a slow down, our economy still needs foreign workers.&nbsp; Many of them take on jobs that Singaporeans may not want to do or are unable to fill, like in Construction and Marine.

This Act ensures that commercial operators who provide public entertainment are responsible for and have in place measures to safeguard public safety and prevent indecent, offensive or improper activities from taking place on their premises. In February 2008, the Licensing Officer issued a licence to the Singapore Flyer to operate.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from obtaining a Fire Safety Certificate from the Singapore Civil Defence Force and a Temporary Occupation Permit from the Building and Construction Authority, the Licensing Officer also required that the Singapore Flyer be certified to have met relevant technical and safety standards. Certification of safety for public use is done by a Conformity Assessment Body, or CAB for short, composed of foreign technical experts recommended by SPRING Singapore, as there is no such technical expertise in Singapore. This approach is to ensure that an independent and objective body provides sound assessment on safety standards that the Singapore Flyer has implemented. This is similar <p align=left>Column: 1169<p>to the regulatory regimes in Germany and the UK where CABs and third party assessment bodies are also used to certify the safety of amusement rides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAB based its assessment on a safety standard known as the EN13814 Standard which is widely used in Europe. CAB's technical experts are from the company TUV-SUD, an established German company which is a leading global provider of technical services. The safety standard covers the workmanship of the essential steel and machine components of the Singapore Flyer, and the operational safety performance of the Flyer, such as the adequacy of the locking device on the cabin doors, normal and emergency operations, and braking mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua asked why a manual cranking device was not required to be installed on the Singapore Flyer. As we understand from the management of the Singapore Flyer, such a manual system was not made part of its design given the size of the wheel. The Singapore Flyer is the largest of its kind in the world today and its design was approved in accordance with international standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a contingency, the Flyer put in place a back-up system to operate the wheel in an emergency. The back-up system kicked in and enabled the wheel to resume operation on three previous occasions namely on 4th December, 11th July and 18th June 2008, when the Flyer stopped for an hour on each occasion. However, if everything fails, the Flyer management has contracted a professional body to conduct a physical passenger evacuation protocol. This was tested and exercised by the Flyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the incident on 23rd December 2008, a fire broke out at about 4.50 pm in the Flyer's control room. The fire caused extensive damage to the equipment in the room. This caused the Flyer to stop. Its back-up system also failed as its equipment was also damaged by the fire. This is a scenario that the Flyer management and engineers had not anticipated before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Flyer management then activated its emergency protocol which involves bringing in the Flyer's vendor engineers and putting the vendor rescue team on standby. The first priority is to resolve the problem technically so that the Flyer can re-start to allow passengers to evacuate in the usual way. In this instance, the vendor engineers tried to re-start operations but failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Flyer informed the Police of the Flyer's stoppage at about 5.08 pm. When the Flyer management failed to resolve the technical problem, the management contacted the SCDF and Police for assistance. This was at about 7.25 pm. Police arrived at 7.44 pm while SCDF representatives arrived at the Singapore Flyer at about 7.54 pm. On arrival, the SCDF officers observed that the Flyer management had already activated their evacuation protocol to winch passengers down from the capsules located lowest to the ground level. Two passengers had already been evacuated in this manner. Removal of another batch was ongoing. The SCDF officers then went on stand-by to provide rescue assistance and prepared to take command of the operations. After the second batch of passengers was evacuated, the Flyer's engineers managed to re-start the wheel. The engineers had created an ad hoc by-pass to the control system and managed to re-start three of the six motors of the wheel. This was something the engineers had not tried before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1171<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police and SCDF have completed their investigations into the cause of the incident. We have found no evidence to suggest foul play. The cause of the fire was accidental and due to an electrical malfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Flyer has said that it will develop two new independent backup systems which would be located in a completely separate location from the existing control system and which will further strengthen the wheel's ability to rotate. The Singapore Flyer has also said that it will install new emergency supplies such as water and glucose tablets in the capsules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Flyer management was reported to have said that they would require time for the backup systems to be put in place and request to reopen only when they are confident that such a situation as occurred on 23rd December 2008 will not happen again. The Police will authorise the reinstatement of the operations when the changes made by the Flyer have been inspected and certified safe by CAB. The certification report would also need to be submitted to Police. The Police will also require to be satisfied that the Flyer has put in place adequate contingency plans, and the Police will work with the relevant technical experts including CAB, SPRING Singapore and SCDF in this respect.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1171<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CHANGE IN GROSS FLOOR AREA COMPUTATION-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CHANGE IN GROSS FLOOR AREA COMPUTATION</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Consultation with industry-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Consultation with industry)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Er Lee Bee Wah </B>asked the Minister for National Development with the change in computation of gross floor area (such as bay windows and planter boxes) for housing projects, whether the Ministry has carried out any consultation with the building/construction industry before implementing the change in policy.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#65279; <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562\" name=\"GENERATOR\"> <LINK title=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" href=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> &#65279; <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562\" name=\"GENERATOR\"><LINK title=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" href=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \r\n\r\nURA has earlier exempted bay window from the gross floor area (GFA) of a development as they were treated as small elements of a building design and do not form part of the floor.&nbsp; URA also exempted planter boxes within residential units from GFA computation to facilitate greening for high-rise living.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, bay window designs have since evolved to become a predominant feature for newer residential buildings and contributed significantly to the building bulk.&nbsp; Based on URA's review, more than half of proposals received have the entire external fa&ccedil;ades of the building wrapped around by bay windows or planters.&nbsp; The extensive use of bay windows leads to higher heat transfer into buildings and increases the need for air-conditioning. This is energy inefficient and environmentally unfriendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The GFA exemption of planter boxes also did not achieve the objective of promoting high-rise greenery. URA noticed that only a small percentage of the approved planter boxes were being used for planting, leaving the rest either unplanted or illegally converted to other uses.&nbsp; Over the years, URA has received many complaints from Management Corporations of Strata Titled Development and the public on the illegal conversion of planter boxes to other uses. Home owners had provided feedback that they were not keen to provide planting and preferred to have the flexibility to convert the planter box space to other uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1173<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, while the government had exempted bay windows and planter boxes from GFA computation, buyers of residential units were made to pay for them as internal spaces of a residential unit.

In doing so, we took into account the interests of various stakeholders, including homeowners and the public.&nbsp; With the removal of GFA exemption for bay windows and planter boxes, developers can still incorporate these building features that are computed as GFA, into their designs if there is a demand for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At the same time, we also appreciate the impact of data protection on businesses and the general public.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had previously informed the House that an Inter-Ministry Committee is reviewing Singapore's data protection regime. This review is on-going.&nbsp; We are currently looking into developing a data protection model that can best address Singapore's privacy concerns, commercial requirements and national interest.&nbsp; As data protection is a complex issue with extensive impact on all stakeholders, this review will take some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is currently no generic data protection law, it does not mean that there is no protection of personal data.&nbsp; In fact we have in place strict provisions in sectoral laws, such as the Banking Act and codes for medical professionals to protect sensitive financial and health information.&nbsp; There are also other industry codes of practices against the unauthorised use of personal information.&nbsp; For example, in the telecommunications sector, under the Telecom Competition Code, IDA requires licensees to take reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorised use of End User Service Information.&nbsp; A telecom licensee would be in breach of the Code if it shares with third parties its customers' information that was obtained from the use of its service, without the customers' consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to sectoral laws, there is a Model Data Protection Code introduced in 2002 for voluntary adoption by the private sector.&nbsp; The principles of this Code have been adopted by many companies, including those engaged in e-commerce under the TrustSg initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government also takes data protection within the public sector seriously.&nbsp; We have structured our data protection policy after the Model Data Protection Code and this has been incorporated in the Government Instruction Manuals for the public service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of individuals who discover that their pictures have been posted by other individuals on new media platforms such as blogs, without prior consent, it would be considered a civil matter.&nbsp; The aggrieved persons could first ask the site's webmaster to remove the pictures.&nbsp; As with matters relating to online libel and personal defamation, they could also seek professional legal advice to determine the most appropriate legal recourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has also asked how consumers are protected from spam mails.&nbsp; The Spam Control Act was passed in Parliament on 12th April 2007.&nbsp; It sets out basic requirements for legitimate direct electronic mass marketing, and provides civil recourse for persons affected by illegal spam in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What this translates to, in practical terms, is that each unsolicited, commercial, electronic message which is sent in bulk, is required to contain an '&lt;ADV&gt;' [Reads: \"A. D.

MCYS administers the Integrated Healthy Start Programme, which targets \"high risk\" children up to six years from dysfunctional families.

Its role is to investigate specific complaints on using the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as an excuse for profiteering. The most recent increase in GST was in July 2007. Since then, CAP has worked with grassroots organisations and the Consumers Association of Singapore (or CASE) to investigate 274 cases of potential GST profiteering. Grassroots leaders have visited individual stall owners and worked with them to resolve the issue. For chain stores, CASE has written directly to the businesses asking them to explain their reasons for increasing prices. No new complaints pertaining to GST profiteering have been received by CAP in the past eight months.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High prices are not always due to profiteering. In a competitive and open economy such as Singapore, prices move up and down in response to changes in supply and demand. Most price increases that Singapore experienced in the past year can be traced back to increases in global prices such as the price of commodities. For instance, higher oil prices have translated to higher pump prices, taxi fares and airfares.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers naturally expect prices to adjust when the price of commodities fall. Global commodity prices have eased from their peak in July 2007. This already has, and should continue to help ease domestic price pressures in the coming months. On a year-on-year basis, the overall Consumer Price Index (or CPI) inflation has come down from its high of 7.5% in the second quarter of 2008, to 6.6% in the third quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider energy prices. Retail petrol prices have declined in tandem with world market trends. The price of one litre of Grade 95 petrol was about $2.30 at its peak in July 2008 but has since dropped to about $1.55, a 33% decrease. Taxi and airline companies have also announced adjustments of their fuel surcharges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is often a time lag between import and retail prices. This is because retailers often purchase their goods in bulk, or sign contracts on advance orders, thereby locking in prices that could be higher than current market prices.&nbsp; The time-lag not withstanding, a random survey of rice sold in our supermarkets suggests that between May 2008 and January 2009, retail prices of rice of 5kg and 10kg-pack declined between 5% to 17%.&nbsp; This shows that international prices of commodity filter through our distribution channels which we believe are efficient because of large number of players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, market competition as defined by the presence of many buyers and many sellers would provide the best defence against unreasonable price increases. By creating a conducive and competitive business environment for enterprises to thrive, we ensure that consumers have a wide range of choices. This allows consumers to switch to cheaper alternatives should some business charge unreasonable prices. For instance, consumers now have the choice to switch to cheaper house brands, as more local supermarkets widen the variety of products under their house brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There may be some businesses that maintain high prices unreasonably. The public can report any such cases to CASE which will not hesitate to investigate further. In addition, to encourage competitive pricing from retailers, CASE has been publishing price surveys on groceries on its website since May 2008. Consumers should make full use of these price surveys to make informed choices when they make purchases.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1181<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK FOR NEW GRADUATES IN 2009-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK FOR NEW GRADUATES IN 2009</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Assistance programmes-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Assistance programmes)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa </B>asked the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what is the employment outlook for new graduates in 2009; and (b) whether his Ministry will consider coming up with assistance programmes similar to SPUR to help job-seeking Singaporean graduates from polytechnics and universities.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment outlook for new graduates in 2009 will be less rosy compared to 2007 and 2008.&nbsp; This is to be expected given the weak economic outlook for 2009. Nonetheless, there are still growth areas that will see continuing demand for workers. For example, the healthcare sector will continue growing over the next two years with the development of healthcare facilities such as the opening of the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said it now has 6,200 job vacancies, of which 4,500 will be filled in the next two years.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil service will also continue hiring; for example, the Ministry of Education recently announced that it will be hiring more than 7,000 teachers and support staff in 2009; while the Ministry of Home Affairs is looking to fill more than 1,000 vacancies across the various Home Team departments. New jobs will also be created from the pipeline of new investments that will materialise in the manufacturing industry, such as pharmaceuticals and renewable energy. In the tourism sector, the integrated resorts have also started their hiring efforts and are expected to provide more than 20,000 jobs, including at the PMET level, over the next few years. Graduates are encouraged to seek out these various opportunities and be realistic about job and wage expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower will continue to provide comprehensive and timely information on careers, jobs and skills in demand through the Career Compass, a career guide for students. The pilot edition of the Career Compass was launched in February last year and students have found the career guide useful in helping them gain a better understanding of the opportunities in the job market, and make more informed choices on the courses of study and careers. MOM has launched the latest edition of the Career Compass on a dedicated internet portal and is actively engaging the various Post Secondary Educational Institutions (PSEIs) to maximize our outreach efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM and WDA will also be working with the PSEIs to organise job fairs for graduating students.&nbsp; Our universities and polytechnics are also stepping up their efforts to secure job placements for its graduates.&nbsp; Besides organising career fairs, recruitment talks and career counselling, they have kept in close touch with industries and firms from hiring sectors.&nbsp; For example, NUS Career Centre will intensify its work to engage more industries, including those from growth sectors such as gaming, environment and clean energy, to help find jobs for their graduates.&nbsp; Our graduates must also make an extra effort to learn about the available jobs in the different sectors and be open to these various jobs which may not be what they have hoped for initially.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the graduating students may consider proceeding with post-graduate education to acquire more knowledge and skills and enter the job market later when the <p align=left>Column: 1183<p>situation has improved. Various economic agencies also offer scholarships, such as MAS's Finance Scholarship Programme, STB's Tourism Industry Scholarships, and EDB's Joint Industry Postgraduate Programme. These aim to build up a critical mass of specialists in targeted fields.&nbsp; Fresh graduates can consider participating in these programmes to continue their post-graduate studies. EDB has also announced a new training initiative, PREP-UP (Preparing for the Upturn), to help companies develop manpower capabilities in science and technology fields, which will open up even more opportunities for fresh graduates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will monitor the employment situation closely and assess whether more needs to be done to help new graduates access job opportunities.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1183<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE AT PUBLIC HOSPITALS-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE AT PUBLIC HOSPITALS</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Er Lee Bee Wah </B>asked the Minister for Health in view of the heavy demands on public hospitals (a) what is the incidence of medical negligence at public hospitals over the past five years; (b) what are the procedures in place to detect such negligence; and (c) what is the course of action to prevent recurrence of any lapses.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy demand on public hospitals should not be an excuse for any act of medical negligence.&nbsp; A healthcare professional may be found negligent by the court if he fails to exercise reasonable diligence and care when providing treatment and causes injury to his patient as a result.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past&nbsp;five years, the public hospitals have reported three cases of alleged medical negligence that went to trial.

For example a patient can develop a serious drug allergy after receiving an antibiotic that is medically indicated for the first time. This may be an acceptable adverse outcome of the drug.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we can and should learn from each adverse event. That is why we have a Sentinel Event Reporting System in our hospitals.&nbsp; Whenever an adverse event has occurred, the hospital's Quality Assurance Committee is required to promptly review the event to determine the root causes, recommend risk reduction strategies and follow up on their implementation. The primary aim of the review is to improve the system so as to prevent future adverse events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All such reviews are notified to my Ministry and we monitor the follow-up actions to ensure that the corrective measures are put in place and useful lessons are shared with the larger health care community.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1185<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Anyone who uses electronic media as a means of communication is susceptible to it, but victims of cyber-bullying are often youths.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have specific laws against cyber-bullying but there is no immunity for acts conducted via the Internet.&nbsp; We can deal with cyber-bullying under our existing laws where an offence is made out.&nbsp; Potential offences in cyber-bullying cases would include criminal intimidation or insulting the modesty of a woman.&nbsp; Cyber-bullies are liable to be prosecuted if such offences are committed.&nbsp; Police does not track cyber-bullying cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the cyber-bully is prosecuted in Court, the offender may be tried by the Juvenile Court if he or she is below the age of 16 years at the point of pleading guilty to the offence.&nbsp; There is no necessity to enact specific legislation to exempt such prosecutions from the usual criminal procedure and trial process as there are sufficient safeguards in our laws.&nbsp; For example, the Children and Young Persons Act, or CYPA, provides sufficient safeguards for both the youth offender and victim through provisions on protection of identities of young persons involved in hearings.&nbsp; The Evidence Act also provides for witnesses below the age of 16 years to give evidence through live video or live television links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key lever to addressing the phenomenon of cyber-bullying is education and awareness.&nbsp; Cyber-bullying is one of the topics covered in the Cyberwellness Framework developed by the Ministry of Education to enhance the schools' cyberwellness education efforts.&nbsp; The framework includes a series of lessons that increases students' understanding of cyber-bullying and its negative effects, as well as providing information on preventing and dealing with incidents of cyber-bullying.&nbsp; MOE has also been collaborating with various agencies like the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore to support schools in their efforts to educate both students and parents about cyberwellness.&nbsp; Specifically, MOE partners MHA in the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation, which encourages and creates platforms to transmit the cyberwellness message to youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, despite the best efforts, there will be cases of cyber-bullying which can go unnoticed by the schools.&nbsp; As cyberspace is pervasive and extends beyond the bounds of the school, parents need to be vigilant about their children's activities, including their <p align=left>Column: 1187<p>on-line activities.&nbsp; Close cooperation between parents and schools can help identify children who are victims of cyber-bullying so that appropriate steps can be taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have no plans to enact specific offences related to cyber-bullying at this point in time as we think it is not necessary, but we will monitor the situation.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1187<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Academics from NTU had studied into this carefully some 10 years ago, before we introduced Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), and had recommended such an approach.&nbsp; This is because by taking into account such factors, for example by including the waiting time at traffic lights within the optimal speed range of 20-30 kph, it will better reflect the travelling experience of motorists.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Land Transport Review, we had also engaged a team of NTU professors to assess if we need to update the optimal speed range for our roads.&nbsp; We have concluded that the minimum threshold speed for arterial and city roads should remain at 20 kph, as sub-optimal stop-start traffic conditions would likely take place at speeds below that.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1187<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Buses in these countries have priority when leaving some bus stops or changing in between lanes, and motorists are required to give way to the buses.&nbsp; Thus far, there is no evidence linking any increase in accident rates with the operation of the scheme in these countries.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mandatory Give Way to Buses Scheme is not an entirely a new initiative in Singapore.&nbsp; In 2005, the LTA and the public bus operators launched a campaign to encourage motorists to voluntarily give way to buses leaving bus bays.&nbsp; Observations <p align=left>Column: 1189<p>during the campaign have shown that motorists are able to give way to buses safely, and bus journey times improved when motorists do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the success of the earlier campaign depended on the voluntary good-will and courtesy of motorists to give way.&nbsp; In practice, some motorists gave way, some did not, so that on the whole, bus travel times remained unreliable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with growing travel demand in land-scarce Singapore, we need to make public transport more attractive.&nbsp; We cannot do so without making buses faster and more reliable, by giving buses more priority on the roads.&nbsp; Hence LTA has introduced the Mandatory Give Way to Buses Scheme.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we are sensitive to the needs of other road users.&nbsp; We have therefore adopted a cautious approach, to first pilot this scheme along&nbsp;three roads for an initial period of&nbsp;three months.&nbsp; This is to test how it works in practice and for us to examine any potential issues that might arise before deciding on full implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA has taken great care in designing the pilot to ensure safety for all road users.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot locations are along roads that have a speed limit of 60 km per hour or lower.&nbsp;&nbsp; As with pedestrian zebra crossings, motorists are given adequate warning. Two consecutive give-way triangles have been painted on the roads, and special traffic signs put up, 50 metres to 70 metres&nbsp;away so that motorists have sufficient time to react when approaching a Give Way to Buses Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that motorists know about the pilot, LTA has sent detailed information brochures in the four official languages to all registered car owners and taxi companies.&nbsp; Similarly, LTA has worked with the bus operators to train bus drivers, so that they clearly signal their intentions and watching out for vehicles when pulling out of bus bays. Also, reminder messages are aired over the radio regularly, to alert road users to the scheme.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1189<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPORE ZOO-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SINGAPORE ZOO</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Emergency measures-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Emergency measures)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Chiam See Tong </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what emergency measures were in place at the Singapore Zoo during the time of the incident involving a cleaner who was killed by two white tigers; and (b) whether there are alarms or emergency call buttons installed for the use of staff or patrons should an emergency arise.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#65279; <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562\" name=\"GENERATOR\"> <LINK title=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" href=\"/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \r\n\r\nAll exhibits in the Singapore Zoo comply with international safety standards established under the guidelines of the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria.&nbsp; This includes the white tiger exhibit.&nbsp; To ensure that facilities continue to be safe and are in good condition, zoo personnel inspect all enclosures on a daily basis, and take immediate action to rectify problems identified.&nbsp; The checks are also subject to a monthly audit by a team of expert staff.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The emergency protocols for the zoo are based on guidelines from the AZA.&nbsp; The Singapore Zoo also regularly consults counterparts in the benchmark zoos in the United States, such as The National Zoo in Washington D.

Employment agencies that are found to have breached licence regulations are liable to have their licences revoked and their security deposit of $20,000 forfeited.&nbsp; We have also been working with foreign embassies here with regard to errant agents in the source countries.&nbsp;

The EIP is applied consistently to all races.&nbsp; Exceptions made to EIP can undermine the objective of maintaining a balanced racial mix and result in the creation of ethnic enclaves.&nbsp; However, HDB does exercise some flexibility under very exceptional circumstances.&nbsp; For example, it has allowed households of mixed marriages/parentage to be re-classified to meet the ethnic criteria.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a large number of resale flats available in the market, with about 30,000 transactions annually.&nbsp; Sellers who are realistic in their asking price should be able to find buyers from the eligible ethnic groups.&nbsp; There could be a small number of households that may need more time to find a suitable buyer for their flat because of the EIP.&nbsp; This is a small inconvenience that Singaporeans must live with to ensure racial harmony in our society.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1197<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Investments by GIC and Temasek have inevitably been affected, like those of other global investors. However, their overall value has fallen by less than the decline in global equity markets, as they maintain diversified portfolios and had taken precautionary actions early in the crisis to reduce their exposures to the equity markets.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temasek reports the market value of its portfolio in the annual Temasek Review.&nbsp; GIC now reports its long term returns on a moving average basis, which will be updated in the next annual GIC Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC and Temasek's strategies of investing on a diversified basis for the long term, and maintaining sound governance and risk management practices, enable them to ride through market cycles, including severe market declines such as in the current global crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp; These strategies also put them in a position to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise from the current downturn.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1201<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:INTEGRATED PROGRAMME STUDENTS-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>INTEGRATED PROGRAMME STUDENTS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Number of failures-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Number of failures)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Ong Ah Heng </B>asked the Minister for Education since its inception in 2004, how many students in the Integrated Programme did not pass the GCE 'A' level examination or equivalent examinations and ended six years of education without a certificate.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no passing criteria set for the GCE 'A' Level examination.&nbsp; All students who pass at least one subject in the GCE 'A' Level examination will receive a certificate indicating their results.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, the first batch of Integrated Programme (IP) students from Hwa Chong Institution, National Junior College and Raffles Junior College sat for the 'A' Level examination.&nbsp; 98.2% of IP students obtained a pass in three H2 subjects and General Paper/Knowledge and Inquiry, similar to the performance of the previous cohort of non-IP students in the same schools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with previous cohorts from these schools before IP was introduced, there were a few students who did not meet the minimum criteria to apply for admission to the National University of Singapore or the Nanyang Technological University.&nbsp; These students have chosen to repeat their 'A' Levels, or apply to overseas educational institutions using their 'A' Level and school-based results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first batch of IP students from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) took the International Baccalaureate (IB) examination in November 2007.

Measures included volunteers from the Grassroots Organisations visiting families with five-year old children who are not attending pre-school to understand their reasons and to encourage them to do so. Places in PCF kindergartens were offered and help for financial assistance given, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has also been working with primary schools to identify six-year old children who are not attending pre-school at the point of the Primary One registration exercise. Based on self declared information, families were identified and encouraged by the Self-Help Groups to register their children in PCF kindergartens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1203<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these efforts in place, we have reduced the percentage of those entering Primary 1 without any pre-school education from more than 4% to about 2.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these improvements, these efforts should be continued and stepped up as the families concerned would have multiple problems, often beyond the need for financial help. MOE, MCYS and the Grassroots Organisations will continue their efforts in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For financial help, there are many schemes in place. The Baby Bonus Scheme was enhanced in August 2008, and the monies in their Child Development Account (CDA) can be used by parents to pay pre-school fees. Children receive a cash gift and enjoy matching Government contributions in the CDA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, a number of financial assistance schemes have also been put in place to help children from lower-income families. MCYS provides a fee subsidy under its Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) for children from low-income families.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp; families that cannot afford the initial costs related to sending their children to kindergarten (e.g. registration fee, uniforms) may also be considered for a Start-up Grant of up to $200 per child per year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children who attend childcare centres receive a universal child care subsidy. Over and above the universal child care subsidy, working parents with monthly household income not exceeding $1,800 can also apply for the Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who need further help, community-based support is available through the Grassroots Organisations, self-help groups and PCF kindergartens, to supplement the government subsidies.&nbsp; For example, CDAC and MENDAKI provide additional financial assistance to needy families, under the Pre-School Assistance and Support Scheme (PASS) and Education Trust Fund (ETF) initiatives respectively. Advisers and grassroots leaders can also tap on the Citizens' Consultative Committees' (CCC) Welfare and Education Fund, and the ComCare Fund to assist their residents who need financial support to send their children to pre-school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, families who need help will have access to financial and other assistance.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1203<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:NIE'S BACHELOR OF EDUCATION PROGRAMME-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>NIE'S BACHELOR OF EDUCATION PROGRAMME</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Enrolment-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Enrolment)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Siew Kum Hong </B>asked the Minister for Education in each of the past&nbsp;three years (a) how many persons were enrolled in NIE's Bachelor of Education programme; and (b) of these, how many had two A-Level passes.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of candidates enrolled in NIE's Bachelor of Art/ Bachelor of Science in Education programme (BA/BSc programme) has risen from 175 in AY2006/07 to 470 in AY2008/09.

For non-motor accident cases, the Ministry involved can settle claims not exceeding $750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to statutory boards, there will similarly be a range of claims, with some as low as tens of dollars.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
