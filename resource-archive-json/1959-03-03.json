The final form\r\n\r\nof  the  questions was determined in my  Ministry  only\r\n\r\nafter   the   questions  had  returned  from   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  and  thus  the  professors   up   at   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  did  not  know  the  final  form   of   the\r\n\r\nquestions. The questions that leaked out were in  their\r\n\r\nfinal form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) All these question papers were sent to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Printing  Office for printing.  The  proofs\r\n\r\nwere checked by the setters themselves and returned  to\r\n\r\nthe Printing Office for final printing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The packing of the printed papers was supervised\r\n\r\nby  three  officials of the Ministry  at  the  Printing\r\n\r\nOffice  and  brought back personally  by  them  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) During this period from the setting of the first\r\n\r\nquestions  until  the delivery of the  printed  papers,\r\n\r\nthey   were  kept  in  the  custody  of  the  Assistant\r\n\r\nExaminations Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Government Printer has accounted for all the\r\n\r\npapers printed by him either in proof or in final form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelation of the above facts should have brought\r\n\r\nabout  the  exposure of the culprit  or  culprits,  but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  this  has been made  impossible  by  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal to students and others to come forward to\r\n\r\ngive  information with regard to the leakage  has  been\r\n\r\ndisappointing.  Although many pupils who  had  been  in\r\n\r\npossession of the questions had been interrogated, none\r\n\r\nof   them  was  prepared  to  speak  the  whole  truth.\r\n\r\nInvariably  the  final answers were  either  that  they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobtained   the   questions  anonymously   through   the\r\n\r\ntelephone, through the post or from collective  copying\r\n\r\nin a coffee shop or at some other place. Even those who\r\n\r\nhad  come  forward to surrender some of  the  questions\r\n\r\nbefore  the  examination  were  not  prepared  to  give\r\n\r\nfurther information. They said that their object was to\r\n\r\nprove  to the Government that there had been a  leakage\r\n\r\nof  questions so that the dishonest students would  not\r\n\r\nget  their qualifications through foul means. They said\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  objective had been achieved and they,  therefore,\r\n\r\ndid not want to go further to put anybody in trouble, in\r\n\r\nface  of  this attitude no one can force any of them  to\r\n\r\nsay  anything against their will but I want to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity,  not  to  condemn the  perverted  sense  of\r\n\r\nloyalty  to  friends among the Chinese school  students,\r\n\r\nbut  to  ask  them to sit back and reflect whether  they\r\n\r\nwere  doing the right thing as citizens of this  country\r\n\r\nand  whether the loyalty and sincerity they  learned  in\r\n\r\nthe  classics  taught  them to  shield  those  who  have\r\n\r\nconspired  to cheat in an examination at national  level\r\n\r\nand frustrate the efforts of the Government.

Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will have this tragic event still fresh in their\r\n\r\nminds  and  I need not go over the harrowing details  of\r\n\r\nthis  tragedy  which has called forth the sympathy,  not\r\n\r\nonly  of  the  whole  of Singapore, but  also  from  our\r\n\r\nbrothers  in  the Federation and Brunei and sympathisers\r\n\r\nfrom  the  United Kingdom. In this account, I intend  to\r\n\r\nconfine  myself purely to the sober statistical  details\r\n\r\nof this fire, the largest Singapore has experienced, and\r\n\r\nto an account of the measures which Government has taken\r\n\r\nor intends to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the scheme for undertaking emergency\r\n\r\nmeasures whenever a fire or other calamity occurs, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  measures  taken  to fight  the  fire  and  provide\r\n\r\nimmediate medical care and attention to the victims, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  set up a relief centre under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Social  Welfare Department at  the  Kim  Seng  Road\r\n\r\nSchool.   The  Social  Welfare  Department   staff   and\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers manned the relief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncentre  day  and  night.  Donations  of  food   and\r\n\r\nclothing  and goods immediately poured in from  the\r\n\r\never    generous   public   and   from    voluntary\r\n\r\nassociations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these donations the Singapore Council of\r\n\r\nSocial  Services have to date distributed  $154,140\r\n\r\nin  cash  to  the fire victims through  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department while that Department itself has\r\n\r\npaid  out $26,060. The Singapore Council of  Social\r\n\r\nServices  has spent a further $10,000  on  feeding,\r\n\r\nthe  Social  Welfare Department another  $2,000  on\r\n\r\nequipment,  the Public Works Department have  spent\r\n\r\n$12,500 on works carried out, while health services\r\n\r\nand milk were provided by the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these measures provided immediate relief to\r\n\r\nthe  victims, it was necessary to consider  the  no\r\n\r\nless urgent problem of their future accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning following the fire, a team from\r\n\r\nthe Estates Department of the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust,   by   liaison  with  the   Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment,    obtained   basic   information    in\r\n\r\nconnection  with rehousing requirements.  Including\r\n\r\nlate registrations and additions made subsequently,\r\n\r\nit  was  necessary to consider rehousing 115 single\r\n\r\npersons and 920 families amounting to approximately\r\n\r\n4,500  persons  in all. On Monday,  16th  February,\r\n\r\nGovernment directed the Singapore Improvement Trust\r\n\r\nto  provide  temporary accommodation for  the  fire\r\n\r\nvictim  families at Kallang Airport Estate  and  to\r\n\r\nprepare schemes for the immediate redevelopment  of\r\n\r\nthe  area  devastated by the fire. On the following\r\n\r\nday,  Sir,  I  announced the Government's  decision\r\n\r\nthat  the  victims of the Kampong Tiong Bahru  fire\r\n\r\nwould  be  accommodated free of  charge  for  three\r\n\r\nmonths  and  that a large number of low-cost  flats\r\n\r\nwould be built to rehouse all the victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move of all persons living within the school\r\n\r\npremises  and the majority of those who have  found\r\n\r\naccommodation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutside the school was completed on Thursday,  26th\r\n\r\nFebruary.  During the 13 days, from  the  time  the\r\n\r\nTrust  was  first  directed to  take  part  in  the\r\n\r\noperation,   779   units  of   accommodation   were\r\n\r\nallocated   and   occupied  by  approximately   900\r\n\r\nfamilies  and single person groups. The total  move\r\n\r\ninvolved more than 4,000 persons. Lettings  of  779\r\n\r\nunits  in normal times would take some two  months.\r\n\r\nThe  organization  and effort  contributed  by  the\r\n\r\nstaff  who condensed the volume of work into a  few\r\n\r\ndays  has  been possible only because of  continued\r\n\r\nworking  by the staff on the site until late  hours\r\n\r\neach day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I must come to the Government's intentions in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  redevelopment  of  the  fire  site\r\n\r\nitself.  It  is  considered  that  only  a  planned\r\n\r\nredevelopment  of  the site with permanent  housing\r\n\r\nshould be carried out and that haphazard rebuilding\r\n\r\nwith  attap or timber barrack buildings  should  be\r\n\r\nstrongly resisted and prevented. Government has now\r\n\r\naccordingly gazetted for acquisition the full  area\r\n\r\nof  the  fire site itself together with  additional\r\n\r\nlands around it for satisfactory redevelopment. The\r\n\r\nproposals   are  that  the  fire  site  should   be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  by the erection of 240 two-room  single-storey units and 500 two-room units in multi-storey\r\n\r\nblocks. The single-storey units will be constructed\r\n\r\nto  a  simple but durable structure by the  use  of\r\n\r\nwood   wool  slabs  and  concrete  hollow   blocks.\r\n\r\nIndividual  water supply and electricity  would  be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaid on to each unit. The overall cost of these two-room  units, including a proportion of  site  work,\r\n\r\nwould  be $2,500. Such two-room units could be  let\r\n\r\ncomplete   to  larger  families  or  be  split   to\r\n\r\nindividual rooms for allocation to small  families.\r\n\r\nThe  redevelopment of the higher  portions  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsite,  having good load bearing capacity  would  be\r\n\r\nwith  seven-storey  buildings containing  units  of\r\n\r\nalmost   identical  plan  to  the   single   storey\r\n\r\nstructures  but having balcony access.  Such  units\r\n\r\ncould   again  be  let  out  complete  or  as   two\r\n\r\nindividual rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the cost of 500 units of the two-room units in the multi-storey blocks will be\r\n\r\napproximately $5,000 each or $2,500 per single room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanction will be sought at the next sitting of this\r\n\r\nAssembly   for  the  provision  of  additional   monies\r\n\r\namounting  to  approximately  $3.3  million  for   this\r\n\r\ndevelopment. In the meantime, the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust  is being authorised to proceed immediately  with\r\n\r\nsite  works  in  anticipation of  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that, after the carrying out of the\r\n\r\nnecessary  site works, the first phase  of  the  scheme\r\n\r\nresulting  in  the completion of the 240  single-storey\r\n\r\nunits  would  take  three months, while  the  remaining\r\n\r\nphases   of   the  scheme  would  result   in   further\r\n\r\naccommodation  being available by the completion  of  a\r\n\r\npossible 200 units in the multi-storey buildings at six\r\n\r\nto eight weeks intervals thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to end this statement by voicing the\r\n\r\nthanks  of this Government and, I am sure, the  victims\r\n\r\nof  this fire will wish me to do so on their behalf, to\r\n\r\nall  persons  who  worked long  and  devoted  hours  to\r\n\r\nalleviate the plight of the afflicted victims,  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  very  willing co-operation and assistance rendered\r\n\r\nby  all  bodies  and  organizations,  both  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate,  from  the  City  Council  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust to the Council of Social Services and\r\n\r\nother relief organizations.

Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main value of the amendment proposed lies in\r\n\r\nclauses  2  and  3  the result of which  will  be  that\r\n\r\nmarried  couples will be enabled to adopt  and  give  a\r\n\r\nproper  status to an illegitimate child of one  or  the\r\n\r\nother.  There  are  cases  where  the  mother   of   an\r\n\r\nillegitimate child marries the natural father  of  that\r\n\r\nchild and it is desirable that some proper means should\r\n\r\nbe  provided for the child to be adopted jointly by the\r\n\r\nhusband  and  wife without the undesirable  fiction  at\r\n\r\npresent resorted to whereby the mother has formally  to\r\n\r\ngive  up  her parental rights before an adoption  order\r\n\r\ncan be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill will allow for adoption in this\r\n\r\nvery small class of case where the mother marries a man\r\n\r\nless  than  21 years older than the child.  Usually  in\r\n\r\nsuch  cases  the man, married, is in fact  the  natural\r\n\r\nfather.   These  two  clauses  will  allow   of   these\r\n\r\narrangements  which I suggest are proper and  desirable\r\n\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth clause of this Bill makes a minor\r\n\r\nalteration  to  section  9  of  the  Ordinance,   which\r\n\r\nprovides  for  rules to be made. At present  there  are\r\n\r\nrules  providing for adoption orders to be made not  in\r\n\r\nopen  court  but  in Chambers. Strictly,  interlocutory\r\n\r\napplications should be dealt with in open  Court.  This\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  the  practice in the  past  and  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable  that  provision  should  be  made  for   the\r\n\r\nexisting practice of dealing with interlocutory  orders\r\n\r\nin Chambers to be regularised and put completely beyond\r\n\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final clause of the Bill adds a definition\r\n\r\nsection  which  is now desirable so as  to  distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween fathers of legitimate children and the natural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfathers  of  illegitimate children, and is consequential\r\n\r\non the provision that will be made by clause 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.- [Mr Shanks].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Tun Lim Yew Hock):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of constitutional changes and of\r\n\r\nexperience  gained  over  the  past  few  years  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Immigration Ordinance, 1953, it is\r\n\r\nimperative that certain amendments should be made in the\r\n\r\nlaw   to  meet  changed  conditions  and  to  close  the\r\n\r\nloopholes  that have been discovered over a  period.  To\r\n\r\nthis end there have been several consultations with  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government at ministerial as well as official\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> are aware that since 1953 the policy on\r\n\r\nimmigration  has been Pan-Malayan, and  I  am  happy  to\r\n\r\nreport  that as a result of these consultations it  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is an independent territory now and\r\n\r\nSingapore  will soon have internal self-government,  but\r\n\r\ndespite   the  difference  in  status,  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed to maintain a Pan-Malayan approach\r\n\r\nto  this  very important legislation. There will  be  no\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  freedom  of movement  between  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories along the Causeway other than in the case of\r\n\r\nthose  citizens who are specifically prohibited by order\r\n\r\nof either Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions incorporated in this Bill are the\r\n\r\nresult  of consultations referred to by me. A  new  Bill\r\n\r\nincorporating these amendments was passed by the Federal\r\n\r\nLegislative   Council  about  a   fortnight   ago.   The\r\n\r\nFederation Government is now awaiting the passing of our\r\n\r\nBill  so  that the new law can be brought into operation\r\n\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference to the Explanatory Statement to the Bill\r\n\r\nwill disclose the reasons for the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, the most important clause, seeks to amend\r\n\r\nthe provisions of section 7 of the Immigration Ordinance\r\n\r\nin  that  the right of entry is now confined to citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and of the Federation, and  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will welcome this move. Persons other than\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore and of the Federation will have to\r\n\r\napply  for  a permit or pass in order to enter Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  outside  Malaya. I wish to stress that  this  will\r\n\r\nrefer  to  those who will be seeking entry  into  Malaya\r\n\r\nafter  the  coming  into force of this  amendment.  This\r\n\r\namendment  will not affect persons already  resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on entry permits or passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to those categories of persons who at\r\n\r\npresent are entitled to enter by virtue of section 7 (1)\r\n\r\n(b)  of  the Ordinance, namely, persons in the  specific\r\n\r\nemployment  of  the Government or of the  City  Council,\r\n\r\nconsular  representatives or members of  the  Diplomatic\r\n\r\nCorps,  and  members of Her Majesty's Forces serving  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  they  will  be  covered  by  an  Immigration\r\n\r\n(Exemption) Order which it is proposed to make  if  this\r\n\r\nBill  is passed. This Exemption Order will be authorised\r\n\r\nunder section 55 of the Ordinance as amended. Clause  27\r\n\r\nof  the Bill seeks such an amendment to section 55 so as\r\n\r\nto   empower  the  Minister,  when  he  makes  an  Order\r\n\r\nexempting  any  person  or class  of  persons  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Immigration  Ordinance,  to  impose\r\n\r\nconditions on such exemption. It is intended  that  such\r\n\r\nan Order, when made, will make it obligatory on the part\r\n\r\nof persons qualified for exemption to apply for an entry\r\n\r\npermit or pass, if the specific reason for the exemption\r\n\r\nceases to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhold good. Such persons could then be treated as if they\r\n\r\nwere  applying  for first entry into Singapore  if  they\r\n\r\nwish  to  remain here after their diplomatic or consular\r\n\r\nstatus ceases, or their service with the Armed Forces or\r\n\r\nthe Government or the City Council is terminated, as the\r\n\r\ncase may be. The Government feels that this amendment is\r\n\r\nvitally  necessary in order that when the new  Exemption\r\n\r\nOrder  is introduced, there will be a system of control,\r\n\r\nwhich   will  enable  it,  in  consultation   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government if need be, to have the  power  to\r\n\r\nrefuse or to allow such persons to remain in Malaya when\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  for exemption have ceased to be  valid  in\r\n\r\ntheir  cases. The present law gives no such  power  once\r\n\r\nthey   have  entered  Singapore  under  the  entitlement\r\n\r\nconferred  under section 7 (1) (b) of the Ordinance.  It\r\n\r\nwill  therefore be in the interests of Singapore to have\r\n\r\nthis  control  in  order that permission  to  stay  here\r\n\r\neither on an entry permit or pass would be regulated  by\r\n\r\nconsiderations of contributions which such persons would\r\n\r\nmake  for  the  economic  betterment  or  otherwise   of\r\n\r\nSingapore or of Malaya as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore now has overwhelming problems of a fast\r\n\r\nexpanding population and of a totally inadequate  number\r\n\r\nof employment opportunities created from time to time to\r\n\r\nabsorb  the  large numbers of young persons coming  into\r\n\r\nthe  employment market every year. At the same time, the\r\n\r\nGovernment is only too conscious of the need to  attract\r\n\r\ncapital   and  technological  know-how  for   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and to expand and improve the productivity\r\n\r\nof  existing industries, while maintaining to  the  full\r\n\r\nthe  enviable position which we have gained through  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade. It is, therefore, necessary that  there\r\n\r\nshould be a balance struck somewhere between the need to\r\n\r\ncurtail  the  entry  of  persons seeking  employment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the necessity to have recourse to steps to\r\n\r\ninvite foreign capital or experts, whether it is in  the\r\n\r\nscientific, technological or professional spheres, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  contribute  to  Singapore's economic,  social  or\r\n\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this control, Sir, emphasis\r\n\r\nwill be placed more and more on the economic benefit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Positive  steps will have  to  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nencourage  people to invest in Singapore and to  protect\r\n\r\nthat   investment  with  their  presence  here.  As   an\r\n\r\nimportant corollary to this better system of immigration\r\n\r\ncontrol,  it  is  proposed that the present  Immigration\r\n\r\n(Prohibition   of  Entry)  Order,  which  includes   the\r\n\r\ncategory  of persons under paragraph (b) of the Schedule\r\n\r\nto  the Order enabling a contract employee to be granted\r\n\r\nan  entry  permit  if  he has a contract  of  employment\r\n\r\nguaranteeing a salary of $500 per month for  two  years,\r\n\r\nshould  be  replaced. Accordingly a new  order  will  be\r\n\r\nissued, deleting paragraph (b) of the Schedule, as  well\r\n\r\nas  another  category in paragraph (c) which  refers  to\r\n\r\nskilled  artisans being allowed entry for employment  in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  or  occupation if there are  not  sufficient\r\n\r\nskilled artisans already resident in Malaya, and if such\r\n\r\nentry is in the economic interests of Singapore, and  to\r\n\r\ncover  these two categories of persons by the  issue  of\r\n\r\nEmployment  Passes.  Such  Employment  Passes  will   be\r\n\r\nauthorised under new Immigration regulations which it is\r\n\r\nalso  proposed to make. Such an Employment Pass  may  be\r\n\r\nissued  by  the Controller to any person  other  than  a\r\n\r\nprohibited  immigrant who satisfies the Controller  that\r\n\r\nhe  wishes  to  enter  Singapore in  order  to  take  up\r\n\r\nemployment in Singapore under a contract for  a  minimum\r\n\r\nperiod  of  two years and up to a maximum of five  years\r\n\r\n(with extensions to be granted at the discretion of  the Controller)  with  \r\n\r\na  company  or  firm,  such  contract\r\n\r\nguaranteeing  an emolument of $1,200 per  month.  It  is\r\n\r\nfurther  proposed that there should be  a  proviso  that\r\n\r\nwhere   the  Controller  is  satisfied  that  no  person\r\n\r\nresident   in   Singapore  is  available  to   undertake\r\n\r\nemployment of the kind referred to in such contract  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  will be unreasonable to expect an employer  to\r\n\r\npay such a salary in the particular circumstances of the\r\n\r\njob or post, he may waive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  requirements  of  this  stipulation  that  the\r\n\r\nemployee  should  be paid a salary  of  $1,200  per\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must ask hon. Members to bear\r\n\r\nwith  me if I appear to dwell too long on this part\r\n\r\nof  the  proposed provision. There  has  been  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable disquiet on the part of the commercial\r\n\r\nand   trading  community  as  to  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintentions,  and I hope this statement  will  allay\r\n\r\nthe fears that the Government is seeking to exclude\r\n\r\ncontract employees altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the necessity to provide and\r\n\r\npreserve employment opportunities for local people,\r\n\r\nthere  is of course the recognized need to maintain\r\n\r\nconfidence in the ability of Singapore to cope with\r\n\r\nthe  demands  of what we hope will be an  expanding\r\n\r\neconomy.  Contract  employees  will  therefore   be\r\n\r\nallowed  entry  and  even  welcomed  if  they   are\r\n\r\npersonnel of a high calibre of attainments that are\r\n\r\nnot  to  be found amongst local qualified  persons,\r\n\r\nand if they will bring special talents, whether  it\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  business,  industrial,  scientific  or\r\n\r\ntechnological fields. In the process of raising the\r\n\r\nfigure from $500 a month to $1,200 a month,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe Government's hope that indirect inducement will\r\n\r\nthus be offered to firms and companies to encourage\r\n\r\nor  promote local persons to take the places of the\r\n\r\njunior  executive  grades  whom  they,  up  to  the\r\n\r\npresent,   find  it  expedient  to   recruit   from\r\n\r\noverseas. We believe that many firms of repute  and\r\n\r\nstanding  in  Singapore have  already  embarked  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes  of training local people to  take  over\r\n\r\nposts  of  responsibility  even  without  any  such\r\n\r\ninducement. Therefore, I wish to give an  assurance\r\n\r\nto   such  firms  and  to  others  which  recognize\r\n\r\nsympathetically the need of Singapore  to  preserve\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities as far as possible to  its\r\n\r\ncitizens,  that  there is no present  intention  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  them to Malayanise the senior  executive\r\n\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need hardly stress that if this proposed\r\n\r\nimmigration  control is exercised over  the  coming\r\n\r\nyears  with the broad imaginative objectives  which\r\n\r\nwe  have  in  mind,  there  will  be  much  greater\r\n\r\nappreciation   of   the   benefits   of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship, and communities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill become close-knit and integrated. The building\r\n\r\nup  of a Malayan consciousness and loyalty will  be\r\n\r\ngreatly  accelerated thereby. With the  Federation,\r\n\r\nthis  Government  agrees that at this  juncture  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  be unduly restrictive over the issue  of\r\n\r\nEmployment Passes provided that employers can  show\r\n\r\nthat  they are making genuine attempts to cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  the Government to see that as far as possible\r\n\r\nlocal  people  are being employed or being  trained\r\n\r\nfor  higher  posts, so that the need  for  overseas\r\n\r\nrecruitment  is  reduced to  the  minimum.  As  the\r\n\r\nproposed   orders   to  be   made   will   not   be\r\n\r\nretrospective but will come into force on the dates\r\n\r\nthey  are  made, persons already resident on  entry\r\n\r\npermits,  whether  they  be contract  employees  or\r\n\r\nspecialists   or  professional  consultants   under\r\n\r\nparagraph (a) of the Schedule to the Prohibition of\r\n\r\nEntry order, will not be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill proposes an amendment\r\n\r\nto  subsection (2) of section 6 of the  Immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  order  to prohibit  the  entry  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  from the Federation of any person  other\r\n\r\nthan a citizen of Singapore who has been prohibited\r\n\r\nentry  by  order  made  under  section  9  of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  or  who has entered the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya on a pass issued under the provisions of any\r\n\r\nwritten  law  for the time being in  force  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and  endorsed as not valid  for  entry\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore. Hon. Members will appreciate  that\r\n\r\nthis  amendment will enable the Government to  have\r\n\r\nthe  right,  which  it  is  hoped  will  be  rarely\r\n\r\nexercised,  to  exclude visitors to Singapore  from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  whether  for  security  or  other\r\n\r\nreasons, because their presence is objected  to  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   but   not  in  the   Federation.   The\r\n\r\nFederation  Bill has such a parallel  provision  to\r\n\r\nexclude visitors from Singapore to the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to amend section 10 of\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration Ordinance to make the issue of  an\r\n\r\nEntry Permit discretionary instead of mandatory.  I\r\n\r\nhave  already  explained that this will  now  prove\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary if immigration control in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  Singapore which we  seek  is  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 similarly seeks to amend section 11 (2) of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   to  make  the  issue  of  Re-entry   Permits\r\n\r\ndiscretionary instead of mandatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 seeks to repeal and re-enact section 15 of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance to give power to the Controller to declare\r\n\r\nthe presence of a person who has entered Singapore on  a\r\n\r\npermit  or certificate to be unlawful after his arrival,\r\n\r\nif  it  is  proved subsequently that he obtained  either\r\n\r\ndocument by misrepresentation or that he is a prohibited\r\n\r\nimmigrant.   The   certificate  in   question   is   the\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Citizenship status  issued  to  someone\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore  who  claims  to  be  a  citizen   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  by birth or otherwise.

This latter provision is to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nnecessary lengthy enquiries that may be required in some\r\n\r\ncases  do  not  result in the owner  of  the  vessel  or\r\n\r\naircraft repudiating liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 introduces a new section to facilitate\r\n\r\ninterrogation  and investigation in cases where  persons\r\n\r\nare liable to be removed from Singapore under any of the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish, in conclusion, to acknowledge with\r\n\r\ngratitude  the part played by Tunku Abdul Rahman,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the Federation, in all this.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every\r\n\r\nSingaporean will no doubt support the protection of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of Singapore citizens in getting employment in\r\n\r\nhis own country. I have no objection to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister mentioned in his\r\n\r\nspeech  that  he  wants  foreign capital.  I  think  all\r\n\r\nParties  need it, and have already spoken about it.  But\r\n\r\nhow  is foreign capital going to come? Unless you  allow\r\n\r\nthe  managers or partners to run the business. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  send capital here and hand  it  over  to\r\n\r\nsomebody  and say, \"Look here, you take this capital  of\r\n\r\n$100,000,  and  run the business for us.\"  That  is  not\r\n\r\npossible, because those who invest their capital in this\r\n\r\ncountry  want  to see their capital under their  control\r\n\r\nand invested in lines of their own interests. This being\r\n\r\nthe case, the managers and partners should be allowed to\r\n\r\nstay here to manage the affairs of their businesses.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they will have to employ local men in  the  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  especially the industrial  side,  and  they\r\n\r\nmust  also train the local people in order to  form  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have one more question. Many firms have been\r\n\r\nestablished  here for years. Their businesses  are  vast\r\n\r\nand  they have branches in many parts of the world, with\r\n\r\ntheir   managers   or  their  partners   running   these\r\n\r\nbusinesses. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government, whichever Party is  in  power - of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  present Government will soon  be  out  of\r\n\r\noffice -  must  know that, in order to keep  investments\r\n\r\nin  this  country and to attract investments into  this\r\n\r\ncountry  from outside, they must allow the partners  or\r\n\r\nmanagers  of these businesses, whoever they choose,  to\r\n\r\nstay  in  this  country.  Of  late,  many  people  have\r\n\r\napproached me saying that they want to send  their  own\r\n\r\npartners  here  to  manage their  own  well-established\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  If  these partners  or  managers  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to stay here, the only thing that will  result\r\n\r\nis  that  the  businesses, and with the businesses  the\r\n\r\ncapital  too,  will  move  out.  This  difficulty,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  after  persuading the Immigration  Department,\r\n\r\nis  generally  solved; sometimes it goes  to  a  higher\r\n\r\nlevel, but it is solved. But I must at this stage  draw\r\n\r\nspecial  attention  to this fact - that  most  businesses\r\n\r\nhere  have been established before these rules, or this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  came into force. Therefore, my first  point\r\n\r\nis  that these partners or managers - when I say managers\r\n\r\nand   partners,   I   mean   those   who   manage   the\r\n\r\nbusinesses - must be allowed to stay in this country.  My\r\n\r\nsecond  point  is that those who want to establish  new\r\n\r\nbusinesses for the benefit of Singapore must also  come\r\n\r\nwithin the same category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.55 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nBill,  as  presented  to  us  by  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  makes it quite clear that this is a  measure\r\n\r\nwhich  should receive the support of this House and  of\r\n\r\neveryone  in  Singapore. Although  we  are  politically\r\n\r\nseparated  from  the Federation, we are physically  and\r\n\r\neconomically one, and it would be unthinkable  to  have\r\n\r\ntwo sets of immigration laws - one of the Federation, and\r\n\r\nthe  other  of  Singapore.  This  would  give  rise  to\r\n\r\ndifficulties in going from Singapore to the  Federation\r\n\r\nand from the Federation to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of raising the minimum salary of $500 to\r\n\r\n$1,200,  there  has  been considerable  disturbance  in\r\n\r\nfirms  whose managements are outside Singapore. But  on\r\n\r\nthe  whole, they realise that times have changed.  When\r\n\r\nthe minimum of $500 was fixed many years ago, wages and\r\n\r\nthe cost of living then were very much lower, and it is\r\n\r\nonly  right that the minimum should be raised to $1,200\r\n\r\ntoday,  because  anyone fit to be a manager,  assistant\r\n\r\nmanager  or  partner, should be worth over  a  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars,  if he should be allowed to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  should have the experience, the knowledge  and  the\r\n\r\nknow-how  to  justify that salary before  he  could  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  come and take away a job from one  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  men. One of the greatest difficulties and causes\r\n\r\nof  dissatisfaction in business management, and even in\r\n\r\nthe  public services, has been the importation of  very\r\n\r\njunior  men.  People  who have  just  passed  out  from\r\n\r\ncollege or have received superficial training - young men\r\n\r\nof  just  over  20 years - come to Singapore  and  become\r\n\r\nassistant managers and are placed well over the head of\r\n\r\nthose  who have been working here for years and  years;\r\n\r\nclerks who have worked 20 years or more and who are now\r\n\r\nin the position of chief clerks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to a few years ago, there was not much attempt to\r\n\r\ntrain the local senior staff to bring them to the stage\r\n\r\nwhere  they  could  take  over  the  manager's  or  the\r\n\r\nassistant   manager's  job.  One  can  well   see   the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction that is caused in an office  where  you\r\n\r\nhave a junior man suddenly thrown over you and you have\r\n\r\ngot  to  take  his directions when you  know  that  his\r\n\r\ndirections  are  not correct as he does  not  know  the\r\n\r\nlocal conditions, but you still have to serve him. That\r\n\r\nsurely  lowers the morale of the whole office. I  think\r\n\r\nit is only right that posts which carry up to $1,200 in\r\n\r\npay  should be given to local men to encourage them  to\r\n\r\ntake  over all these positions so that they can  become\r\n\r\nmanagers in later years and take part in the running of\r\n\r\nour Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.01 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one\r\n\r\naccepts this Bill as inevitable as one welcomes the\r\n\r\nfact that the Federation and Singapore continue in line\r\n\r\non these measures. The emoluments - I think that is the\r\n\r\nword and I would like the Hon. the Chief Minister to\r\n\r\nconfirm that it is the word \"emoluments - $l,200\" that\r\n\r\nwas used - on the whole may .not be unreasonable in the\r\n\r\ncircumstances which are likely to exist in the future.\r\n\r\nI may not have heard the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\ncorrectly, Sir, but there is the point that was made in\r\n\r\nthe Federation, and stated by the Acting Prime Minister\r\n\r\nthere. He gave an assurance that entry was allowed on\r\n\r\nan employment pass - that the holder, once he got in,\r\n\r\ncould look forward to a continuing career in this\r\n\r\ncountry. I think that is quite an important point,\r\n\r\nbecause if it is necessary to bring someone in, they\r\n\r\nare brought in for a very good reason. To seek for a\r\n\r\nperson, and when you find him, and all that you can say\r\n\r\nto him is, \"You may come in for two years\", may be\r\n\r\ndamaging to the economy of the country, possibly not in\r\n\r\nthe long term, but certainly in the short term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.02 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the\r\n\r\npoint raised by the last speaker, I stated in my speech\r\n\r\non  the  Second  Reading that, in regard to  Employment\r\n\r\nPasses, these will be given and that extensions will be\r\n\r\ngranted  if  the  employers could  produce  a  contract\r\n\r\nguaranteeing that such persons will continue  in  their\r\n\r\nemployment.  Perhaps  the language  used  is  not  very\r\n\r\nclear,  and thus it has caused some doubts in the  mind\r\n\r\nof the hon. Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nAyer,  I  would like to explain something  which  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid has not been properly grasped. Under the present\r\n\r\nlaw,   any   person  who  could  produce   a   contract\r\n\r\nguaranteeing his employment for two years on an  all-in\r\n\r\nemolument of $500 cannot be denied permanent entry into\r\n\r\nSingapore. That definitely is wrong. And the  amendment\r\n\r\nproposed is to see that persons who seek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment in Singapore should only be given Employment\r\n\r\nPasses  and  not permanent residence, and his  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will therefore be tied to the length  of  his\r\n\r\nemployment with his employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of $1,200 that has now been fixed is to\r\n\r\nensure  that  only  persons of senior  status  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  Employment Passes. But I did say  even  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  just  now  that  if the employers  can  make  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  case to the Controller  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  find  local men to do a  particular  job,\r\n\r\nwhich  job  does not require the payment  of  $1,200  a\r\n\r\nmonth,    the    Controller   will   give   sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration to the granting of an Employment Pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Telok Ayer then mentioned the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  foreign capital,  and  that  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  will never be interested in coming  in  unless\r\n\r\nthey  are  allowed to bring in their own  people.  Sir,\r\n\r\nunder  the proposal here, anyone whose entry is in  the\r\n\r\neconomic   interest  of  Singapore  will   be   granted\r\n\r\npermanent stay, and along with him will be his  family,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  his wife and children up to the  age  of  18\r\n\r\nyears. That is a great encouragement to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the senior jobs as managers and\r\n\r\naccountants, they will be allowed Employment Passes  if\r\n\r\nthey  can produce a contract showing that these  people\r\n\r\nare  being  employed for a certain period at a  certain\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit more difficult, Sir, in regard to\r\n\r\npartners. Now, partners can be sleeping partners.  They\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  interested  in  the  management  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness. But just by reason of the fact that they  are\r\n\r\npartners  and  that they should be allowed  entry  into\r\n\r\nSingapore is, I submit, not in the best interest of the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore.  If before  a  new  venture  is\r\n\r\nstarted  they  are partners, they will, of  course,  be\r\n\r\nallowed  in,  but not for already established  business\r\n\r\nwhich  desires  to  bring  in their  friends  or  their\r\n\r\nrelatives, by just transferring some shares to  someone\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore, and then claiming that that  person\r\n\r\nshould have a right of entry by reason of the fact that\r\n\r\nhe  owns some shares in that business.

It\r\n\r\ndoes not play favourites with one side or the other. If\r\n\r\nanyone  indulges  in the overthrow of  any  established\r\n\r\ngovernment by violence or, according to the words here,\r\n\r\nSir,  \"by force or violence\", such a one should not  be\r\n\r\nallowed entry into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir, but I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand what the Chief Minister says.

If it is also proved that Communist China is\r\n\r\nan  established  Government, then  Formosa  is  against\r\n\r\nCommunist  China. Then Formosans should not be  allowed\r\n\r\nentry  into  Singapore. America  is  against  Communist\r\n\r\nChina.  Therefore the Americans should not  be  allowed\r\n\r\nentry  into  Singapore.  You must  delete  \"established\r\n\r\ngovernment\".  You say: \"Ah, we must not interfere  with\r\n\r\npolitical   intentions.\"  If   America   went   against\r\n\r\nCommunist China, we must declare that Singapore  should\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with them. But when you say:  \"When\r\n\r\nany government goes against an established government\",\r\n\r\nthen  it  is admitted that Formosa is against Communist\r\n\r\nChina,  and America is against Communist China  because\r\n\r\nCommunist China is an established Government,  and  you\r\n\r\ntreat  those persons as prohibited persons. There  must\r\n\r\nbe  some proper explanation.

This  calls  for  the  necessity  for   the\r\n\r\nimposition  of sterner measures to ensure the  complete\r\n\r\neradication of this evil. The proposed amendments  have\r\n\r\nbeen framed with a view to closing certain loopholes in\r\n\r\nthe  law  made  apparent in the light of its  practical\r\n\r\nworking. They provide for more stringent action against\r\n\r\nopium  smugglers, dealers and vendors, and  also  ship-owners  and  masters, when responsible ships'  officers\r\n\r\nare  shown to have been negligent in supervision,  with\r\n\r\nthe  result  that  their  vessels  are  used  for  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 gives statutory definitions of \"pipe\" and\r\n\r\n\"utensil\", used in opium smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 are drafted to combat difficulties\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been encountered in the interpretation  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"possession\". Section 6 of the Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nexpanded by the addition of the word \"Keeps\". Section 9\r\n\r\n(1)  (b)  is  similarly expanded by  adding  the  words\r\n\r\n\"custody or control\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 10 of the Ordinance by\r\n\r\nsubstituting  the words \"is found in or  escaping  from\r\n\r\nany  place\" for the words \"frequents any place\", as  it\r\n\r\nis  found  to be extremely difficult to prove frequency\r\n\r\nof  visits  to  places where opium is consumed.

Clause 10, in addition, also\r\n\r\nenables  these officers to board aircraft  as  well  as\r\n\r\nships in the course of their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12, which amends section 28, makes an attempt\r\n\r\nto  dispose of case property as much an offence as  the\r\n\r\nactual destruction of such property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 is intended to prevent the removal of any\r\n\r\nconveyance  which  has been used for the  transport  of\r\n\r\ndangerous drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 brings section 30 of the Ordinance into\r\n\r\nline  with  similar provisions relating to seizure  and\r\n\r\nforfeiture contained in the Customs Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has also been taken in clause 15 to\r\n\r\nclarify  the  meaning of section  35  (2)  (b)  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 strengthens the presumptions under section\r\n\r\n37 (c) of the Ordinance.

Paragraph  (b)  of\r\n\r\nthis  clause extends the presumption in section 37  (d)\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance to cases where a person has custody or\r\n\r\ncontrol  of anything containing a dangerous  drug,  and\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  has been taken in  paragraph  (d)  to\r\n\r\nremove  an  ambiguity  under  section  37  (h)  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 is designed to make the owners of premises\r\n\r\nexercise greater responsibility and to prevent the rise\r\n\r\nof   their   property   for  purposes   involving   the\r\n\r\nadministration  or  smoking  of  dangerous  drugs.   It\r\n\r\nempowers  the police to take action against owners  and\r\n\r\nmagistrates  to  order the demolition  of  obstructions\r\n\r\nerected  to  faciliate the administration of  dangerous\r\n\r\ndrugs or smoking or other consumption of such drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 amends section 38 (1) of the Ordinance, to\r\n\r\nmake  owners and masters of vessels jointly liable  for\r\n\r\nthe   negligence  of  any  responsible  officer,  which\r\n\r\nresults  in the vessel being used for the smuggling  of\r\n\r\ndangerous  drugs.

Members are aware, the Minor Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance  seeks to control a variety of  misdemeanours\r\n\r\nand  nuisances  of  a minor character.  Experience  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  the  provisions  of  this  Ordinance   are\r\n\r\ninadequate to control certain of these offences and the\r\n\r\npresent Bill is designed to remedy that position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the amending Bill relates to Part II of\r\n\r\nthe  principal  Ordinance which deals  with  rules  and\r\n\r\norders  as  to assemblies, processions, etc. It  amends\r\n\r\nthe  definition  of  a \"public place\"  to  include  any\r\n\r\nbuilding or other place to which the public or a  class\r\n\r\nof  the  public  have for the time  being  access.  The\r\n\r\namendment  is  required because at the present  time  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  held  in  a building or in an  enclosed  space\r\n\r\ncannot  be  defined as a public meeting even though  it\r\n\r\nmay in fact be so by virtue of the fact that the public\r\n\r\nor  a  class  of  the  public have access  thereto.  In\r\n\r\nconsequence, the police at present have no authority to\r\n\r\nrequire  a permit for a public meeting which  is  being\r\n\r\nheld   in   a  building  or  an  enclosed  space.   The\r\n\r\nopportunity is also taken to bring the definition of  a\r\n\r\n\"place of public resort\" into line with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe    definition   now   contained   in   the    Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments   Ordinance,  which  has   replaced   the\r\n\r\nTheatres Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill makes provision for the control\r\n\r\nof  catapults and similar weapons to which at present no\r\n\r\nprovision exists. Catapults are in common use  by  small\r\n\r\nboys,  and  while it is not intended to  interfere  with\r\n\r\nthis  pastime,  provision  must  be  made  against   the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of such weapons in circumstances which  might\r\n\r\nbring injury to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 12 of the\r\n\r\nmain  Ordinance  which deals with offences  relating  to\r\n\r\nanimals.  It  is at present a common practice  with  the\r\n\r\nowners  of  animals to tether them on  private  land  or\r\n\r\nCrown  land without the permission of the owner  of  the\r\n\r\nland  or the Crown. It is desired to put an end to  this\r\n\r\npractice.  The second subsection of this clause  of  the\r\n\r\namending  Bill is designed to ensure that herdsmen  keep\r\n\r\ntheir animals under proper control when driving them  on\r\n\r\nthe highway. There have been many instances of accidents\r\n\r\noccurring  on  public highways as a  result  of  animals\r\n\r\nbeing  permitted to wander when supposedly  under  their\r\n\r\nherdsmen's    charge.    This   new    section    places\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the control of the animals firmly  on\r\n\r\nthe herdsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first subsection of clause 5 of the Bill relates\r\n\r\nto  the  obstruction of public roads and  footways.  The\r\n\r\nexisting  section  makes reference to \"goods\"  but  this\r\n\r\nword  has no proper grammatical definition, whereas  the\r\n\r\nword  \"article\" can be clearly defined. The use  of  the\r\n\r\nword  \"goods\" in the existing Ordinance has in the  past\r\n\r\nresulted  in  ambiguity  and, in consequence,  cases  of\r\n\r\nobstruction have been dismissed by the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second subsection of this clause makes it an\r\n\r\noffence to cause obstruction on a public road by  carts,\r\n\r\nwheelbarrows,  bicycles,  tricycles  or  other  vehicles\r\n\r\nwhich  can  effectively cause obstruction. The  existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance makes no provision for this offence, which has\r\n\r\nbeen shown in the past to occasion considerable nuisance\r\n\r\nto the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third subsection of this clause makes it an\r\n\r\noffence  to place any projection over or along a  public\r\n\r\nroad  at a height of less than 8 feet. It has been found\r\n\r\nthat  owners of property abutting on the public  highway\r\n\r\nhave  erected  such projections which  are  not  only  a\r\n\r\nnuisance but may be dangerous to passers-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 6 of the Bill is designed to increase\r\n\r\nthe  maximum fine for wilful trespass from the  existing\r\n\r\nfigure  of $20 to a sum of $100, which is considered  to\r\n\r\nbe  more in keeping with the present scale of fines  for\r\n\r\nminor offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.-[Mr David].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MIDWIVES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.46 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nessential  that midwives be experts in that field,  both\r\n\r\nfor  the  safeguarding of the lives of  the  mother  and\r\n\r\nchild and for maintaining their professional standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Midwives Board, constituted under the Midwives\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  find it therefore necessary to  redraft  the\r\n\r\nrules  which  govern  the  registration,  training   and\r\n\r\nsupervision  of  midwives. In order  that  this  may  be\r\n\r\neffected, the Midwives (Amendment) Bill makes  a  number\r\n\r\nof amendments to the Midwives Ordinance, Cap. 192, so as\r\n\r\nto give the Board powers to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity is taken to make the amendments so\r\n\r\nthat reference to Christmas Island, the Cocos or Keeling\r\n\r\nIslands,  is omitted and to correct the designations  of\r\n\r\nthe members of the Board so as to bring them up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Midwives\r\n\r\nOrdinance to remove the word \"Central\" in the  title  of\r\n\r\nthe  Midwives Board, as the Midwives Ordinance will only\r\n\r\napply  to  Singapore,  and to amend  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"local  supervising authority\" to bring it in line  with\r\n\r\nthe reorganisation of local government in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill repeals and reenacts section 6 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  in  order  to define  more  clearly  the\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  entitled to be registered  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 7, to correct the\r\n\r\ndesignations  of the persons who are to  constitute  the\r\n\r\nBoard.

Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar   will\r\n\r\nmisunderstand that - but this reference to  any  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Rural Board area has become  unnecessary\r\n\r\nbecause,  by clause 3, the local supervising  authority\r\n\r\nis now being changed. At present the law has a somewhat\r\n\r\ncomplicated provision for providing that in  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard  area  the officer performing the duties  of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Health Officer and in any other area the officer\r\n\r\nperforming the duties of Health Officer in that area is\r\n\r\nby  definition, the local supervising authority. Now we\r\n\r\nare changing that and simplifying it, so that the local\r\n\r\nsupervising authority within the City remains the  City\r\n\r\nHealth  Officer;  but  outside  the  City  it  is   the\r\n\r\nAssistant Director\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Medical Services (Health) - just one person.

I observe in the present Ordinance that\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  the general provision now sought  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the additions referred to on page 4  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  as  paragraphs (k) and (l), although there  is  in\r\n\r\nsection 8 power to frame various rules and to do various\r\n\r\nacts - the two things are separated. There is power to  do\r\n\r\nacts  reasonably necessary for the carrying out  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance, and then there is  specific\r\n\r\npower to frame rules, but those powers are limited,  and\r\n\r\nthe  addition  of the new paragraphs (k)  and  (l)  will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  make  for  more  freedom.  I  believe   the\r\n\r\nMidwives  Board has, in the past, found that its  powers\r\n\r\nhave  been too closely circumscribed, and it is for that\r\n\r\nreason  that  they are now seeking to have their  powers\r\n\r\nwidened.

This is a new provision. The reason\r\n\r\nfor  its  introduction is that in  past  elections  we\r\n\r\nfound that polling stations were invariably obstructed\r\n\r\nby  motor  vehicles  parked in front  of  the  polling\r\n\r\nstation.  Although we shall not be having  competition\r\n\r\nto    provide   free   transport   for   the   voters,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, it is quite possible that people who own\r\n\r\ncars  will  still  park  their  cars  outside  polling\r\n\r\nstations,  thus  causing  general  congestion.  I  had\r\n\r\noriginally  drafted the amendment by way of  reference\r\n\r\nto the Road Traffic Rules so that to park a motor car\r\n\r\nwithin 100 yards of the polling station, shall  be  an\r\n\r\noffence within the Road Traffic Rules, like parking  a\r\n\r\nmotor  car  within so many feet of a fire hydrant,  so\r\n\r\nmany feet of a bus stop, or so many feet of the corner\r\n\r\nof  a  street.  But  I am told by the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nthat  he  considered the Road Traffic Rules  a  highly\r\n\r\ninelegant  piece  of  subsidiary legislation,  and  he\r\n\r\nintends, in the not too distant future, to dispose  of\r\n\r\nit.  That being the case, he has helped to draft  this\r\n\r\nvery  comprehensive, elaborate, but I am sure  equally\r\n\r\neffective,  series of clauses to make it  possible  to\r\n\r\nimpose  a  penalty  if  anybody  should  breach   this\r\n\r\nprovision. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, may I ask this question? It\r\n\r\nappears  that  if one parks within 99\u00bd  yards  from  a\r\n\r\npolling station, one creates an offence for which one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  arrested.

It  is,  I  think,\r\n\r\nundesirable  that  we should seek  to  amend  laws  by\r\n\r\nreferences made in other pieces of legislation. When a\r\n\r\npiece  of  legislation is unsatisfactory  or  requires\r\n\r\namplification   or  an  amendment,   that   piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation should ordinarily be itself amended. It is\r\n\r\nonly  confusing  to  do it by, as it  were,  a  cross-reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I wish only to say one thing in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the  amendment.  It  does  impose  a\r\n\r\nfurther  duty on the police force. In connection  with\r\n\r\nthe  remarks made by Sir Ewen Fergusson, I would  wish\r\n\r\nto  reiterate what I said in moving the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill, that the success or otherwise of  these\r\n\r\nprovisions  which are being made will  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  observance  by  the  people  concerned.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  expect the police force who have only  limited\r\n\r\nnumbers  to  cover all their duties and to  cope  with\r\n\r\nvery   substantial  or  numerous  breaches  of   these\r\n\r\ndifferent  provisions which we are making  under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Regarding the point raised by Sir\r\n\r\nEwen  Fergusson, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do  not  see  any\r\n\r\ndifficulty arising on that score. It is a common sight\r\n\r\nalong  any street to find a \"No Parking\" sign  with  a\r\n\r\nblue background, a white \"P\", and a red line across it\r\n\r\nmeaning  no parking, and an arrow indicating \"Starting\r\n\r\nfrom  this  point\". I can trust the  police  force  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  accurately and fairly. All that  they  really\r\n\r\nneed  do  is  to  take two such posts and  place  them\r\n\r\noutside a polling station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

But\r\n\r\nin  the meantime, there is no reason why we should not\r\n\r\naccept  this  amendment specially for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nthis election. As such, I support this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Chief Secretary says that it will be an\r\n\r\nadditional  duty on the police force. One  should  not\r\n\r\nforget that an election is held once in four years and\r\n\r\nthis will be the most important election so far. Every\r\n\r\nprecaution  should be taken to see that no one  abuses\r\n\r\nthe  loopholes that are left, and the purpose of  this\r\n\r\namendment is to plug those loopholes in the  cases  of\r\n\r\nmotorists  who  possibly  and  intentionally  try   to\r\n\r\nobstruct roads and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, I am not saying that\r\n\r\nthis  amendment is no good. But what I want is a point\r\n\r\nof  clarification.  I do believe that  there  are  car\r\n\r\nowners  who  do live within a radius of  100  miles  -\r\n\r\n[Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so sorry. It is 100 yards. If such owners do\r\n\r\nnormally park their cars within 100 yards of a polling\r\n\r\nstation, it may be just in front of their houses.  Are\r\n\r\nwe to prohibit, or are the police or some authority to\r\n\r\nsee  that  they should take their cars away  from  the\r\n\r\nfrontage  of their houses? If this is so, then  should\r\n\r\nit  be covered in this amendment or not? And if it  is\r\n\r\nnot  covered in this amendment, I think it is  subject\r\n\r\nto  abuse, because car owners can claim that they have\r\n\r\nthe right in that they do pay road taxes to have their\r\n\r\ncars  parked  in front of their houses. I  would  like\r\n\r\nthis to be clarified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was of the fond opinion that when\r\n\r\nI dealt with the Chief Minister, I dealt with a person\r\n\r\nwho  had the necessary credentials to speak on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  S.P.A.

In fact,  it\r\n\r\nis true, Sir, that it is very difficult for leaders of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to believe that there are sincere  people\r\n\r\nwho  help  those in distress out of their  own  heart,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  seeking political credit  for  everything\r\n\r\nthat they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they say the fact that we are going to build\r\n\r\nhouses  in three months' time is a political stunt  on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the S.P.A.

And,  \"If  your\r\n\r\nhouses get burnt, well, you have to look out! You have\r\n\r\na  very rotten Government which does not have sympathy\r\n\r\nfor your sufferings.\" I believe, Sir, even on the very\r\n\r\nday  of the fire, while it was still raging, there was\r\n\r\na  P.A.P. propaganda machine out there saying that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was the cause of the fire!

Ten years have I served the people,\r\n\r\nand  I  will  keep  on serving clean,  without  having\r\n\r\nanything to do with politics.

No election office is prohibited, and it  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that the practice in the past, of  using  or\r\n\r\nrequiring  election  offices as near  as  possible  to\r\n\r\npolling  stations, would spread like  a  rash  if  the\r\n\r\npurpose  is  to  try  to overcome  or  circumvent  the\r\n\r\nprovision   against   canvassing   on   polling   day.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  move  this  amendment  to  prevent  any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelection office from being used within 200 yards of  a\r\n\r\npolling  station. The present provision  without  this\r\n\r\namendment  only  prohibits  canvassing,  which   means\r\n\r\nactivity  in a public place.

Sir,   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate him on the perspicacity with which he has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  discern  the  other  loopholes  in  my\r\n\r\namendment. But I would like to remind him that  it  is\r\n\r\nnormal  during polling day to have what are  known  as\r\n\r\npolling  agents  and  counting  agents - polling  agents\r\n\r\nrepresenting a candidate, one in each place where  the\r\n\r\nvotes  are  cast. If you do not have any  place  where\r\n\r\nyour counting agents can foregather, and then disperse\r\n\r\nto  the  various  polling stations, how  then  do  you\r\n\r\norganise your work on polling day? I am obliged to him\r\n\r\nfor  the simplicity with which he has swept aside  all\r\n\r\nnecessity for any activity whatsoever on polling  day.\r\n\r\nBut I must remind him that candidates are entitled  as\r\n\r\nof  right  to  have a polling agent at each  place  of\r\n\r\npolling,  and  a  counting  agent  at  the  place   of\r\n\r\ncounting. These people have to be organised in shifts.\r\n\r\nThey  go  in  the  morning - some are  replaced  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoon.  If  there  is  no  place  where  they  can\r\n\r\nforegather,   then   how  does   one   conduct   these\r\n\r\nactivities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I just explain the reason why the\r\n\r\namendment  was  drafted in this way?  It  was  because\r\n\r\nevery  other conceivable type of election activity  on\r\n\r\npolling   day  has  been  catered  for  and   properly\r\n\r\ncircumscribed,  except a candidate's election  office.\r\n\r\nAnd we know from past experience that if an election\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffice is near a polling station, the chances are that\r\n\r\nit will be abused. It will be used, not as an election\r\n\r\noffice where the organisational operation - the backroom\r\n\r\nwork - of the election is done, but it will also  become\r\n\r\na centre from which a certain amount of canvassing can\r\n\r\ntake place, because voters would pass by on their  way\r\n\r\nto the polling station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not originally phrase my amendment to include\r\n\r\n\"within  a  radius of two hundred yards\". I originally\r\n\r\nphrased  my  amendment  to read  \"within  two  hundred\r\n\r\nyards\", because I did not consider the back street  of\r\n\r\na  polling  station to be of sufficient importance  to\r\n\r\nwarrant   its  exclusion.  I  think  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown does not really know how much embarrassment\r\n\r\nhe  is causing his Government. This draft which he now\r\n\r\nsees  on  the  Order Paper is, in fact,  the  Attorney\r\n\r\nGeneral's improvement on my draft. Since he wanted  it\r\n\r\nto  read  \"within  a radius of two hundred  yards\",  I\r\n\r\nagreed.  Even  though we will have  only  one  further\r\n\r\nsitting    when   we   have   to   deal    with    the\r\n\r\nGovernment - Members  of  the Opposition  will  be  well\r\n\r\nadvised to circularise individually all Members on the\r\n\r\nGovernment side to get their respective views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  says  that  he  is  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment;  but  I,  as  an elected  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  have no right at all to raise any  question\r\n\r\nor  to  move an amendment to an amendment.  I,  as  an\r\n\r\nelected representative of the people, have no right at\r\n\r\nall  to voice the views that I have gathered from  the\r\n\r\npeople.

I  again  emphasise, Sir,  with  all  his  legal\r\n\r\ntraining  from  the  Colonial  Office  which  he   had\r\n\r\ncondemned,  he now comes and admits that  he  has  not\r\n\r\nframed  the  amendment in such a way as he  originally\r\n\r\nshould  have  done  so. I move this amendment  to  his\r\n\r\namendment  because it came into my  mind,  during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  my  interviewing the  electorate  and  the\r\n\r\npublic,  that  if his amendment were to  be  accepted,\r\n\r\nthen it would be subject to abuse by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

From what I find on  the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  the  operation  of  public   passenger-transport service, there are two kinds of law - one  for\r\n\r\nthe S.T.C. and one for the Chinese bus companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to April 1956, the law where it controls the\r\n\r\npublic  passenger transport service was  divided  into\r\n\r\ntwo  parts,  as  I have just mentioned. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Ordinance, which controls buses operated  by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Traction Company; and another one, which\r\n\r\nis section 326 of the Municipal Ordinance at that time\r\n\r\nand  the  Hackney  Carriage by-laws  made  after  this\r\n\r\nsection  326 of the Municipal Ordinance, controls  the\r\n\r\nChinese bus companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After April 1956, the Government thought it best that\r\n\r\nthere   should  be  a  licensing  authority   and   it\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  new  law, which is called  the  Omnibus\r\n\r\nLicensing Authority Ordinance, to control the  Chinese\r\n\r\nbus  companies. Under this legislation, three  members\r\n\r\nwere appointed to this authority. One is the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Ministry of Communications and Works,\r\n\r\nwho  was  made Chairman of the authority. Another  one\r\n\r\nwas  the  Chairman of the Rural Board, and  the  third\r\n\r\nmember was the then President of the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the new City Council that has\r\n\r\ncome  into  being,  neither the Mayor  nor  the  Chief\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officer of the City Council  could  sit\r\n\r\non  this  authority,  because at the  time  when  this\r\n\r\nauthority  was introduced it was made clear that  only\r\n\r\nmembers  of the civil service could sit as members  of\r\n\r\nthis   authority.  The  Mayor,  who  is   an   elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative,  cannot sit on this authority.  So  is\r\n\r\nthe  case  with the Chief Administrative  Officer  who\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be  an employee of the City  Council.  So\r\n\r\nafter  1957  or  1958  this  authority  has  only  two\r\n\r\nmembers - one,  the Permanent Secretary to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Communications  and  Works,  and  the  other,  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this authority was introduced, I was told\r\n\r\nthat it was at the initiative of the then Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Works. It was he  who  had  bright\r\n\r\nideas  of  alleged corruption in the City Council  and\r\n\r\nthat  it would be better to set up a new authority  to\r\n\r\ncontrol   the   public  passenger-transport   service,\r\n\r\nbecause he felt that even if more members sit  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard  it would not serve any purpose. It was  subject\r\n\r\nto  corruption. That was his way of thinking. I cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  how he could make it this way. When  there\r\n\r\nare six, seven or eight persons to decide an issue - and\r\n\r\nit  is so difficult to canvass or bribe all of them to\r\n\r\ncome  to  a definite conclusion - there are allegations\r\n\r\nof  corruption!  Now,  today  with  only  two  members\r\n\r\nsitting  on that authority, there is no corruption  at\r\n\r\nall.  I  am  not suggesting that the members  of  this\r\n\r\nauthority are corrupted. But I am trying to point  out\r\n\r\nto the then Minister for Communications and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks,  who  sits  right behind me, that  his  way  of\r\n\r\nthinking   about  corruption  is  entirely  from   the\r\n\r\npractical side of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this new licensing\r\n\r\nauthority, the Singapore Traction Company comes  under\r\n\r\nthe  old law of the Singapore Traction Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nthese  Chinese  bus  companies  come  under  this  new\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which  also includes the Municipal  Hackney\r\n\r\nCarriage  By-Laws. Under these two laws, I find  there\r\n\r\nis a lot of disparity in treatment. I will now come to\r\n\r\nthe  different types of disparities. The first is  the\r\n\r\nmonopoly  given to the S.T.C. The S.T.C. is  given  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly under a sort of charter and this charter  was\r\n\r\nextended by the City Council for another seven  years,\r\n\r\nbecause in 1956 the City Council was not able  to  buy\r\n\r\nup the S.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monopoly gives them special rights to run a\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of routes, they are  covered  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction  Ordinance,  Section  3   of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  gives the different routes that the  S.T.C.\r\n\r\nwere allowed to operate:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telok Blangah Road, Keppel Road, Anson Road, Telok\r\n\r\nAyer  Street,  Cecil Street, Collyer  Quay,  Fullerton\r\n\r\nRoad,  Anderson Bridge and High Street,  Hill  Street,\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley  Road,  Tank Road, Tanjong  Pagar  Road,\r\n\r\nSouth  Bridge  Road, North Bridge Road, Jalan  Sultan,\r\n\r\nVictoria Street, Kallang Road and Geylang Road (Part),\r\n\r\nGeylang  Road  (Part), Bras Basah Road, Prinsep  Road,\r\n\r\nSelegie  Road, Serangoon Road, Upper Serangoon   Road,\r\n\r\nLavender Street, McKenzie Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And list \"b\" which was included later:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper Serangoon Road, Geylang Road, Victoria Street,\r\n\r\nHill Street, New Bridge Road,\r\n\r\nBukit Timah Road, Rochore Canal Road, Rochore Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the monopoly that has been given to the\r\n\r\nS.T.C.  It is more or less a statutory right that  the\r\n\r\nomnibuses  or the buses operated by the S.T.C. should\r\n\r\nrun  according to these routes. If they want to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  new  routes, apart from what is in the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthey will have to apply to the proper authorities. The\r\n\r\nproper  authority  are the City Council  where  it  is\r\n\r\nwithin  the City radius, and the Rural Board where  it\r\n\r\nis  outside  the  City limits it  should  now  be  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that they are only confined to the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. They are allowed to operate only within the\r\n\r\nroutes I have mentioned. And if they are to apply  for\r\n\r\nany route outside that limit, they will have to submit\r\n\r\nplans  to the proper authorities, showing the way  how\r\n\r\nthey are going to run it and the reasons why they  are\r\n\r\ngoing to run it. I will read the interpretation of the\r\n\r\nword \"Authority\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the expression \"the Authority\" means, in the case of\r\n\r\nthat  portion  of  the  Island of  Singapore  situated\r\n\r\nwithin City limits, the City Council and, in the  case\r\n\r\nof  any  other  part of the said Island, the  District\r\n\r\nCouncil;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the law which I have found recently is\r\n\r\nnot in the least respected by this authority, because,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  mentioned, this authority  has  only  two\r\n\r\nmembers  sitting on it. You can now find S.T.C. buses\r\n\r\npenetrating into every other street not listed in  the\r\n\r\nlaw. Applications are made and if the authority thinks\r\n\r\nfit  to give it to the S.T.C., it just says \"Yes\"  and\r\n\r\nit  goes  ahead without reference to the City Council.\r\n\r\nWhy  are  the  applications not referred to  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil or to the District Council?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote a case where representations were made to me\r\n\r\nby  the  Queenstown Community Centre and  the  Redhill\r\n\r\nCommunity   Centre.  There  are  many   thousands   of\r\n\r\nresidents    in    these   two   localities - Alexandra,\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and Redhill kampongs. They  come  down  to\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar or to town either for work or any  kind\r\n\r\nof  business. There is no direct service at  all  from\r\n\r\nQueenstown  or Redhill to Tanjong Pagar,  which  means\r\n\r\nthat  all  the residents within these two  areas  will\r\n\r\nhave to take two or three different buses by different\r\n\r\nroutes to come down to Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Sir, there are many school children\r\n\r\nwho  attend the Fairfield Girls' School, which is near\r\n\r\nCantonment  Road. These school children,  aged  seven,\r\n\r\neight  or nine, will also have to travel two or  three\r\n\r\ndifferent routes to get to their school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for a bus service was made to the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  about  two  years  ago.  At  that  time   the\r\n\r\nLicensing Authority had not taken over, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity  Council took all the trouble and spent money  to\r\n\r\nwiden Cantonment Road, so that it could take the heavy\r\n\r\nload  of  these  omnibuses.  Cantonment  Road  is  now\r\n\r\nwidened  and  it  can take omnibuses.  But  when  that\r\n\r\napplication  was  referred to the Licensing  Authority\r\n\r\nafter it has taken over, it was turned down. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow why should it be turned down. If that application\r\n\r\nhad  been approved, it would not have caused  so  much\r\n\r\ntrouble to the bus company that is running that route.\r\n\r\nIt  would only necessitate a very slight deviation  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing  route  of  the  bus  company  that   is\r\n\r\noperating  in  that area. Why then,  Sir,  should  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of  Queenstown and Redhill  suffer  because\r\n\r\nthis  Licensing  Authority did  not  look  into  their\r\n\r\nplight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, as I have said, the authority\r\n\r\nhas  allowed  the S.T.C. buses to penetrate  into  the\r\n\r\nChinese  bus  companies' areas. Why  should  there  be\r\n\r\ndisparity  and  discrimination, Sir?  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\neither  due  to the ignorance or inefficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers of that authority who do not look at things in\r\n\r\nthe  right way. If the members of that authority claim\r\n\r\nthat they are neither ignorant nor inefficient, then I\r\n\r\nsay  it is discrimination of treatment. Because it  so\r\n\r\nhappens that the S.T.C. is not an Asian company. It is\r\n\r\nmore  or  less  run and managed by the Whites  or  the\r\n\r\nEuropeans. That is the reason why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then Minister at that time was a nominated\r\n\r\nMinister. He was not aware of the trouble, because  he\r\n\r\ndid  not stand for election. He does not know what the\r\n\r\npeople want, and he does not know the troubles of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  members of that authority  also  do  not\r\n\r\nknow. May I say that the then Minister was a white man\r\n\r\nand,  as a white man, certainly I think he was in  his\r\n\r\nmind pro-white. The Singapore Traction Company is more\r\n\r\nor  less  controlled by Europeans and he should  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  pro-white. I wonder whether the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  has given a direction to this authority  that\r\n\r\nwhenever  they  decide on these applications  for  bus\r\n\r\nroutes, they should be pro-white. Because, as far as I\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, section 4 of the Omnibus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nServices  Licensing  Authority  Ordinance  does   give\r\n\r\npowers  to  the Minister to issue a directive  to  the\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may from time to time give to the\r\n\r\nAuthority  such  general directions  not  inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith  the provisions of this Ordinance as he may think\r\n\r\nfit  and  the  Authority shall comply  with  all  such\r\n\r\ndirections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my assumption - the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nalways assumes things - that the then Minister, who was\r\n\r\na  white  man,  would  have given directions  to  this\r\n\r\nauthority  that it should be given to a white  company\r\n\r\nand  not  to any of these Asian companies. If that  is\r\n\r\nthe  directive, Sir, it is now high time that the  new\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  is  an  elected  Minister  and  not  a\r\n\r\nnominated  Minister - he is also an  Asian - changed  that\r\n\r\ndirective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the licence and licence fees, this is\r\n\r\nwhere  the disparity comes in. The S.T.C. do  not  pay\r\n\r\nany  licence fee at all to operate bus routes. It  was\r\n\r\ngiven free of charge to them. You have your buses, you\r\n\r\nrun  on  the routes that have been given to  you.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  bus companies will have to pay $10 every  six\r\n\r\nmonths  for a bus route licence, irrespective  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber of buses that operate on that route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the licence fee of the vehicle itself. The\r\n\r\nS.T.C. enjoy the privilege of paying a sort of royalty\r\n\r\nto  the City Council and the Rural Board - 5 per cent of\r\n\r\nits  gross takings, plus two cents for every  car-mile\r\n\r\nrun  whilst carrying passengers -which means that  they\r\n\r\nonly  pay  5  per cent of the gro ss profits  plus  two\r\n\r\ncents  for  every  car-mile run. This  means  that  an\r\n\r\nS.T.C. vehicle  which  is  stationed  on  the  S.T.C.\r\n\r\npremises, does not pay at all. Only when it  runs  and\r\n\r\ncarries passengers does it pay two cents for every car-mile run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do the Chinese bus companies pay? First, as a\r\n\r\nseating fee of $5 per passenger per month. This  means\r\n\r\nthat it depends upon the size of the vehicle, and  for\r\n\r\nevery passenger the Chinese bus company must pay $5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have a horsepower tax that we normally\r\n\r\npay. We have our vehicles on the roads and the Chinese\r\n\r\nbus companies must pay the same tax as we pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is what is imposed on the Chinese bus companies.\r\n\r\nThird,  Sir, there is the hackney-carriage fee of  $30\r\n\r\nfor  every  six months. Now, the Chinese bus companies\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  $10  for the use of a route  every  six\r\n\r\nmonths. On top of that $10, they have to pay a hackney-carriage fee of $30 \r\n\r\nevery six months. Just compare the\r\n\r\ndifference in treatment and the fees paid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of fares, Sir. The S.T.C. are\r\n\r\nallowed to charge a minimum of ten cents for the first\r\n\r\nmile and five cents for every subsequent mile. But can\r\n\r\nthe Chinese bus companies start with a minimum fare of\r\n\r\nten  cents for the first mile? No. I am not trying  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the Chinese bus companies should  raise\r\n\r\ntheir  fares to ten cents for the first mile,  because\r\n\r\nit  will  make  things difficult  for  the  travelling\r\n\r\npublic who will have to pay more for their fares. I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the S.T.C. should reduce the  fare  to\r\n\r\nfive cents for the first mile to bring it in line with\r\n\r\nthe Chinese bus companies. The travelling public would\r\n\r\nbenefit  by  this.  Most people who travel  in  public\r\n\r\ntransport  do not travel long distances as car  owners\r\n\r\ndo.  It  is  only  on these short distances  that  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  make a bigger margin of profit.  No  wonder\r\n\r\nthe S.T.C. make a lot of money every year!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to accidents and mechanical defects in\r\n\r\nbuses. Sir, if a bus belonging to a Chinese company is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  an  accident or  if  it  has  mechanical\r\n\r\ndefects,  it  has  to be brought to the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles immediately for a mechanical inspection. Only\r\n\r\nafter  the  mechanical inspection and  after  all  the\r\n\r\ndefects  are attended to can that bus go back  on  the\r\n\r\nroad.  But  the S.T.C. under its charter or under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  enjoy  a privilege. They  have  their  own\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Vehicles to inspect their vehicles. If an\r\n\r\nS.T.C. bus  is involved in an accident or  there  are\r\n\r\nmechanical defects in a vehicle, the S.T.C. repairs it\r\n\r\nin  its own shed. I am even prepared to overlook this,\r\n\r\nbut  why  should  it not be sent to the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  for  inspection after it has been  repaired?\r\n\r\nThere  are  qualified inspectors  who  can  check  the\r\n\r\nvehicle instead of their saying, \"All\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright, you have already repaired your vehicle. You can\r\n\r\nput  it  back on the road.\" The Chinese bus  companies\r\n\r\nmust  send their vehicles to the Registrar of Vehicles\r\n\r\nfor inspection, and if there are any defects, they are\r\n\r\nsent to the workshops for repairs. After that they are\r\n\r\nsent  back  again  to the Registrar  of  Vehicles  for\r\n\r\ninspection  and  if they are certified  fit  for  road\r\n\r\nservice, then only can they go on the road. But in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the  S.T.C. buses, who  is  there  to  check\r\n\r\nwhether they have been repaired or not? The S.T.C. can\r\n\r\nsay,   \"We  have  repaired  this  vehicle  after   the\r\n\r\naccident.\"  There is no inspector to  certify  whether\r\n\r\nthat  is  the case. Their own people pass judgment  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own vehicles. There are many, many more  points\r\n\r\nof  disparity, but it may take me too long to describe\r\n\r\nthem. I have already spoken for about 18 minutes and I\r\n\r\nwant  to  give the Minister a chance to  reply  if  he\r\n\r\nwants to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the new elected and Asian\r\n\r\nMinister - I  congratulate  him  on  being  an   elected\r\n\r\nMinister and I am much obliged to him for the reply he\r\n\r\ngave  me this morning - to consider my suggestion:  one,\r\n\r\nto  put  the S.T.C. on the same footing as the Chinese\r\n\r\nbus companies, or, alternatively, to bring the Chinese\r\n\r\nbus  companies in line with the S.T.C.;  and  two,  to\r\n\r\nreview any directives that may have been issued by the\r\n\r\nformer  Minister for Communications and Works  to  the\r\n\r\nLicensing Authority consisting of only two men who are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be  incorruptible.  There  should  be  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  consisting of about six men. If there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  such directives issued, they should be withdrawn\r\n\r\nand new directives issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not propose, Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\nattempt   to  deal  with  the  lengthy  and  extremely\r\n\r\ninaccurate  remarks  of  the  Member  for  Queenstown.\r\n\r\nAnybody  who  wishes  to inform himself  on  transport\r\n\r\nmatters  should get a copy of the Hawkins'  Commission\r\n\r\nReport  in  which he will find the situation  properly\r\n\r\nlaid  out.  Anybody who is misguided enough to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  guidance  of  the Member for Queenstown  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter will certainly find himself in error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are two points on which I would like\r\n\r\nto  speak.  The  first  is what  appears  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown   that\r\n\r\nforeign  investors  should  be  deprived   of   the\r\n\r\nprotection of the law. His own Party newspaper  has\r\n\r\nbeen quoted in the daily Press - I have not seen the\r\n\r\npaper myself - as threatening that if his Party does\r\n\r\nnot  get elected, there will be a strike of capital\r\n\r\nto be organised so as to strangle Singapore. Yet he\r\n\r\nhimself is proposing in this proposed treatment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Traction Company precisely the  sort\r\n\r\nof  anti-foreign investment line which would be the\r\n\r\nworst possible thing for Singapore. He is proposing\r\n\r\napparently  to  deprive them  unilaterally  of  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  the Singapore Traction  Ordinance.  I\r\n\r\nhave seldom heard a more irresponsible speech and I\r\n\r\nhope  that  it  will be officially  denied  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Front Bench that there is any reason  at\r\n\r\nall  to  support  that. If he  is  suggesting  that\r\n\r\nforeign  investors  should  be  deprived   of   the\r\n\r\nprotection  of the law, I hope that  will  be  made\r\n\r\nquite  clear by the Front Bench, that there  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion of that at all. If it cannot be made quite\r\n\r\nclear, it is a matter where I shall personally feel\r\n\r\nbound  even to sever my long connection  with  this\r\n\r\nside of the House and move across to the other side\r\n\r\nof  the House - if I thought that this Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  adopt  the  line  of  frightening   away\r\n\r\nreasonable  and responsible overseas  investors  in\r\n\r\nthe hope of getting votes for the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which I would like very briefly\r\n\r\nto  deal  with is the allegation or insinuation  by\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member that I am a white man and therefore\r\n\r\nI  have  given pro-white directives to the officers\r\n\r\nin  my  Ministry and to the Members of the  Omnibus\r\n\r\nServices Licensing Authority. I think the time  has\r\n\r\ncome  when we should stop talking about the  colour\r\n\r\nof  people's skins and talk of people according  to\r\n\r\ntheir   citizenship,  whether  they  are  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens or not. I am a Singapore citizen. I have a\r\n\r\nhome in Singapore. I married a Singapore woman.

I have the most sad and pained  feelings\r\n\r\nin  my  heart  when again an hon.  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  can  raise - for what reason I  can  hardly\r\n\r\nguess,  nor  would  you  allow  me  to  guess,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - a racial and a communal issue on  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  is  purely  concerned with  the  profits  of\r\n\r\nChinese bus companies. He referred to the rumour, I\r\n\r\nbelieve, that there was corruption in dealings with\r\n\r\nbus  company matters when they were handled by  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council. Matters of corruption are very  hard\r\n\r\nto  prove  indeed,  but those  who  have  made  any\r\n\r\nexamination  of the facts, either of the  furniture\r\n\r\nin people's houses or of the new cars that appeared\r\n\r\nin  front of people's houses when there was  a  new\r\n\r\nroute  approved, or of the presence of other goods,\r\n\r\nhave  also studied the irrationality and the  folly\r\n\r\nof the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir.

Having had  the  privilege  of\r\n\r\nlooking  into the whole aspect of the traffic  problem\r\n\r\nand  the  enormous amount of work which my predecessor\r\n\r\nhad  to  go  through, I am convinced beyond all  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  there had been no bias in the discharge  of  his\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown is not in full possession\r\n\r\nof  the  facts regarding the membership of the Omnibus\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority. I heard him say that  there  are\r\n\r\nonly  two  members on the Board, namely, the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary to my Ministry and the Chairman of the Rural\r\n\r\nBoard. I must inform him, Sir, that the Board consists\r\n\r\nof three members: the Registrar of Vehicles who is the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  the Board, my Permanent Secretary,  and\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can show that many of the points he raised\r\n\r\nwere  baseless. I do not think I have enough time  now\r\n\r\nat  my  disposal to do so; but may I just inform  this\r\n\r\nHouse that there are two important documents in regard\r\n\r\nto  the passenger transport service which have been in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of hon. Members for a long time? The  first\r\n\r\none  is  the Report of the Commission of Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nthe   Public  Passenger  Transport  System  which  was\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the Government as a clear, comprehensive\r\n\r\nand  authoritative analysis of the grounds for concern\r\n\r\nof  the  state  of  industry in Singapore.  The  other\r\n\r\ndocument is Cmd. Paper No. 48 of 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth  these  two  documents give full details  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplications   of  our  transport  system   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment policy regarding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said this morning that the Government has\r\n\r\nfully  realised  and has come to the  conclusion  that\r\n\r\nthere cannot be proper co-ordination of the service in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest and that the traffic needs of the\r\n\r\narea as a whole cannot be met unless all operators are\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the same licensing system and rules.  The\r\n\r\nactivities  with  regard  to  unifying  the  transport\r\n\r\nsystem  in  Singapore  have  been  undertaken  by   my\r\n\r\npredecessor,  but they were negatived by difficulties.\r\n\r\nWe  have  felt, Sir, that the only step  which  is  of\r\n\r\nparamount  importance to the achievement of a  unified\r\n\r\nbus  transport system is the purchase of the Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company and, as my predecessor has stated  in\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, the stumbling-block to this has been the\r\n\r\nlack of finance. I must say here and now, Sir, that if\r\n\r\nwe  have  the  money, the problem can  be  ironed  out\r\n\r\nfairly  quickly. The other difficulty which faced  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  was the question of the Chinese  bus  owners\r\n\r\nnot  being  able  to  agree among  themselves  on  the\r\n\r\namalgamation  of all Chinese bus companies,  which  we\r\n\r\nthought was the first step to the unification  of  the\r\n\r\nbus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not been able to make the whole thing\r\n\r\nclear  as  there are so many other points which  could\r\n\r\nfurther  clarify the whole matter. I do  not  think  I\r\n\r\nhave  any  more time left, but I would  just  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  one more point and that is the  allegation\r\n\r\nagainst   the   Licensing  Authority.
