For  a  normal  day  in  1972,  about  9,000\r\n\r\npassengers would be passing through the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pilgrimage flights, Singapore Airlines has\r\n\r\nmade  special  provisions  to  begin  checking  in\r\n\r\npassengers as early as three to four hours  before\r\n\r\neach flight, compared to some one to two hours for\r\n\r\nother   flights.

Members  may  recall,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  restructuring of  Teachers'  salary\r\n\r\nscales,  and the revision of salaries  for  Junior\r\n\r\nPolice  Officers, Technical Officers,  Nurses  and\r\n\r\nMidwives  and  daily-rated  employees.   In   this\r\n\r\nStatement, however, my purpose is to consider  the\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions of service of  Division  I,\r\n\r\nespecially    Administrative   and   Professional,\r\n\r\nOfficers  constituting the  top  echelons  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These officers form about 2 per cent only of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Service but make the  most  vital  and\r\n\r\nimportant contribution as they give administrative\r\n\r\nand  professional leadership and direction to  the\r\n\r\nwhole    service.    Their   administrative    and\r\n\r\nprofessional  skills, so valuable  to  Government,\r\n\r\nwould  be  equally useful to the  private  sector,\r\n\r\nwhich  can, and often do attract them by the offer\r\n\r\nof  rewards  well  in excess of  what  the  public\r\n\r\nsector at present pays. It is not expected that we\r\n\r\ncan  completely  prevent  losses  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  even with the revisions we are proposing.\r\n\r\nBut it is essential, if we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot   to  strain  unduly  the  great  loyalty  and\r\n\r\ndedication  to the Service which most of  our  top\r\n\r\ncivil servants have shown, that their salaries and\r\n\r\nconditions of service should he roughly equated to\r\n\r\nthose in the private sector. The Government should\r\n\r\nseek  to  be  regarded, taking the  monetary  with\r\n\r\nother non-financial rewards which are offered,  as\r\n\r\nequally good or even better employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I propose to confine my remarks in this\r\n\r\nStatement to revisions proposed for the Government\r\n\r\nsector,  I  recognise that they  will  be  equally\r\n\r\npertinent  to some employers in the public  sector\r\n\r\nwho  also  employ administrative and  professional\r\n\r\nofficers.  Where  their  qualifications  and   the\r\n\r\nnature of their work are comparable, the terms and\r\n\r\nconditions   of   service  of   their   Government\r\n\r\ncounterparts are relevant. To the extent that such\r\n\r\nStatutory  Boards  and  Universities  depend  upon\r\n\r\nGovernment  financing, my Budget and Establishment\r\n\r\nDivision, in consultation with these public sector\r\n\r\nbodies,  will examine any necessary revisions  for\r\n\r\nsuch  professional and administrative officers  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  may be correlated with  those  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But it is necessary to emphasise  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government revisions may not be  relevant  or\r\n\r\nappropriate to all administrative and professional\r\n\r\nofficers  in the public sector as the  nature  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  such  officers   and   their\r\n\r\nconditions of service may be quite different  from\r\n\r\nthose of the Government officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revisions of salaries have obvious financial\r\n\r\nimplications  which  have  had  to  be   carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  relation to  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nsituation and its ability to pay enhanced salaries\r\n\r\nnot  only to officers in Superscale posts but also\r\n\r\nto  officers  in  the whole of the public  sector.\r\n\r\nPending such consideration, the payment of a  non-pensionable  annual allowance  equivalent  to  one\r\n\r\nmonth's salary (a sort of 13th month payment) as a\r\n\r\nregular  annual  feature was  an  interim  measure\r\n\r\nwhich  has  not, however, rendered the problem  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring  the  top  civil  service  any  less\r\n\r\nurgent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of Singapore's continuing economic\r\n\r\ngrowth, it is now proposed to make revisions  with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1st March, 1973 as in the  Table* (*See Appendix, cols 435-6.)

The\r\n\r\ninadequacy often arises after three to five  years\r\n\r\nwhen there may be difficulty in retaining some  of\r\n\r\nthe  more promising officers who are attracted  to\r\n\r\nseemingly greener pastures in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to find an answer to this problem in\r\n\r\nmore  rapid and more frequent promotions to higher\r\n\r\nsegments  of the salary scale based on  merit  and\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily on vacancies and  these  are  now\r\n\r\nregularly   being  done  by  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission.   For  example,  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission   has  only  this  week   concluded   a\r\n\r\npromotion  exercise in the administrative  service\r\n\r\nin which 11 Assistant Secretaries were promoted to\r\n\r\nthe grade of Principal Assistant Secretary and  16\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Assistants were  promoted  to  the\r\n\r\ngrade  of  Assistant Secretary with an  additional\r\n\r\nthree promoted to Principal Assistant Secretary on\r\n\r\ntrial and seven promoted to Assistant Secretary on\r\n\r\ntrial  for  one  year. In addition to  these  more\r\n\r\nfrequent  promotions for the Division I  Officers,\r\n\r\nit   is   proposed  to  introduce  a   scheme   of\r\n\r\naccelerated increments for merit. This will enable\r\n\r\nus to reward by more than the normal one increment\r\n\r\nannually,  but  subject  to  a  maximum  of   four\r\n\r\nincrements, deserving officers who either are  not\r\n\r\nyet  ready to be promoted to the next grade or for\r\n\r\nother   organisational  reasons   cannot   be   so\r\n\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Merit Increment Scheme has been accepted by\r\n\r\nthe   Public  Service  Commission  and  the  Legal\r\n\r\nService Commission, and will be implemented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis year. The Scheme will then apply not only  to\r\n\r\nTimescale  officers in the Administrative  Service\r\n\r\nbut  also  to professional officers like  doctors,\r\n\r\nlawyers,  architects and engineers. The assessment\r\n\r\nof  the  merit  of individual officers  under  the\r\n\r\nScheme  will  be  carried out by  a  Committee  of\r\n\r\nrelevant   Permanent  Secretaries  who   will   be\r\n\r\nappointed  by, and will make their recommendations\r\n\r\nto  the  Public Service Commission (or  the  Legal\r\n\r\nService   Commission,  as  the   case   may   be).\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, such assessment of merit will  not  be\r\n\r\nan  easy  task  but  the  Committee  of  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries   will   have  access   to   all   the\r\n\r\nconfidential  dossiers  of  the  officers  and   a\r\n\r\nspecially   prepared  report  by   the   Head   of\r\n\r\nDepartment of the officers concerned. This  Scheme\r\n\r\nis  not  a novel one as it has been tried  out  in\r\n\r\nother public services and it has also been adopted\r\n\r\nby some companies in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Upper Timescale Officers, that\r\n\r\nis,  officers on the salary scale $1,700x50-1,850,\r\n\r\nit  is  proposed to revise their salary  scale  to\r\n\r\n$1,700x 100-2,000. There are really two changes to\r\n\r\nthis scale:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) it extends the upper limit from $1,850 to $2,000 and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) it increases the yearly increment from the existing $50 per annum to $100 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Upper Timescale grade is a stepping stone  to\r\n\r\nthe  Superscale  grades and the  present  revision\r\n\r\nbringing  the maximum to $2,000 will  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  Upper Timescale Officers will reach a  higher\r\n\r\nmaximum than the Timescale Officers on the  salary\r\n\r\nscale  $900x50-l,000/1,050x50-l,400/1,450x50-1,850.  A Timescale Officer through the passage  of\r\n\r\ntime only will no longer reach the same salary  as\r\n\r\nan Upper Timescale Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the first of the Superscale\r\n\r\ngrades,   that   is,  Superscale  G.

The  responsibility of these officers  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  a  shade higher than the  Superscale  G\r\n\r\nOfficers. It is proposed to revise their salary to\r\n\r\n$2,750,  an  increase of $730 per month  over  the\r\n\r\npresent salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further up the ladder is Superscale Grade E which\r\n\r\nincludes officers like the Assistant Directors  of\r\n\r\nPublic Works, the Commissioner of Lands and Deputy\r\n\r\nSecretaries  of  Ministries. The salary  of  these\r\n\r\nSuperscale  Grade E Officers will be revised  from\r\n\r\n$2,070 to $3,000, an increase of $930 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next are Superscale D Officers. There are only a\r\n\r\nsmall  number  of officers in this  grade  amongst\r\n\r\nwhom  are  the  Accountant-General,  the  Auditor-General, Deputy Directors of Medical Services, the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Director of Public Works, the Director  of\r\n\r\nCivil  Aviation, the Registrar of the  High  Court\r\n\r\nand  the Senior District Judge. At present,  these\r\n\r\nofficers are drawing a salary of $2,170 and it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to revise their salaries to  $3,500  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  In addition, it is also proposed to  bring\r\n\r\nthis  grade of officers within the scheme  whereby\r\n\r\nthey will be entitled to the use of a car paid for\r\n\r\nby  the  Government but maintained by the officers\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the Superscale C grade. This is\r\n\r\nthe  grade  for most of the Permanent  Secretaries\r\n\r\nand   for  four  other  officers,  the  Solicitor-General,  the Commissioner of Police, the Director\r\n\r\nof  Public  Works and the Commissioner  of  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue.

In  addition, they will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to  the  use  of  a  car  paid  for   by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Special arrangements of  an  official\r\n\r\ncar  with driver maintained by Government are made\r\n\r\nfor  the  Commissioner of Police  because  of  his\r\n\r\nposition as head of a disciplined force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next higher in grade is Superscale B, which\r\n\r\nincludes   other  Permanent  Secretaries,   Puisne\r\n\r\nJudges   and   the  President  of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court. In view of the nature of  their\r\n\r\nduties  and the positions they occupy, the  salary\r\n\r\nof this grade of officers presently at $2,700 will\r\n\r\nbe  revised  to  $5,500 per month.  They  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  also  entitled to the use of  a  car.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  the car that would  be  provided  by\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  Judges will  continue  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nperquisites  such  as a Government  house  at  the\r\n\r\nusual   Government  subsidised  rental  but  fully\r\n\r\nmaintained by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to create an additional grade\r\n\r\ncalled  Superscale B1 to be attached to  the  most\r\n\r\nsenior of the Puisne Judges in recognition of  his\r\n\r\nspecial  position. This salary will he revised  to\r\n\r\n$6,000 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the hierarchy is Super-scale A.\r\n\r\nThere  are only three full-time civil servants  on\r\n\r\nthis  grade  - two Permanent Secretaries  and  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General,  in addition  to  the  Chairman.\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission, and for the purposes of\r\n\r\ngrading  only,  the Honour-able  Speaker  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  It  is  indeed  difficult  to  assess,  in\r\n\r\nmonetary terms, the value of these officers but it\r\n\r\nis now proposed that the salary of these officers,\r\n\r\nwho  are presently at $3,000 per month, be revised\r\n\r\nto  $6,500  per  month. Special  arrangements  are\r\n\r\nintended for the Speaker since he officiates part-time,  but he will continue to be entitled to  the\r\n\r\nofficial residence (with servants) and an official\r\n\r\ncar, as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we have to consider the position of the\r\n\r\nChief Justice. He will be graded as Superscale Al,\r\n\r\nwith  a salary of $7,500. The Chief Justice  will,\r\n\r\nin addition, continue to enjoy all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  terms of office which he presently  enjoys,\r\n\r\nincluding  an  official car  with  driver  and  an\r\n\r\nofficial   residence  maintained   at   Government\r\n\r\nexpense,  together  with  a  number  of  household\r\n\r\nservants to help to upkeep the residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dealt generally with the various\r\n\r\nSuperscale  gradings and the  salaries  and  other\r\n\r\nterms appropriate to each, I should like to say  a\r\n\r\nword about cur medical services officers. Many  of\r\n\r\nthem are in specialist grades, either in the G  or\r\n\r\nE  Superscales. At one time, it was  the  practice\r\n\r\nfor    these   specialists   (both   medical   and\r\n\r\nprofessional) to be allowed to retain part of  the\r\n\r\nconsultation  fees from private patients  or  from\r\n\r\nundertaking   outside   consultancy   work.   This\r\n\r\npractice,  however,  resulted in  malpractices  or\r\n\r\nconduct   unbecoming  to  the   specialist   whose\r\n\r\nattitude towards patients tended to be related  to\r\n\r\ntheir ability to pay fees. Also, essential medical\r\n\r\nspecialities,  such  as pathology  and  radiology,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  possibilities  of  fees  earning  were\r\n\r\ngreatly  inferior, tended to be increasingly  less\r\n\r\nfavoured  for  specialisation by the bright  young\r\n\r\nmedical  officer.  In  1958,  this  practice   was\r\n\r\nabolished   and   replaced  by  fixed   Specialist\r\n\r\nAllowances  for  Superscale  Medical  Officers  at\r\n\r\nvarying rates. These rates were revised in 1969 to\r\n\r\n$100  per  month,  $150 and  $500  per  month  for\r\n\r\nMedical Officer, Senior Registrar and Superscale G\r\n\r\nrespectively, and $750 per month for Superscale  E\r\n\r\nand above. However, over the last two years, there\r\n\r\nhas   been   increasing  pressure  for   the   re-introduction  of  some scheme in which  consultant\r\n\r\nfees would be shared by the consultant specialist.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues in the Cabinet and I do not favour a\r\n\r\nsystem which experience has so clearly shown to be\r\n\r\nreadily  subject to abuses. At the  same  time,  I\r\n\r\nrealise  that  if  we  are  to  retain  our   best\r\n\r\nspecialists, we must recognise the value of  their\r\n\r\ncontributions  in  some  tangible  way.  For  this\r\n\r\npurpose,   we  should  promote  a   few   of   our\r\n\r\noutstanding specialists to Superscale D. This will\r\n\r\nnot  only mean an immediate increase in salary  of\r\n\r\n$1,430  per month for promotion from the E  salary\r\n\r\nto  the  proposed  Superscale D salary,  but  also\r\n\r\ncarry the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperquisite I have already mentioned of a  Mercedes\r\n\r\nBenz  car  provided  as to  its  capital  cost  at\r\n\r\nGovernment expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if need be, I am prepared to agree\r\n\r\nthat  the  fixed Specialist Allowance for  doctors\r\n\r\nshould  be increased beyond the present  limit  of\r\n\r\n$750   up   to  $1,250  per  month  for  specified\r\n\r\nindividual outstanding officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, because of the great interest which has\r\n\r\nbeen  generated,  it would seem  especially  among\r\n\r\ndoctors, it may be appropriate if I refer at  this\r\n\r\nstage  to  the  scheme  for reduced  vacation  and\r\n\r\nmedical  leave  which  has  been  introduced  with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1-1-73  for all Government  Officers\r\n\r\nother than those in the teaching service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants under the previous leave scheme\r\n\r\nwere  eligible for the following rates of vacation\r\n\r\nleave:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nCompleted service    \r\n\r\n in a particular      Days per calendar year\r\n\r\n    Division          \r\n\r\n                      Div   Div    Div   Div\r\n\r\n                       I    II     III   IV\r\n\r\n                       \r\n\r\nLess than 10 years'   33    28     24    21\r\n\r\n    service           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 years' service     39    33     28    24\r\n\r\n    or more\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Because of the generous leave scheme, coupled with\r\n\r\nthe general shortage of staff over the years, many\r\n\r\nofficers  had  not been able to  take  their  full\r\n\r\nleave,   and   as   a  result,  have   accumulated\r\n\r\nconsiderable leave to their credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to vacation leave, civil servants\r\n\r\nunder  the previous regulations were eligible  for\r\n\r\nsick  leave  on  full pay up to 90 days  per  year\r\n\r\nwhether they are hospitalised or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the leave usually allowed by the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, leave eligibility for all  public\r\n\r\nofficers,  regardless  of divisional  status,  has\r\n\r\nbeen revised as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than 10 years' service - 14 working days a\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 years' service or more - 21 working days a\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll   provisions  for  deferred  leave  would   be\r\n\r\nabolished.  However, accumulation of leave  up  to\r\n\r\none  year's  eligibility  may  be  allowed  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried forward to the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical leave on full pay has been revised to 30\r\n\r\ndays  per  year if no hospitalisation is necessary\r\n\r\nbut  may be extended to 60 days if hospitalisation\r\n\r\nis  recommended  by the medical authorities.  This\r\n\r\nrevised   leave  scheme  has  been   accepted   in\r\n\r\nprinciple  by  the  staff unions representing  the\r\n\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To compensate for the reduction in vacation and\r\n\r\nmedical   leave,   the  difference   between   the\r\n\r\nemployee's previous and new leave eligibility will\r\n\r\nbe  commuted  into  pay. The mode  and  the  exact\r\n\r\nformula   of  such  compensation  is   now   under\r\n\r\nexamination with the staff unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should, however, be pointed out that all\r\n\r\nserving  officers  on the permanent  establishment\r\n\r\nhave  an  option to either accept  the  new  leave\r\n\r\nscheme  with  compensatory payment or  retain  the\r\n\r\nprevious leave scheme. Furthermore, this principle\r\n\r\nof  option  will also be extended to new  recruits\r\n\r\ninto the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those officers who consider the reduced\r\n\r\nvacation leave insufficient, I should like to  add\r\n\r\nthat  in future, no-pay leave to make up leave  to\r\n\r\ntheir previous leave eligibility will be liberally\r\n\r\ngranted.  Officers  who feel the  need  for  extra\r\n\r\nleave  will therefore be able to use the  monetary\r\n\r\ncompensation paid in lieu of leave to  offset  the\r\n\r\nloss of pay during such leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to inform members that\r\n\r\napart  from  these salary revisions the Government\r\n\r\nwill  adopt the agreed general guidelines  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council for salary increases  every\r\n\r\nyear.   For  administrative  convenience,  it   is\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention to pay these increases  in\r\n\r\nthe  form of supplementary allowances at the  rate\r\n\r\nrecommended by the National Wages Council. At  the\r\n\r\nend  of  every  four to five years the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  undertake  a full scale revision  of  salary\r\n\r\nscales,   consolidating  in   the   process   such\r\n\r\nsupplementary allowances into the basic salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a revision of salary scales after four to\r\n\r\nfive  years will enable Government to review wages\r\n\r\nand   salaries  in  the  public  sector  and  make\r\n\r\nadjustments to keep broadly in parity with private\r\n\r\nsector wages and salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, our promising young officers can be\r\n\r\ncertain  when  electing for a  Government  career,\r\n\r\nthat in the medium and longer run, they will never\r\n\r\nlose  out  to their contemporaries in the  private\r\n\r\nsector.

There  is  no  comparison  between  the\r\n\r\nsalary  revision for the teachers and this current\r\n\r\nsalary revision for the upper echelon of the civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is similar to that of the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, and that is, whether the Government  is\r\n\r\ncontemplating an immediate salary revision for the\r\n\r\nother  echelons  of  the civil service.  With  the\r\n\r\nbooming   economy  and  an  accelerated  rate   of\r\n\r\nindustrial expansion, attractive job opportunities\r\n\r\nare  thus  increased considerably with the  result\r\n\r\nthat there is a strong competition to attract both\r\n\r\nthe  brains as well as brawns not only within  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector itself but also between the private\r\n\r\nsector  and  the  public sector. This  problem  of\r\n\r\nretaining  and attracting the best in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice is not only confined to the upper echelons\r\n\r\nof  the public service but is also felt throughout\r\n\r\nthe other rungs of the public service hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is whether consideration will be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the need for a revision of salaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  echelons  of the  public  service  not\r\n\r\nmentioned in today's Ministerial Statement, with a\r\n\r\nview  to  ensuring an efficient  and  able  public\r\n\r\nservice  in  the best interests of  the  efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nbooming  economy  and the affluence  that  we  are\r\n\r\nexperiencing  now,  we are faced  with  a  certain\r\n\r\ndegree   of  inflation  at  the  present   moment.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would suggest that rather than go  on\r\n\r\nincreasing  the workers' salary, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance should look into ways and means to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nshould  like to make it clear that this particular\r\n\r\nrevision  of  salaries for the top  echelon  is  a\r\n\r\nrevision  which is intended to maintain the  rapid\r\n\r\nrate  of growth of the Singapore economy.

The  Council will accordingly  be  re-styled  the  \"Presidential  Council  for  Minority\r\n\r\nRights\".  Although Part IVA as a  whole  has  been\r\n\r\nrepealed   and  re-enacted  to  make  for   easier\r\n\r\nreading,  it  is  substantially the  same  as  the\r\n\r\nexisting Part IVA except for the changes  which  I\r\n\r\nshall now mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 81J under clause 2 of the Bill now reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be the particular function of the\r\n\r\nCouncil  to draw attention to any Bill or  to  any\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  legislation if that Bill or subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation  is in the opinion of  the  Council  a\r\n\r\ndifferentiating measure.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Article differs from the present Article  8li\r\n\r\nin  that the words \"or otherwise inconsistent with\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental liberties of the subject\" at  the\r\n\r\nend of that Article have been omitted. This phrase\r\n\r\nhas,  in  fact, been deleted throughout Part  JVA,\r\n\r\nwhile   at   Article   81A   the   definition   of\r\n\r\n\"inconsistent  with the fundamental  liberties  of\r\n\r\nthe  subject\" has also been excised. The  omission\r\n\r\nof  this  phrase  from  the Bill  means  that  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Council for Minority Rights  will  be\r\n\r\nconcerned   only   with   drawing   attention   to\r\n\r\n\"differentiating  measures\"  in  any  legislation,\r\n\r\nprincipal  or subsidiary, that is, measures  which\r\n\r\nare  disadvantageous to persons of any  racial  or\r\n\r\nreligious   community.  Upon   the   coming   into\r\n\r\noperation  of the Act, therefore, it will  not  be\r\n\r\npart  of the Council's functions to draw attention\r\n\r\nto  inconsistencies with the fundamental liberties\r\n\r\nof  the  subject  as set out in  Part  II  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution   of   Malaysia  which   applies   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are being made as the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council itself  over  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  has  indicated that it wishes its principal\r\n\r\nfunction to be the examination of legislation with\r\n\r\na  view  to  ascertaining whether  any  provisions\r\n\r\ntherein  may be discriminatory against  racial  or\r\n\r\nreligious communities. In the annual report of the\r\n\r\nPresidential Council for the twelve months  ending\r\n\r\non   30th  April,  1971,  the  Council  urges   at\r\n\r\nparagraph 9 thereof, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the light of the topics that have been raised\r\n\r\nby  members and discussed during our meetings,  we\r\n\r\nare  of  the view that the Council can best  serve\r\n\r\nthe   multi-racial  multi-religious   peoples   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  if  the Council is required  under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution to devote its principal attention  to\r\n\r\nconsidering   whether   or   not   any    proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation, including subsidiary legislation,  in\r\n\r\nits  opinion  \"is, or is likely in  its  practical\r\n\r\napplication to be, disadvantageous to  persons  of\r\n\r\nany  racial or religious community and not equally\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous   to   persons   of   other   such\r\n\r\ncommunities,   either  directly   by   prejudicing\r\n\r\npersons of that community or indirectly by  giving\r\n\r\nadvantage  to  persons of another  community\".

This  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation was made about 32 years ago. There are\r\n\r\nat present 28 trade unions comprising 16 unions of\r\n\r\nemployers  and  12 unions of employees  which  own\r\n\r\noffice   buildings  on  land  either   leased   or\r\n\r\npurchased by them. None of the land area  held  by\r\n\r\nthem exceeds one acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with enlarged membership and growing\r\n\r\naffluence,  it is anticipated that more  and  more\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  will be able to purchase  or  lease\r\n\r\nland  to  build  their own offices.

At present a vehicle owner needs only  to\r\n\r\npossess a valid insurance policy on the date  when\r\n\r\nthe  licence comes into operation. This can result\r\n\r\nin   the  insurance  policy  expiring  before  the\r\n\r\nvehicle   licence,  giving  rise  to  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhereby  a  vehicle  though properly  licensed  is\r\n\r\nwithout  a  valid  insurance cover.  This  can  go\r\n\r\nundetected during the period of the licence unless\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle is involved in an accident.  The  new\r\n\r\nrequirement  would therefore remove  the  existing\r\n\r\nanomaly  in  respect  of the insurance  cover  for\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another object of the Bill is to give the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Vehicles additional powers to  cancel\r\n\r\nthe  registration of motor vehicles whose licences\r\n\r\nhave  not been renewed for more than three  years,\r\n\r\nor   when   the  vehicles  have  been   destroyed,\r\n\r\npermanently  exported,  or  have  become   totally\r\n\r\nunfit,  or  have exceeded the age limit prescribed\r\n\r\nfor  that  class  or description of  vehicle.

As a result there  are  many\r\n\r\n\"dead\"  vehicles  on  the register.  The  proposed\r\n\r\namendment  will  minimise  the  number  of  \"dead\"\r\n\r\nvehicles that are maintained on the register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to increase the late\r\n\r\npayment fees for renewals made after expiry of the\r\n\r\nvehicle  licence  (road tax). At  present  a  late\r\n\r\npayment  notice  fee of 50 cents  is  charged  for\r\n\r\nrenewals  made  after 10 days  of  expiry  of  the\r\n\r\nlicence.  A  further fee of $5, known  as  warrant\r\n\r\nfee, is levied for renewals made after 20 days  of\r\n\r\nexpiry  of the vehicle licence. This is  far  from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory and has not been effective in getting\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners to renew their licences  promptly.\r\n\r\nIn  conjunction with the new scale of road  taxes,\r\n\r\nit  is proposed to raise the late payment fee. The\r\n\r\nnew  rate  for late payment fees would  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  graduated scale of  road  taxes  and\r\n\r\nwould range from 510 to $50 depending on the class\r\n\r\nand description of vehicles. For private vehicles,\r\n\r\nthe  rate of late payment fees would be determined\r\n\r\nby  the  engine capacity. These late payment  fees\r\n\r\nwould he levied for renewals made after 14 days to\r\n\r\na  month of expiry of licence. Renewals made after\r\n\r\none  month of expiry of licence may be compounded,\r\n\r\nprovided  the  late  payment  fees  are  paid   in\r\n\r\naddition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new\r\n\r\ncategory  of  public service buses  to  be  called\r\n\r\nPrivate  Hire  Buses.

The Central Narcotics Bureau, under  a\r\n\r\nDirector, has been recently created to enforce the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill especially  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nillicit use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, by its geographical position and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   is  now  a  strategic   centre   of\r\n\r\ncommunication  and  international  trade.   Whilst\r\n\r\nwelcoming trade, visitors and tourists, we must at\r\n\r\nthe  same time be constantly on the alert for  the\r\n\r\ntrafficker,  the addict and the hidden consignment\r\n\r\nof controlled drugs. Law enforcement officers must\r\n\r\nbe  adequately empowered to stop, search any ship,\r\n\r\naircraft,  train  or vehicles whenever  there  are\r\n\r\nreasonable  grounds  to  suspect  that  controlled\r\n\r\ndrugs  are  hidden and, if found,  to  seize  such\r\n\r\ndrugs and to detain any person found therein. Such\r\n\r\nvehicle  will  he liable to seizure under  certain\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ill-gotten gains of the drug traffic are\r\n\r\nhuge.  The key men operating behind the scene  are\r\n\r\nruthless and cunning and possess ample funds. They\r\n\r\ndo  their  utmost  to  push their  drugs  through.\r\n\r\nThough  we may not have drug-trafficking and  drug\r\n\r\naddiction to the same degree as, for instance,  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  States, we have here some quite  big-time  traffickers and their pedlars moving  around\r\n\r\nthe Republic selling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  evil goods and corrupting the lives of  all\r\n\r\nthose who succumb to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They and their trade must be stopped. To do this\r\n\r\neffectively, heavy penalties have to  be  provided\r\n\r\nfor   trafficking.   Clause   15   specifies   the\r\n\r\nquantities of controlled drugs which, it found  in\r\n\r\nthe possession of a person unless the contrary  is\r\n\r\nproved,  will be presumed to be in his  possession\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of trafficking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule to the Bill shows the various\r\n\r\npenalties  for offences committed under the  Bill.\r\n\r\nFor  unauthorised traffic in a Class A  controlled\r\n\r\ndrug,  for  example, morphine, opium, heroin,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  sentence is 20 years or $40,000 or  both,\r\n\r\nand ten strokes of the rotan. The heaviest penalty\r\n\r\nwill  apply  to  those convicted  of  unauthorised\r\n\r\ntrafficking  in  a  Class  A  controlled  drug  to\r\n\r\npersons  under  the  age of  18  years.  For  this\r\n\r\noffence  a maximum penalty of 30 years or $50,000\r\n\r\nor  both,  and  15  strokes of the  rotan,  and  a\r\n\r\nminimum penalty of five years or $10,000 or  both,\r\n\r\nand three strokes of the rotan have been provided.\r\n\r\nThe  existing law on dangerous drugs provides  for\r\n\r\nthe  offence  of  trafficking,  but  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndistinction  as regards the age of the  person  to\r\n\r\nwhom  the  drugs are sold. The penalties  for  the\r\n\r\noffence  of  trafficking in the existing  law  are\r\n\r\n$10,000  or  five years, or both. These  penalties\r\n\r\nare obviously totally inadequate as deterrents,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government views the present situation with deep\r\n\r\nconcern.  To  act as an effective  deterrent,  the\r\n\r\npunishment provided for an offence of this  nature\r\n\r\nmust  be  decidedly  heavy.  We  have,  therefore,\r\n\r\nexpressly provided minimum penalties and the rotan\r\n\r\nfor  trafficking. However, we have not gone as far\r\n\r\nas  some  countries which impose the death penalty\r\n\r\nfor drug trafficking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug addiction is a problem increasing in size\r\n\r\ndaily.  What was once smoking opium and  marijuana\r\n\r\n(the  dried plant which is known locally as ganja)\r\n\r\nor  the  consumption  of  opium  pills  amongst  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively   small  group  of  middle-aged   or\r\n\r\nelderly people has developed into the taking of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmethaqualone (known popularly as MX pills) or  the\r\n\r\nsmoking of marijuana amongst the younger age group\r\n\r\nin  their teens or early 20's who can be found not\r\n\r\nonly in the street or coffee-shop but also in  the\r\n\r\nschool and the university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young person falls under the influence of\r\n\r\nsuch a drug in a variety of ways. It might be  the\r\n\r\nresult of boredom, sense of adventure to know  how\r\n\r\nit  feels by taking it or he might be inducted  to\r\n\r\nit  before being accepted as one of the circle  of\r\n\r\nso-called  \"friends\". The danger is that  when  he\r\n\r\nfinds that the effects of such a drug are not  too\r\n\r\nupsetting  but  rather pleasant in  the  transient\r\n\r\nlight-headed  feeling it induces, he continues  to\r\n\r\ntake it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, he so very easily progresses to more\r\n\r\npotent  drugs that will give him that same feeling\r\n\r\nof  euphoria  after failing to get it  with  those\r\n\r\ndrugs  which  he  first used, even  in  increasing\r\n\r\nquantities.  Once he becomes \"hooked\"  On  a  hard\r\n\r\ndrug,  e.g, morphine  or  heroin,  his  path   to\r\n\r\nruination and disaster is certain. He will not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  stop taking such a drug as the  physical\r\n\r\nand mental symptoms known as \"withdrawal symptoms\"\r\n\r\nfollowing  will be unbearable. It  is  known  that\r\n\r\nonce  a  person is hooked to a hard drug, he  will\r\n\r\nlie,  cheat, steal or even kill just  to  get  the\r\n\r\ndrugs.  Thus,  a  drug  trafficker  is  the   most\r\n\r\nabominable  of  human beings if he can  be  deemed\r\n\r\n\"human\". He is a merchant of \"living death\"  which\r\n\r\nhe  brings to a fellow human being. He, therefore,\r\n\r\ndeserves the maximum punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will, however, note that it\r\n\r\nis  not  all punishment written into this Bill.  A\r\n\r\nclear  distinction has been made between the  drug\r\n\r\naddict  and the trafficker and pedlar. I am moving\r\n\r\nan  amendment at the Committee Stage to remove the\r\n\r\nprovision of a minimum sentence of two years for a\r\n\r\nsecond  or  subsequent offence for smoking,  self-administering  or consuming a controlled  drug  as\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the Second Schedule  to  clause  29,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  inserted as a result of an  oversight.\r\n\r\nFor  those  addicts who wish to stop this  vicious\r\n\r\nhabit,  there are provisions under clause  33  (3)\r\n\r\nfor them to volunteer for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment   at   an   approved  institution.

Anyone\r\n\r\nwho  has  been  addicted to any of the  controlled\r\n\r\ndrugs  and  especially those who  have  had  their\r\n\r\nfirst  acquaintance  with such  a  drug  can  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  this  provision  to  have   himself\r\n\r\nrehabilitated. Powers have also been provided  for\r\n\r\nthe  Director,  Central  Narcotics  Bureau,  under\r\n\r\nclause  33,  to require any person,  whom  he  has\r\n\r\nreasonable grounds to suspect to he an addict,  to\r\n\r\nbe   medically  examined  and,  it  necessary,  to\r\n\r\nundergo treatment at an approved institution.  All\r\n\r\noutpatient clinics and centres have been organised\r\n\r\nto  provide  for  treatment  of  drug  addicts.  A\r\n\r\nreferral clinic has been established at the Outram\r\n\r\nRoad  Hospital.  A  second  one  is  planned   for\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hospital.  A  special  ward   for   the\r\n\r\nhospital care of addicts will be opened within the\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the drug trafficker there is also another\r\n\r\ndanger,  though on a lesser scale,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\ntourist   drug  addict,  particularly  among   the\r\n\r\nhippies. To seek out such drug addicts amongst the\r\n\r\nhuge  and  increasing number of tourists  entering\r\n\r\nSingapore, powers have been provided in clause  28\r\n\r\nof  the Bill for an immigration officer, where  he\r\n\r\nhas reasonable grounds to suspect any person to be\r\n\r\na drug addict, to request that person to provide a\r\n\r\nspecimen  of  urine  for  testing.  Entry  of  any\r\n\r\nperson,  other  than  a  Singapore  citizen  or  a\r\n\r\npermanent resident here, will be prohibited if  he\r\n\r\nrefuses  to submit to such a test or if  the  test\r\n\r\nshows  the  presence of a controlled drug.  It  is\r\n\r\nGovernment's  firm intention to exclude  entry  of\r\n\r\nsuch   tourist  addicts  for  their   habits   are\r\n\r\nimitative  and the youth of our Republic  must  be\r\n\r\nprotected from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule also lists the penalties\r\n\r\nprovided  for other offences under this Bill.

Certain  professional\r\n\r\npersons-doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinary\r\n\r\nsurgeons and others - who use or handle such drugs\r\n\r\nin  the  course of their professions or businesses\r\n\r\nwill  be  authorised to possess controlled  drugs,\r\n\r\nand  in certain cases, where applicable, to supply\r\n\r\nsuch  controlled drugs. Doctors and dentists  will\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  report any person  suspected  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a  drug  addict. The new  regulations  will\r\n\r\nprovide  for the keeping of more detailed  records\r\n\r\nof  import,  sale,  supply and use  of  controlled\r\n\r\ndrugs  so  as to provide better means of  checking\r\n\r\nthe   movement  of  controlled  drugs  within  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Association of Social Workers have\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a memorandum on the Bill. In  it,  they\r\n\r\nhave recommended that clause 27 (c) of the Bill be\r\n\r\namended  so  that professional social  workers  be\r\n\r\nexempted  from  the  law  of  having  to   divulge\r\n\r\nconfidential information gained from drug  addicts\r\n\r\nin  the course of their work in rehabilitating the\r\n\r\naddict.  This suggestion cannot be accepted  since\r\n\r\neven  doctors  are not exempt from revealing  such\r\n\r\nconfidences  if  this is required by  the  Courts.\r\n\r\nHowever, clause 32 gives protection to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons  acting under authority from any civil  or\r\n\r\ncriminal  liability. This should be  adequate  for\r\n\r\nthe  protection of the social worker who  acts  in\r\n\r\ngood faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also suggested the listing of approved\r\n\r\ninstitutions     to    include    non-governmental\r\n\r\ninstitutions for the treatment of drug addicts. It\r\n\r\nis  not necessary to do this in the main Act. This\r\n\r\ncan be done under regulations to be made under the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also suggested the setting up of an\r\n\r\nadvisory  panel of persons to determine  the  drug\r\n\r\npushers from the drug addicts. This recommendation\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  on  the  assumption  that  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to differentiate between the two.  Such\r\n\r\narm  assumption  is, of course, not  correct.  The\r\n\r\nCentral   Narcotics  Bureau,  together  with   the\r\n\r\ndoctors involved in the rehabilitation of addicts,\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  know how to make the  distinction\r\n\r\nand act accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also suggested that the Bill be\r\n\r\nreferred  to a Select Committee to consider  their\r\n\r\naforementioned proposals. In view of what  I  have\r\n\r\nstated    in    reply    to   the    Association's\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  reference to a Select  Committee\r\n\r\nis clearly unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to state quite categorically here\r\n\r\nthat  whatever  heavy  penalties  that  are  being\r\n\r\nprovided in this Bill, they by themselves are  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to solve the drug problem in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe   shall  require  all  the  co-operation   from\r\n\r\nparents, teachers, doctors, social workers and, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  whole public if we are to successfully\r\n\r\nmeet  that  problem. It is going to be  an  uphill\r\n\r\ntask all the way. Of course, highly deterrent laws\r\n\r\nagainst drug traffickers will help us tremendously\r\n\r\nin   our   fight  against  drug  trafficking   and\r\n\r\naddiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to take this opportunity to  say\r\n\r\na  few words in support of this Bill, particularly\r\n\r\non the problem of drug abuse which this Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now the mass media have\r\n\r\nperiodically focused attention on the problems  of\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse and have thereby aroused in the public\r\n\r\nan awareness of its dangers. Be that as it may,  I\r\n\r\nam  not convinced that this awareness alone is  an\r\n\r\nadequate defence against drug abuse. Hence, it  is\r\n\r\nmy  view  that  the  enhanced  punishment  in  the\r\n\r\npenalty clauses of this Bill is beneficial to  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am prepared to grant that the enlightened\r\n\r\nparent in control of the family is a deterrent  to\r\n\r\ndrug abuse. The question which then arises is just\r\n\r\nhow many parents are sufficiently enlightened and,\r\n\r\nmore   significant  still,  how  many   of   these\r\n\r\nenlightened parents have control of their children\r\n\r\nwho  are  prone to the attractions  of  drugs  and\r\n\r\ntheir abuses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public knowledge of the dangers of drug abuse is\r\n\r\nan  important  step in the effort to construct  an\r\n\r\neffective  social defence against drug abuse.  The\r\n\r\npublic  should  be  given  ample  opportunity   to\r\n\r\nacquire  this knowledge through the mass media.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think we need worry about over-acting  to\r\n\r\nthe  fears of drug abuse. If we are not  alert  we\r\n\r\nmay suddenly find the disease firmly rooted in our\r\n\r\nsociety.  By  that  time  we  would  he  extremely\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  about drugs  for  we  would  be  in\r\n\r\ndirect  touch with the ghastly realities  of  drug\r\n\r\naddiction of all kinds. To know of the dangers  of\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse  when the decrepit human  remnants  of\r\n\r\ndrug addiction surface onto our streets is to know\r\n\r\nof  the  dangers too late. I say that the time  to\r\n\r\nworry is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tri-Border Area of Thailand, Burma and Laos,\r\n\r\nsometimes  known  as  the `Golden  Triangle\",  has\r\n\r\nprobably  become  the main source  of  heroin  and\r\n\r\nother  opiates,  after Turkey  decided  to  outlaw\r\n\r\nopium production in its highlands. This change has\r\n\r\nbrought  the  world's principal  narcotics  source\r\n\r\nclose  to us. Meanwhile, the Vietnam conflict  has\r\n\r\nhad  the  effect  of dramatically  increasing  the\r\n\r\ndemand for narcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, 1971, a sub-committee on Public Health\r\n\r\nand Environment of the House of Representatives in\r\n\r\nthe U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconducted  investigations into the production  and\r\n\r\nabuse  of opiates in the Far East. Members of  the\r\n\r\nsub-committee  visited  Thailand,  South  Vietnam,\r\n\r\nHongkong  and  Japan.  In that  report,  the  sub-committee  estimated that the amount of opium  and\r\n\r\nits derivatives that would be produced for 1971 in\r\n\r\nthe  Tri-Border  Area would be as  high  as  1,000\r\n\r\ntons.  The large bulk of heroin and opiates, which\r\n\r\nleave  Mae  Sai  in  the Thai-Burma  border,  pass\r\n\r\nthrough  Bangkok  to Hongkong and  then  to  South\r\n\r\nVietnam, Okinawa, the U.S, and other countries. It\r\n\r\nseems to me that with the cessation of the Vietnam\r\n\r\nconflict and the withdrawal of foreign forces from\r\n\r\nIndo-China, a large quantity of surplus  narcotics\r\n\r\nin  South-east Asia would be seeking new  markets.\r\n\r\nWe  join  other quarters in hoping that  the  Thai\r\n\r\nAuthorities will record greater success  in  their\r\n\r\neffort  to  contain  opium  production  with   the\r\n\r\nsupport of the U.N, programme of crop substitution\r\n\r\namong the tribesmen in the highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is no indication that heroin is\r\n\r\npresently a much used drug in the country, let  us\r\n\r\nnot  beguile  ourselves with the notion  that  our\r\n\r\nsociety is safe from it. In our society today, the\r\n\r\nindustries  are  manned  by  new  generations   of\r\n\r\nyouthful workers in whom we hope the work ethic of\r\n\r\ntheir     fathers    and    forefathers    remains\r\n\r\nunadulterated. This work ethic has  accounted  for\r\n\r\nour  national  growth hitherto, and  we  naturally\r\n\r\nhope  that our young will retain it to stand  them\r\n\r\nin  good  stead  in  the  future.  However,  young\r\n\r\ngenerations tend to colour the moral, cultural and\r\n\r\nsocial values of their times with their own  sense\r\n\r\nof  worth  and  their  own  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nrational.  Sometimes they even abandon established\r\n\r\nvalues altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two facts may be stressed. First, youth\r\n\r\npredominate in our society. Secondly, our  society\r\n\r\nis very much exposed to foreign values which, more\r\n\r\noften  than not, are inconsonant with our own  way\r\n\r\nof life. The degree and extent of erosion upon the\r\n\r\nwork  ethic  of our youthful national  work  force\r\n\r\nwill be determined by the degree and extent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their response to these foreign values  which,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  reach  our  youth  in   a   highly\r\n\r\nattractive and heavily publicised fashion in which\r\n\r\ndrugs  feature as the sole instrument of communion\r\n\r\nwith narcotic bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With affluence spreading through the social\r\n\r\nfabric,   work   as   an  ethic   may   lose   its\r\n\r\nmeaningfulness   as   opportunity   for    leisure\r\n\r\nincreases   and  the  quest  for  excitement   and\r\n\r\neuphoria   becomes   more  deliberate.   In   this\r\n\r\nsituation,  drug offers an irresistible invitation\r\n\r\nto  such  excitement and euphoria.  And  to  those\r\n\r\nseeking  a momentary escape from the stresses  and\r\n\r\nstrains  of  a successful industrial society,  the\r\n\r\nnarcotics   dimension  offers  much   solace   and\r\n\r\nrecuperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When narcotics, other opium derivatives,\r\n\r\namphetamines and barbiturates become plentiful  in\r\n\r\na  country, there will manifest the inclination to\r\n\r\nexperiment  with drugs. In 1972,  for  the  period\r\n\r\nJanuary-March,  the  quantity  of  various   drugs\r\n\r\nseized by the Customs and Central Narcotics Bureau\r\n\r\nare as follows:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Ganja a total of about 68 kg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Morphine a total of about 29 kg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heroin a total of less than 1 kg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Opium a total of about 615 kg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hashish  a  total of about 1 kg, and \r\n\r\n      24,650 MX tablets.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  quantity has passed undetected  is  left  to\r\n\r\ninference.  The  larger quantity  of  drugs  being\r\n\r\ndetected may be due to the efficiency of  the  CNB\r\n\r\nand/or  it may simply be the fact that more  drugs\r\n\r\nare  flowing into the country. Whatever the  case,\r\n\r\nit  is  time  for us to sit up and appreciate  the\r\n\r\npotential gravity of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug commonly abused by some sections of our\r\n\r\nyouth  is ganja. They do not regard this  drug  as\r\n\r\nharmful   and   sometimes  equate  it   with   the\r\n\r\npermissible  intoxicates,  such  as   brandy   and\r\n\r\nwhisky.  `This, I think, is due to the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe dangers of ganja abuse is not common knowledge\r\n\r\namong  our  youth, which should not be  the  case.\r\n\r\nThere is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient  material by the experts  which  assert\r\n\r\nthat  ganja or marijuana is an \"initiation  drug.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it does not develop in the person a physical\r\n\r\ndependence    on   the   drug,    it    does    so\r\n\r\npsychologically.  It initiates the  consumer  into\r\n\r\nthe  narcotics experience and to a life  of  warp,\r\n\r\nirrelevant,  wasteful and anti-social  values.  He\r\n\r\nmay   not  he  drug-dependent;  but  he  is  drug-oriented.  Whether he subsequently degenerates  to\r\n\r\naddiction  to hard drugs will, I think, depend  on\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  in him a moral,  cultural  and\r\n\r\nsocial ballast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brings me to what I believe is the second\r\n\r\nrequisite  to an effective social defence  against\r\n\r\ndrug abuse, that is, parental control of children.\r\n\r\nBy  control,  I  mean  that kind  of  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  parents  and their children  which  stems\r\n\r\nfrom  an  enlightened authority that is vested  in\r\n\r\nthe  parents  through common love and respect,  on\r\n\r\nwhich  authority members of the family depend  and\r\n\r\nto  which  they respond. It is authority which  is\r\n\r\nthe  result  of close and concerned management  of\r\n\r\nsons   and   daughters   through   childhood   and\r\n\r\nadolescence undertaken within the cohesion of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In present times a number of social trends and\r\n\r\nactions    militate   against   family   cohesion.\r\n\r\nPressured  by  the  demands of daily  living,  the\r\n\r\nfamily  is  in  a  state of constant  motion.  The\r\n\r\nmotion  is  centrifugal in relation to  the  home,\r\n\r\ntearing  members of the family away from the  home\r\n\r\nand each other disintegrating the family unit.  If\r\n\r\nthis,  development  is not checked  somewhat,  our\r\n\r\nsociety  is  going to be that much  weakened;  for\r\n\r\nmoral,  cultural and social values can only inhere\r\n\r\nin  members of the family which live in harmonious\r\n\r\nand  intelligent cohesion. I believe that, in  the\r\n\r\nlast  analysis,  the  moral, cultural  and  social\r\n\r\nballast   in   the  individuals  of  our   society\r\n\r\nconstitute  in  its  totality our  most  effective\r\n\r\nsocial defence against drug abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I have on a number of\r\n\r\noccasions urged parents to retain or recover  this\r\n\r\nfamily  cohesion by insisting upon all members  of\r\n\r\nthe family to daily-gather around for dinner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  will, at least in my view, ensure that  once\r\n\r\nin  every  day, the family will assemble  and  the\r\n\r\nunit  becomes  intact. This  moment  will  provide\r\n\r\nopportunity  for communication, understanding  and\r\n\r\ninspiration,   all  of  which  make   for   family\r\n\r\ncohesion.  The family that eats together,  I  say,\r\n\r\nstays together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the law is finding it necessary to\r\n\r\nseverely  punish with imprisonment up to 10  years\r\n\r\npersons who consume or have in their possession  a\r\n\r\ncontrolled  drug may be regarded as an  indictment\r\n\r\nagainst   parents.   If  this  realisation   jolts\r\n\r\ncomplacent  parents  to a more responsible  action\r\n\r\nand  supervision of their children's affairs, this\r\n\r\nBill will succeed in launching a drug alert in our\r\n\r\ncountry, and in co-operation with the law we  will\r\n\r\neffectively combat drug abuse in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I support this Bill. The introduction of this\r\n\r\nBill, I believe, will be supported by people  from\r\n\r\nall  walks of life. It cannot be denied  that  our\r\n\r\nsociety  is  facing the problem of drug addiction.\r\n\r\nThere is a small number of people who indulges  in\r\n\r\nthis  drug  abuse.  These  drug  addicts  live  an\r\n\r\nunrealistic life and do not engage in any form  of\r\n\r\nproduction.  They  day-dream  all  day  long,  and\r\n\r\nbecome   useless.  This  will   not   only   incur\r\n\r\ndispleasure  and cause worry to their parents  but\r\n\r\nwill also pose a serious problem to our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for drug addiction are many and\r\n\r\nvaried.   Some  drug  addicts  have  been   easily\r\n\r\ninfluenced by their social environment  and  their\r\n\r\nfriends.  Some  of  them have been  influenced  by\r\n\r\ntourists from abroad, who have brought these drugs\r\n\r\nwith  them.  For example, some hippies  have  been\r\n\r\nknown  to  have done this. We must therefore  take\r\n\r\nsteps to prevent them from entering our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister emphasised just now that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is taking a serious view of this matter\r\n\r\nand   is   empowering  Immigration  officials   to\r\n\r\nprohibit the entry of any person whom they suspect\r\n\r\nto be drug traffickers. If hippies from abroad are\r\n\r\nallowed to come in to spread\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe use of drugs, it will have serious effects  on\r\n\r\nour society or will cause serious repercussions in\r\n\r\nour country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to eliminate this problem, I think it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  not only to introduce  the  various\r\n\r\nmeasures as provided in this Bill but also to deal\r\n\r\nwith  it  in a two-fold manner. Firstly,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Minister that every year we  should\r\n\r\nhold an anti-drug campaign on a big scale, similar\r\n\r\nto  what  he has done for the Ministry of  Health,\r\n\r\ni.e, the Keep Singapore Clean campaign. This anti-drug  campaign should be conducted in the  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies in order to bring home the  lessons\r\n\r\nof  the harm and ill-effects of drugs. In this way\r\n\r\nparents will be more aware of the dangers and they\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  face  the  problem  properly.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  I  would  like  to  suggest  that   the\r\n\r\nMinister should pay special attention to the youth\r\n\r\nin  our  country. The Ministry of Health  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  departments,  for  example,  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce,  should  establish more contacts  with  the\r\n\r\npeople in our society. Contacts between the Police\r\n\r\nand  the  people on a wider scale  will  help  the\r\n\r\nPolice  to be \"in the society\", so that they  will\r\n\r\nknow  where  the drug addicts are  and  where  the\r\n\r\ndrugs  are to be found. This will help reduce  the\r\n\r\nphenomenon of drug addiction. This, I think, is  a\r\n\r\nbetter and a more positive measure of dealing with\r\n\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a young nation. Sixty\r\n\r\nper  cent of our population are below the  age  of\r\n\r\n21. We should therefore take special steps and pay\r\n\r\nmore  attention to the problems of  youth  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  We  should protect them  from  all  evil\r\n\r\ninfluences.  If  we  are  concerned   with   their\r\n\r\nproblems,  we  can  help them  to  become  a  more\r\n\r\nrugged,  strong and firm generation, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan contribute towards our nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nhave anything more to add, except to thank the two\r\n\r\nspeakers  who  have  very strongly  supported  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the BiIl.---[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note, in page 1, line 6,\r\n\r\nto  leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".
