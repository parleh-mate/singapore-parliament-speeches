These\r\n\r\nestimates,  however, have been drawn up in  the  year\r\n\r\nprevious  to  that  to which they refer.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nalways  possible  to say with complete  accuracy  how\r\n\r\nmuch  will have to be spent in the following year  on\r\n\r\nthe  services for which provision is made or what new\r\n\r\nneeds will arise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, when the need to provide\r\n\r\nfor  some new service arises, an application is  made\r\n\r\nfor  a supplementary vote. Similarly, where there has\r\n\r\nbeen  some  radical  change in a  service  for  which\r\n\r\nprovision has already been made and additional  funds\r\n\r\nare  required, an application for supplementary  vote\r\n\r\nis  made.  These  applications  are  incorporated  in\r\n\r\nmessages  which  are presented to the  Assembly  from\r\n\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a number of occasions when the\r\n\r\nneed   arises  to  supplement  a  service  for  which\r\n\r\nprovision  has  already  been  made  but  where   the\r\n\r\nadditional sum required is small; for example, a rise\r\n\r\nin the price of printing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachines   due  to  circumstances  in  the  supplying\r\n\r\ncountry  may necessitate a supplement; freight  rates\r\n\r\nmay  be  increased  as a result of  an  international\r\n\r\ncrisis and prices may rise generally on goods ordered\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas;  and so on. In no  case  is  any  new\r\n\r\nprinciple  involved, nor has there been any  material\r\n\r\nchange  in the service for which provision  has  been\r\n\r\nmade in the estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an established principle in financial\r\n\r\nprocedure  of  the United Kingdom that the  Executive\r\n\r\nshould  have power to transfer funds from one service\r\n\r\nto  another  provided no new or  novel  principia  is\r\n\r\ninvolved and the sum voted under a particular head of\r\n\r\nexpenditure is not exceeded. This power of  virement,\r\n\r\nas  it  is called, has been incorporated to a limited\r\n\r\ndegree in the financial procedure of this Colony, and\r\n\r\nGeneral  Orders  of  the Government prescribe - General\r\n\r\nOrder 662(b) -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the provision under one sub-head appears to\r\n\r\nbe  likely  to be exceeded in any year, savings  from\r\n\r\nanother  sub-head  within the  same  sub-division  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  may be transferred with the approval  of\r\n\r\nthe  Financial  Secretary, except  under  the  Head - \r\n\r\n'Public Works, Non-Recurrent'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These transfers approved by the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nunder  General  Order  662 (b) are  recorded  in  the\r\n\r\nTreasury  and  in  the Vote Books of the  Departments\r\n\r\nconcerned, and are notified to the Deputy Director of\r\n\r\nAudit as they are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when studying the accounts for 1954, the\r\n\r\nPublic  Accounts  Committee  of  this  Assembly  drew\r\n\r\nattention to the fact that, while they had  a  record\r\n\r\nof applications for supplementary provision which had\r\n\r\nbeen  approved, neither they nor the Legislature  had\r\n\r\nany  record of transfers approved under General Order\r\n\r\n662  (b),  and  that  the  information  required   to\r\n\r\nreconcile the sums voted in the annual estimates  and\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure shown in the accounts  was  to  that\r\n\r\nextent incomplete. It was therefore suggested by  the\r\n\r\nCommittee that a quarterly return of transfers  under\r\n\r\nGeneral  Order  662  (b)  should  be  made   to   the\r\n\r\nLegislature  for  information. The first  return  was\r\n\r\ntabled as Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 16 of 1957 and the\r\n\r\nsecond, for the second quarter of the year, is tabled\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRIVATE MEDICAL BENEFIT ORGANISATIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Legislation to Control Activities)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.26 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am pleased to announce that following upon the\r\n\r\nfindings of a Government Inter-Departmental Committee\r\n\r\nwhich  was recently appointed to look into the nature\r\n\r\nand    activities   of   private   medical    benefit\r\n\r\norganisations, Government has decided in principle to\r\n\r\nintroduce  fresh  legislation  to  bring  under  more\r\n\r\neffective   control   the   activities    of    these\r\n\r\norganisations  as well as other forms  of  mutual-aid\r\n\r\norganisations which might be established in future.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are at present 21 active medical benefit\r\n\r\norganisations  which  have all  sought  and  obtained\r\n\r\nofficial recognition by either registering under  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Names Ordinance or registering  as  private\r\n\r\nlimited companies under the Companies Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nexcept  for registration they are not subject to  any\r\n\r\ncontrol whatever.

A matter has now arisen in this  way.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese  Printing Workers  Union  have  had\r\n\r\nconsiderable correspondence with the employers  as  to\r\n\r\nthe right of their workmen to have seven days' holiday\r\n\r\nnot  including  the rest day or Sunday. The  employers\r\n\r\nhave  sought  legal advice and the  advice  they  have\r\n\r\nreceived  is  that  the Ordinance, as  drafted,  means\r\n\r\nseven days including the rest day or Sunday.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the argument, very briefly, is this, that\r\n\r\nin  section 48, where sick leave is mentioned,  it  is\r\n\r\nspecifically stated in subsection (2), in the  proviso\r\n\r\nthereto, that-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"no workman shall be entitled to paid sick leave on\r\n\r\na  rest  day  or on a holiday to which the workman  is\r\n\r\nentitled under section 46 of this Ordinance or on  any\r\n\r\nday of paid annual leave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by implication, since rest day is not\r\n\r\nmentioned in section 47 (1), but holidays is mentioned\r\n\r\nin section 47 (1), rest day is included as part of the\r\n\r\nseven days mentioned in section 47 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written to the Ministry of Labour on this\r\n\r\nmatter and their very unhelpful suggestion is that  we\r\n\r\nshould take the matter up in the High Court. That will\r\n\r\ncost  a  great  deal of money and in  my  opinion  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  suggested by  the  managements'  legal\r\n\r\nadvisers  is  correct. We can obviate  the  difficulty\r\n\r\nwhich  this bit of draftsmanship has created by adding\r\n\r\nin section 47 (1) words which will make it quite clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  seven days are not to include  holidays  or\r\n\r\nrest  days,  and  it  is for this purpose  that  I  am\r\n\r\nseeking leave to move a Bill to amend section  47  (1)\r\n\r\nof the Labour Ordinance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will be in such terms-to alter the\r\n\r\nwords at the end of the subsection so that it reads as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every workman shall be entitled to seven days' paid\r\n\r\nleave for every twelve months continuous service  with\r\n\r\nthe same employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the coming into force of this Ordinance and such\r\n\r\nleave  shall be in addition to rest days and  holidays\r\n\r\nto which such workman is entitled under section 41 and\r\n\r\nsection 46 respectively of this Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those terms, there will not be any doubt whatsoever\r\n\r\nas  to  the right of a workman to be entitled to seven\r\n\r\ndays not including holidays or rest days.

With\r\n\r\nyour  permission, Sir, I will read the full  text  of\r\n\r\nthat message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Mr Speaker do convey to Mr Speaker of the\r\n\r\nFederal Legislative Council the following message  of\r\n\r\ngreetings  and good wishes for the inaugural  meeting\r\n\r\nof the Federal Legislative Council:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On this historic occasion, the Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  on behalf  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  sends fraternal greetings and good  wishes\r\n\r\nto  the Federal Legislative Council and the people of\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dawn of this new era in the political history\r\n\r\nof  the separated parts of this Malayan territory  we\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Legislative Assembly look forward to\r\n\r\nthe  closest co-operation and co-ordination with  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Legislative Councillors  in  building  up  a\r\n\r\nMalayan outlook and loyalty and in the achievement of\r\n\r\nour  common  aims for freedom, economic security  and\r\n\r\nsocial welfare of the peoples of this territory,  and\r\n\r\nextend  to our brothers across the Straits  our  good\r\n\r\nwishes for their success in the way ahead.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that first message was in the main a message of\r\n\r\nhope  and  good wishes for the future, at  that  time\r\n\r\nstill in the balance. That message, too, pledged  our\r\n\r\nfull   and   unstinting  support,  for   there   were\r\n\r\nnegotiations  ahead - and as we know  so  well  to  our\r\n\r\ncost,  negotiations sometimes have a habit of  taking\r\n\r\nan  unexpected turn. But that was two years  ago.  In\r\n\r\nthe  life  and  the  history of a people,  two  years\r\n\r\nrepresent but a fleeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoment.  Yet within this small compass of  time,  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya achieved Merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which this was accomplished is worth\r\n\r\nrecollecting. Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation of Malaya, is a close and sincere\r\n\r\nfriend  of  mine. I have always admired him  for  his\r\n\r\nsincerity,  a quality at once apparent  even  at  the\r\n\r\nfirst  meeting.  Members of the  Opposition  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly have also paid tribute to this most valuable\r\n\r\nasset  possessed  by the Tunku.  Two  years  ago  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar described the Tunku  as  a\r\n\r\ngentleman in every sense of the word - an apt and happy\r\n\r\ndescription.  It  was  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman,   by   a\r\n\r\ncombination of patience, perseverance and  that  most\r\n\r\nimportant  ingredient - inspiring  leadership - and  with\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of  dedication,  who  first  created   an\r\n\r\natmosphere of unity in his country and cordiality  in\r\n\r\nthe  conference  hall, prerequisites of  the  success\r\n\r\nrightly  his due. Here was a display of statesmanship\r\n\r\nat  once  magnificent and masterly; here  was  a  man\r\n\r\nbuilding     success     on     the     surest     of\r\n\r\nfoundations - sincerity.  It  was  this  quality  which\r\n\r\ngenerated  pond  readily to  goodwill.  It  was  this\r\n\r\nquality of the Tunku which made the High Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  the Federation his ally, and this fact the  Tunku\r\n\r\nhimself has admitted a few days ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road the Federation will take is now known. A\r\n\r\nnation  assembled  in proud array is  ready  for  its\r\n\r\ndestiny  and  the greatest adventure of all - to  march\r\n\r\ninto the Merdeka Highway! - a path which the leader is\r\n\r\npointing  out with pride and confidence.  The  future\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will make will be glorious. They have\r\n\r\na  just man as leader. They have unity and purpose as\r\n\r\na  driving force. They have friends and allies tested\r\n\r\nand true, whose aid they have but to invoke; but most\r\n\r\nimportant  of  all,  Sir,  they  have  themselves - the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Malaya ardent in their wish to  take  the\r\n\r\ndifficult uphill road of freedom,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  glory, and nationhood. On this day, with joy and\r\n\r\r\npride, and yet with humility, we greet the people and\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya with  but  one\r\n\r\nword - Merdeka!  For  other words  are  inadequate  and\r\n\r\nempty, inappropriate and meaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the last part of my motion. Here\r\n\r\nis  our  testament of faith, hope and charity;  faith\r\n\r\nthat  one day soon Singapore will be united with  the\r\n\r\nFederation;  hope that Singapore and the  Federation,\r\n\r\nas one unit, one country, one nation, will contribute\r\n\r\njointly  to  the good and the strength of the  whole;\r\n\r\nand charity that the tolerance and goodwill, the help\r\n\r\nand  support each has given to the other in the past,\r\n\r\nwill sustain us in the future and remain the basis of\r\n\r\nour relations in the new and changed circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reason to look to the future with doubts\r\n\r\nor  misgivings.  We, too, shall know  a  change  next\r\n\r\nyear. We in Singapore shall have self-government and,\r\n\r\nwith it, the responsibility for the management of our\r\n\r\ninternal  affairs  and  our trade.  In  the  one,  we\r\n\r\nalready  have the assurance of Federation assistance;\r\n\r\nin  the other, we look forward to the continuance  of\r\n\r\ntheir  co-operation.  To me, the  future  holds  both\r\n\r\npromise and challenge, so long as we keep faith  with\r\n\r\nourselves  and  our destiny, which is inevitably  and\r\n\r\ninextricably bound up with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I would like to make the following\r\n\r\nannouncements.  The Government, in  order  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  people  of  this island  may  be  able  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  as  they  desire,  and  as   fully   and\r\n\r\nspontaneously   as   possible,   in    the    Merdeka\r\n\r\ncelebrations  commencing in the  Federation  on  30th\r\n\r\nAugust,  has already announced that it has  appointed\r\n\r\nSaturday, 31st August, a public holiday, in  addition\r\n\r\nto the public holidays appointed for this year. Ships\r\n\r\nwill  be dressed on Saturday, 31st August. Guns  will\r\n\r\nbe fired at 10 a.m. on Monday, 2nd September, to mark\r\n\r\nthe  installation of His Majesty the Yang di  Pertuan\r\n\r\nAgong.  The  Government  has offered  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment a gift\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  will  take  the  form of meeting  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nfurnishing  completely a Committee  Room  in  the  new\r\n\r\nParliament building to be erected in Kuala Lumpur. The\r\n\r\nFederation Government has been pleased to signify  its\r\n\r\ngracious   acceptance.  Hon.  Members  approved   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure earlier today. Sir, an interim  gift  from\r\n\r\nSingapore,  of  a  grandfather clock,  which  will  be\r\n\r\nplaced   in   the  Committee  Room  in   the   Federal\r\n\r\nLegislative Council, will be sent to Kuala Lumpur this\r\n\r\nweek.  I have arranged for this clock, which has  been\r\n\r\nsuitably  engraved, to be put on view in the foyer  to\r\n\r\nmy  office for the convenience of Members who may wish\r\n\r\nto  see  it.  I am sure, Sir, these arrangements  will\r\n\r\nreceive the wholehearted approval of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to announce that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the Federation has extended  to  me  an\r\n\r\ninvitation  to  attend,  as a  representative  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government,  the  Merdeka  celebrations  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  from 30th August to 3rd  September.  My\r\n\r\nwife  has  also  been  included in this  invitation.\r\n\r\nMinisters -  and I understand you also,  Six - have  been\r\n\r\ninvited separately. I shall convey to His Majesty  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Agong, and the Prime Minister of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, on behalf of the people and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore, our felicitations and  good\r\n\r\nwishes,  and  our assurance of continued  support  and\r\n\r\npromise of continued co-operation and goodwill. Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsecond  the motion. Whenever a nation is free  of  its\r\n\r\nshackles  from colonialism, wherever a nation  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  attains freedom, we, who love freedom,  rejoice\r\n\r\nwith   them.  In  this  particular  case,   Sir,   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya had been a part of the  whole  of\r\n\r\ngeographical Malaya. We had been together for  a  very\r\n\r\nlong  time until separated just after the war, so that\r\n\r\nwhen the Federation of Malaya attains independence, it\r\n\r\nis  with greater joy that we express our feelings. Our\r\n\r\njoy is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot   only  limited,  Sir,  to  the  nation  attaining\r\n\r\nindependence,   but  that  this  nation,   after   its\r\n\r\nattainment  of  independence, will remain  within  the\r\n\r\nfree world as a free and democratic country, a country\r\n\r\nthat  will follow the wishes of the people, a  country\r\n\r\nthat   will  observe  parliamentary  democracy.   This\r\n\r\nindeed,  Sir, is one of the rejoicings that  we  have.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact that must be remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish the Federation of Malaya all the best in its\r\n\r\nfuture.  We wish that the Government will rule wisely.\r\n\r\nAnd  we wish that the people - all the people - in Malaya,\r\n\r\nirrespective of race or creed, will enjoy the  freedom\r\n\r\nthat is now obtained. We wish that all of them will be\r\n\r\nhappy  and  be treated equally under the law,  and  we\r\n\r\nhope  that the nation will march forward as  one  that\r\n\r\nhas  co-operation  amongst its people,  and  that  its\r\n\r\npeople will all be loyal to its Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the Straits, Sir, we in Singapore\r\n\r\nlook at the Federation of Malaya with admiration,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps, too, with a little sense of shame, for having\r\n\r\nbeen in the forefront of this march to Merdeka; we are\r\n\r\nnow  left behind to follow its footsteps. We wish  we,\r\n\r\ntoo,  will  be independent. We wish we too could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a free nation. We wish that we could be as proud\r\n\r\nas  they  could be on August 31 to proclaim themselves\r\n\r\nas free people of a free nation. Yet we are happy that\r\n\r\nthey have attained freedom. We are happy that our  big\r\n\r\nbrother is ahead of us. We hope to follow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more concerned, Sir, that after the\r\n\r\nattainment of independence, the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand  Singapore will carry on as in the days of old  on\r\n\r\nthe lines of co-operation, on the lines of helping one\r\n\r\nanother.  People  in  the Federation  as  well  as  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  always regard the two territories  as  one.\r\n\r\nThere  is never an instance when we think of going  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya as going abroad  to  a  new\r\n\r\ncountry.  We always regard going to the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  as taking a sort of a holiday in another  part\r\n\r\nof  our  own country. We hope that all the  laws  that\r\n\r\nwill  be made will be for the mutual benefit of  both.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  that not only will one nation be  benefited,\r\n\r\nbut the Federation   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  and  Singapore  will   both   be\r\n\r\nprosperous and happy. With two neighbours so  closely\r\n\r\nconnected, it is important that both territories must\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied. The losing of happiness  of  one  will\r\n\r\naffect  the other. As a Chinese saying goes, \"Without\r\n\r\nthe  lips the teeth will be cold.\" If Singapore  were\r\n\r\nto  be  placed in an unhappy position, the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya will not be as happy as it should be.  But\r\n\r\nwith  both sections complete, it can be assured  that\r\n\r\nthere will be prosperity all round.

I wish to echo the rejoicings of  my  Party\r\n\r\non  Malaya's attainment of full nationhood  within  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of days. With its diverse interests  and  its\r\n\r\nriches   in  mineral  resources,  and  its   multiple\r\n\r\nsociety,  Malaya  has shown to the world  during  the\r\n\r\nlast two short years that it is more than capable  to\r\n\r\nharness  those diverse interests and riches  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the different peoples that go to make  up\r\n\r\nthe  population of Malaya. By this I do not mean that\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Malaya, whom I  shall  refer  to  as\r\n\r\nMalayans, should rest on their laurels, but that they\r\n\r\nshould  march forward with caution and steadiness  so\r\n\r\nthat  whatever teething troubles that  are  bound  to\r\n\r\narise  to  face the new nation will be overcome  with\r\n\r\nconfidence and wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rejoicings which the Malayans richly deserve,\r\n\r\nI  think  they should also jolt themselves  into  the\r\n\r\nrealisation   of   three   factors:   firstly,    the\r\n\r\nstatesmanlike manner in which the Chief  Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya and his  colleagues  have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  in  their  struggle  for  independence;\r\n\r\nsecondly,   the   magnanimity  of  the   British   in\r\n\r\nrelinquishing their power, influence and interests in\r\n\r\na  manner  which speaks volumes of their good  faith,\r\n\r\nsincerity and a genuine desire on their part to grant\r\n\r\nindependence without the shedding of one single  drop\r\n\r\nof  blood; and thirdly, the militant Communist menace\r\n\r\nthat mars the progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the country and its people in the pursuit of their\r\n\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the country is to be independent with a\r\n\r\nfully  elected Legislature in 1959, I trust  all  the\r\n\r\nMalayans will rally round the Government in putting a\r\n\r\nstop to this wasteful shooting war in the jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these sentiments I salute the new nation - the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya - and proudly endorse the  message\r\n\r\nto the Federal Legislative Council and its Members.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.11 a.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit is with a feeling of joy and happiness that I rise\r\n\r\nto support the motion. Never before in the history of\r\n\r\nthe  world  has a people in so short a time  attained\r\n\r\nthe  status  of national independence. In  two  years\r\n\r\nfrom  a stage of colonialism the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nhas emerged into one of the leading nations of South-East  Asia.  How was this brought about? First,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncredit must go to the leaders themselves, men of  the\r\n\r\ncalibre of Tunku Abdul Rahman and Dato Sir Cheng-lock\r\n\r\nTan who, moved by an intense desire for independence,\r\n\r\nwere  able to rally the support of the various  races\r\n\r\nin  Malaya into one channel, that of Merdeka.  Malaya\r\n\r\nis  fortunate in that, at this stage of its  history,\r\n\r\nshe  has  at the helm of affairs a man of exceptional\r\n\r\nforesight  and  understanding, able  and  willing  to\r\n\r\nserve  his fellow-men without fear or favour  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the country as a whole.  But  for  his\r\n\r\ncourage and devotion to the cause of Merdeka, and his\r\n\r\nnon-communal  leadership,  we  might  not  today   be\r\n\r\nsending this message of congratulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit must also be given, Sir, to the Malay Rulers\r\n\r\nwho,  with  dignity and calmness, aligned  themselves\r\n\r\nwith the people in their struggle for independence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, credit must go to the people of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya who, against great  odds,  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to sink their differences and work  for  the\r\n\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the greatest but sometimes forgotten factor\r\n\r\nwhich  contributed towards Malaya's  independence  is\r\n\r\nthe  approach of the political Parties. It  is  true,\r\n\r\nSir,  that political Parties these days have one form\r\n\r\nof  ism  or  another. Sometimes it is  Socialism,  at\r\n\r\nother  times it is capitalism or even Communism.  But\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation it is worthy  of  note  that  the\r\n\r\nParties  in  the  Alliance had  a  totally  different\r\n\r\nideology.  Their  ism - if at all it  could  be  called\r\n\r\nthat - is  Merdekaism. It was this call to  the  people\r\n\r\nwhich  struck the note. Had it been any other, Malaya\r\n\r\nwould probably be in chaos today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this small island should take note and perhaps\r\n\r\ndraw  a leaf out of the Federation's book of success.\r\n\r\nIf  we are really sincere and honest to the cause  of\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  we  should be able to subjugate  everything\r\n\r\nelse to this greater goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the message which we propose to send to the\r\n\r\nFederation,  mention is made of a merger.  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  to  go  to great lengths over  this.  It  is\r\n\r\nadmitted  that  a  great majority of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore would like to see a United Malaya.  How  it\r\n\r\nwill  be brought about is another matter. It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat the Federation Government will continue refusing\r\n\r\nus, as they have consistently done since the days  of\r\n\r\nMr  Marshall; or it may be that they may  accept  us\r\n\r\nfive, ten or fifteen years hence. But what I do  say,\r\n\r\nSir, to the political Parties of Singapore, including\r\n\r\nmine, is the less we talk of a merger the greater the\r\n\r\npossibility. We already have much in common.  Let  us\r\n\r\nuse  these common grounds as a basis for greater  co-operation   and   understanding   between   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the people of the Federation of Malaya, I say,\r\n\r\n\"May you progress from strength to strength, and  may\r\n\r\nyou  be the guiding light to the people of this  part\r\n\r\nof  Asia.

At the moment, Sir, all the  noise  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  make regarding the merger is but a voice  in\r\n\r\nthe  wilderness. It is just like rain water  dripping\r\n\r\noff  the  back of a duck. We might as well  save  our\r\n\r\nface,  we might as well at least save our breath,  to\r\n\r\ncool  our  porridge for the time  being.  Let  us  be\r\n\r\nrealistic.  Let  us  do first things  first.  Let  us\r\n\r\nmarshal  our  forces together. Let us pull  ourselves\r\n\r\nout   of,   or  solve,  the  many  pressing  problems\r\n\r\nconfronting  us,  lest  we humiliate  ourselves  much\r\n\r\nfurther   in  the  eyes  of  our  good  neighbour - the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many urgent needs that require immediate\r\n\r\nattention. First, the industrial unrest; second,  the\r\n\r\nflight  of local capital; the ever-increasing  number\r\n\r\nof  unemployed in Singapore and the growing  army  of\r\n\r\nidle teenagers whose future is doomed as things stand\r\n\r\ntoday.  If  Beng Kong has chicken-pox, do you  expect\r\n\r\nMohammad  next door to go hand-in-hand with him?  The\r\n\r\nreason  is obvious, even though both of them are  the\r\n\r\nbest of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore say that this goodwill message\r\n\r\nwill serve its purpose better if we would delete \"the\r\n\r\nmerger hint\" entirely out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.18 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

The people  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation have fought well and courageously  in  the\r\n\r\nstruggle   for   freedom.

Anyone  who\r\n\r\nhas  a close eye on the present political development\r\n\r\nof  this  country should be deeply impressed  by  the\r\n\r\nheavy  responsibility and the hearty feelings implied\r\n\r\nin  the  motion. I may not agree with what  was  said\r\n\r\njust  now  by the mover of the motion, the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister, but I have doubt that he was speaking\r\n\r\nwith full conscience and sincerity. I can assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse that the Hon, the Chief Minister, just the same\r\n\r\nas  I or any other average sensible person in the two\r\n\r\nterritories,  welcome 31st August, Merdeka  Day -  but\r\n\r\nwith  mixed feelings.

The present Chief Minister asked me at the\r\n\r\nhotel  in  St. James' Court, \"Look, Cher  Kheng,  you\r\n\r\nsigned  your  name in the Record Book of  St.  James'\r\n\r\nCourt as Malayan?\" I said, \"Yes.\" \"Oh,\" he said,  \"I,\r\n\r\ntoo, signed as Malayan.\" The then Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand   I  then  signed  the  record  book  giving  our\r\n\r\nnationality  as  Malayan, but in the  light  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion today, will the mover of the motion be allowed\r\n\r\nany  more  to  sign  his  nationality  officially  as\r\n\r\nMalayan? Sir, I doubt very much. Although the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes says that every true Malayan should buy a  copy\r\n\r\nof  its Merdeka souvenir, I doubt very much if it  is\r\n\r\nin  the  right  sense to term our brothers,  who  are\r\n\r\nlucky,  powerful  and  able  to  achieve  such  early\r\n\r\nindependence, a new nation. Naturally, Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\nmixed   feelings  and  I  cannot,   as   a   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentative,  tell  lies or  engage  in  political\r\n\r\ndouble-talk.

Mr  Lennox-Boyd, who must be held  responsible\r\n\r\nfor   the  state  of  affairs  today - this  artificial\r\n\r\nseparation of the two territories. If he had  allowed\r\n\r\nus  to  have a genuine joint Merdeka team,  we  would\r\n\r\nhave had one united and consolidated constitution.

I hold him  as\r\n\r\none  of  the truly idealistic leaders of this country\r\n\r\nwho  can solve the serious problem of today, and even\r\n\r\nof tomorrow, of creating a greater Malaysian nation.\r\n\r\nI  told him that almost all the political leaders  in\r\n\r\nthis  country  were fools because they  were  falling\r\n\r\ninto the age-old colonial trap of divide and rule.  I\r\n\r\nthink  I have asked once before in this Assembly  why\r\n\r\nif  the  Commissioner-General, Sir Robert  Scott,  is\r\n\r\nable  to  have  jurisdiction  and  control  over  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo, why cannot we have a Malaysian  nation\r\n\r\nas our cultural and economic interests are identical?\r\n\r\nInstead, we are being driven apart. It is a shock  to\r\n\r\nme.  I  say  that in the history of the world,  there\r\n\r\nhave never been two territories so close and yet  are\r\n\r\ndivided.  The Hon. the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands and Housing has just said that the independence\r\n\r\nof Malaya, achieved in so short a time, creates world\r\n\r\nhistory.

E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now departing into\r\n\r\nnuclear research! Shall we confine ourselves  to  the\r\n\r\nmotion, which is to send a message of goodwill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am sorry. I close my\r\n\r\nspeech with a sincere appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot add to the beautiful phrases and the praise\r\n\r\nfor Tunku Abdul Rahman. I extend my personal greeting\r\n\r\nto him and hope that he will fulfil the wishes of the\r\n\r\npeople of this territory. On my short visit to Brunei\r\n\r\na  few weeks ago it was a surprise to me, Sir, to see\r\n\r\nmany households displaying pictures of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour Malayan political leaders like Tunku Abdul Rahman\r\n\r\nand  even the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. It seems\r\n\r\nto  be  so  natural to do so. Therefore, I convey  my\r\n\r\nwishes,  not just empty words of praise, but I  hope,\r\n\r\nfirst, that the coordinating administrative bodies in\r\n\r\nthe two territories will, and must, try their best to\r\n\r\ncontinue  their work; and second, that a  pan-Malayan\r\n\r\neconomic  policy will be adopted. That is my  sincere\r\n\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I   rise   to   support   this   message    of\r\n\r\ncongratulations   to  the  new  nation   across   the\r\n\r\nCauseway. I support in particular the hope  that  the\r\n\r\nseparation of Singapore and the Federation  will  one\r\n\r\nday be ended. I hope that that day will be very soon.\r\n\r\nThe  longer  this day is postponed, Sir, the  greater\r\n\r\nthe  risk  of the two territories drifting apart.  As\r\n\r\nyou    already   know,   Sir,   there   are   already\r\n\r\ngroups - factions - in  Singapore  working  actively   to\r\n\r\nprevent a merger between the two territories. Only  a\r\n\r\nfew  days ago there was a newspaper report of  a  new\r\n\r\npolitical  party  with the slogan.  \"Merdeka  without\r\n\r\nmerger!\"  This party has the backing of  wealthy  men\r\n\r\nwho probably would like to run this island as one big\r\n\r\nestate.  Parties  like this can do a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nharm.  They  will  exploit  and  magnify  differences\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two territories in order to  strengthen\r\n\r\ntheir  cause.  This must result in communal  tensions\r\n\r\nand  suspicions.  Those who cry for  Merdeka  without\r\n\r\nmerger may not intend such a thing, but there will be\r\n\r\na  rise of communal tension whether they like  it  or\r\n\r\nnot.  Therefore the longer the two territories remain\r\n\r\ndivided,  the greater the difficulties of building  a\r\n\r\nstrong  united  nation.  The  People's  Action  Party\r\n\r\ntherefore  believes that merger should not  remain  a\r\n\r\npious  hope,  an  objective to be  achieved  in  some\r\n\r\nremote  future.  The two Governments  must  get  down\r\n\r\ntogether  now to consider ways and means of  bringing\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories closer to each  other,  not  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss   ways  and  means  of  how   to   make   the\r\n\r\ndistinctions between the two greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W.

On 31st August, a new\r\n\r\nphase  begins in the history of Malaya. Earlier  this\r\n\r\nmorning I met the Hon. Deputy Chief Minister  and  he\r\n\r\nmade  a  special  request  that  on  this  happy  and\r\n\r\nauspicious   occasion   I  should   not   make   dire\r\n\r\npredictions of impending doom and disaster.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to accede to that request but I think we  would\r\n\r\nbe  deceiving ourselves if we do not realise the deep\r\n\r\nsignificance of the change that will be taking  place\r\n\r\nafter 31st August. At the moment those of us who read\r\n\r\nonly  the  English  Press are  preoccupied  with  new\r\n\r\nofficial  dress, palace for the new Paramount  Ruler,\r\n\r\nand embassies being opened abroad. These are the more\r\n\r\nextravagant  manifestations of an independent  state.\r\n\r\nBut  those who are preoccupied with what is going  on\r\n\r\nnot  in  these high places but in the hearts and  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the  people, are more concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nreactions  of  the various groups in  Malaya  and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to 31st August, it was a straightforward anti-colonial fight. We all gang up and beat the brains\r\n\r\nout  of  the British, which was a very good thing  to\r\n\r\nhave done. If, Mr Speaker, Sir, people like the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Secretary, apart from  enjoying  all  the\r\n\r\nbeautiful places, the beautiful rest houses in  which\r\n\r\nhe must have stayed, and the spacious bungalows which\r\n\r\nthe State Governments must have provided for him, had\r\n\r\nspent  some time wondering what would happen  to  all\r\n\r\nthe   immigrant  children  for  whose  education  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not provide, if  they  had  wondered\r\n\r\nabout  the change in the whole complex of the Malayan\r\n\r\nsituation - which  their action in  allowing  wholesale\r\n\r\nimmigration, without providing for the absorption and\r\n\r\nassimilation of the people would bring about - we would\r\n\r\nnot be faced with this situation today. No doubt when\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  of  the good old days he  thinks  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguid, languorous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy Lamour type of situation, where he, the white\r\n\r\nboss,  watched  the  spectacle of  beautiful  natives\r\n\r\nfloating across the panoramic scene. But we  have  to\r\n\r\nface  the reality now because of their stupidity  and\r\n\r\ntheir mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever may be said, I think the people of Malaya\r\n\r\nhave  no  regrets in the passing of the British  raj.\r\n\r\nBut  I  give this one compliment to the British  raj.\r\n\r\nThey, of all the colonial powers, know how to bow out\r\n\r\ngracefully. Unlike the French and the Dutch  who  got\r\n\r\ntheir  brains  beaten  into the  dust  of  Hanoi  and\r\n\r\nJogjakarta, the British are past masters at this art.\r\n\r\nThey bow out gracefully when the time comes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what we want to know after 31st August is:\r\n\r\nWhat happens next, because-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether we\r\n\r\ndo  really want to know what happens next in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  motion.  The motion is  just  a  message  of\r\n\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, we can give no better\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of our goodwill than our  concern  and\r\n\r\nanxiety  over what follows after Merdeka. We are  all\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  this, Mr Speaker, Sir; very  much  so,\r\n\r\nbecause if the battle is lost in the Federation, then\r\n\r\nthe battle is lost in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to be intervening in\r\n\r\nthis debate so frequently but it seems to me that all\r\n\r\nwe  are debating now is whether or not we should send\r\n\r\na goodwill message to the Federation, and the message\r\n\r\nhas  been couched as appears on the Order Paper.  And\r\n\r\nif  hon.  Members  do  not like the  wording  of  the\r\n\r\nmessage, they are at liberty to make amendments.  But\r\n\r\nI  think  the  emphasis should be whether  or  not  a\r\n\r\ngoodwill message should be sent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I would not be so ungracious as to\r\n\r\ncriticise  the fluency of the language. In fact,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in the short adjournment which  I  took\r\n\r\nfor  myself  this morning, I came across  the  former\r\n\r\nChief  Minister and it struck me that if he  were  in\r\n\r\ncharge of this motion we would really have an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonorific motion to send across the Causeway.  And  I\r\n\r\nhave been wondering for some time how it is that such\r\n\r\na  mundane and modest Chief Minister has got  himself\r\n\r\ninvolved in such a long and flowery motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the colonial officials find it tedious\r\n\r\nto  be  reminded  of  their  past  misdeeds  but  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir, you will forgive me if I say  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  give  no  greater evidence of  our  desire,  our\r\n\r\ngenuine  goodwill, for the people of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nthan by showing our concern not only for what happens\r\n\r\non  Merdeka  Day but what happens after. Before  31st\r\n\r\nAugust,  every  policeman, every Home Guard  officer,\r\n\r\nevery  member of the Federation Regiment who is  shot\r\n\r\nin  the armed revolution is shot as a running-dog, or\r\n\r\nit  can be said he was a running-dog, of the British.\r\n\r\nBut after 31st August - and this I think is in the mind\r\n\r\nof everybody - every soldier, every Home Guard shot, is\r\n\r\na  shot against a guardian of the newly-found freedom\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Malaya, and therefore the  $64,000\r\n\r\nquestion:  What is the Malayan Communist Party  going\r\n\r\nto  do? If it goes on shooting, then the consequences\r\n\r\nwill be catastrophic for them and for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new phase and if there are leaders who\r\n\r\nhave  the interests of other than just their  parties\r\n\r\nat  heart,  we should be able to make the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem work, for this simple reason if nothing  else,\r\n\r\nthat the people of Malaya have not lost faith in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system. It is the democratic system - or the\r\n\r\ndemocratic constitutional Parties taking advantage of\r\n\r\nthe   overall  three-cornered  fight  in  Malaya - that\r\n\r\nbrought  freedom to Malaya. That is  the  first  fact\r\n\r\nthat  must  be acknowledged. Secondly, the people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  are not at the moment in favour of any  armed\r\n\r\ntotalitarian revolt. We have had enough of it  and  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that  31st  August will see  some  dramatic\r\n\r\nchanges in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking to a friend of mine, a colleague of\r\n\r\nmine  who  is  now  enjoying the hospitality  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government  in one of the  prison  camps  in\r\n\r\nChangi.  He said - and I think he said it with absolute\r\n\r\nsincerity - \"After 31st August let\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  pack  up this armed revolution before  they  do\r\n\r\ngreat  damage  to  the country.\"  And  we  say  this:\r\n\r\nWhoever  does not declare where he stands after  31st\r\n\r\nAugust   is  a  fool.  Up  to  31st  August  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,   the  question  is:  Do   we   have   an\r\n\r\nindependent  Malaya? After the 31st the question  is:\r\n\r\nWhat kind of independent Malaya do we make of it? And\r\n\r\nwe  say categorically - I say it for myself and for  my\r\n\r\nParty - we believe in an independent, democratic,  non-Communist Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Speaker do convey to Mr Speaker of the\r\n\r\nFederal Legislative Council the following message  of\r\n\r\ngreetings  and good wishes to Members of the  Federal\r\n\r\nLegislative Council :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On the occasion of the attainment of Independence\r\n\r\nby  the  Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nof  Nations  on  Saturday,  31st  August,  1957,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative Assembly,  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, sends to the Federal Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil  and the people of the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\ngreetings   and  congratulations  at  this   historic\r\n\r\ntime - the  emergence  of  a  new  nation,  taking  its\r\n\r\nrightful  place among the freedom-loving  nations  of\r\n\r\nthe  world; and good wishes for the future  in  which\r\n\r\nthe  peoples  and Governments of both our territories\r\n\r\nare  inextricably  bound, a  future  which  therefore\r\n\r\nholds  a challenge to good sense and tolerance  which\r\n\r\ncan   only  be  successfully  met  by  constant   and\r\n\r\nunstinted  goodwill,  and  by  the  closest  of   co-operation  in  realising the  ardent  desire  of  the\r\n\r\npeoples of both our territories; for it is the  prime\r\n\r\ninterest  of  both  peoples to merge  into  a  single\r\n\r\npolitical  unit within which as one people  with  one\r\n\r\noutlook and purpose, all may share the joy and fruits\r\n\r\nof that happy state of Merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of Singapore look forward to that day when our\r\n\r\nstrength  will  be  added to your  strength  and  our\r\n\r\nseparation  will  be ended; and  we  can  proudly  go\r\n\r\nforward  together to make our joint  contribution  in\r\n\r\nhuman welfare,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic  prosperity and political  strength  to  the\r\n\r\ngreat  and distinctive service of Asia to the  modern\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>MERDEKA.\"</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (The Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, may I request you,\r\n\r\nSir, to declare whether the motion has been agreed to\r\n\r\nnemine contradicente?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
