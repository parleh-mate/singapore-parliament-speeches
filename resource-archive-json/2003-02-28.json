-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for Trade\r\n\r\nand Industry (a) whether the Singapore economy is likely to be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to even greater volatility in future as  we  invest\r\n\r\nmore  heavily in the life sciences, pharmaceuticals  and  bio-medical sectors; and (b) what measures his Ministry has  taken\r\n\r\nor  will take to help mitigate the possibility of even greater\r\n\r\nvolatility of the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the greater variation in Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic  growth recently is in part due to the volatility  of\r\n\r\nthe  global electronics industry.  After the bursting  of  the\r\n\r\nInternet  bubble, global semiconductor sales fell  sharply  by\r\n\r\n32%  in 2001 after a record 37% growth the year before.  Given\r\n\r\nSingapore's small and open economy and the significant size of\r\n\r\nelectronics,  we cannot insulate ourselves from  the  cyclical\r\n\r\nnature of the global electronics industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lessen the cyclical swings, we have been diversifying\r\n\r\nour economy.  In manufacturing, we are strengthening the other\r\n\r\n3 clusters besides electronics, namely, chemicals, engineering\r\n\r\nand  the  Biomedical  Sciences.  Within  electronics,  we  are\r\n\r\ndeveloping   various   segments  like  data   storage,   info-communications and key modules to diversify the  value  chain.\r\n\r\nAs  these  segments do not necessarily follow the same  cycle,\r\n\r\nthe sector as a whole will be less volatile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asks if our promotion of life sciences,\r\n\r\npharmaceuticals  and  bio-medical sectors  will  increase  the\r\n\r\nvolatility in our economy.  This is not likely, for 3 reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the cycle for these 3 areas, which we refer to as  the\r\n\r\nBiomedical   Sciences  cluster,  is  not   synchronised   with\r\n\r\nelectronics.  Hence, it can help to even  out  overall  growth\r\n\r\nrates. For example, while electronics fell by 21% in 2001, the\r\n\r\nBiomedical  Sciences  cluster  grew  by  10%,  moderating  the\r\n\r\ndecline in the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, within the Biomedical Sciences cluster itself,\r\n\r\nthere  are three different segments - pharmaceuticals, medical\r\n\r\ntechnology and biotechnology. Pharmaceuticals account for some\r\n\r\n80%  of  the  total Biomedical Sciences manufacturing  output.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical producers have diversified their  manufacturing\r\n\r\nactivities to include formulation, fill and finishing of final\r\n\r\ndosage  forms and biotech products. Although smaller in  size,\r\n\r\nthe  medical  technology industry is also expanding  strongly.\r\n\r\nLast year, it enjoyed a 14% growth in manufacturing output and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontributed  the remaining 20% of Biomedical Sciences  output.\r\n\r\nOver  time,  the increase in the number of plants and  product\r\n\r\ntypes  will  also smoothen output patterns. As the  Biomedical\r\n\r\nSciences  cluster  develops greater  breadth  and  depth,  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  pattern  will likely be more stable. In  this  regard,\r\n\r\nrather   than  greater  volatility,  investing  in  Biomedical\r\n\r\nSciences  can help to even out the growth of the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, media reports on monthly figures have\r\n\r\ncharacterised  the pharmaceutical segment as \"volatile\".  This\r\n\r\nis  not  accurate. There are no inherent swings in demand  for\r\n\r\npharmaceutical  products  per se. Rather,  the  variations  in\r\n\r\noutput  from  month to month are due to the way pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nproducts  are  made.  Pharmaceutical  companies  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nmanufacture active ingredients for global markets in  batches,\r\n\r\nto take advantage of the high degree of flexibility of our new\r\n\r\n\"multi-product\" plants. The plants are designed to  be  multi-purpose  and  produce  different  batches  of  ingredients  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  times  of the year. Each batch of  ingredients  has\r\n\r\ndifferent  value  and market requirements. The  batch-oriented\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  process  is  a major  reason  for  the  seeming\r\n\r\nvolatility in Biomedical Sciences output from one month to the\r\n\r\nnext.  It would be more accurate to measure performance  on  a\r\n\r\nyear-to-year  basis, which shows that the Biomedical  Sciences\r\n\r\ncluster  has  achieved strong and consistent growth  in  total\r\n\r\noutput, employment and value added for the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has also recommended a number of strategies to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  more  diversified economy. This includes  developing\r\n\r\nexportable  services and encouraging greater  entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nto complement the MNCs.  Our national objective is to build  a\r\n\r\nglobalised, diversified and entrepreneurial economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  if, in addition to placing emphasis on sectors  such\r\n\r\nas pharmaceuticals and biomedical, the Ministry would continue\r\n\r\nto ensure that sectors which may not be identified as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth areas but which are equally viable, for instance, those\r\n\r\nproposed  by small and medium enterprises, would also  receive\r\n\r\nequal attention or help?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Absolutely.

In the past year, the European Commission has\r\n\r\nbeen holding consultations with industry on whether there is a\r\n\r\nstrong  business  case  for such an FTA.  The  Commission  has\r\n\r\nindicated on various occasions that its current priority is to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on the Doha Development Agenda and that it prefers\r\n\r\nto  consider new FTA initiatives only after its completion  in\r\n\r\n2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the EU's economic engagement with ASEAN,\r\n\r\nCommissioner  Lamy has informed me that he  is  working  on  a\r\n\r\nflexible  framework  which takes into  account  the  different\r\n\r\nstages of development of the 10 ASEAN countries.

Some time this year, we will start negotiations  with\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand and Chile for a P3 (Pacific Three) FTA which will\r\n\r\nenter three corners of the Pacific.  In March, we will begin a\r\n\r\njoint study with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea on a Korea-Singapore FTA with a view to launching\r\n\r\nnegotiations  after that later this year.  In  April,  we  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to   launch negotiations with India on a Comprehensive\r\n\r\nEconomic Partnership Agreement which will include an FTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With China, we are engaged in FTA negotiations as a\r\n\r\nmember of ASEAN.  A framework agreement incorporating an Early\r\n\r\nHarvest was signed by the leaders in Phnom Penh last year.  We\r\n\r\ncan  expect  to see the first round of commitments implemented\r\n\r\nas  early as 1st January next year, and for the final round of\r\n\r\ncommitments to be implemented by the end of the decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also involved in negotiations for an ASEAN-Japan\r\n\r\nComprehensive Economic Partnership.  This will complement  the\r\n\r\nbilateral  FTA  that we already have with Japan.    Similarly,\r\n\r\nASEAN has embarked on an FTA joint study with India.  Finally,\r\n\r\nwith  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  US-Singapore   FTA\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  the  US  is pursuing an  Enterprise  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\nInitiative, which will provide an enhanced framework  for  US-ASEAN economic engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximise the advantages of these FTAs, we must achieve\r\n\r\ngreater   economic integration in ASEAN.  Prime  Minister  Goh\r\n\r\nhas proposed the concept of an ASEAN Economic Community as  an\r\n\r\neventual goal.  We are now pursuing this idea with other ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers to see how it can be realised.  We are laying stepping\r\n\r\nstones to get us there.  One example is the Singapore-Thailand\r\n\r\nEnhanced Economic Relations framework, which is co-chaired  by\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Ministers from both countries. Another  is  the\r\n\r\ncooperation with Indonesia on Batam and Bintan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from FTAs, we are also expanding the range of\r\n\r\ninvestment guarantee agreements (IGAs) with various countries.\r\n\r\nIGAs   will  accord  greater  protection  and  certainty   for\r\n\r\ninvestments  into  and out of Singapore.  Currently,  we  have\r\n\r\nconcluded  IGAs with 27 countries, including China,  Cambodia,\r\n\r\nLaos, Vietnam, Germany, France, United Kingdom and some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern European countries.  Our FTAs also contain commitments\r\n\r\nover  and  above IGAs.  We also have on-going IGA negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  countries such as Romania, Russia, Myanmar  and  Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we recently concluded negotiations for an IGA  with\r\n\r\nUzbekistan  and Peru.  The agreement with Peru is expected  to\r\n\r\nbe signed about now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors will find it more attractive to invest in\r\n\r\nSingapore, so as to take advantage of our FTAs and  IGAs,  and\r\n\r\nthe greater economic integration of  ASEAN.

For\r\n\r\nexample,  our FTA with Japan enables some of our petrochemical\r\n\r\nproducts  to enter Japan without tariff which gives  exporters\r\n\r\nhere  a  major advantage.  Under the US-Singapore  FTA,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  hundreds  of millions of dollars'  worth  of  tariff\r\n\r\nsavings across a wide range.  A simple but graphic example  is\r\n\r\nthe  repair of US ships.  Before the FTA, any US ship repaired\r\n\r\noutside the US will have to pay a special fee.  With the  FTA,\r\n\r\nKeppel  and Sembawang can repair US ships in Singapore without\r\n\r\nthese  ships having to pay a fee and this of course encourages\r\n\r\nour  shipyards to go out to all US ships in the region  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  business.  These are some of the advantages  which  the\r\n\r\nFTAs can bring to our businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On existing trade patterns, the advantages in the initial\r\n\r\nyears  would  already be hundreds of millions of  dollars  and\r\n\r\nthey  will ramp up as various provisions of the FTAs come into\r\n\r\neffect.   This  is  the first order effect.   A  second  order\r\n\r\neffect  is  to exploit these FTAs, new investments  will  come\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.

Mr Steve Chia asked\r\n\r\nwhether  Singapore is aiming towards 100% self-sufficiency  in\r\n\r\nour  water  resources and, if so, when will this be  achieved.\r\n\r\nSir,  currently, we have two sources of water supply,  namely,\r\n\r\nwater  from  our  local catchments as well as untreated  water\r\n\r\nfrom  Johor under the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.  As  the\r\n\r\ntwo agreements will expire only in 2011 and 2061 respectively,\r\n\r\nthe issue of self-sufficiency does not arise until 2061.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before us is therefore not so much one of\r\n\r\nhow  soon we can be self-sufficient in water supply.   Rather,\r\n\r\nit  is  about  whether  we  can become,  firstly,  more  self-sufficient  by  2011  when  the 1961  agreement  expires;  and\r\n\r\nsecondly, totally self-sufficient by 2061 when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1962  agreement  expires.   And  the  answers  to  both  these\r\n\r\nquestions are: Yes, we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked whether the plans to increase the local\r\n\r\nsupply  can be speeded up just in case there is a need for  us\r\n\r\nto  be  totally  self-sufficient.  Sir, PUB has already  taken\r\n\r\nsteps  to  strengthen  our local water supply  system.   These\r\n\r\ninclude expanding the local catchments, launching NEWater  for\r\n\r\ndirect   non-potable  use  in  the  industry  and   commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings,  and  indirect potable use in our domestic  sector.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, PUB is also introducing desalted water under\r\n\r\na water purchase agreement with the private sector by the year\r\n\r\n2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these three initiatives will more than make up\r\n\r\nfor  the  supply of water from Johor under the 1961 agreement.\r\n\r\nAfter  2011, we will increase the amount of desalted water  in\r\n\r\nour  supply  system  now that the cost of desalted  water  has\r\n\r\nreached  an  affordable  level.  We  will  also  produce  more\r\n\r\nNEWater  as  it is not only cleaner than PUB water,  but  also\r\n\r\ncheaper than desalted water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by our Prime Minister at the launch of NEWater\r\n\r\non 21st February, there is therefore no need to renew the 1961\r\n\r\nWater  Agreement  when it expires in 2011.   We  can  also  be\r\n\r\ntotally  self-sufficient  by  2061  when  the  1962  Agreement\r\n\r\nexpires,  if there is no new water agreement with Malaysia  on\r\n\r\nmutually beneficial terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked what are the targeted quantities and\r\n\r\nproportion  of  NEWater and desalinated  water  that  will  be\r\n\r\nproduced by 2011 and 2061.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Singapore Green Plan 2012, our projection is\r\n\r\nthat  NEWater and desalted water will account for 25% of total\r\n\r\ndemand  over the next 10 years.  And this works out  to  about\r\n\r\n100 mgd out of a projected total demand of 400 mgd by the year\r\n\r\n2012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2061, the quantities and proportions of NEWater and\r\n\r\ndesalted water in our water supply system will depend  on  the\r\n\r\noverall supply and demand situations, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  as  the relative costs of these two sources and that  of\r\n\r\nother  potential sources made possible by future  advances  in\r\n\r\nwater  purification  technology.  As of  now,  we  expect  the\r\n\r\nquantity  of NEWater to be higher than desalted water  because\r\n\r\nit is much less energy intensive and cheaper to produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked for the reason for NEWater to be\r\n\r\npumped back into the reservoirs, thus raising cost.  Mr  Steve\r\n\r\nChia  is  right  to  point out that indirect  potable  use  of\r\n\r\nNEWater will cost more than if it is consumed directly.   Even\r\n\r\nthough  NEWater  is  cleaner than  PUB  water  and  meets  all\r\n\r\ninternational standards for potable use, we have decided to go\r\n\r\nalong  with  the  recommendation of the  international  expert\r\n\r\npanel  to  consume  NEWater  indirectly  by  mixing  it   with\r\n\r\nreservoir  water.  This is to follow the established practices\r\n\r\nin  the United States for more than 25 years.  We see no  need\r\n\r\nfor Singapore to set a new precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that we are not taking full\r\n\r\nadvantage of the lower cost of NEWater.  In view of the ultra-pure characteristics of NEWater, more than 80% of NEWater will\r\n\r\nbe  used in the industry and commercial buildings directly for\r\n\r\nnon-potable  use.  Sir, in this way, we can  still  enjoy  the\r\n\r\ncost  advantage  of  NEWater for the industry  and  commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings.  And yet, at the same time, we can free up more PUB\r\n\r\nwater for domestic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked what will be the estimated cost of\r\n\r\nwater by the time we achieve self sufficiency.  Sir, the  cost\r\n\r\nof  PUB water today is $1.17 per cubic metre plus 30% of Water\r\n\r\nConservation  Tax,  giving a total price of  $1.52  per  cubic\r\n\r\nmetre.   The projection by PUB in 1997 was that we would  have\r\n\r\nto   increase  the  cost  of  water  to  $2  per  cubic  metre\r\n\r\neventually, in view of the high cost of desalted water at that\r\n\r\ntime.   But,  fortunately, with advances in water purification\r\n\r\ntechnology, desalted water today costs much less than what  we\r\n\r\nprojected   five   years  ago.   But  more  importantly,   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of NEWater has further lowered the high  cost  of\r\n\r\nadditional supply of water in future.  We therefore do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  foresee the need to increase the price of water to $2 per\r\n\r\ncubic metre for some time yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Chia asked if Singaporeans are sold treated\r\n\r\nwater  at  S$5.32 per 1,000 gallons making it a whopping  445%\r\n\r\nmarkup  from cost.  Sir, treated water is sold to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nat $1.17 per cubic metre, or about $5.32 per thousand gallons,\r\n\r\nas  stated  by Mr Steve Chia.  However, I am not sure  how  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve Chia arrived at the figure of \"445% markup from cost\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the costs of collecting raw water and\r\n\r\nprocessing  it  into  treated water,  PUB  has  to  build  and\r\n\r\nmaintain  an  extensive reticulation system  reaching  out  to\r\n\r\nevery home, every factory and every building.  PUB also has to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  new  collection facilities, additional  production\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  expanded delivery infrastructure to  cater  for\r\n\r\nfuture increases in demand.  Let me assure this House that the\r\n\r\naim  of  PUB is not only to produce enough drinking  water  to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of Singaporeans and Singapore, but also to keep\r\n\r\nthe  price of water at an affordable level to the best of  its\r\n\r\nability in a sustainable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, as we will be\r\n\r\nrelying more and more on NEWater, can the Minister assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  there  will  be no long-term  health  effects  on\r\n\r\nconsumers?  Can he assure us that PUB is fully satisfied?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Ms Irene Ng\r\n\r\nfor  raising  the question.  Sir, I am aware that  in  today's\r\n\r\nToday  newspaper,  there is an article  on  NEWater.   Reading\r\n\r\nthrough  the article, it leaves the impression that the  long-term  health effect of NEWater is yet to be established.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI want to point out that this is not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain the situation in layman's terms. All\r\n\r\nover  the  world today, countries do introduce new sources  of\r\n\r\nwater  supply.   In every country, Singapore included,  before\r\n\r\nany  new  source of water supply is introduced,  there  is  an\r\n\r\nestablished requirement to conduct physical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntest, chemical test and microbiological test.  The findings of\r\n\r\nthese  tests are complete, comprehensive and sufficient  basis\r\n\r\nto establish the suitability for potable use of the new source\r\n\r\nof water supply.  In the case of NEWater, over a period of two\r\n\r\nyears,  we had conducted thousands of tests - physical  tests,\r\n\r\nchemical  tests,  microbiological tests - and  it  is  clearly\r\n\r\nestablished beyond any doubt that NEWater is safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the article in Today seems to convey the point\r\n\r\nthat,  since  there  are  two  animal  tests  still  underway,\r\n\r\ntherefore we have not established the long-term health  effect\r\n\r\nof  NEWater.   This is a wrong presentation of the  situation.\r\n\r\nSuch  animal tests are conducted all over the world,  not  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of introducing new sources of water supply,  but\r\n\r\nfor  the  introduction  of new drugs.   Sir,  any  company  or\r\n\r\nindustry  that  wants  to introduce new  drugs  will  have  to\r\n\r\nconduct  animal  tests, but not for the  introduction  of  new\r\n\r\nsources of water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may then ask: if this is the case, why did PUB\r\n\r\nand  NUS go ahead to conduct these two animal tests?  Sir, let\r\n\r\nme  put it this way.  The article is right to say that we  are\r\n\r\nbeing kiasu.  We want to be so sure and safe that, even though\r\n\r\nall  the  tests needed have concluded clearly that NEWater  is\r\n\r\nsafe  to  drink,  we want to make sure that,  on  an  on-going\r\n\r\nbasis,  we will continue to monitor NEWater, just to  be  very\r\n\r\nsafe.   In case something unknown happens, at least we are  in\r\n\r\nthere  to  monitor the development and, if need be,  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure this House that the safe potable use of\r\n\r\nNEWater is never in doubt.  I was not at the interview.  So  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  whether  Prof. Lee and Prof.  Ong  were  either\r\n\r\nmisquoted, or quoted out of context.

It  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in some places in USA, for example, since 1972.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  almost 30 years by now.  In USA today, the consumption\r\n\r\nof  reclaimed water has to satisfy two requirements.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  reclaimed water must be of potable standard,  meaning  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  able to meet all international standards for potable\r\n\r\nuse.   It  means the reclaimed water must be good  enough  for\r\n\r\npotable  use  on  its own.  Secondly, having established  that\r\n\r\nthis  reclaimed  water has met the potable  standard,  in  USA\r\n\r\ntoday,  they have stipulated that this reclaimed water  should\r\n\r\ngo through a process of naturalisation, meaning it is put into\r\n\r\nthe  reservoir, above ground or underground, and then  treated\r\n\r\nagain  through  conventional method  before  it  is  used  for\r\n\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other words, what we are saying is that even\r\n\r\nthough the NEWater plant in Singapore - using the words of the\r\n\r\ninternational experts - is the best of the best in  the  world\r\n\r\ntoday,  even  though the quality of NEWater is of the  highest\r\n\r\nstandard they know of, we still feel that, just to be  prudent\r\n\r\nand  cautious,  we  should  follow  established  international\r\n\r\npractices,  which is to let the reclaimed water go  through  a\r\n\r\nprocess of naturalisation in the reservoir before we treat  it\r\n\r\nagain for indirect potable use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> May I ask the Minister if he can\r\n\r\nconfirm  that  there  have been tests conducted  by  countries\r\n\r\noverseas who have used NEWater in an indirect manner and  that\r\n\r\nthere are no long-term negative effects of such use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, we have gathered the international\r\n\r\nexperts,  people  who are experienced in  the  area  of  water\r\n\r\nreclamation and who have done it for many years before to  sit\r\n\r\non  our Expert Panel for NEWater.  Take the case of USA,  they\r\n\r\nhave been doing that for the last 25-30 years.  Today, you  go\r\n\r\nto  Orange County, or Upper Occoquan in North Virginia, it  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear  that they have consumed reclaimed  water  in  an\r\n\r\nindirect manner for the last 20-30 years and there is no  sign\r\n\r\nat all of any long-term health effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that anyone, including the reporter of\r\n\r\nToday's  article,  who still has any doubt about  this  should\r\n\r\nvisit the NEWater Visitor Centre.  The whole purpose of having\r\n\r\nthe NEWater Visitor Centre is for members of the public to see\r\n\r\nfor  themselves and to convince themselves that NEWater indeed\r\n\r\nis safe and clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favourite exhibit there is one that blows up the pore\r\n\r\nsize  of  the  reverse osmosis membrane by 100 million  times.\r\n\r\nWith the enlargement, the size of the pores of the membrane is\r\n\r\nnow the size of a tennis ball.  In that exhibit, it shows that\r\n\r\npure  water is the size of a ping-pong ball.  As a  result,  a\r\n\r\nping-pong  ball can get through the reverse osmosis  membrane.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of an estrogenic compound, which could cause a\r\n\r\nchange  in  the sex of a fish, it is the size of  a  football.\r\n\r\nObviously, a football is much bigger than a tennis ball.   So,\r\n\r\nno  estrogenic  compound is able to get  through  the  reverse\r\n\r\nosmosis membrane.  In the case of a virus, it is the size of a\r\n\r\n3-ton  truck, compared to the size of a tennis ball.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase of bacteria, it is the size of a building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you go to the NEWater Visitor Centre, you can see\r\n\r\nclearly  for  yourself that NEWater is really clean  and  very\r\n\r\nsafe.   I  want to repeat that we have established beyond  any\r\n\r\ndoubt that NEWater is clean and safe.

Assuming that post-2061 there is\r\n\r\nno  new water agreement with Malaysia; assuming that there  is\r\n\r\nno  new  technology,  which is not  likely  to  be  the  case;\r\n\r\nassuming that there are no other new sources of water  supply;\r\n\r\nin  effect,  our  four  national water taps  would  have  been\r\n\r\nreduced  to  only  three,  ie, local  catchment,  NEWater  and\r\n\r\ndesalted water.  Based on PUB assessment, even if we are to be\r\n\r\nsolely  dependent on these three sources of supply  alone,  we\r\n\r\nwill  still be able to meet all our water requirements in  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  and,  at  the same time, do  it  in  an  affordable\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked what would be the projected mix for these\r\n\r\nthree  sources of water supply by then.  Again, our assessment\r\n\r\nis  that, firstly, we do not really have to use every drop  of\r\n\r\nwater  again, again and again.  In fact, all we have to do  is\r\n\r\nto  turn  every drop of water into two drops of  water.   That\r\n\r\nwould be enough for us to have a supply that is sufficient  to\r\n\r\nmeet  our long-term requirements.  Bearing in mind what I said\r\n\r\nearlier  that  more  than 80% of the  NEWater  would  be  used\r\n\r\ndirectly  for  non-potable  use in industrial  and  commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings, for a glass of water coming out of the tap,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  expect the contents of NEWater to be significantly higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  10%  established in other countries.

It is a closed loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked why not wait till the test results\r\n\r\nare  out.   Sir, it is very unfortunate that this article  has\r\n\r\ncreated  this  doubt in the minds of the public, including  Mr\r\n\r\nChia.  As I said, I was not at the interview.  So, I leave  it\r\n\r\nto  the two experts to clarify with the reporter whether  they\r\n\r\ndid  say  that  the  long-term  health  effect  has  not  been\r\n\r\nestablished.   But,  as  I  mentioned  to  you  earlier,   the\r\n\r\ninternational experts, in their report to the PUB, had in fact\r\n\r\nclearly concluded that NEWater is safe for potable use.   This\r\n\r\nquestion  of  long-term health effect of NEWater was  never  a\r\n\r\nconcern  because  it  has  been clearly  established.   It  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate that the article has now created this doubt.

Does it mean that the Government should now  stop  the\r\n\r\nsale of sugar in the marketplace?

The answer is no,  because,  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the day, the job of the research community  is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to discover new knowledge that we do not know  today.\r\n\r\nBut  just because they are pursuing new areas of research,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that we should now stop our life today,  as  we\r\n\r\nstill need to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure this House again that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  not have proceeded with the introduction of NEWater  if\r\n\r\nwe  were  not  fully  confident that the safe  consumption  of\r\n\r\nNEWater  was  beyond any doubt.

This  decision  is  the\r\n\r\nconsequence of a general shift in MAS' supervisory  philosophy\r\n\r\nfrom  prescriptive regulation to a risk-based approach,  where\r\n\r\nMAS  avoids micro managing decisions by financial institutions\r\n\r\nand  consumers,  and  applies supervisory  limits  only  where\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a risk perspective, the financial limits on car\r\n\r\nloans  were  unnecessary,  because such  loans  form  a  small\r\n\r\nproportion  of  total loans in the financial system,  and  the\r\n\r\nproportion of car loans that are non-performing is low.

This  is not the case.  Housing loans are significant\r\n\r\nfrom  a  risk perspective because they form a large proportion\r\n\r\nof  total loans in the financial system.  Unsecured loans  and\r\n\r\ncredit card facilities are smaller than housing loans, but MAS\r\n\r\nregulates them for prudential and social reasons.  Many  other\r\n\r\nregulators  around the world are likewise concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nrisks posed by rapid growth in property and consumer loans  to\r\n\r\nthe  health  of their financial systems.

This is simply not true.  Malaysian state vessels  - Navy and Marine Police - came into Pedra Branca waters for the\r\n\r\nfirst  time in June 1989, a good 10 years after the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nclaim  surfaced  in 1979.

Of these, two were successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high number of applications is probably because many\r\n\r\nmembers   of  the  public  thought  that  it  was  a   general\r\n\r\nunconditional  handout from the Government  which  they  might\r\n\r\nhave  a chance of getting.  But the CCC Assistance Scheme  was\r\n\r\nspecifically   to  offer  additional  help   only   to   those\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  with a monthly income of $3,600  or  less,  whose\r\n\r\nextra  GST  expenditure is not adequately offset  by  the  GST\r\n\r\noffset package.  The People's Association and MOF held a press\r\n\r\nbriefing on 25th January 2003 to clarify the rationale of  the\r\n\r\nScheme.   Recent  feedback from the CCCs  indicates  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of applications has tapered off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST Offset Package was designed with a 5% GST rate in\r\n\r\nmind.   Although the transition to a 5% GST rate is now phased\r\n\r\nin  over  two  years, the Government kept the  offset  package\r\n\r\nintact.

We would then analyse and  see  what  is  the\r\n\r\ndifference.  And if indeed the offset package he has  received\r\n\r\nis  less than the GST expenditure which he is likely to incur,\r\n\r\nthen  we  would  give him the additional assistance.   In  the\r\n\r\nfirst family, the amount of grant approved is about $105.   In\r\n\r\nthe second family, it is about $72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain that the CCC Assistance Scheme is not a\r\n\r\nnew scheme introduced by us.  We put in place this scheme when\r\n\r\nwe introduced GST in 1994.  If Members remember, Dr Richard Hu\r\n\r\nexplained why such a scheme was necessary.  I think he put  it\r\n\r\nvery  cogently.   Basically, we have  the  various  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes for Singaporeans which provide a safety net.   All  of\r\n\r\nus  have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in designing\r\n\r\nthese  safety nets.  But just in case people are not protected\r\n\r\nby  these  safety  nets,  then we have  this  \"mother  of  all\r\n\r\nschemes\" called the CCC Assistance Scheme where they just come\r\n\r\nforward,  explain how it has affected them and if indeed  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  adversely  affected,  we  will  provide  them  the\r\n\r\nassistance.  And that worked out quite well in 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round when we raised the GST, we have, of\r\n\r\ncourse, had the experience of the previous GST arrangement and\r\n\r\nwe have improved the offset package. The most important change\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  made this time round is the ERS  which  really\r\n\r\nhands  out  cash  grants  to  Singaporeans  and  we  are  very\r\n\r\nconfident  that  every Singaporean has got an  offset  package\r\n\r\nthat  more  than offsets the GST expenditure.  But because  we\r\n\r\nhad this scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1994, we thought we should not remove the scheme and still\r\n\r\nkeep  this safety net even though we know that having improved\r\n\r\non the offset package, the number of applicants would be very,\r\n\r\nvery  few and indeed it turns out that actually the number  of\r\n\r\napplicants  who were eligible would be very small.   But  this\r\n\r\nGST  change comes amidst the economic downturn, so more people\r\n\r\nare  in financial difficulties.  It comes about after we  have\r\n\r\nrun  the  EDRS scheme which unfortunately may have  given  the\r\n\r\nimpression to some Singaporeans that there can be handouts  if\r\n\r\nthey  come  to  the CCC and apply for it.   As  a  result,  it\r\n\r\ngenerated  this  big increase in the number  of  applications.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why PA and MOF took action to explain this.\r\n\r\nI  think we are getting this message across and the number  of\r\n\r\napplications has come down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister\r\n\r\nhas not quite answered my question on the cost of disbursement\r\n\r\nbut  it  does not matter.  Would the Minister consider cutting\r\n\r\nour  losses  and  diverting the cost savings  and  the  amount\r\n\r\nallocated  for  this scheme to other worthwhile  causes  where\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans can benefit from?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The reason why I did not answer the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  because I do not have the  data.   We  have  not\r\n\r\nestimated  the cost to run this scheme because this scheme  is\r\n\r\nrun  by  the  CCC.  So it is not easy to ascribe the  specific\r\n\r\ncost   to   this   system.   But  I  think   it   is   useful,\r\n\r\npsychologically and politically, for us to have this scheme so\r\n\r\nthat  whoever falls through the net knows that there  is  this\r\n\r\nscheme that they can come forward and avail themselves.  It is\r\n\r\ngood  for  us  and  although we may have designed  the  offset\r\n\r\npackage  comprehensively, we never know which  sector  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  missed  out.  I think it is right for us to include  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  We did not expect that many applicants would turn  up\r\n\r\nand  that it would be costly for us to administer this scheme.\r\n\r\nBut  the perception on the ground is that this is a free grant\r\n\r\nand everybody tries their luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, we have to take actions to make sure that people\r\n\r\nunderstand  the scheme properly.  I think it is  a  worthwhile\r\n\r\nscheme to run.  It will run its course and, at the end of  the\r\n\r\nexercise, people who felt that they have been disadvantaged or\r\n\r\nthey did not benefit from the GST package know that there is a\r\n\r\nrecourse  that  they can turn to.  And those who  tried  their\r\n\r\nluck had been given a hearing.  We calculated for them to show\r\n\r\nspecifically  that the GST offset package that they  get  more\r\n\r\nthan pays for the additional GST expenditure.  I think we also\r\n\r\nwin  a  convert to the GST scheme.  It is good for us to  keep\r\n\r\nthe scheme and not close it and divert the cost of running  it\r\n\r\nto other schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  the Minister says that it  is  worthwhile  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with the scheme when so far, only two  persons  have\r\n\r\nbenefited.   Does it make any sense for us to  have  a  scheme\r\n\r\nlike  this and we end up explaining to people why in the first\r\n\r\nplace  they  do not qualify at all?  Would it not be  possible\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister  to  look into  the  formula  by  which  we\r\n\r\ncalculate their eligibility?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained the\r\n\r\nbackground to the scheme.  If, when we introduced this scheme,\r\n\r\nwe  told  this House that we were removing this scheme,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  MPs  like Mr Tan Soo Khoon would have stood up and  said\r\n\r\nthat the Government should keep this scheme in case our offset\r\n\r\npackage was not comprehensive enough and, therefore, we should\r\n\r\nhave  this  safety  net to catch these people.   I  think  our\r\n\r\nintentions  are quite clear. We have designed a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nGST  package  but  the society has different segments  and  we\r\n\r\nprovide this safety net in case people feel that they have not\r\n\r\nbenefited  from the offset package.  We have run  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nPeople  have  turned up.  They were unsuccessful.   There  are\r\n\r\nsome costs to us in having to explain to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, personally, I think this is worthwhile because when\r\n\r\nyou  sit  down with the person and go through the calculations\r\n\r\nwith him, you convince him that, in fact,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  additional  GST expenditure that he has incurred  is  not\r\n\r\nvery  significant and the GST offset that he has got from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is significant enough to offset it.  So it may seem\r\n\r\na very costly and laborious way of convincing individuals but,\r\n\r\npersonally, I think it is worth it and, therefore,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  stop in the middle of  the  exercise.   The\r\n\r\nnumbers are coming down, so I do not think that it will  incur\r\n\r\ntoo much administration from now on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  not got my point.  Why do we  want  to  have  a\r\n\r\nscheme for which we have announced that there would be quite a\r\n\r\nbig sum of money - I cannot remember how much it was - and  in\r\n\r\nthe  end, we tell people, everyone who comes to us, that  they\r\n\r\ndo  not, in fact, qualify at all?  What is the point of having\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme?  I am in support of a scheme to  help  people\r\n\r\nduring  these difficult times, especially if it is  to  absorb\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in the GST, but I think what we would  like  to\r\n\r\nhave is a scheme that works and not a scheme that, in the end,\r\n\r\nensures  actually that from the word \"go\" when you apply,  you\r\n\r\ndo not qualify at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we must understand\r\n\r\nthe  objective  of the scheme. We started off by  saying  that\r\n\r\nwhen  we increased the GST, all Singaporeans would be expected\r\n\r\nto  pay  a higher GST component when they buy things.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, we have a GST package which will help them  offset\r\n\r\nthis  additional GST component.  And because of  the  ERS,  we\r\n\r\nmake  sure that everybody is better off with the GST  package.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  intention of having this scheme.   Because  the\r\n\r\ndesign of our ERS is by household type and therefore there may\r\n\r\nbe those people, for example, who stay in private property but\r\n\r\nat the lower end of the private property, who have high income\r\n\r\nlevels,  who may not be a national serviceman, and do not  get\r\n\r\nthe  extra GST.  So there may be a segment of people  in  that\r\n\r\nsituation  whose income level may be around $3,000  or  $2,000\r\n\r\nand  because they are not staying in an HDB flat, they may not\r\n\r\nbe  the  head  of the household and therefore do not  get  the\r\n\r\nbenefit through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Utilities  Save and the S&C grant, they  do  not  benefit\r\n\r\nfully from the offset package.  So these are the cases that we\r\n\r\nwant to cater for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we made this announcement, we have set aside a few\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars.  We did not make it a very big programme  to\r\n\r\ncater for this group.  We know from our calculations that such\r\n\r\nfamilies  ought to be very few, but from 1994  till  now,  the\r\n\r\nhousehold formations and the type of housing in Singapore have\r\n\r\nchanged.  I think Members would remember that when Dr  Richard\r\n\r\nHu  proposed this scheme in 1994, he was very concerned  about\r\n\r\nmany  of the families staying in the Chinatown area which  are\r\n\r\nnot HDB flats. They are not heads of households, so they would\r\n\r\nnot benefit from the S&C grant, the Utilities Save and schemes\r\n\r\nlike  these.  Therefore, we kept the spirit of that scheme  to\r\n\r\ncater  for such people who do not fall into the main  segments\r\n\r\nthat  would  benefit from the GST package.  The  intention  of\r\n\r\ndesigning  this scheme is good.  It is intended to  target  at\r\n\r\nthat group of people. As it turns out, that group is far fewer\r\n\r\nthan  we expect.  We have raised expectations.  People thought\r\n\r\nthat  it  was a free handout. They came and tried their  luck.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  turn them away, so we used that as an  educational\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE'S OVERSEAS INVESTMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Losses)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  Minister  for  Finance  whether  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nsuffered big losses from its overseas investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):</b> The focus of our investments is to\r\n\r\npreserve  the long-term value of our reserves.

The CPF Ordinary  Account\r\n\r\nrate  is computed based on the sum of 80% of the Fixed Deposit\r\n\r\nrates  and 20% of the Savings Deposit rates of the three major\r\n\r\nlocal  banks,  subject to a minimum of 2.5%, as  provided  for\r\n\r\nunder  the CPF Act.

But Mr Steve  Chia,  as\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  used  to work in the finance industry,  must  be\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with the concept of the difference between borrowing\r\n\r\nfunds from long-term sources versus short-term sources, and he\r\n\r\nshould  not confuse the two.  The HDB and the Government  have\r\n\r\ndecided, quite rightly, that we should use funds from the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard,  because this is a long-term source of funds which  are\r\n\r\ntaken  on  20-year repayment terms.  And as  anybody  who  has\r\n\r\nborrowed money to fund his mortgage from HDB will know,  these\r\n\r\nare   often   terms  running  from  10,  20   to   30   years.\r\n\r\nConsequently, it is a prudential and sensible arrangement  for\r\n\r\nthe  HDB to continue to rely on the stable source of long-term\r\n\r\nfunding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates which we see the banks offering right now are,\r\n\r\nin a sense, promotional rates.  To give Members an example, if\r\n\r\nwe  look at what the concessionary rate had been for HDB  over\r\n\r\nthe last three years, it had been flat at 2.6%.  For those who\r\n\r\nhave  borrowed  money  from banks, if  we  look  at  the  non-promotional rates over the last three years, it had, in  fact,\r\n\r\nbeen  at  around  5 or 6%, more than double the  concessionary\r\n\r\nrate which HDB had been charging.  So, what we have right  now\r\n\r\nis a sensible, safe and a secure system that works.  2.6% is a\r\n\r\nreasonable rate to pay for any mortgage.  And anyone  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  this business for any length of time will know  that\r\n\r\nthis  is a system that works; this is a system that is secure.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we have provided choices.

Last year began  promisingly.\r\n\r\nDespite the uncertainties of the war against terrorism and the\r\n\r\nconflicts  in the Middle East, initially the recovery  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States economy boosted our growth prospects.   But  as\r\n\r\nthe  year  progressed, a wave of corporate  scandals  and  the\r\n\r\nWorldCom and Enron collapses shook the confidence of investors\r\n\r\nand consumers.  This slowed down the US economy.  The European\r\n\r\nUnion  (EU) and Japanese economies also lost steam.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  East Asian economies did well.  Our exports to China grew\r\n\r\nstrongly, but this was not enough to make up for the  fall  in\r\n\r\nexternal demand elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the unfavourable conditions, our economy grew by\r\n\r\n2.2%  in  2002.   Unemployment peaked at  4.6%,  but  improved\r\n\r\nslightly  to 4.2% by the end of the year.  Manufacturing  grew\r\n\r\nby  8.3%  driven  largely  by the small,  but  fast-expanding,\r\n\r\nbiomedical   science  cluster.   Exports  remained  resilient,\r\n\r\ngrowing by 1.9%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore continued to attract investments. We garnered\r\n\r\nover  $9  billion of fixed-asset investments in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nForeign  manufacturing fixed-asset investments rose from  $6.6\r\n\r\nbillion  in  2001  to  $7 billion last year,  while  committed\r\n\r\nforeign  business spending grew by 35% to $1.5  billion.   The\r\n\r\nelectronics cluster continued to attract the largest share  of\r\n\r\ninvestments followed by the chemicals cluster.  Investments in\r\n\r\nbiomedical  projects generated the second highest  value-added\r\n\r\nfor the economy.  All these investments are expected to create\r\n\r\n21,000 jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite some public concern about the cost of living, the\r\n\r\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) last year fell by 0.4%.  Healthcare\r\n\r\nand  education  costs rose, but housing and car  prices  fell.\r\n\r\nLower electricity tariffs, cheaper accommodation and household\r\n\r\ndurables  combined to reduce housing costs by  2.2%.   Cheaper\r\n\r\npetrol   and   a   lower  road  tax  reduced   transport   and\r\n\r\ncommunication  costs  by  1%.  Basic  food  items  like  rice,\r\n\r\ncooking oil, meat, seafood and vegetables all cost less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government implemented a slate of measures to help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans cope with the downturn and adapt to the  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring.    Last  year,  our  training   and   upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes helped 36,000 workers learn new skills to match the\r\n\r\njobs  that  are  available or being created.   The  Off-Budget\r\n\r\npackage  helped all Singaporeans, especially the  lower-income\r\n\r\nand unemployed.  800,000 HDB households received 10 months  of\r\n\r\nutilities  rebates worth a total of $226 million.   A  further\r\n\r\n$110 million went towards helping Singaporeans through rebates\r\n\r\non rental and service and conservancy (S&C) charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Immediate Outlook</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Global</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the major uncertainty hanging over the world\r\n\r\neconomy is the prospect of war in Iraq.  Consumers are holding\r\n\r\nback  their  spending, and companies are  delaying  investment\r\n\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks we will know whether war is going to  break\r\n\r\nout.   Within a few months we will know how things have turned\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant worry is oil prices. After a war, they\r\n\r\ncould fall back to normal and give a boost to growth, or  they\r\n\r\nmay  stay high and slow down the recovery process.  The crisis\r\n\r\nin  Venezuela, which has significantly reduced world  supplies\r\n\r\nof oil, makes it more likely that oil prices will stay high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth in Europe and Japan this year is expected to\r\n\r\nremain sluggish.  In the US, the consumer confidence index  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  reached  its lowest level since  1993.   The  present\r\n\r\nprojection  remains  for a pickup in the second  half  of  the\r\n\r\nyear, bringing growth close to 3%, slightly better than 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Regional</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In East Asia, sustained domestic consumption should\r\n\r\nmaintain  growth  at  rates  similar  to  last  year,  despite\r\n\r\ntensions  in the Korean peninsula.  Exports from the Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian region should stay robust, as stronger demand from China\r\n\r\nshould  partially compensate for the weaker  demand  from  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  economies.  China is a large  and  rapidly  growing\r\n\r\nmarket  that offers many opportunities to nimble entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand companies.  India's economy too has much potential.  It is\r\n\r\nshowing  a  new  dynamism  and  a  more  outward  orientation,\r\n\r\nespecially in the southern states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic cooperation among the ASEAN countries is\r\n\r\ngradually deepening, for example, through the ASEAN Free Trade\r\n\r\nArea  (AFTA).  ASEAN  is also launching Free  Trade  Agreement\r\n\r\n(FTA)  negotiations  with China and Japan,  and  preparing  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  an  FTA  with India and  the  Enterprise  ASEAN\r\n\r\nInitiative  with  the US.  Terrorism is  still  a  problem  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia,  but after the Bali bombing, ASEAN  countries\r\n\r\nare cooperating more closely to combat this threat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Singapore</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the external conditions, I expect Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  to continue to grow slowly in the first half  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.   In  the second half, if the US economy and the  global\r\n\r\nelectronics  industry strengthen as we hope, Singapore  should\r\n\r\nalso  recover more strongly, and our unemployment should start\r\n\r\nto decline.  For 2003 as a whole, MTI expects GDP growth to be\r\n\r\nbetween  2% and 5%, although it is less likely to  be  at  the\r\n\r\nhigh  end of the range.  Like in 2002, growth is likely to  be\r\n\r\nnarrow  and  uneven across the different sectors.  A  broader-based recovery is not expected until 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Starting Well</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we now live in a fundamentally changed\r\n\r\nworld.   Singapore is at a turning point.  We  face  not  just\r\n\r\ngreater  economic  volatility,  but  also  new  political  and\r\n\r\nsecurity uncertainties.  Competition is keener and changes are\r\n\r\ncoming faster.  To stay in the race and ahead of the pack,  we\r\n\r\nmust   constantly  adapt  to  the  changes  around   us,   and\r\n\r\nrestructure our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of rapid growth and development, our\r\n\r\npeople  now enjoy a high per capita income and a high standard\r\n\r\nof  living.  But as our economy matures, it will be  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  maintain the same high rates of  growth  that  we\r\n\r\nexperienced  in the 1980s and 1990s.  Structural  unemployment\r\n\r\nwill  become  a  more serious problem.  Older,  less  educated\r\n\r\nworkers  who fail to update and upgrade their skills  will  be\r\n\r\nparticularly  vulnerable.   The Government's  fiscal  position\r\n\r\nwill  tighten  as  slower growth means less buoyant  revenues,\r\n\r\nwhile  an  ageing  population will lead  to  increased  social\r\n\r\nspending.  We must find new sources of growth or else stagnate\r\n\r\nand decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These challenges are formidable, but we can overcome\r\n\r\nthem.   Over the last 30 years we have built up our financial,\r\n\r\nphysical  and  human resources through toil and teamwork.   We\r\n\r\nhave strengthened our social cohesion and institutions.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshare  ideals  and  values that help us to  work  harmoniously\r\n\r\ntogether  for maximum results.  These key advantages  help  us\r\n\r\ntackle  difficult  problems  together,  and  restructure   our\r\n\r\neconomy for continued prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already begun the task of restructuring. In\r\n\r\nOctober  2001,  the Government announced the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Review Committee (ERC) to develop new strategies\r\n\r\nto  take  us forward.  Last year, the Government accepted  and\r\n\r\nimplemented two major recommendations of the ERC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we decided to restructure our tax system. We\r\n\r\nare  lowering  corporate  and top personal  income  tax  rates\r\n\r\nsubstantially.    This  will  help  to  retain   and   attract\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  talent,  and  thus  create  good   jobs   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we are raising the GST rate. The\r\n\r\nGovernment provided a generous $4.1 billion offset package  to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singaporeans adjust to the GST increase, and ensure that\r\n\r\nno  household will be worse off for at least five  years.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the Government is phasing in the GST increase  over\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  instead  of raising it to  5%  in  one  step,  as\r\n\r\noriginally planned.  This puts an additional $650 million into\r\n\r\nthe pockets of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we restructured the CPF to focus on the basic\r\n\r\nretirement  needs of Singaporeans and trim over-investment  in\r\n\r\nhousing.   This  will keep the burden of CPF contributions  as\r\n\r\nlow  as  possible, while meeting the essential  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the population.  To help older workers aged  50-55\r\n\r\nstay  employable,  we also capped employers' contributions  to\r\n\r\ntheir CPF at 16%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these ERC recommendations, we responded to the\r\n\r\nrecession  by  moderating  wage  increases  to  maintain   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and  retain  jobs.   Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\nguided by the National Wages Council's recommendation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwage  restraint,  which extends until June this  year.   Their\r\n\r\nwillingness   to   accept  these  sacrifices  reflects   their\r\n\r\npragmatism,  as  well  as  the close  tripartite  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the unions, employers and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clear response has distinguished us from other\r\n\r\ncountries.   Foreign  investors and analysts  have  noted  our\r\n\r\ndecisive  actions to restructure the economy  and  tackle  the\r\n\r\ndownturn,  as well as our support for difficult but  essential\r\n\r\npolicies.   This  is  a key reason why we  have  continued  to\r\n\r\nattract  investments,  even  as investment  flows  into  other\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian countries have declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Moving Ahead</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made a good start in restructuring the economy to\r\n\r\nsecure our future.  But this is a long process, and much  more\r\n\r\nwork lies ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, the ERC completed its work and\r\n\r\npublished  a  comprehensive report.  It recommended  immediate\r\n\r\nmeasures to help our economy recover fully from the recession,\r\n\r\nas  well as longer term strategies to make Singapore a leading\r\n\r\nglobal city.  These five strategies addressed our:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our External Ties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Competitiveness and Flexibility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Entrepreneurship and Singapore Companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Manufacturing and Services; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Human Capital\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the recommendations in the ERC\r\n\r\nreport.   These recommendations reflect the inputs of  over  a\r\n\r\nthousand  participants  from the private  sector,  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement, as well as the public sector.  The Government thanks\r\n\r\nall  of  them  for  their  efforts and  contributions.   Their\r\n\r\nproposals provided a sound basis for revitalising our economy,\r\n\r\nand  for  sustaining growth in the next phase of our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain these five strategies before I give\r\n\r\nthe  Government's response to the immediate steps  recommended\r\n\r\nby the ERC.  Later, in Part III of the speech, I will announce\r\n\r\nspecific measures to implement the ERC recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>External Ties</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first strategy is to expand our ties with economic\r\n\r\npartners globally and in Asia, especially Southeast Asia.  The\r\n\r\nUS,  the EU and Japan will continue to be our main markets and\r\n\r\nsources  of investments.  But we must also seize opportunities\r\n\r\nin new markets, particularly China and India, by deepening our\r\n\r\nknowledge of their business conditions and expanding trade and\r\n\r\ninvestment ties with them.  Singapore must make itself  a  hub\r\n\r\nfor  strategic  and high value-added activities  of  companies\r\n\r\nthat operate in our broader hinterland of greater China, India\r\n\r\nand  Australia,  which are within a seven-hour  flight  radius\r\n\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to deepen our economic integration with\r\n\r\nour  ASEAN  neighbours,  and make  ASEAN  more  attractive  to\r\n\r\nforeign  investors.  By combining our complementary strengths,\r\n\r\nASEAN countries can compete more effectively, and hold our own\r\n\r\nin manufacturing activities, even against China.  This is what\r\n\r\nSingapore is doing together with Batam and Bintan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small, open economy dependent on world trade,\r\n\r\nSingapore  supports  multilateral trade liberalisation  within\r\n\r\nthe  World  Trade Organisation (WTO) framework.   However,  we\r\n\r\nmust  complement  this with bilateral FTAs  with  key  trading\r\n\r\npartners to expand our economic ties and assure our access  to\r\n\r\ntheir markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already signed FTAs with Australia, New Zealand,\r\n\r\nJapan  and  the European Free Trade Association  (EFTA).   The\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for  the  US-Singapore  FTA  were  concluded  in\r\n\r\nJanuary.   We  look  forward  to  signing  and  ratifying  the\r\n\r\nagreement this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently negotiating FTAs with Canada and Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe will also launch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na trilateral FTA with New Zealand and Chile.  We are likely to\r\n\r\nlaunch  FTA  talks with India and also South Korea this  year.\r\n\r\nAs  part  of ASEAN, we are negotiating an FTA with  China  and\r\n\r\ndoing a study to launch an FTA with India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bilateral arrangements will save our exporters\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  millions of dollars in tariffs  a  year,  create\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  our  companies  to  expand  overseas,  and\r\n\r\nattract  more investments here to take advantage of the  FTAs.\r\n\r\nThis will result in more jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Competitiveness and Flexibility</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second strategy is to strengthen our competitiveness,\r\n\r\nand  enhance the flexibility of the economy.  Given our  small\r\n\r\nland  area  and our dependence on imported energy,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncompete based on costs alone, against larger countries  better\r\n\r\nendowed with natural resources.  Instead, we must redouble our\r\n\r\nefforts  to  improve  our  microeconomic  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.  We must offer a superior business environment and\r\n\r\nan internationally competitive cost structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to keeping taxes low,\r\n\r\nespecially direct taxes on companies and individuals, in order\r\n\r\nto  keep the burden of government light, encourage investments\r\n\r\nand reward enterprise.  We believe that a 20% tax rate will be\r\n\r\nhighly   competitive,   but  we   will   continue   to   track\r\n\r\ninternational trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF must stay focused on its core purposes of\r\n\r\nproviding basic financial security in retirement, housing  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare   for   the  majority  of  Singaporeans.    To   be\r\n\r\nsustainable  over  the long term, the CPF must  not  become  a\r\n\r\nheavy  imposition on employers that deters them from employing\r\n\r\nworkers or growing their businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour market must be flexible, so that workers can\r\n\r\nmove freely from one job to another, and companies can hire or\r\n\r\nshed  workers  when  they  need to.  The  more  difficult  and\r\n\r\nexpensive it is for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  downsize, the more reluctant they  will  be  to\r\n\r\nemploy   people   in  the  first  place.   This   will   raise\r\n\r\nunemployment, to the detriment of workers, as has happened  in\r\n\r\nGermany.   Work  arrangements such as overtime practices  must\r\n\r\nbecome  more  flexible to accommodate the  ups  and  downs  in\r\n\r\nbusiness  conditions.  Our wages need to reflect the worth  of\r\n\r\nthe  job  and  the  contribution of the employee,  instead  of\r\n\r\ndepending rigidly on the seniority of the person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, competitively priced infrastructure will help\r\n\r\nkeep  business  costs low.  We should not  subsidise  services\r\n\r\nbelow  their  true cost, but nor should we allow  monopoly  or\r\n\r\ncost-plus pricing to inflate costs for other businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is one of the most important factors of production.\r\n\r\nTo  make optimum use of this resource, the land market must be\r\n\r\nefficient  and flexible.  This is especially so for industrial\r\n\r\nland,  because MNC projects can go to any number of countries.\r\n\r\nHence we must ensure an adequate supply of industrial land  at\r\n\r\na  competitive price.  We can do so, because we have  reserved\r\n\r\nenough   industrial  land  to  meet  the  needs  of  a   large\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must improve the quality and efficiency of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  services  like utilities  and  port  services.\r\n\r\nNEWater  is an economical, assured and high quality source  of\r\n\r\nwater  which  complements our other water  sources.   It  will\r\n\r\nadequately  meet the needs of both industries and  households.\r\n\r\nIn   the   electricity  market,  competition  in  a   properly\r\n\r\nstructured  industry will ensure that electricity is  produced\r\n\r\nand  supplied  as efficiently as possible.  Since  we  started\r\n\r\nrestructuring  the electricity industry in 1995,  productivity\r\n\r\nper worker has increased by 60%, and tariffs have come down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In port services, PSA Corporation has cut tariffs and\r\n\r\ngiven  $300 million worth of rebates to shippers, in order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  better  value  to  its customers.   To  meet  growing\r\n\r\ncompetition, PSA must cut its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts  and  be  as  lean as possible.   This  is  why  PSA  is\r\n\r\nretrenching its staff and rationalising its operations.  These\r\n\r\nsteps  are  painful, but unavoidable if PSA  is  to  grow  its\r\n\r\nmarket share, and remain the world's port of call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Entrepreneurship and Singapore Companies</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third strategy is to encourage the spirit of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship among Singaporeans.  To thrive in a  volatile\r\n\r\nand  unpredictable environment, and to ride on the  growth  of\r\n\r\nemerging regional markets, Singaporeans must take risks, seize\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  create new possibilities  for  themselves.\r\n\r\nEvery Singaporean must rely on his own wits and initiative, in\r\n\r\norder  to respond quickly and supplely when conditions change.\r\n\r\nIt  is heartening that despite the slow economic growth, about\r\n\r\n600 more new businesses were registered last year compared  to\r\n\r\nthe previous year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship is not just for the minority of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who take the plunge and start up new  businesses.\r\n\r\nIt  is a mindset that all of us should share.  It must pervade\r\n\r\nall businesses, large and small, as well as the public sector.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore, an entrepreneurial and innovative civil service\r\n\r\nbureaucracy must not be a contradiction in terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government policies will help to foster entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nLow  direct taxes will allow successful entrepreneurs to  keep\r\n\r\nmore  of  the  fruits  of their labour.  Improvements  to  the\r\n\r\neducation system will expose Singaporeans to business concepts\r\n\r\nfrom  an  early  age.   The  public sector  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nsimplify   its  rules  and  procedures  and  cut   red   tape.\r\n\r\nMinistries  and statutory boards will avoid crowding  out  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  by spawning companies to do things  that  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship requires talent. While we develop our\r\n\r\nown  talent, we must also attract entrepreneurs from all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world to launch ventures and develop ideas here.   To  do\r\n\r\nso, we must offer an environment in which good ideas stand the\r\n\r\nbest chance to be nurtured and take off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing entrepreneurs will also depend on our social\r\n\r\nvalues.  A society that prizes self-reliance is more likely to\r\n\r\nproduce  winners.  So is one in which winners are  celebrated,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  unsuccessful are encouraged to  learn  from  their\r\n\r\nmistakes and try again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must become such a society. Then we can produce a\r\n\r\nconstant  stream of dynamic start-up companies, some of  which\r\n\r\nwill  grow into major players.  Our established companies  can\r\n\r\nalso  develop  into internationally competitive  firms.   This\r\n\r\nwill enable us to continually renew our economy, staying ahead\r\n\r\nof others through innovation and enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Manufacturing and Services</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must promote manufacturing and services as\r\n\r\ntwin  engines of growth.  Manufacturing will remain a mainstay\r\n\r\nof  our economy.  Our strong manufacturing base generates  80%\r\n\r\nof  our exports, sustains many domestic support industries and\r\n\r\nprovides  good  jobs for Singaporeans.  We  must  continue  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen and upgrade this key economic sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries too are relying on manufacturing to spur\r\n\r\ntheir economic development.  Competition is fierce, especially\r\n\r\nfrom  emerging players like China.  They do not just  rely  on\r\n\r\ntheir low costs.  They are also upgrading their technical know-how,  and moving into higher value-added activities.  We  have\r\n\r\nno  choice but to upgrade our own manufacturing technology, or\r\n\r\nelse see our manufacturing sector hollowed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the manufacturing sector, we must acquire\r\n\r\nnew  technologies and capabilities.  Research and  development\r\n\r\n(R&D),  coupled  with  enhanced  protection  for  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty, are critical elements.  We must help Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ncontinually improve their skills and acquire new ones in order\r\n\r\nto push our manufacturing sector further up the value chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To diversify our economy, we must complement\r\n\r\nmanufacturing with a robust services sector.  Services already\r\n\r\nmake  up  about two-thirds of our GDP and overall  employment.\r\n\r\nHowever  we  must promote our services sector  more  actively.\r\n\r\nExportable  services offer good growth potential, because  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  middle  classes in China and India will  demand  many\r\n\r\nservices which we can provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already a key hub for seaport and airport\r\n\r\nservices,  logistics, trading, info-communications technology,\r\n\r\nfinancial services and tourism.  We will continue to invest in\r\n\r\nthese   areas  and  use  our  strong  position  to  meet   the\r\n\r\ncompetition from other countries.  At the same time,  we  will\r\n\r\ngrow  new  services industries like healthcare, education  and\r\n\r\nthe creative industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the services sector, the trend worldwide is to\r\n\r\noutsource  semi-skilled  jobs  to  countries  with  cheap  and\r\n\r\nabundant labour.  Many US multinationals have outsourced their\r\n\r\nback-end call centre operations to the Philippines and  India,\r\n\r\nlured  by  low  wages and an ample supply of English-speakers.\r\n\r\nPart  of  the training for call operators is to watch American\r\n\r\nTV  serials,  so that they can discuss the latest episodes  in\r\n\r\nthe  proper American accents, and make the callers think  they\r\n\r\nare  talking  to  people in the US.  So  in  services,  as  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  we  need to upgrade our  workers'  skills  for\r\n\r\nhigher-value jobs, and train enough workers in the skills that\r\n\r\nthese  new  services industries need.  Ultimately,  our  human\r\n\r\ncapital drives our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Human Capital</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fifth strategy is therefore to invest in our people.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a key prerequisite for the success of all our  other\r\n\r\nstrategies.  We must continue to develop our talent  to  their\r\n\r\nmaximum  potential.  Continuing education  and  training  will\r\n\r\nhelp our workers update their skills and keep their jobs.  The\r\n\r\nrecent changes to our upper secondary education system and the\r\n\r\nplanned  expansion  of tertiary education  will  have  a  far-reaching impact on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabilities  and outlook of the next generation of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe  new,  broader-based  educational system  complements  our\r\n\r\ntraditional focus on numeracy and technical knowledge  with  a\r\n\r\nnew   emphasis  on  independent  project  work  and   creative\r\n\r\nthinking.   It  will  enable  Singaporeans  to  thrive  in   a\r\n\r\nknowledge-driven economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, dynamic cities like New York, London\r\n\r\nand  Shanghai are competing for global talent.  This is on top\r\n\r\nof   the   considerable  talent  inflow  from  their  national\r\n\r\nhinterlands.  Since Singapore lacks a domestic hinterland,  it\r\n\r\nis  even  more vital for us to reinforce our own  talent  pool\r\n\r\nwith  global talent to sustain a sophisticated and  globalised\r\n\r\nknowledge   economy.   Singapore  welcomes   anyone,   whether\r\n\r\nentrepreneur, scientist, engineer, manager or artist, who  can\r\n\r\ncontribute to our growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also strengthen our links with the community of\r\n\r\noverseas Singaporeans, numbering some 150,000-strong.  Many of\r\n\r\nthem have a deep sense of attachment to Singapore and want  to\r\n\r\noffer their experience, expertise and network of contacts.  As\r\n\r\nour   economy  globalises  further,  the  number  of  overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will grow.  Our international network  will  help\r\n\r\nus  to  sense  what is happening in all the major cities,  and\r\n\r\nequip Singaporeans with the exposure and flexible attitudes to\r\n\r\noperate in a diverse world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Tackling Immediate Issues</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the measures in this year's budget are directed\r\n\r\nat these five strategies.  However, before I discuss them, let\r\n\r\nme  address the ERC recommendations dealing with the immediate\r\n\r\neconomic situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><u>CPF Changes</u></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF Restoration</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC recommended that the Government defer for two\r\n\r\nyears any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  restoration of the current CPF contribution  rate  of\r\n\r\n36%.   The rate would thereafter be restored progressively  to\r\n\r\nthe  full  40%,  although the pace and timing will  depend  on\r\n\r\nprevailing  economic  conditions.  The ERC  also  proposed  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with the other changes to the CPF scheme,  which  had\r\n\r\nbeen linked to the full restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts these recommendations. The\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy has not yet fully recovered from  the  2001\r\n\r\nrecession.   Moreover,  the current slowdown  is  not  just  a\r\n\r\ncyclical downturn, but a reflection of a fundamentally changed\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Even  as we pursue longer  term  strategies  to\r\n\r\nadapt  to  this  new  landscape, we must maintain  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitive position and make sure the recovery is  firmly  on\r\n\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferring any further CPF restoration for two years will\r\n\r\nensure  that we do not increase the burden on employers before\r\n\r\nthe economy has fully recovered.  It will send a strong signal\r\n\r\nto  investors that Singaporeans understand what is  at  stake,\r\n\r\nand are determined to face up to the new challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans have expressed concern that delaying\r\n\r\nthe  CPF restoration will hurt workers' savings.  But the more\r\n\r\nurgent  priority  now is to help them keep their  jobs.   When\r\n\r\ncompanies are assured that their business costs are not  going\r\n\r\nup,  they are less likely to retrench workers or move  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They may even be encouraged to hire more  workers\r\n\r\nas soon as business picks up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we will proceed to phase in other\r\n\r\nchanges  to the CPF system that we had intended to do when  we\r\n\r\nrestored  the  CPF contribution rate.  These  are  changes  to\r\n\r\nrestructure and improve the CPF scheme, and we should begin to\r\n\r\nimplement them progressively, giving Singaporeans enough  time\r\n\r\nto adjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF Salary Ceilings</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we will phase in the reduction in the CPF salary\r\n\r\nceilings.  The ceiling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  currently $6,000 for private sector employees.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe lowered to $5,500 in January 2004, and further to $5,000 in\r\n\r\nJanuary 2005.  The civil service will also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrationalise the salary ceilings of the public sector to  match\r\n\r\nthat of the private sector, including the pensionable officers\r\n\r\nwho have lower CPF contribution rates.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n              Table 1:  Lower CPF Salary Ceilings\r\n\r\n                               \r\n\r\n  CPF Salary Ceiling     Current      From        From\r\n\r\n                                     1 Jan     1 Jan 2005\r\n\r\n                                      2004\r\n\r\n    Private Sector       $6,000      $5,500      $5,000\r\n\r\n Public Sector (Non-     $7,000      $6,000      $5,000\r\n\r\n     Pensionable)\r\n\r\n    Public Sector        $9,333      $8,000      $6,667\r\n\r\n    (Pensionable)\r\n\r\n</pre>     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will refocus the CPF scheme on the basic\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  majority of the population,  rather  than  the\r\n\r\nhigher  income earners who are better able to plan and provide\r\n\r\nfor  their  future  financial  needs.   It  is  not,  however,\r\n\r\nintended  as  a  wage  cut.   As recommended  by  the  ERC,  I\r\n\r\nencourage  employers to pass on part of their cost savings  to\r\n\r\ndeserving  workers  through the variable component  of  wages,\r\n\r\nsuch  as bonuses or other variable payments.  This will depend\r\n\r\non  the circumstances of each company and the contribution  of\r\n\r\neach worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employee Contribution Rates for Older Workers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will phase in the lowering of the employee\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for older workers aged 50-55.  The  rate  is\r\n\r\ncurrently 20%.  It will be lowered to 18% in January 2004, and\r\n\r\nfurther  to  16% in January 2005.  These changes  will  enable\r\n\r\nolder  workers to take home more of their pay, and  will  help\r\n\r\nthem  when  their  companies phase out  seniority  based  wage\r\n\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n Table 2:  Lower CPF Contribution Rates for Workers Aged 50-55\r\n\r\n                               \r\n\r\n       CPF Rates         Current      From          From\r\n\r\n                                     1 Jan       1 Jan 2005\r\n\r\n                                      2004\r\n\r\n Employer Contribution     16%        16%           16%\r\n\r\n         Rate\r\n\r\n Employee Contribution     20%        18%           16%\r\n\r\n         Rate\r\n\r\nTotal CPF Contribution     36%        34%           32%\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Contribution Rates for Special and Medisave Accounts</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will phase in higher contributions to the\r\n\r\nSpecial  and Medisave Accounts for all Singaporeans.  This  is\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  savings  for old age  and  healthcare.   These\r\n\r\nchanges will be phased in gradually over three years, starting\r\n\r\nfrom January 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n <pre>                              \r\n\r\n Table 3:Increased Contribution Rates to Special and Medisave\r\n\r\n                           Accounts\r\n\r\n                               \r\n\r\n      CPF Rates        Current   From     From     From\r\n\r\n                                 1 Jan    1 Jan    1 Jan\r\n\r\n                                 2004     2005     2006\r\n\r\nFor workers aged 35 years and below\r\n\r\n- Special Account         4%      5%       5%       5%\r\n\r\n- Medisave Account        6%      6%       7%       7%\r\n\r\nFor workers aged above 35-45 years\r\n\r\n- Special Account         6%      7%       7%       7%\r\n\r\n- Medisave Account        7%      7%       8%       8%\r\n\r\nFor workers aged above 45-50 years\r\n\r\n- Special Account         6%      7%       8%       9%\r\n\r\n- Medisave Account        8%      8%       8%       9%\r\n\r\nFor workers aged above 50-55 years\r\n\r\n- Special Account         6%      7%       8%       9%\r\n\r\n- Medisave Account        8%      8%       8%       9%\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members need not worry that these changes will leave\r\n\r\nthem  with  less  savings in their CPF  Ordinary  Accounts  to\r\n\r\nservice  their  mortgage payments.  We  are  implementing  the\r\n\r\nchanges  over several years, during which we expect  wages  to\r\n\r\nincrease.   In  addition, the Government will give  those  who\r\n\r\npurchased  their properties before 1st January 2004  continued\r\n\r\naccess  to their Special Accounts to top up their CPF mortgage\r\n\r\npayments,  to the extent that these payments are  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Business Costs</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC also recommended that we keep other components of\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  as low as possible.  This the  Government  is\r\n\r\ndoing,  as I explained earlier. Besides wages, land, utilities\r\n\r\nand   infrastructure  services  all  should  be  competitively\r\n\r\npriced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several concessions which were introduced as part of the\r\n\r\nOff-Budget measures in 2001 were subsequently extended and are\r\n\r\nstill in effect.  They include the property tax rebate, rental\r\n\r\nrebates, and the reduction of the diesel tax on taxis and  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  petrol excise duties.  These four measures  are\r\n\r\nscheduled  to expire on 30th June 2003.  I have reviewed  them\r\n\r\nand will extend or modify them as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Tax Rebate</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to give a new property tax rebate for\r\n\r\ncommercial  and industrial properties for the  period  of  1st\r\n\r\nJuly  to  31st December 2003.  The rebate will be $2,000  plus\r\n\r\n15% of the balance property tax payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rebate will cut costs for businesses, both large and\r\n\r\nsmall,  who own their own premises.  It will give them greater\r\n\r\ncertainty amidst the current business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvironment.  The total property tax savings for the year will\r\n\r\nbe  $456 million, inclusive of the rebates given for the first\r\n\r\nhalf of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rental Rebates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebates on rental have been given to HDB's 18,000 tenants\r\n\r\nand  lessees, JTC Corp's 7,000 tenants, and the Singapore Land\r\n\r\nAuthority's (SLA) commercial tenants.  Some 2,900 stallholders\r\n\r\nin  ENV,  HDB and JTC hawker centres are also enjoying  rental\r\n\r\nrebates.   As business conditions remain weak, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill extend the rebates by another six months, till the end of\r\n\r\n2003.   These will lower business costs for tenants by another\r\n\r\n$204  million,  on top of the $200 million of  rental  rebates\r\n\r\nalready given for the first six months of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Diesel Tax for Taxis</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diesel tax for taxis was reduced from $5,100 to\r\n\r\n$4,700  in  the  2001 Off-Budget package.  I have  decided  to\r\n\r\nextend  this reduction by another six months, till the end  of\r\n\r\n2003.  This will cost the Government about $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Excise Duties on Petrol</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, excise duties on petrol are levied either at\r\n\r\nan  ad  valorem rate on final pump price before GST, or  at  a\r\n\r\nprescribed floor rate, whichever is higher.  If petrol  prices\r\n\r\nrise,  the  duties go up correspondingly.  This  adds  to  the\r\n\r\nburden  on businesses and motorists.  To address this, I  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to impose excise duties on petrol at a specific  rate\r\n\r\ninstead,  so  that  the duties no longer  fluctuate  with  oil\r\n\r\nprices.  This takes effect from today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new specific duty rates for various grades of petrol\r\n\r\nwill  be  set at the current floor rates of the petrol  excise\r\n\r\nduties,  taking  into account the Off-Budget reductions  which\r\n\r\nare  in  force,  so that there will be no increase  in  petrol\r\n\r\nduties after 30th June 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cost the Government about $60 million annually.\r\n\r\nDetails of the changes are in Annex A (Cols. 117-118).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760117.htm\">ANNEX A - CHANGES TO EXCISE DUTIES FOR PETROL (Cols. 117-118)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Foreign Worker Policy</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC recommended that we keep our foreign worker\r\n\r\npolicies   flexible,  so  that  companies   can   employ   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals   and  workers  they  need,   especially   those\r\n\r\ncompanies which cannot find enough local workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is to admit a controlled number of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  and  this  will continue to be  a  major  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage.    These   foreign  workers  help   to   keep   our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector  viable  and  competitive,  notably   in\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  and  ship repair.  They reduce overall  business\r\n\r\ncosts  and do jobs which Singaporeans are unwilling or  unable\r\n\r\nto take up.  In a factory, without foreign workers manning the\r\n\r\nthird  shift,  there would be no jobs in the first  or  second\r\n\r\nshifts  for  Singaporeans.  In services too,  foreign  workers\r\n\r\nhelp  many  local  companies to stay in  business,  especially\r\n\r\nSMEs, thereby creating more jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to strike an appropriate balance between\r\n\r\nmeeting industry's needs for affordable, skilled manpower  and\r\n\r\nkeeping  Singaporean workers from being displaced.   The  best\r\n\r\ninstrument  for controlling the number of foreign  workers  is\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  worker  levy.  This is a price  mechanism  which\r\n\r\nleaves  maximum  flexibility for the market  to  allocate  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  to  where  they are  most  needed  and  most\r\n\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, when our economy was hit by the Asian Crisis,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  sharply lowered the foreign  worker  levy  to\r\n\r\nreduce business costs.   Since then the levy rates have stayed\r\n\r\nat  the  same low level.  Last December, we extended the  levy\r\n\r\nreduction until June 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will extend the levy reduction for another\r\n\r\nsix months, until the end of 2003.  As foreign worker numbers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  remained stable, there is no urgency to raise  the  levy\r\n\r\nback  again.   The  only  exception is  the  levy  on  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  which is now just $30.  MOM will review the  skilled\r\n\r\nworker levy this year to decide whether it is necessary to peg\r\n\r\nit at a more realistic level next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help for Singaporeans</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the ERC recommended that the Government help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to cope with the current economic  difficulties.\r\n\r\nThese   include   employment-oriented   measures,   such    as\r\n\r\nencouraging  part-time  work,  augmenting  MOM's   job   bank,\r\n\r\nimproving job-matching efforts, and counselling and retraining\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.   They also include financial  assistance\r\n\r\nfor lower income households.  The Government agrees with these\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring Shares</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from helping Singaporeans find jobs, the Government\r\n\r\nis  also providing them with substantial support by offsetting\r\n\r\nthe  GST  increase  through the Economic Restructuring  Shares\r\n\r\n(ERS).  In FY 2002, the Government set aside\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$1.2  billion for the first tranche of ERS.  Most Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould by now have received their basic allocation of ERS worth\r\n\r\n$400.   To date, almost two-thirds of the ERS have been cashed\r\n\r\nout.   Some  lower income Singaporeans in 1-  and  2-room  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  and welfare homes failed to get their ERS because  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  top  up  their CPF accounts.   We  are  giving  them\r\n\r\nadditional   time   to   get  their   ERS.    The   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  are  contacting them  individually,  to  extend\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance, if necessary.  Those who apply  by  the\r\n\r\ndeadline of 31st March will get their ERS on 1st May 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Utilities Save Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to extend the Utilities Save scheme by one\r\n\r\nyear  to  help households, especially lower-income ones,  cope\r\n\r\nwith their utilities charges.  Households in 1- and 2-room HDB\r\n\r\nflats  will  enjoy rebates for six months over  the  one  year\r\n\r\nperiod from July 2003 to June 2004; those living in 3-room HDB\r\n\r\nflats  will get four months; those living in 4-room HDB  flats\r\n\r\nwill get two months; and those living in 5-room HDB flats will\r\n\r\nget  one month.  The rebate will be worth $35 per month.

We grew by an average of 7.3% per  year\r\n\r\nover the last 15 years.

I\r\n\r\nalso  estimated then that the surplus would turn into a  small\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $190 million after accounting for the package  of\r\n\r\noffsets, rebates and Economic Restructuring Shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the second column of the table shows, the revised\r\n\r\noperating  revenue is almost the same as the budgeted  amount.\r\n\r\nTax revenues were lower because of the cut in corporate income\r\n\r\ntax  to  22%  in YA 2003 and slower economic growth,  but  Net\r\n\r\nInvestment Income (NII) contribution was higher than expected.\r\n\r\nThe  revised  total  expenditure is about $1.0  billion  less.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  addition to the $1.2 billion special  transfer\r\n\r\nfor  the  ERS,  I  have  decided to  make  additional  special\r\n\r\ntransfers to the Lifelong Learning Fund (LLF) and the  Medical\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund (Medifund).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Fund is an important part of our\r\n\r\ncontinual education and training (CET) framework.  Established\r\n\r\nthree years ago, the Fund will be built up to a target size of\r\n\r\n$5.0  billion  to  ensure a secure and  continuing  stream  of\r\n\r\nincome   to  support  lifelong  learning  in  Singapore.    As\r\n\r\nhighlighted  by the ERC, we spend less on CET at the  national\r\n\r\nlevel  than on pre-employment, formal education and  training.\r\n\r\nI  have  therefore decided to transfer $500 million  into  the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning Fund, to bring the Fund  to  $1.5  billion.\r\n\r\nThis  will generate $60 million of interest income a  year  to\r\n\r\nfund skills upgrading and retraining programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medifund has helped many needy Singaporeans to pay\r\n\r\nfor  their  medical bills during this economic  downturn.   To\r\n\r\nenable  the Medifund to help more Singaporeans, I have decided\r\n\r\nto  increase it to $900 million through a $100 million special\r\n\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the revised revenue, expenditure and special\r\n\r\ntransfers into consideration, an overall budget deficit of $90\r\n\r\nmillion is now expected for FY 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Projected FY 2003 Fiscal Position</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the FY 2003 Budget, which is summarised\r\n\r\nin the last column of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating revenue for FY 2003 is estimated at $29.6\r\n\r\nbillion.  This includes $3.0 billion in NII contribution,  and\r\n\r\nis  $500  million  more  than the operating  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nprevious  year.   Total  expenditure  is  budgeted  at   $30.0\r\n\r\nbillion,  comprising  $20.4 billion in operating  expenditure,\r\n\r\nand  $9.6  billion  in development expenditure.   Taking  into\r\n\r\naccount the $600 million provision for ERS, the Government is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, projecting a deficit of $900 million, before taking\r\n\r\ninto account the fiscal changes in this Budget Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government turned in a budget deficit in FY 2001, and\r\n\r\nis likely to be in deficit again in FY 2002 and FY 2003.  This\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  third consecutive year that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nrunning a budget deficit.  But this is the appropriate  fiscal\r\n\r\nstance  to  adopt in an economic downturn.  During recessions,\r\n\r\nrevenues will fall, but expenditures need to be maintained  to\r\n\r\nfund  essential projects and services, thereby resulting in  a\r\n\r\nbudget deficit.  This deficit serves as a stabiliser to  steer\r\n\r\nthe  economy towards the path of recovery.  The Government has\r\n\r\ndone this previously, although not in recent years.  After the\r\n\r\ndeep  recession  in  1985, we ran a  budget  deficit  for  two\r\n\r\nconsecutive years, in FY 1986 and FY 1987.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the House that this Government has not changed\r\n\r\nits  longstanding  prudent fiscal  policy.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance continues to plan for a modest budget surplus over the\r\n\r\nbusiness  cycle.  In difficult years, we can accept a deficit.\r\n\r\nBut  we intend to accumulate surpluses in good years, to cover\r\n\r\nthese deficits and build up the reserves for rainy days.  This\r\n\r\nprudent and disciplined approach has kept the Singapore dollar\r\n\r\nstrong  and  inflation  low.  If we spend  beyond  our  means,\r\n\r\ninflation  would  go  up, the value of  Singaporeans'  savings\r\n\r\nwould be eroded, especially our CPF savings, and confidence in\r\n\r\nour currency and economy would fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must recognise that it will be more difficult\r\n\r\nto  balance  the budget in future, even after the economy  has\r\n\r\nrecovered.  Revenues will be less buoyant, as we lower  income\r\n\r\ntax  rates further, and as our GDP grows less rapidly.  On the\r\n\r\nother  hand, we will come under persistent pressure  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore,  especially  in healthcare and social services,  as  the\r\n\r\npopulation ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government expenditure has already gone up over the\r\n\r\nyears.   A decade ago, it was only 15% of GDP.  This year,  it\r\n\r\nwill be 19% of GDP.  This is still low compared to the 40%  or\r\n\r\n50%  share  of  GDP  that  the Government  takes  up  in  most\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.  This is the result  of  our  deliberate\r\n\r\npolicy  to focus spending on critical areas that yield lasting\r\n\r\nreturns, but it also reflects our relatively young population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In healthcare, for example, our national expenditure\r\n\r\ncurrently stands at 3.5% of GDP.  3.5% is much lower than  any\r\n\r\ndeveloped  country,  but this is not  solely  because  of  our\r\n\r\nefficient   healthcare  system.   It  is  also   because   our\r\n\r\npopulation  is much younger.  If our population had  the  same\r\n\r\nage profile as, for example, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUK,  then  based on our present spending patterns  alone,  our\r\n\r\nnational  expenditure  on healthcare would  be  7.2%  of  GDP,\r\n\r\nhigher than the UK's figure of 6.8%.  Similarly, if we were to\r\n\r\nmatch  the  age  profile of Japan, our healthcare  expenditure\r\n\r\nwould  be  close  to  Japan's  (6.6%  versus  7.4%).   As  our\r\n\r\npopulation  is  ageing rapidly, we must  expect  our  national\r\n\r\nhealth  expenditure, including Government's share,  to  go  up\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher Government spending will mean higher taxes. To\r\n\r\nkeep  taxes  as  low  as possible, we must  target  Government\r\n\r\nsocial  spending  to  reach  those  who  need  it  most.   One\r\n\r\neffective way to do so is through means-testing.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health  (MOH)  already  uses means-testing  to  decide  on\r\n\r\nsubsidies  for  step-down healthcare.   As  revenue  pressures\r\n\r\nintensify  in future, we will need to extend means-testing  to\r\n\r\nother  medical  and social services.  This  will  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntruly needy Singaporeans receive adequate support, despite our\r\n\r\nbudget constraints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Expenditure Priorities</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the Government's expenditure\r\n\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760079.gif\">TABLE 7:  SECTORAL SHARES OF FY 2003 BUDGET</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Social</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain the balance of expenditure\r\n\r\nacross  the  four  sectors:  Social,  Security,  Economic  and\r\n\r\nGovernment Administration.  Nearly half of the Government's FY\r\n\r\n2003  expenditure  will  be on social development.

From  next\r\n\r\nmonth, the Government will be providing an online consultation\r\n\r\nportal  on eCitizen to obtain public feedback on new policies.\r\n\r\nThis  will  include the consultation on the changes to  income\r\n\r\ntax laws following from this Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all Singaporeans are IT-literate. To help\r\n\r\nthose who do not have access to a computer or are not able  to\r\n\r\nuse  one, the Government has established eCitizen Help Centres\r\n\r\nat  CDCs  and  CCs.  This is part of our plan to  ensure  that\r\n\r\neveryone  may  enjoy  the  convenience  and  benefits  of   e-Government  and  e-services.  From March 2003,  eCitizen  Help\r\n\r\nCentre  services  will also be available from  private  sector\r\n\r\noutlets such as Fuji Film and NTUC Fairprice which sign up  to\r\n\r\noffer the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the cost of these improvements, the Government's\r\n\r\nadministrative  functions  will  only  consume  5%  of   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  As always, the bulk of Government resources goes\r\n\r\nto  the  operational  ministries to deliver  services  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  The Government sector will remain lean and efficient,\r\n\r\nand will restructure itself if necessary to deliver value-for-money services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In   my\r\n\r\nassessment,  our present rate of 22% is still competitive  for\r\n\r\nnow.  Therefore, I will not be reducing corporate and personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax  rates further this year.  Nor,  given  the  tight\r\n\r\nbudget  position, will I be giving any rebates on these taxes.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  reaffirm  the  Government's  intention,  which  I\r\n\r\nannounced last year, to bring the tax rates down to 20% by  YA\r\n\r\n2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Foreign Income</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Government has received repeated\r\n\r\nrequests  to  exempt  from tax foreign  income  remitted  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Until  now, we have resisted this  proposal.   We\r\n\r\nalready  have  a  comprehensive  network  of  double  taxation\r\n\r\nagreements  and unilateral tax credits, under  which  we  give\r\n\r\ncredit  for taxes paid on foreign income.  We may also  exempt\r\n\r\ntaxes  on foreign income from specific overseas projects under\r\n\r\nsection  13(8)  of  the Income Tax Act.  In practice,  foreign\r\n\r\nincome  which  has been taxed elsewhere usually does  not  get\r\n\r\ntaxed  again  in Singapore.  At least that's the  Government's\r\n\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also concerned that this exemption would create a\r\n\r\nloophole,   which  could  seriously  erode   our   tax   base.\r\n\r\nIndividuals  and companies could avoid tax on their  Singapore\r\n\r\nincome  by  round-tripping  and  transfer-pricing.   This   is\r\n\r\ndifficult to detect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the Government's view that this was not a\r\n\r\nproblem,  we  have  continued to  receive  feedback  from  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community, and now from the ERC,  that  taxation  of\r\n\r\nforeign   income  indeed  poses  difficulties  to   companies.\r\n\r\nCompanies  find the existing tax credit system more cumbersome\r\n\r\nthan  an  exemption system.  As more companies  globalise  and\r\n\r\nearn  a larger share of their income from overseas operations,\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be an increasing problem. Simplifying and improving  the\r\n\r\ntax treatment of foreign income will make us a more attractive\r\n\r\nbusiness hub and boost our services exports.  Moreover,  other\r\n\r\ncountries, for example, Germany, the Netherlands and Malaysia,\r\n\r\nhave shifted from the tax credit system, to exempting specific\r\n\r\ncategories of foreign income from tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to exempt from tax all foreign\r\n\r\nincome  in the form of dividends, branch profits and  services\r\n\r\nincome from 1st June 2003 onwards.  This will mean that  about\r\n\r\n90%  of  all remitted foreign income will be tax exempt.   The\r\n\r\nexemption   will  be  available  to  all  taxpayers,   whether\r\n\r\nindividuals  or  companies, but it will apply only  to  income\r\n\r\nearned from jurisdictions with headline tax rates of at  least\r\n\r\n15%.  All other foreign income will continue to be subject  to\r\n\r\nthe existing tax credit system.  This will curb round-tripping\r\n\r\nand  transfer-pricing  while keeping our  system  simple.   An\r\n\r\nalternative would be to impose anti-avoidance rules, but  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  complex to administer and burdensome to businesses.\r\n\r\nThe IRAS will release more details by May 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Domestic Interest Income</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC also recommended that interest income sourced\r\n\r\ndomestically  be exempted from tax.  Our current  practice  of\r\n\r\ntaxing domestic source interest income encourages funds to  be\r\n\r\nparked  offshore in interest-bearing deposits and instruments,\r\n\r\nthereby   benefiting  the  financial  and  commercial  banking\r\n\r\nsectors of other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to exempt from tax interest paid\r\n\r\nto individuals derived from standard domestic savings, current\r\n\r\nand  fixed  deposits.  This change will help  retain  domestic\r\n\r\nfunds  in  Singapore,  and also attract back  funds  currently\r\n\r\nplaced offshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption will be implemented in two phases.\r\n\r\nDepositors  with  POSBank already enjoy tax exemption  on  the\r\n\r\ninterest from the first $100,000 of their deposits.   From  YA\r\n\r\n2004, in addition to this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax exemption on POSBank deposits, I will exempt interest from\r\n\r\namounts  exceeding the first $100,000 in each of the  standard\r\n\r\nsavings,  current  and fixed deposit accounts  of  individuals\r\n\r\nfrom  the first dollar.  From YA 2006, the exemption  will  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  the full amount of these deposits of individuals\r\n\r\nfrom  the  first dollar.  This two step process  is  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  under  an  agreement between the Government  and  DBS\r\n\r\nBank, depositors with POSBank enjoy the exclusive right to tax\r\n\r\nexemption  on  interest  from  the  first  $100,000  of  their\r\n\r\ndeposits until 31st December 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exemption will cost the Government $43 million per\r\n\r\nyear.  The IRAS will release more details by April 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Portable Medical Benefits</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As workers get older and change jobs more frequently, it\r\n\r\nbecomes  more  important  for them to  have  portable  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.   This will provide them with medical  coverage  not\r\n\r\nonly  when they are in employment, but also when they  are  in\r\n\r\nbetween  jobs.  Furthermore, if a worker develops a long  term\r\n\r\nmedical  condition, without portable medical benefits he  will\r\n\r\nface difficulties finding another employer willing to take him\r\n\r\non and incur the expense of treating his medical condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this problem, the ERC recommended that the\r\n\r\nPortable  Medical Benefits Scheme or the Transferable  Medical\r\n\r\nInsurance Scheme be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portable Medical Benefits Scheme will involve\r\n\r\nadditional  contributions  to  the  CPF  Medisave  account  by\r\n\r\nemployers.   To encourage employers and workers to  switch  to\r\n\r\nthe  new  scheme,  I have decided to raise the  tax  exemption\r\n\r\nlimit for additional Medisave contributions for private sector\r\n\r\nemployees from 1% of an employee's monthly salary at  present,\r\n\r\nto a lump-sum of $1,500 per employee per year.  This will take\r\n\r\neffect from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, medical benefits are tax deductible expenses\r\n\r\nfor employers, up to a limit of 2% of payroll.  From 1st April\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2004,  employers who implement either of the new schemes  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enjoy a 2% deduction limit.  However,  employers\r\n\r\nwho  do  not  implement these schemes will only be allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeduct 1% of their total payroll for medical expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Entrepreneurship and Singapore Companies</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take the House through what the Government\r\n\r\nplans  to  do  in  response to the ERC's  call  to  facilitate\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Companies Act Amendments</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, the Government accepted all the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  Company Legislation  and  Regulatory\r\n\r\nFramework  Committee  (CLRFC) which aim to  simplify  business\r\n\r\nregulations, support entrepreneurship and lower  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nraising capital in Singapore.  Let me highlight three  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee's proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Business Vehicles</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce two new business vehicles\r\n\r\nnext year to give businesses more options in structuring their\r\n\r\nbusiness  activities.   The Limited  Partnership  and  Limited\r\n\r\nLiability  Partnership structures will  be  available  to  all\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  They offer limited liability to the partners,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the flexibility of being structured as partnerships.\r\n\r\nSmall  businesses  and  start-ups may  find  these  structures\r\n\r\nuseful for their business activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Company Secretaries</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lower business costs for private companies, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will remove the statutory requirement for  private\r\n\r\ncompanies   to   appoint  professionally   qualified   company\r\n\r\nsecretaries.  Although a private company must still appoint  a\r\n\r\ncompany secretary to keep proper records, it is free to choose\r\n\r\nbetween doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  internally and outsourcing the job to professional company\r\n\r\nsecretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Audited Accounts</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audited accounts will no longer be required for dormant\r\n\r\ncompanies, and for exempt private companies with small  annual\r\n\r\nturnovers.   This  will  reduce  compliance  costs  for  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  leaving them to decide whether they need  audited\r\n\r\naccounts.   The  annual turnover threshold for exempt  private\r\n\r\ncompanies will initially be set at $2.5 million, and  will  be\r\n\r\nraised  to $5 million after one year.  I have decided to  make\r\n\r\nthis  change in two steps after taking in feedback  from  both\r\n\r\ncompanies and audit firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative changes to the Companies Act will be made\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Concession for Enterprise Development</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the expenses incurred by businesses before trade\r\n\r\nrevenue is earned may not be eligible for tax deduction.  With\r\n\r\neffect from YA 2004, I have decided to regard the first day of\r\n\r\nthe accounting year in which a business earns its first dollar\r\n\r\nof  trade  revenue as the point at which the  business  starts\r\n\r\ntrading.  Businesses will benefit from tax deductions for  all\r\n\r\nrevenue expenses incurred during that accounting year.   If  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  able  to prove that it has started  trading  and\r\n\r\nincurred revenue expenses even earlier, it will be allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeduct these expenses as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Revised Overseas Investment Incentive</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Overseas Investment Incentive allows an\r\n\r\napproved  company to deduct losses arising from  the  sale  of\r\n\r\nshares  or  liquidation  of  an approved  overseas  investment\r\n\r\nagainst  its  statutory income.  To help our companies  expand\r\n\r\noverseas, I have decided to revamp this incentive to allow  an\r\n\r\napproved  company to defer its income taxes for two  years  if\r\n\r\nits  approved  overseas  investment  incurs  operating  losses\r\n\r\nduring  the  first three years of the investment.   This  will\r\n\r\naffect all new investments made from 1st January 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the tax changes to foster entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nare in Annex D (Cols. 121-122).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760121.htm\">ANNEX D - TAX MEASURES TO PROMOTE  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SINGAPORE COMPANIES (Cols.  121-122)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Government Procedures and Rules</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has underscored the importance of minimising\r\n\r\nGovernment  rules  and  regulations  so  as  not   to   stifle\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  The Government has set up several  channels\r\n\r\nto streamline and review its procedures and rules to make them\r\n\r\nmore pro-business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pro-Enterprise Panel is a joint public- and private-sector committee which frequently solicits feedback on rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations that can hinder entrepreneurs.   Out  of  500\r\n\r\nsuggestions  received from entrepreneurs  over  the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears,  50% have been implemented and regulations were  either\r\n\r\nremoved or relaxed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rules Review Panel of five Permanent Secretaries is\r\n\r\ncurrently  overseeing  an effort by all Ministries  to  review\r\n\r\ntheir  rules by the end of FY 2004, and thereafter every  five\r\n\r\nyears.    One  outcome  is  that  one-third  of  all  required\r\n\r\nstatutory declarations have been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, 12 Government licences are due to be removed\r\n\r\nin  FY 2003.  This includes a hatchery licence administered by\r\n\r\nthe  Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority.  Currently, Singapore\r\n\r\nonly  has  one hatchery and it is already issued with  a  Farm\r\n\r\nLicence.   Hence,  it does not make sense for  the  agency  to\r\n\r\nduplicate  its  regulatory efforts.  If Members  discover  any\r\n\r\nother licences which seem redundant or meaningless, please let\r\n\r\nme know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those licences which are still needed, and there\r\n\r\nare  a few, putting them online allows us to reduce processing\r\n\r\ntime  and costs for entrepreneurs.  BizFile is a fully  online\r\n\r\nsystem that cuts the time taken to incorporate a company  from\r\n\r\na   few  days  to  a  couple  of  hours.   By  July  2004,  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  will  be  able  to  apply  for   many   of   the\r\n\r\nregistrations and licences required to start up a company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough a single online form on the eCitizen portal.  From 1st\r\n\r\nMarch 2003, a new Government-wide authentication system called\r\n\r\nSingPass,  short for Singapore Personal Access, will  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  any individual who seeks to transact  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Public Sector Market-Testing</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from streamlining its rules, the Government will\r\n\r\ncreate  more  opportunities for businesses.   My  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nintroducing  market-testing for non-core  Government  services\r\n\r\nthis   year,  beginning  with  new  services.   Public  sector\r\n\r\nagencies will be required to compare the cost of providing the\r\n\r\nservice  in-house against the price quoted by  private  sector\r\n\r\nvendors.   If a private sector vendor can deliver the  service\r\n\r\nmore cost-effectively, it will be engaged to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Statutory Board Companies</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will progressively stop\r\n\r\nproviding  services  that  the  private  sector  can   supply.\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  statutory boards will no longer  set  up  new\r\n\r\ncompanies,  except  in strategic areas or  where  the  private\r\n\r\nsector is not ready.  The Ministries have started a review  of\r\n\r\nall their companies, to be completed by this fiscal year.   It\r\n\r\nwill   be  repeated  every  three  years  to  determine  which\r\n\r\ncompanies should be retained, and which should be divested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have so far identified a few dozen companies, mostly\r\n\r\nsmall, which are non-strategic and can be divested within  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years.   Two larger examples are Ascendas  and  PSB\r\n\r\nCorp.   Ascendas develops, markets and manages business  parks\r\n\r\nin  Asia,  while  PSB  Corp's core  business  is  in  testing,\r\n\r\ntechnology,  consultancy  and  training  services.   A  third,\r\n\r\nsmaller  example  is Hdbay, which provides interior  designing\r\n\r\nservices  and  develops  e-commerce  applications.   It   also\r\n\r\naccredits and recommends renovation contractors to homeowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Minister of State in Charge of Entrepreneurship</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the spirit of entrepreneurship is a long\r\n\r\nterm  effort,  involving  not just policy  changes,  but  also\r\n\r\nchanges in mindsets and culture.  The ERC recommended that the\r\n\r\nGovernment designate a Minister or Minister of State  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  Entrepreneurship 21 Ministerial Committee,  and  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for promoting and driving the diverse initiatives\r\n\r\nto  develop  a more entrepreneurial Singapore.

Mr  Raymond  Lim, Minister of State  for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,    who    chaired    the    Entrepreneurship     and\r\n\r\nInternationalisation  Sub-Committee  of  the  ERC,  will  take\r\n\r\ncharge    of    the   Government's   efforts   to   facilitate\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Manufacturing and Services</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce a range of new or enhanced\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  sustain the competitiveness of our manufacturing\r\n\r\nand services sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Intellectual Property</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On manufacturing, the ERC recommended that we move beyond\r\n\r\nbeing  a  production base, to become an innovative creator  of\r\n\r\nproducts  and  new businesses.  On services, the ERC  proposed\r\n\r\nthat we focus on exportable services, and develop new services\r\n\r\nlike  healthcare, education and creative industries, in  order\r\n\r\nto  service  the  region.  These are all high value-added  and\r\n\r\nknowledge-intensive activities.  Investors in these fields  do\r\n\r\nnot  look for the cheapest location, but for the country where\r\n\r\ntheir  intellectual property (IP) enjoys the best  protection,\r\n\r\nand where the environment is most conducive to the creation of\r\n\r\nnew  IP.

To make Singapore  a  key  node  for\r\n\r\ndeveloping,  managing  and commercialising  IP,  I  have  also\r\n\r\ndecided to introduce the following tax measures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Royalty Income</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage firms to hold their IP rights in Singapore,\r\n\r\nI  have decided to extend the Unilateral Tax Credit Scheme  to\r\n\r\nroyalties  remitted from all non-treaty countries.  This  will\r\n\r\ntake effect from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>IP Acquisition</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies can currently apply to EDB or IDA for writing-down allowances over a five-year period for capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  incurred in acquiring intellectual property  such\r\n\r\nas   patents,   copyrights   and  trademarks.    To   increase\r\n\r\nSingapore's  attractiveness  as an  international  IP  holding\r\n\r\nlocation, I have decided that writing-down allowances will  be\r\n\r\ngranted automatically, subject to the condition that the legal\r\n\r\nand  economic  ownership  of the IP lies  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nentity.   This  will  apply to IP acquired  on  or  after  1st\r\n\r\nNovember 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Patenting Costs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more companies to patent their inventions\r\n\r\nand  make  Singapore an attractive base for IP  management,  I\r\n\r\nhave  decided to complement the Patent Application  Fund  Plus\r\n\r\ngrant scheme with tax deductions for the costs of patenting an\r\n\r\ninvention.  This will apply to patenting costs incurred on  or\r\n\r\nafter 1st June 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Income for R&D</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the stockpile of funds for R&D activities\r\n\r\nconducted  in Singapore or controlled from Singapore,  I  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  introduce  a  new R&D incentive,  which  will  be\r\n\r\neffective from 1st June 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanies  under this incentive will be granted tax  exemption\r\n\r\non foreign sourced royalties and interest income that are used\r\n\r\nfor R&D purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provision of Information and Digitised Goods</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to facilitate the flow of online\r\n\r\ninformation  and  digitised goods  by  granting  exemption  on\r\n\r\nwithholding tax for payments made by end-users to non-resident\r\n\r\npersons.  This will take effect immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Integrated Industrial Capital Allowance</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing sector draws strength from its\r\n\r\ninternational  linkages, for example with  Batam  and  Bintan.\r\n\r\nCorporate  groups  increasingly split their activities  across\r\n\r\ngeographical boundaries.  Marketing or other high  value-added\r\n\r\nactivities  are concentrated in the main company,  with  other\r\n\r\nactivities distributed to its regional subsidiaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate this business model, I have decided to\r\n\r\nintroduce   an   \"Integrated  Industrial  Capital   Allowance\"\r\n\r\nincentive   from  1st  March  2003.   Under  this   incentive,\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  be  allowed to claim  capital  allowances  on\r\n\r\nequipment   that   is  used  by  their  subsidiaries   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Upfront Land Premium for Leased Land</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained earlier the importance of competitively\r\n\r\npriced    industrial   land   for   attracting   manufacturing\r\n\r\ninvestments.   Currently, tax deductions are granted  for  the\r\n\r\nupfront  land  premium  paid by  a  lessee  in  respect  of  a\r\n\r\ndesignated lease for the construction or use of a building  on\r\n\r\nJTC  or HDB industrial land, provided the lease tenure is  not\r\n\r\nmore  than 30 years.  This restriction was imposed at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  it  was  unlikely  for lessees to have  upfront  premium\r\n\r\nscheme terms exceeding 30 years for an industrial land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to undertake investments in\r\n\r\nSingapore over longer periods, I have decided to extend the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrent  30-year lease tenure restriction to a  60-year  limit\r\n\r\nwith effect from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Private Wealth Management</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we upgrade our manufacturing sector, we must also spur\r\n\r\nour services sector to become our second engine of growth.  In\r\n\r\nfinancial services, the development of world-class trustee and\r\n\r\ncustodian  services  in Singapore is integral  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndevelopment as a wealth management centre.  To support this, I\r\n\r\nhave decided to introduce the following changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I have decided to extend income tax exemption to\r\n\r\nforeign   trusts  administered  by  all  trust  companies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and not just those administered by Approved Trustee\r\n\r\nCompanies (ATCs) from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, by 1st June 2003, the existing lists of\r\n\r\ndesignated  investments and specified  income  under  the  ATC\r\n\r\nscheme will be replaced with an exclusion list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to reduce compliance costs for trust companies\r\n\r\ncurrently  having to comply with different sets of  conditions\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of income tax exemption for foreign trusts and\r\n\r\nthe  zero-rating  of  trustee  services  provided  to  foreign\r\n\r\ntrusts, I have decided to align the set of conditions for both\r\n\r\nfrom 1st June 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the current GST relief provision in respect of\r\n\r\ntrustee  services  will  be extended to  trust  administration\r\n\r\nservices  provided by a Singapore trust company to  a  foreign\r\n\r\ntrust of which it is not the trustee from 1st June 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from improving the tax environment for trusts, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  conducting  a  comprehensive  review  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trustees Act.  We must bring our trust laws  up  to\r\n\r\ndate so that they are relevant to today's needs and supportive\r\n\r\nof  financial sector activity.  This is critical in developing\r\n\r\nthe trust industry.  The revised legislation will be tabled in\r\n\r\nFY 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Approved Marine Hull and Liability Insurer Scheme</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided by our transport and logistics\r\n\r\nindustry  account for about 8% of GDP and establish  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  leading  centre  for  global trade.  With  intensifying\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  lower-cost regional  centres  and  changing\r\n\r\ntrade  patterns  towards  Northeast Asia,  we  must  transform\r\n\r\nourselves into a leading supply-chain management hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Approved Marine Hull and Liability Insurer Scheme\r\n\r\ncurrently  provides  tax  exemption  for  income  derived   by\r\n\r\napproved  marine  hull  and liability  insurers  from  writing\r\n\r\noffshore  marine hull and liability insurance business  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 10 years.  To further encourage the development  of\r\n\r\nmarine  insurance expertise in Singapore, I  have  decided  to\r\n\r\nextend  the Approved Marine Hull and Liability Insurer  Scheme\r\n\r\nto  also cover income derived from writing onshore marine hull\r\n\r\nand liability insurance business with effect from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Approved Third Party Logistics Company Scheme</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third party logistics companies generally undertake\r\n\r\nvendor-managed inventory operations where they import and hold\r\n\r\ngoods  belonging to foreign principals, and deliver the  goods\r\n\r\nto  local  customers  only  upon instruction  by  the  foreign\r\n\r\nprincipal.   In line with ERC recommendations, I have  decided\r\n\r\nto  introduce a scheme whereby qualifying companies can import\r\n\r\ngoods  belonging  to  them  or to foreign  principals  without\r\n\r\npayment  of  GST.  Under the new scheme, these  companies  can\r\n\r\nalso  move  goods to their customers who are under  the  Major\r\n\r\nExporter Scheme, and other qualifying companies under the same\r\n\r\nscheme,  without charging GST.  This scheme will be  effective\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Improved Global Trader Programme</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International trading is a highly mobile and tax-sensitive industry. Although Singa-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npore  has  flourished as a regional trade hub, we are  neither\r\n\r\nkey producers nor consumers.  Instead we have leveraged on the\r\n\r\npresence  of international trading companies to build  up  our\r\n\r\nglobal  reach.   As  countries around  us  develop  their  own\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  networks,  Singapore  will  face  stiffer\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Trader Programme (GTP) now offers a 10%\r\n\r\nconcessionary tax rate on all qualifying trade income.  I have\r\n\r\ndecided  to enhance and expand the GTP with immediate  effect.\r\n\r\nUnder  the enhanced scheme, an approved global trading company\r\n\r\nwould  be  granted concessionary tax rates of 5%  and  10%  on\r\n\r\nqualifying offshore trade incomes, depending on the  company's\r\n\r\nturnover and business spending.  In addition, the GTP will  be\r\n\r\nexpanded   to   include   high-growth,  medium-sized   trading\r\n\r\ncompanies.   This  will  give a further boost  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nstatus as an international trading centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Tax Holiday for the Singapore Commodity Exchange</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Commodity Exchange (SICOM) has developed\r\n\r\ninto  a  global rubber futures trading centre.   In  order  to\r\n\r\ncompete  with  other emerging exchanges in the  region,  SICOM\r\n\r\nmust continue to improve on its facilities and strengthen  its\r\n\r\nfinancial reserves.  I have therefore decided to grant another\r\n\r\nfive-year tax holiday to SICOM, with effect from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Submarine Cable Capacity</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage telecommunications operators to provide\r\n\r\ninternational  connectivity, I have  decided  to  exempt  from\r\n\r\nwithholding tax payments for the use of capacity on  submarine\r\n\r\ncables   operated  by  non-resident  persons,  with  immediate\r\n\r\neffect.  I have also decided that payments for the purchase of\r\n\r\nIndefeasible Rights of Use on submarine cable system  will  be\r\n\r\ngranted  a  writing-down allowance over its useful  life  with\r\n\r\neffect from YA 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Ministerial Committee on Services</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues involved in growing our services sector cut\r\n\r\nacross  various  Government  agencies.   Given  that   it   is\r\n\r\nimpractical  to  designate a single agency to resolve  diverse\r\n\r\neconomic and social objectives, the Government agrees with the\r\n\r\nERC  recommendation  to  set  up a  Ministerial  Committee  on\r\n\r\nServices,  which I will chair, to coordinate policy  and  make\r\n\r\nthe necessary trade-offs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the tax changes to promote manufacturing\r\n\r\nand services can be found in Annex E (Cols. 123-132).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760123.htm\">ANNEX E - TAX MEASURES TO HELP THE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES SECTORS (Cols. 123-132)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Human Capital</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the quality of our human capital underlies the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  all  other restructuring efforts, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  introduce  a  number of measures to  upgrade  our  human\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Continuing Education and Training</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, workers will to have to change jobs more\r\n\r\noften,  and to upgrade their skills continuously to keep  pace\r\n\r\nwith  economic  restructuring.  To help them,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  put  in  place a comprehensive continuing education  and\r\n\r\ntraining   (CET)   framework,   focused   on   enhancing   the\r\n\r\nemployability and competitiveness of our workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will establish a statutory board under the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower to enhance the development and promotion\r\n\r\nof   continuing  education  and  training  for  adults.    The\r\n\r\nstatutory  board will coordinate CET and employment assistance\r\n\r\nefforts by working closely with various economic agencies,  as\r\n\r\nwell as the private and people sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory board will build up professional\r\n\r\ncapabilities to strengthen the curriculum design and  delivery\r\n\r\nof  adult education and training, and promote the upgrading of\r\n\r\nall  segments of the workforce.

The ERC has recommended raising  the  course\r\n\r\nfee  relief  from the current level of $2,500.  The Government\r\n\r\nagrees   that  lifelong  learning  and  training  to  maintain\r\n\r\nemployability  is becoming more important in today's  volatile\r\n\r\nand  uncertain economic environment.  I have therefore decided\r\n\r\nto  increase the course fee relief to $3,500.  This will  cost\r\n\r\nthe Government an additional $6.4 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government has reviewed the\r\n\r\nconditions  for  claiming  course fee  relief.   Seminars  and\r\n\r\nconferences  are  becoming increasingly necessary  to  upgrade\r\n\r\noneself.  I have therefore decided to expand the scope of  the\r\n\r\nrelief to include seminars and conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, people may need to retrain not just for their\r\n\r\npresent jobs, but to prepare for possible career shifts.  I am\r\n\r\ntherefore  extending  the  relief  to  courses  that  are  not\r\n\r\ndirectly related to one's current profession.  To qualify  for\r\n\r\nthe  relief,  the applicant has to establish that  the  course\r\n\r\nresulted in a career switch to a relevant job within a  period\r\n\r\nof two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resident taxpayers who complete courses, seminars or\r\n\r\nconferences  starting from 1st January  2003  will  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nenhanced course fee relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Overseas Talent Recruitment</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Double Tax Deduction (DTD) for Overseas Talent\r\n\r\nRecruitment  Scheme  introduced in 1998  allows  employers  to\r\n\r\nclaim  a  further  tax deduction for approved  relocation  and\r\n\r\nrecruitment expenses incurred in the hiring of top talent from\r\n\r\nabroad.  The scheme helps offset the extra cost that companies\r\n\r\nbear to employ such persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to relocate is often easier if the\r\n\r\nindividuals  are able to bring their families with  them.

To discourage smoking, and  especially  to\r\n\r\ndeter the young from picking up the habit, the Government will\r\n\r\ntake  every  opportunity to raise excise duties on  cigarettes\r\n\r\nand other tobacco products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I raised the excise duty on cigarettes from\r\n\r\n$180  per  kg  to  $210  per kg.

The\r\n\r\nlow prices make such cigarettes more accessible to our youths.\r\n\r\nI  have therefore decided to tax cigarettes by sticks, instead\r\n\r\nof  by weight so that these cigarettes are subject to the same\r\n\r\nduty  rates  as regular packs of cigarettes.  Under  this  new\r\n\r\nsystem of taxation, the excise duty on each stick of cigarette\r\n\r\nless  than  1g will be 25.5 cents, and each additional  1g  or\r\n\r\npart  thereof will attract a duty of 25.5 cents.  So there  is\r\n\r\nno  point having an extra long cigarette.  To give traders and\r\n\r\ncigarette  companies time to adjust their  systems,  this  new\r\n\r\nsystem of taxation will be implemented from 1st July 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual revenue gain from these changes is about $194\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travellers can currently bring in tobacco products not\r\n\r\nexceeding 2 kg without a permit, by paying duty on them.  This\r\n\r\nis  equivalent to 100 twenty-stick packs of cigarettes.   Some\r\n\r\npeople  have  found  that  paying duty  on  cigarettes  bought\r\n\r\noverseas is still cheaper than buying cigarettes here.  I have\r\n\r\ndecided to lower the limit to 400g, which is equivalent to  20\r\n\r\npacks  of  cigarettes.

We  will  change from the Brussels  Definition  of\r\n\r\nValue (BDV) method to the Customs Valuation Code (CVC) method.\r\n\r\nThis  new  basis  will  exclude obligatory  expenses  such  as\r\n\r\nadvertising,  promotion, warranties, showroom and  warehousing\r\n\r\ncosts  from a vehicle's taxable value.  The effect will be  to\r\n\r\ndecrease the ARF and excise duty payable for most vehicles  by\r\n\r\n3% to 5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is consistent with our policy of gradually lowering\r\n\r\nthe costs of owning a car and raising usage costs, in order to\r\n\r\nstrike  a better balance, and enable more Singaporeans to  own\r\n\r\ncars.  For a typical 1,500 cc car with an assessed open market\r\n\r\nvalue or OMV of $15,000 under the existing valuation system, a\r\n\r\n5% tax saving would amount to about $1,100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  change  will take effect from 1st April  2003.   Details\r\n\r\nabout the valuation method can be found in Annex I (Cols. 139-140).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760141.htm\">ANNEX I - VALUATION OF  MOTOR VEHICLES (Cols. 141-142)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>ARF and Excise Duty Rebates for Wheelchair Lifts</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the elderly and disabled meet their transport\r\n\r\nneeds, I have decided to exclude the cost of wheelchair  lifts\r\n\r\nand other costs associated with the installation of such lifts\r\n\r\nfrom  the  OMV of a vehicle when computing the ARF and  excise\r\n\r\nduty  payable.

Childcare  benefits defray the cost  of  alternative\r\n\r\ncare  arrangements  for their children and encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nstay  in  the workforce.  I have therefore decided  to  exempt\r\n\r\nfrom income tax employer-subsidised childcare benefits paid to\r\n\r\nlicensed childcare centres with effect from YA 2004.  This  is\r\n\r\nin  line  with the Government's efforts to promote  pro-family\r\n\r\npractices in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Stamp Duties</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Stamp Duty on Leases</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, all property leases are levied with stamp\r\n\r\nduty.   To reduce the tax burden on families living in  rental\r\n\r\nflats,  and  the inconvenience to businesses and  the  general\r\n\r\npublic,  I have decided to exempt from stamp duty leases  with\r\n\r\nannual  rents  that do not exceed $1,000.   This  change  will\r\n\r\nbenefit some 3,500 households that start a new lease or  renew\r\n\r\nthe  lease of a 1- and 2-room HDB rental flats each year.  The\r\n\r\nexemption  will  also cover the fixed duty levied  on  99-year\r\n\r\nleases  that some 32,000 households enter into each year  when\r\n\r\nthey  purchase flats from HDB.  About 30% of all  leases  will\r\n\r\nnow be exempted.  Households and businesses can expect to save\r\n\r\nabout $340,000 a year from 1st April 2003 onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Seller's Stamp Duty</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seller's stamp duty on the sale of residential\r\n\r\nproperties  within three years of purchase was  introduced  in\r\n\r\n1996  to  curb  property  speculation  and  to  stabilise  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market.  It was suspended indefinitely  in  November\r\n\r\n1997 when the property market cooled down.

Donors  will\r\n\r\nhave the flexibility to decide if they would rather donate the\r\n\r\nsales  proceeds  of the asset, or the asset  itself,  as  both\r\n\r\noptions  will  now  allow  them an equivalent  amount  of  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><u>Stamp Duty on Donations</u>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, IPCs have to pay stamp duties when they\r\n\r\nreceive  donations  of immovable properties  and  shares.   To\r\n\r\nlessen  the  burden on IPCs receiving such  donations  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage bequests and donations from estates to IPCs, I  have\r\n\r\ndecided to exempt all donations to IPCs from stamp duty.

But\r\n\r\nwe  can  and  will  use our resources and  strengths  to  give\r\n\r\nourselves   the   best  chances  to  succeed,   whatever   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, the Government accepts the ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to revitalise the economy  in  the  immediate\r\n\r\nfuture  and  sustain growth over the longer term.   Vigorously\r\n\r\nimplemented,  over  a  decade  these  strategies   will   make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a leading global city, a hub of talent,  enterprise\r\n\r\nand innovation, and one of the best places in Asia to live and\r\n\r\nwork.   We  will  be  host to both global  MNCs  and  emerging\r\n\r\nbusiness networks linking up China, India and Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nOur  broad  economic  base  will have  services  complementing\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   industries,  start-ups   operating   alongside\r\n\r\nestablished  companies, and Singaporean companies  reinforcing\r\n\r\nMNCs.   These diversified activities will provide a wide range\r\n\r\nof  rewarding  jobs  for  Singaporeans,  either  as  knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers, skilled technicians, or semi-skilled workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change will not be effortless. There is no safe harbour\r\n\r\nwhere  our  ship  can  shelter to rebuild  and  refit,  before\r\n\r\nheading  out  to  sea.  In a rapidly unfolding situation,  all\r\n\r\nwork  must  be  done  onboard ship while we  are  sailing  and\r\n\r\nbattling the elements.

Under this regime,  taxi\r\n\r\noperators  will  be made more accountable for the  quality  of\r\n\r\ntheir  taxi  services, as they will need  to  meet  a  set  of\r\n\r\nQuality of Service standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taxi Operator Licence regime will require LTA, as the\r\n\r\nregulator,  to  closely  monitor  the  performance   of   taxi\r\n\r\noperators  and  their compliance with the Quality  of  Service\r\n\r\nstandards.   LTA  will  also investigate and  enforce  against\r\n\r\nerrant  taxi  drivers under the new Vocational Licence  Points\r\n\r\nSystem.  As  these are new activities, additional  budget  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources will be required.  The  licence  fee  will\r\n\r\nenable LTA to fund these activities relating to regulating and\r\n\r\nimproving the taxi industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA expects to analyse and audit fairly often the\r\n\r\nperformance records of the taxi companies for compliance  with\r\n\r\nthe Quality of Service standards in the initial 1-2 years.  It\r\n\r\nhas  estimated that it needs an annual budget of $5.3 million,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes the salary cost for 28 staff.  The  main  cost\r\n\r\nitems are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop and operate a new centralised computer system\r\n\r\nto administer the Taxi Operator Licence regime and the records\r\n\r\nof some 85,000 taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enforce the Quality of Service standards by analysing\r\n\r\nthe  radiophone  booking  systems of the  taxi  operators  and\r\n\r\ncommissioning  external  audits of the  operators'  radiophone\r\n\r\nbooking systems and their operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conduct investigations and enforcement against errant\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To monitor taxi services by conducting taxi surveys and\r\n\r\nauditing indicators submitted by the taxi operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are about 19,000 taxis in Singapore, this works\r\n\r\nout  to a licence fee of $25 per taxi per month. This is  less\r\n\r\nthan  1%  of  the  gross turnover of the operators.  (This  is\r\n\r\nminuscule and comparable to licence fees paid by operators  in\r\n\r\nother  regulated industries, e.g. telecommunications  sector).\r\n\r\nIt  amounts  to  less than 3 cents per taxi trip,  against  an\r\n\r\naverage fare of around $7.  As you can see, the licence fee is\r\n\r\nnot excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As LTA will need to set up the audit and enforcement\r\n\r\nframework, the work will be more intensive in the first couple\r\n\r\nof  years.  As the $25 licence fee is based on the budget  for\r\n\r\nthis  more  intensive phase of the regulatory work,  LTA  will\r\n\r\nreview  the quantum of the licence fee after two years, taking\r\n\r\ninto account the actual costs incurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Dr Amy Khor's concern that taxi companies should\r\n\r\nnot  pass  on this cost to commuters. We have liberalised  the\r\n\r\ntaxi   industry  to  allow  new  entrants  into  the   market.\r\n\r\nObviously, taxi companies will have to take into consideration\r\n\r\nthe  new  competitive landscape before considering passing  on\r\n\r\nthis cost through any rental adjustment or fare increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRESCHOOL GUIDELINES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Education how\r\n\r\nmany  of the preschools here have complied with the guidelines\r\n\r\nannounced recently by his Ministry and what measures are being\r\n\r\ntaken  to  monitor the progress of the preschools in complying\r\n\r\nwith these guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has announced various\r\n\r\nguidelines  and measures to improve the quality of  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore. The first of these measures  concern\r\n\r\nteacher training in the pre-school sector.  In December  2000,\r\n\r\nMOE  announced  that  all  kindergarten  principals  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired   to  obtain  the  Diploma  in  Pre-school  Education\r\n\r\n(Leadership)  by 2006. In October 2001, MOE further  announced\r\n\r\nthat  one  in  four teachers will be required  to  obtain  the\r\n\r\nDiploma  in  Pre-school Education (Teaching),  and  all  other\r\n\r\nteachers to have Certificates in Pre-school Teaching by 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been good progress made in the number of\r\n\r\nteachers  going for training among all the major  kindergarten\r\n\r\nproviders. MOE has an open channel of communication  with  all\r\n\r\nkindergarten providers and is keeping track of developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative undertaken by MOE to uplift the\r\n\r\nquality of pre-school education has been the development of  a\r\n\r\nframework  for  kindergarten curriculum, based  on  a  set  of\r\n\r\ndesired  outcomes  for  pre-school education.  The  curriculum\r\n\r\nframework was launched in January this year.  The framework is\r\n\r\navailable to all kindergartens, which are encouraged to use it\r\n\r\nas  a guide to design their own programmes that meet the needs\r\n\r\nof children physically, emotionally, socially and cognitively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE does not intend to make the pre-school curriculum\r\n\r\nframework a formal requirement for all kindergartens.  This is\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  the  Government's  approach  of  having  the\r\n\r\nprovision of pre-school education remain in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  and  community sectors. Such an  approach  encourages\r\n\r\ninnovation as each kindergarten operator strives to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of its pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, MOE is currently reviewing the legislation\r\n\r\nnecessary   for   regulation  of   pre-school   education.

Of these,  $94.4\r\n\r\nbillion  (or 97.9%) were invested in Government Bonds  and  $2\r\n\r\nbillion (or 2.1%) in Advance Deposits*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*  These are unaudited figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returns on the funds invested in Government Bonds and\r\n\r\nAdvance  Deposits are pegged to the same interest  rates  that\r\n\r\nthe Board pays its CPF members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest rate that the CPF Board pays on balances in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinary  Account (OA) is pegged to  the  12-month  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposit  rates (80% weightage) and the savings rates of  banks\r\n\r\n(20%  weightage). The minimum guaranteed rate for OA  is  2.5%\r\n\r\nper annum.  For balances in the Special and Medisave Accounts,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Board pays an interest rate that is 1.5%  above  the\r\n\r\nprevailing  CPF  interest  rate,  i.e.  at  4.00%  per   annum\r\n\r\ncurrently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board does not receive any interest from the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board (HDB), as the CPF Board does not\r\n\r\nplace any funds with the HDB.  As highlighted earlier, all CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  were  invested in only Government Bonds  and  Advance\r\n\r\nDeposits. The Government, however, does provide the  HDB  with\r\n\r\nmortgage financing loans at an interest rate that is pegged to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  interest  rate  to enable the  HDB  to  finance  its\r\n\r\nconcessionary mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board does not track the proportion of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with CPF OA balances greater or lower than  their\r\n\r\nproperty loans.  It is unclear why Mr Chia wants to compare  a\r\n\r\nmember's  CPF balance with his property loan.  If the  concern\r\n\r\nis  that  the member has used too much CPF for housing,  there\r\n\r\nare  checks against that, such as the withdrawal limit,  which\r\n\r\nat  present is equal to 150% of the lower of the valuation  or\r\n\r\nthe  purchase  price  of the property and would  be  gradually\r\n\r\nreduced  to  120% over the next 5 years.  If  the  concern  is\r\n\r\nabout  the  member's ability to finance his housing loan,  his\r\n\r\ncurrent  CPF  balance is a poor measure of  that,  because  he\r\n\r\ncould have withdrawn his CPF savings under other schemes, such\r\n\r\nas  for  investment under the CPFIS.  Also, he could  use  his\r\n\r\nmonthly  OA  contributions to finance his loan;  that  is  not\r\n\r\nreflected  in  his  current  CPF balance.  Hence,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nmeaningful to compare CPF balances with housing loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS OFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation if he will give a breakdown of the number of  bonded\r\n\r\nand  bond-free scholarships, offered by the Government and its\r\n\r\nrelated  organisations,  to  Singaporean  and  non-Singaporean\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government offers a wide range of scholarships\r\n\r\nthrough   its   various   Ministries   and   agencies.
