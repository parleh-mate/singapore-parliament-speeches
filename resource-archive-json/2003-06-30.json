Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  in  view of the current unemployment  situation\r\n\r\nand projected pessimistic employment forecast, whether he\r\n\r\nwill introduce additional financial assistance schemes to\r\n\r\nhelp  those  who  are unemployed and who  face  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  (a)  whether  he  is aware  that,  despite  the\r\n\r\nUtilities Save scheme introduced in the Budget, there  is\r\n\r\na  substantial number of households who are unable to pay\r\n\r\nutility  bills  and have had their supplies disconnected;\r\n\r\nand  (b)  whether he will introduce measures  or  provide\r\n\r\nspecific assistance schemes to help these households.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to\r\n\r\ntake Question Nos. 1 to 3 together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Because the Questions have been asked\r\n\r\nfrom various agencies, this reply is with the inputs from\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   of   Finance,  Ministry   of   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and Sports, Ministry of the Environment  and\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member rightly pointed out, since 1998, as\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions worsened, the Government appreciated\r\n\r\nthat  more  would  face hardship.  In  response,  several\r\n\r\nmeasures have been introduced to help lower income groups\r\n\r\nand  unemployed  workers cope with the  difficult  times.\r\n\r\nThese  measures  involved  not just  temporary  financial\r\n\r\nassistance, but also job matching and placement services,\r\n\r\nand  specific  schemes and programmes to  facilitate  re-entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On financial assistance, the Government works\r\n\r\nclosely  with Community Development Councils  (CDCs)  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) to tailor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  assistance to households in need.  For instance, the\r\n\r\nunemployed who have a low household income can apply  for\r\n\r\ninterim   financial   assistance   at   their   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils.  Short-term financial aid  will  be\r\n\r\ngranted  for six months, subject to a review every  three\r\n\r\nmonths.   In  FY2002, 6,700 unemployed Singaporeans  were\r\n\r\nhelped by this scheme.  88% of them managed to get a  job\r\n\r\nwithin three months and become financially independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, families who live in 1-, 2- or 3-room\r\n\r\nrental  and  purchased flats who have  difficulty  paying\r\n\r\ntheir rental, utilities or conservancy charges can obtain\r\n\r\nshort-term  relief to tide over temporary  crises.   They\r\n\r\nmay  apply for monthly subsidies for rent, utilities  and\r\n\r\nservice  and conservancy charges, up to a maximum monthly\r\n\r\ncap  of  $90  for  utilities  and  $35  for  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges.   For those lower  income  families\r\n\r\nthat  are unable to pay their utility bills - this is  in\r\n\r\nreply  to  Mr Low Thia Khiang -  PUB has already  adopted\r\n\r\nthe  practice of thimbling their water supply instead  of\r\n\r\ncutting  it  off  completely since late  2002.  This  has\r\n\r\nenabled  them  to continue to have access  to  a  minimum\r\n\r\nsupply  of  water for basic needs.  PUB will extend  this\r\n\r\npractice until the economic situation improves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for facilitating job placement, between December\r\n\r\n2001  and  last month, 152,000 visits for job  assistance\r\n\r\nunder  MOM's Career Link and its Distributed Career  Link\r\n\r\nNetwork  were  recorded;  of these,  19,600  people  were\r\n\r\nplaced  into jobs. Recently, we have seen an increase  in\r\n\r\ntake-up   rate  and  this  is  encouraging.    MOM   also\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  number of industry-targeted programmes  to\r\n\r\nplace and train or convert job seekers for jobs in growth\r\n\r\nor  strategic sectors.  More than 1,200 Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nbenefited from such programmes so far.  Further, training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are  in place to ensure that  workers'  skill\r\n\r\nsets  develop  in tandem with the economy.  About  80,000\r\n\r\nworkers  have  benefited  from the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Members' concern on the impact of a further\r\n\r\nrise  in overall unemployment rate, as pointed out by  Dr\r\n\r\nAmy Khor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHence, MOM is working towards introducing more place  and\r\n\r\ntrain   programmes  in  other  sub-sectors  which   offer\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities.  We will support retooling  and\r\n\r\nupskilling workers and later I will be introducing a Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  will  enable us to start the CET statutory  board.\r\n\r\nThese developments will enable MOM and its partners to be\r\n\r\nmore effective in helping the unemployed find jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various financial, training and employment\r\n\r\nassistance measures which I have just described provide a\r\n\r\nsound  and holistic framework for helping unemployed  and\r\n\r\nlow-income Singaporeans in this downturn. We will have to\r\n\r\ncalibrate the extent of assistance depending on  economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances, and feedback from MPs, VWOs, and  officers\r\n\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, our experience shows that despite the\r\n\r\ndifficult  conditions,  there are  jobs  which  companies\r\n\r\nstill  cannot  find  Singaporeans  to  fill.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  need to tighten the connection  between\r\n\r\nfinancial   assistance  and  efforts  on  the   part   of\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  look for jobs, take  up  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable and undergo training.  We will monitor  closely\r\n\r\nhow  well  the existing schemes are working and, wherever\r\n\r\nnecessary,  to  streamline  and  improve  the  assistance\r\n\r\nframework to make it more effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, jobs and self-reliance are the best\r\n\r\nguarantee of financial independence, self-confidence  and\r\n\r\npersonal  dignity.  I urge Singaporeans who  are  out  of\r\n\r\nwork  to  be  flexible and realistic in their search  for\r\n\r\njobs.  They should not turn down job opportunities  which\r\n\r\nmay  not  be ideal, but which can financially  tide  them\r\n\r\nover this downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister specifically about  the  white\r\n\r\ncollar workers.  It has been reported that about half  of\r\n\r\nthe  currently unemployed are white collar workers.   Are\r\n\r\nthere any specific measures in place or being planned  to\r\n\r\nhelp this specific group of workers, especially they  are\r\n\r\nreporting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  are encountering resistance from  prospective\r\n\r\nemployers  due to cynicism about their over-qualification\r\n\r\nand possible change of job when the economy turns around?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, saying that half of the workers\r\n\r\nunemployed  are white collar workers does not quite  lend\r\n\r\nequanimity  to  the  situation.  Let me  give  a  clearer\r\n\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the unemployed residents - if we take the\r\n\r\noverall global number of those who are unemployed  -  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate for degree holders is 3.8%,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  96%  of  those with degrees  are  employed.   For\r\n\r\ndiploma  holders,  it  is  3.5%; upper  secondary,  3.4%.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, we do agree with Dr Amy Khor that more needs\r\n\r\nto be done to help every sector of the unemployed and our\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are  crafted not so much at  either  blue  or\r\n\r\nwhite  collar workers but industry-specific, to  look  at\r\n\r\nareas  where  there is growth and to enable  workers  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  unemployed or retrenched from one  sector  to\r\n\r\nconvert to another sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister how he would facilitate the employment\r\n\r\nof  young graduates who are today finding themselves very\r\n\r\ndisillusioned  when  they graduate from  the  university,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  they  are losing  out  to  the  diploma\r\n\r\nholders as well as the ITE graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I think the Member has touched\r\n\r\non  the issue of job vacancies.  Let me give some numbers\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March 2003, there were still about 12,000 job\r\n\r\nvacancies  in the private sector.  There are still  about\r\n\r\n31% or 4,000 jobs for professionals, managers, executives\r\n\r\nand  technical  vocations.  Also, in the  public  sector,\r\n\r\nthere  are  about 1,800 jobs available for  professionals\r\n\r\nand  associate professionals.  It is not only a  question\r\n\r\nof  the grade of jobs but also the industry.  Yes,  there\r\n\r\nis  disruptive  unemployment, in other words,  particular\r\n\r\nsectors have shrunk so that those who work in one  sector\r\n\r\ncannot go back to that sector and they have to convert to\r\n\r\nanother   sector.   We  have  created  specific   schemes\r\n\r\ntargeted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  this  group.   One particular scheme  is  called  the\r\n\r\nStrategic Manpower Conversion Programme and it  is  aimed\r\n\r\nespecially  at  professionals to help them  change.   For\r\n\r\nexample,   an  executive  who  is  retrenched  from   the\r\n\r\nelectronics  sector can switch to the healthcare  sector.\r\n\r\nThere  are  these schemes available.

Let  me  give\r\n\r\nsome  objectivity to his question in terms of  those  who\r\n\r\nare  in  utility account arrears, which he has mentioned.\r\n\r\nYes, for everyone who suffers hardship, we empathise, but\r\n\r\nwe  need to be mindful of the numbers.  The percentage of\r\n\r\nhouseholds  who have arrears on utilities is  1%  of  all\r\n\r\naccounts.  Even in the 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, it is\r\n\r\naround 5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Energy Market Authority has set for itself\r\n\r\nparticular  targets to try to bring down  the  number  of\r\n\r\naccounts  in  arrears to reduce the  figure  to  pre-1999\r\n\r\nlevel,  which is 0.2% eventually.  So that is the working\r\n\r\ntarget internally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have also mentioned, PUB, instead of\r\n\r\ndisconnecting  supply,  has agreed  that  they  will  use\r\n\r\nthimbling so that their essential water requirements  are\r\n\r\nstill  met.   We will work hard and, as I said,  we  will\r\n\r\ncalibrate the financial assistance schemes with our  CDCs\r\n\r\nand  VWOs  to respond to those in need.

This Unit monitors\r\n\r\nretrenchment    trend,   advises   companies    on    how\r\n\r\nretrenchments can be carried out smoothly and  fairly  to\r\n\r\nthe extent possible, provides conciliatory assistance  to\r\n\r\nresolve  disputes, disseminates information  relating  to\r\n\r\nretrenchment  through brochures and leaflets.

While  often\r\n\r\nstated  in  these  simple terms and  often  repeated,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  reminded again that our CPF system remains  a\r\n\r\ncornerstone  on  which  we build our  social  and  indeed\r\n\r\neconomic   well-being.   We  should  resist   strenuously\r\n\r\nattempts  to adulterate the original aims and intents  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF system.  Yes, from time to time, we may have  to\r\n\r\nrecalibrate  the amount we put aside to meet these  basic\r\n\r\nneeds  because  there  is a trade-off  from  too  high  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  burden  for  wages.   We  risk  becoming  less\r\n\r\ncompetitive and thereby restrict employment creation,  we\r\n\r\ncreate  less jobs.  In other words, we should  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the majority of the population has enough to  cover\r\n\r\nthese  basic needs and we should neither under  or  over-provide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Education Scheme was introduced in 1989 as a\r\n\r\nspecial concession to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  lower-income families support themselves  or  their\r\n\r\nchildren through full-time local tertiary education.   To\r\n\r\nallow  CPF savings for overseas tertiary education  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  further deviation from the aims of the CPF scheme.\r\n\r\nIt   would   also  introduce  opportunities   for   over-consumption.  For example, an overseas engineering course\r\n\r\ncould  cost  as  much as $58,000 a year  as  compared  to\r\n\r\n$5,650 at the NUS for the academic year 2003/2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if we did allow it, this availability of\r\n\r\nthe  use  of CPF savings would put unwelcome pressure  on\r\n\r\nparents to fund an ever-increasing aspiration of children\r\n\r\nto  pursue  a tertiary education.  I am not  for  it.   I\r\n\r\nwould rather we hold the line than ask parents to do  it.\r\n\r\nThere  are other avenues of scholarships and loan schemes\r\n\r\navailable  to  good students who would  benefit  from  an\r\n\r\nuniversity education, anywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this same reason of remaining pure to the\r\n\r\noriginal  and focused aims of the CPF scheme  that  I  am\r\n\r\nagainst allowing the early withdrawal of CPF savings  for\r\n\r\nbusiness start-ups.  There is no certainty that all start-ups will thrive and indeed data proves the contrary, that\r\n\r\nthe  majority of start-ups fizzles out.  We run the  risk\r\n\r\nof many members losing their retirement savings for a few\r\n\r\nto make good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those intending to start their own businesses,\r\n\r\nthey  could  look to the Government or private incentives\r\n\r\nand  financing  schemes for assistance.  The  Micro  Loan\r\n\r\nProgramme, for example, administered by SPRING  Singapore\r\n\r\nand offered through participating financial institutions,\r\n\r\nis  a fixed interest rate financing programme designed to\r\n\r\nhelp  the very small local enterprises gain better access\r\n\r\nto financing.

And  as\r\n\r\nI  have  said,  we  should stay sharply  focused  on  the\r\n\r\noriginal  intent of the CPF scheme, which is, retirement,\r\n\r\nhousing  and healthcare.  If we have provided enough  and\r\n\r\nit  is  a  big \"if\", I would tell Members that currently,\r\n\r\nonly  42%  of  CPF members meet the $40,000 Minimum  Sum.\r\n\r\nAnd  this $40,000 Minimum Sum is not calculated from  the\r\n\r\nair, but in adequacy terms, if we withdraw annuities,  in\r\n\r\nother words, monthly payments based on the principal sum,\r\n\r\nit  only  yields about $238 a month.  It is not  a  large\r\n\r\nsum.   It is enough to keep body and soul together.   42%\r\n\r\nof CPF members reach this amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the sense of under-provision, I would say\r\n\r\nthat  the  urge  for the CPF system is to really  provide\r\n\r\nadequacy and not to increase the avenues for consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specifics of the small businesses, I would\r\n\r\nhave  to  look into the specifics and answer the question\r\n\r\nfrom the Member separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> I would like to seek a clarification with the Minister.\r\n\r\nHe  said that the objective of the CPF is for retirement,\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and  housing.

If  we  impose\r\n\r\ntoo high a statutory burden on wages, we are going to  be\r\n\r\nless  competitive.   So  the first  premise  we  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  is that, while we want to put aside  for  our\r\n\r\nretirement,  healthcare and housing  needs,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ntrade-off  in terms of what we get in terms of employment\r\n\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is to arrive at whether we have\r\n\r\nprovided  enough for these three essential aspects.   And\r\n\r\nas  I  have  said, the figures tell us that we  have  not\r\n\r\nquite  provided  enough.  Having said that  we  have  not\r\n\r\nquite  provided  enough,  it really  makes  no  sense  to\r\n\r\nfurther  expand the opportunities in which the CPF  could\r\n\r\nbe  consumed because the first task is to make sure  that\r\n\r\nwe  have provided enough for the majority.  If we do not,\r\n\r\nthere will be serious implications downstream in the long-term.     We   would   have   conscribed   our   economic\r\n\r\nopportunities,  we  would have forced  ourselves  into  a\r\n\r\ntighter fiscal position and we would have engendered  and\r\n\r\nencumbered   future   generations  with   our   problems,\r\n\r\nsomething which we would not want to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, if the CPF member has\r\n\r\nenough  funds in his CPF account and, in times  of  need,\r\n\r\nwhy  can he not borrow from his account which he  has  to\r\n\r\nreturn  back when he is gainfully employed?  This is  not\r\n\r\nover-consumption.  Is it not better that he borrows  from\r\n\r\nhis  CPF  account at a marginal interest than  to  borrow\r\n\r\nfrom some loansharks or maybe from the banks at very high\r\n\r\ninterest rates which he will have to return?

But it is a big \"if\"  for  a\r\n\r\nvery   small  number  that  exists  currently.   And   in\r\n\r\nindividual  cases, we will look at it, but as  a  general\r\n\r\nprinciple,  as I have said, only 42% of CPF members  meet\r\n\r\nour  Minimum Sum which, I will tell Members, is an under-provision,  even as it stands.

The\r\n\r\ndemand is weak and competition in the industry has become\r\n\r\nmore  intense.  As a result, some contractors are  facing\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties and have been unable  to  fulfill\r\n\r\ntheir  contractual obligations. This has  disrupted  some\r\n\r\npublic sector construction projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked whether these problems are due to\r\n\r\nHDB's  tender  system.  Let me first  explain  the  HDB's\r\n\r\nprocess for selecting contractors.  There are three steps\r\n\r\nin the procurement process:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, contractors are pre-qualified based on their\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources,  their professional  and  technical\r\n\r\nqualifications and track record, using the  Building  and\r\n\r\nConstruction Authority (BCA)'s Contractors Registry as  a\r\n\r\nguide.  HDB will specify the category of contractors  who\r\n\r\nare  eligible to participate in the tender based  on  the\r\n\r\nestimated project value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, after the close of the tender exercise, HDB\r\n\r\nwill  verify that the tender proposals fully comply  with\r\n\r\nthe  tender requirements.  The tender proposals are  then\r\n\r\nevaluated  based  on  their price competitiveness,  their\r\n\r\nconformance   to   the   required   specifications,   the\r\n\r\ntenderer's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nability  to undertake the project, his financial solvency\r\n\r\nand his performance in other public sector projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and last stage of the process is for the\r\n\r\nHDB  to conduct due diligence on the tenderers and  their\r\n\r\ntender prices.  All things being equal, HDB will award it\r\n\r\nto  the lowest tenderer who can do the job.  If HDB finds\r\n\r\nthat  the lowest tender price is significantly below  the\r\n\r\nother  tender bids as well as its own estimates, it  will\r\n\r\ninterview the tenderer and ask him to re-examine his bid.\r\n\r\nIf  he  decides  to  withdraw from the tender,  HDB  will\r\n\r\nrecall the tender or award it to the next lowest bidder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of the tender system is to award\r\n\r\nthe   contract  to  the  company  that  offers  the  best\r\n\r\ncombination of price, quality and reliability;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, best value for money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to do so in a way that is objective and fair,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that there is transparency and accountability\r\n\r\nin  the use of public funds.  On the whole, the system is\r\n\r\nsound  and working well, as shown by the large number  of\r\n\r\ncontracts   which  have  been  awarded  and  successfully\r\n\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HDB has put in place a rigorous selection\r\n\r\nprocess,  there is no guarantee that selected firms  will\r\n\r\nnot  run into difficulties later, especially during  this\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.   HDB will monitor  the  contractors'\r\n\r\nperformance   closely   during  construction.    If   any\r\n\r\ncontractor is in trouble, HDB will take immediate  action\r\n\r\nto  minimise  the  impact  on residents.   For  upgrading\r\n\r\nprojects,  HDB will activate a contingency contractor  to\r\n\r\ncomplete   the  essential  works.   It  will  also   keep\r\n\r\nresidents  informed through circulars and  house-to-house\r\n\r\nvisits.  For construction projects of new flats, HDB will\r\n\r\nkeep  buyers informed early if there are changes  in  the\r\n\r\nestimated completion date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in view of recent concerns, MND and\r\n\r\nBCA   are   presently   seeking   views   from   industry\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and key Government agencies, to see\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  and  if  so,  how  the  system  can  be  further\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the specific questions raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.  Dr Amy Khor asked about the management of  main\r\n\r\nand   sub-contractors.   In  HDB's  projects,  the   main\r\n\r\ncontractor   will  choose  and  manage   his   own   sub-contractors, but they must be registered either with  BCA\r\n\r\nor the Singapore Contractors' Association Limited (SCAL).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low asked about HDB's timing of payments\r\n\r\nto  its  contractors.   HDB is  prompt  in  its  progress\r\n\r\npayments and usually pays its contractors within  two  to\r\n\r\nthree  weeks after they have submitted their  claims  and\r\n\r\ntheir  claims  are  validated.  If  the  Member  has  any\r\n\r\nspecific  information to the contrary,  she  can  let  me\r\n\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised a question on the delay of flats at\r\n\r\nPunggol  Field.  HDB is legally required to complete  new\r\n\r\nHDB flats and deliver them to flat buyers by the Delivery\r\n\r\nPossession Date (DPD), which is provided in the Agreement\r\n\r\nfor Lease.  Besides the DPD, HDB also informs flat buyers\r\n\r\nof  an  Estimated Completion Date (ECD), which it reviews\r\n\r\nand updates as construction progresses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the flats at Punggol Field, the\r\n\r\nnovated  contractor ran into financial  difficulties  and\r\n\r\nstopped work in January 2003.  After several unsuccessful\r\n\r\nattempts  to  resume work, HDB terminated and re-tendered\r\n\r\nthe  contract.   A  new contractor was engaged,  and  the\r\n\r\nblocks  are now expected to be completed between  January\r\n\r\n2004  and  September  2004, instead  of  August  2003  to\r\n\r\nOctober  2003,  which  was the  original  estimate.   HDB\r\n\r\nnotified all affected buyers of these changes in February\r\n\r\n2003,  so  that  they could adjust their  housing  plans.\r\n\r\nThose  who  require urgent alternative accommodation  can\r\n\r\napproach HDB for assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats will all be completed before their\r\n\r\nrespective DPDs, which range from August 2004 to  October\r\n\r\n2004.   Thus,  the issue of compensation to  flat  buyers\r\n\r\ndoes not arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  on the registration of contractors by the  BCA.\r\n\r\nHow   is  financial  standing  and  solvency  of  a  firm\r\n\r\nevaluated?  I would also like to ask the Minister  if  it\r\n\r\nis  indeed the case, as reported, in the press  that  the\r\n\r\ncurrent registration system, which is fundamentally sound\r\n\r\nand  rational,  is subject to abuses and,  inadvertently,\r\n\r\nencourages   some  unhealthy  practices,  such   as   the\r\n\r\ncontractors  who are financially unsound  shifting  their\r\n\r\nmonies  around just for registration as well  as  bidding\r\n\r\nfor  jobs at very low or tiao lao bids.  Again,  this  is\r\n\r\njust to ensure that they can qualify for registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the BCA's Contractors'\r\n\r\nRegistration Scheme (CRS) was aimed at making  sure  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   a   certain  minimum  qualification   before\r\n\r\ncontractors are allowed to tender for public sector jobs.\r\n\r\nI  believe  the  CRS is also being used as  a  basis  for\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  tender  for  private  sector  jobs  but,\r\n\r\nessentially, it is for the public sector to find a way to\r\n\r\nprequalify contractors.  Contractors are graded based  on\r\n\r\nseveral  factors  -  financial strength is  only  one  of\r\n\r\nthem.  Other criteria include track record, whether  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  debarred  in the past,  etc.   So,  financial\r\n\r\nstrength  is  only one of the factors but it  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant factor.  Because, as the Member would  probably\r\n\r\nrealise, the construction industry is very much driven by\r\n\r\ncash  flow.  And if contractors do not have the requisite\r\n\r\nfinancial   strength,  they  would  find  themselves   in\r\n\r\ntrouble.   That  is  the reason why the  BCA  requires  a\r\n\r\ncertain minimum financial strength before they are put on\r\n\r\nthe  registry.  And then within the registry,  there  are\r\n\r\ndifferent  grades  -  A1 to C3.  A1 and A2 would  be  the\r\n\r\nhighest grades, followed by B1, B2, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question arises: what happens if a company\r\n\r\nqualifies  for  the  registry and thereafter  shifts  its\r\n\r\nfunds around?  There are certain mechanisms in place, eg,\r\n\r\naccounts have to be audited at certain regular intervals.\r\n\r\nObviously, within those regular intervals, something  can\r\n\r\nstill  take  place but the BCA does try  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthose intervals are reasonable for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontractors as well as reasonable for the BCA  to  check.\r\n\r\nHaving  said  all that, of course, it does not  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat  the  system is foolproof.  It is a fact that  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  some  abuses  of the  system  but,  like  all\r\n\r\nsystems,  if  abuses are detected, then severe  penalties\r\n\r\nwill result.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the so-called tiao lao bids or suicide\r\n\r\nbids?   I  must  say  it is not a good  practice  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry to have such bids.  I am equally concerned about\r\n\r\nsuch bids which are unrealistically low.  But having said\r\n\r\nthat,  I  think we must realise that the contractors  are\r\n\r\nprofessionals.   They are going in for  a  bid  with  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  getting that contract.   They  do  not  go\r\n\r\nputting  in  a  bid  which they would  have  to  withdraw\r\n\r\nsubsequently.  So, it can be for several reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that they are trying to buy market share, or\r\n\r\nthey could be trying to establish a track record, or they\r\n\r\ncould  be going in because they want cash flow,  or  they\r\n\r\nmay  have made a genuine mistake.  So, for these reasons,\r\n\r\nHDB  takes  the view that it does not benefit anybody  to\r\n\r\naward  a  tender to a bid which, in its opinion,  is  too\r\n\r\nlow.   That is the reason why if a bid comes in which  is\r\n\r\nbelow  the  others  or  which  is  way  below  HDB's  own\r\n\r\nestimates, it will, as I explained earlier, call up  that\r\n\r\ntenderer and conduct an interview to see whether the  bid\r\n\r\nthat  has  been put in is a genuine bid.  In some  cases,\r\n\r\nthe  tenderers,  after going through the  specifications,\r\n\r\ndecide  to  withdraw  their bids.  If  the  tenderer  had\r\n\r\nproceeded with the bid, the chances are that he will  not\r\n\r\nbe able to complete that job.  And who would benefit from\r\n\r\nsuch a situation?  HDB would not benefit.  The contractor\r\n\r\nwould not benefit and, certainly, the residents would not\r\n\r\nbenefit.  I think it is in nobody's interest to  award  a\r\n\r\ntender  to  such  a  bid.  Because of this,  the  present\r\n\r\nprocurement process does allow for the tender  evaluation\r\n\r\ncommittee not to award the tender to such a bid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the objective of the tender\r\n\r\nsystem is to get the best value for money on the basis of\r\n\r\nquality,   reliability  and  price.   For   quality   and\r\n\r\nreliability, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave to base on the track record.  We have to base on the\r\n\r\npast.   But price is what is on the table.  If the  price\r\n\r\nis  not realistic then, obviously, that tender should not\r\n\r\nbe  awarded.  And the record shows that there  have  been\r\n\r\nseveral  cases  where the lowest tenders  have  not  been\r\n\r\nawarded.  In the case of Government agencies, as much  as\r\n\r\n25% of tenders are not given to the lowest tenderer.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case of HDB, about 10% of contracts are not  awarded\r\n\r\nto the lowest tenderer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  a  question regarding the case  of  Marine\r\n\r\nTerrace  MUP  Batch 14, because I think that the  lessons\r\n\r\nthat  we have learnt from this particular experience  are\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  the matters under discussion.   Firstly,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry  and\r\n\r\nHDB  have  identified the reasons why the main contractor\r\n\r\nfor  Marine  Terrace MUP Batch 14 suddenly abandoned  the\r\n\r\nproject.   I believe this contractor took over  from  the\r\n\r\nprevious  contractor.   In fact,  there  were  two  other\r\n\r\ncontractors  earlier on, who bid for  this  project  well\r\n\r\nbelow the HDB's estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why was the HDB project management unable\r\n\r\nto  anticipate the problems which the project faced?  And\r\n\r\nwhat measure will the HDB take to ensure that the project\r\n\r\nwill resume quickly without undue delay, and also help to\r\n\r\nminimise  inconvenience to residents?  Will the  Minister\r\n\r\ngive  an  assurance  that the project will  be  completed\r\n\r\nwithout any more delays?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question of payments to sub-contractors. Many sub-contractors have complained that\r\n\r\nthey have not been paid by the main contractors, although\r\n\r\nthey   have   completed   the   projects.    Could   some\r\n\r\narrangements be made by HDB, or the Government  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  for  payments to be made directly  to  the  sub-contractors  when  the projects are  done  and  completed\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Othman asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  Marine Terrace upgrading project.   First  of\r\n\r\nall, the tender was awarded in 2001 to a company known\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  Seatown  Construction.   The  performance  record  of\r\n\r\nSeatown Construction was good and acceptable.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nG8 contractor, meaning that it was a contractor which was\r\n\r\nin  the  highest  category of  the  BCA's  CRS.   So,  no\r\n\r\nquestion about its financial strength or its track record\r\n\r\nat  that  time.   It was not debarred and there  were  no\r\n\r\nadverse  reports  on  the contractor.   However,  Seatown\r\n\r\nConstruction  went  into financial difficulties  and  the\r\n\r\nproject  was  novated  to Hong Lai Huat  Construction  in\r\n\r\nAugust 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Lai Huat Construction was an A1 contractor.\r\n\r\nThe  CRS  had been changed, and A1 is equivalent  to  G8.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was the top of the range.  Again, it had a good\r\n\r\nperformance record.  It was not debarred.  There were  no\r\n\r\nadverse  reports.  So, by all accounts,  it  was  a  good\r\n\r\ncontractor.  Hong Lai Huat went into difficulties and the\r\n\r\nproject  was  novated to Sum Keong Construction  on  18th\r\n\r\nMarch 2003.  Sum Keong Construction is an A2 contractor - not  the  top but the next level down.  A2 means that  it\r\n\r\ncan  tender for jobs between $30 million and $65 million.\r\n\r\nSo  it  was more than qualified to do the Marine  Terrace\r\n\r\nproject - good track record, no debarment status, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till the 2nd June, the progress of works of Sum\r\n\r\nKeong  was  ahead  of  schedule.   It  was  not  just  on\r\n\r\nschedule, but it was ahead of schedule.  I think  it  was\r\n\r\ndoing  something like 55% of the project, which was  more\r\n\r\nthan  what was on the time-line.  On 2nd June, HDB's site\r\n\r\nmanagement  team found that the contractor  had  suddenly\r\n\r\nstopped all works inside the flats.  And on 3rd June, the\r\n\r\ncontractor  had stopped all works outside the flats  very\r\n\r\nsuddenly.  There was no indication by the contractor that\r\n\r\nsuch a thing was going to happen.  I spoke to some of the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders who indicated the same  thing  to  me\r\n\r\nbecause they obviously were on the ground and they  could\r\n\r\nsense when work was being slowed down or delayed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all accounts, this was a very sudden stoppage.\r\n\r\nWhy?   I  can  only  go by what the contractor  told  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  Apparently, the contractor said that he  had\r\n\r\nrun into major financial difficulties and he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  no choice but to stop work.  So, the contractor  had\r\n\r\nto  face  the  consequences of the  stop-work.   And  the\r\n\r\nresidents on the ground had to face more disruptions  and\r\n\r\ninconveniences.  HDB on the same day, 3rd June, took  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  measures to try to minimise these disruptions.\r\n\r\nA circular was sent to the residents on the same day, 3rd\r\n\r\nJune,  to  inform them that there had been a stoppage  of\r\n\r\nwork  by  the contractor, and also to inform  them  about\r\n\r\nwhat  other  measures would be taken by HDB  to  recover,\r\n\r\nincluding,  for  example, the appointment of  contingency\r\n\r\ncontractor to quickly take over the emergency  works  and\r\n\r\nto  complete them.  It also appointed the same contractor\r\n\r\nto  make sure that housekeeping and the conservancy works\r\n\r\nin the area were properly carried out - mosquito control,\r\n\r\nrodent  control, security in the area, and so  on.   This\r\n\r\nwas  done virtually straightaway.  The very next day when\r\n\r\nworks were stopped, all these were put into place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it have been anticipated? As I said, the\r\n\r\nprocurement process tries to conduct due diligence on all\r\n\r\nthe successful tenderers.  In this particular case, there\r\n\r\nwas  no  indication that the contractor  would  not  have\r\n\r\ncompleted  the  job.  But, for various reasons,  it  went\r\n\r\ninto financial difficulties.  And, unfortunately, in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Sum Keong, it went into difficulties so suddenly\r\n\r\nthat  HDB  could  not  warn the residents  earlier.   But\r\n\r\nhaving  had  its  attention brought  to  the  problem,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve it acted swiftly, promptly and efficiently to try\r\n\r\nand  recover and to make sure that the disruption to  the\r\n\r\nresidents was minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to inform the Member that to-date, the\r\n\r\noutstanding internal works that were the most  disruptive\r\n\r\nto  the  residents in 15 of the flats - these were  works\r\n\r\npertaining to the works in the bathrooms and the  toilets\r\n\r\n-  had  been  completed  in that  week.   Similarly,  the\r\n\r\ninternal works for the remaining units in the blocks have\r\n\r\nalso  been completed and external works are going  to  be\r\n\r\nstarted  by the contractor in July, and they expect  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  finish it by the end of August.  As  for  the\r\n\r\nremaining balance of the works, HDB will be calling a re-tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis re-tender will be expedited and works will resume on\r\n\r\nsite by the new contractor by August 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether we can guarantee that there\r\n\r\nwill  be no further delays.  I wish I could.  But, to  be\r\n\r\nrealistic,  while we will do whatever is  necessary  this\r\n\r\ntime in selecting a tenderer, I cannot promise that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  further breakdowns or delays.   But  I  can\r\n\r\npromise  the  Member  that such  a  possibility  will  be\r\n\r\nminimised.  I can also promise that, if there is  such  a\r\n\r\nthing happening again, the recovery will be as swift  and\r\n\r\nefficient as it was in the first episode.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about sub-contractors. The\r\n\r\nproblem  with  sub-contractors is that the contract  that\r\n\r\nthey  have is between them and the main contractors.   It\r\n\r\nhas  nothing to do with HDB.  But having said that, I  do\r\n\r\nsympathise with the sub-contractors because they are,  as\r\n\r\nit  were, at the lowest end of the food chain.  When  HDB\r\n\r\npays the main contractor, the main contractor is supposed\r\n\r\nto pay the sub-contractors.  But when the main contractor\r\n\r\ngets  into  difficulty or trouble,  invariably  the  sub-contractors  suffer.  So we will have to  look  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility of how this problem can be solved, because it\r\n\r\nis  a  problem.  If sub-contractors, which are  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of the whole construction industry, are not  paid\r\n\r\nor treated properly, then I think the industry as a whole\r\n\r\nmust suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked BCA and other Government agencies to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  system and to see in  what  way  we  can\r\n\r\nminimise this problem of sub-contractors not being  paid,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  possibility perhaps of  legislating  such\r\n\r\npayment.  But such changes, if any, must be practical and\r\n\r\ndoable  and it is something that the industry as a  whole\r\n\r\nmust accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, what is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's  response to the call by the  contractors\r\n\r\nfor the security bond to be reduced to 10% of the initial\r\n\r\namount  upon obtaining TOP for contractors, the  accounts\r\n\r\nto be finalised\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  six  months, after the TOP has been obtained,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the 5% retention sum to be waived?  As regards  the\r\n\r\nsuicide tender bids, will the contractors be penalised if\r\n\r\nthey withdraw the suicide tender bids, if it is really  a\r\n\r\ngenuine mistake being made?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think nobody goes into business\r\n\r\nto  commit  suicide.  They all go in  with  the  hope  of\r\n\r\nwinning  the tender.  So, if a tender bid is  low,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of a mistake, then we would definitely look at the\r\n\r\nwaiver of the penalty sympathetically.  We are not  going\r\n\r\nto  penalise somebody who has, say, added an extra \"0\" or\r\n\r\nhas  subtracted an extra \"0\" from one of the line  items.\r\n\r\nSo,  if  it  is  a  genuine mistake, we  will  waive  the\r\n\r\npenalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the other issues are concerned, eg, the\r\n\r\nperformance  bond, the accounts being finalised  quickly,\r\n\r\nthe  retention sum, etc, basically the common denominator\r\n\r\nin all these is that there must be a certain guarantee in\r\n\r\nthe form of a performance bond or an insurance bond or  a\r\n\r\nbanker's   guarantee,  to  ensure  that  the   contractor\r\n\r\ncompletes  the job within the time that is specified  and\r\n\r\nto  the specifications that he has promised.  If he  does\r\n\r\nnot   meet   this  promise  and  does  not  fulfill   his\r\n\r\nobligation, then the performance bond will be  forfeited.\r\n\r\nSo,  it  is  a matter of how much performance bond  is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  amount.   In the case of  HDB  or  Government\r\n\r\nagencies,  it  ranges from 5-10%.  In  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, I believe the norm is  10%.   These  are\r\n\r\nissues which, again, the industry would have to sort out.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  have  asked BCA to also look at these  issues  of\r\n\r\nperformance bond, retention sum, etc.  But bear  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat all this, while it incurs a cost, is part and parcel\r\n\r\nof the contractual obligation between buyer and seller of\r\n\r\nthat service.  Without the performance bond, without  any\r\n\r\nretention sum, the balance must be tilted on the side  of\r\n\r\nthe  contractor.   For  example, what  is  to  prevent  a\r\n\r\ncontractor from not fulfilling his obligations, if  there\r\n\r\nis   no  performance  guarantee?   What  is  to  stop   a\r\n\r\ncontractor  from  not finishing his job to  the  complete\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of the owner, if there is no retention  sum?\r\n\r\nThe contractor just walks away.  You call him\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback  to  rectify certain works, even within the one-year\r\n\r\ndefect  liability period, he does not show up.   What  do\r\n\r\nyou do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think there has got to be a balance between the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  buyer and the seller of  the  service.\r\n\r\nBut,  of course, that balance has to be struck in such  a\r\n\r\nway  that everybody in the industry understands, and this\r\n\r\nis  one of the issues which the industry is now trying to\r\n\r\ngrapple  with.  And I hope that there will be a consensus\r\n\r\nreached on a new equilibrium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, with regard to the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  contractors by BCA, will  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  further tightening the measures, together  with\r\n\r\ninputs  from  the  industry, as regards,  say,  financial\r\n\r\nstanding and solvency of the firm where specific projects\r\n\r\nare  analysed,  like  profitability ratios  or  breakeven\r\n\r\nanalyses?   Because  if the contractors  appear  to  have\r\n\r\nsuicidal  tendencies, as every project is  a  loss,  then\r\n\r\nsome alarm bells must ring with regard to their financial\r\n\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am not sure where the Member\r\n\r\ngets  this  idea that people go into business  to  commit\r\n\r\nsuicide.   I  do  not believe so.  The so-called  suicide\r\n\r\nbids, I think, are the result of several factors, but let\r\n\r\nus leave that aside for the time being.  Specifically, to\r\n\r\nanswer  the Member's question on whether we will consider\r\n\r\ntightening  the Contractors Registration System,  let  us\r\n\r\nbear  in mind that the more you tighten the less will  be\r\n\r\nthe  number of contractors who will be on that list.  You\r\n\r\nwill find that the contractors will not be too happy with\r\n\r\nthis.   Of course, that does not mean that we do  not  do\r\n\r\nit.   But  I  am just pointing out that we will  have  to\r\n\r\nagain make sure that the criteria are sufficient to  pre-qualify the good, suitable contractors and not to  be  so\r\n\r\ntight as to preclude many contractors who would otherwise\r\n\r\nhave been able to do the job.  So the CRS has undergone a\r\n\r\nlot  of  reviews and examinations.  I am sure that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be another round of review some time.  But we  have\r\n\r\njust  done  the last review last year.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nseek  the  Member's  cooperation for us  to  examine  the\r\n\r\nresults of that past year.

Secondly, will the Ministry  consider\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  public sector standard contract  form  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  interests  of  the third  parties,  especially\r\n\r\nconsumers,  sub-contractors  and  suppliers,  are  better\r\n\r\nprotected?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I can give the Member an indication\r\n\r\nabout how many contracts were not completed over the last\r\n\r\nyear.  I believe it is something in the region of 4%.  4%\r\n\r\nof  the total number of contracts awarded by HDB were not\r\n\r\ncompleted  on time for some reason or other.  As  to  how\r\n\r\nmuch liquidated damages were forfeited, I do not have the\r\n\r\nfigure offhand.  But I will be happy to provide it to him\r\n\r\nat an appropriate forum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the review of the public sector tender\r\n\r\nform is concerned, yes, this is one of the issues that is\r\n\r\nbeing  discussed by BCA and the industry.  The  objective\r\n\r\nis  to  make  sure  that the terms in the  public  sector\r\n\r\nprocurement system and the form are transparent and  fair\r\n\r\nto  all the parties involved and I include, in this case,\r\n\r\nthe   sub-contractors,  in  response  to  Encik  Othman's\r\n\r\nquestion just now, and the consumers as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister about the problem concerning the main contractor\r\n\r\nand  sub-contractor.  When the main contractor  gets  the\r\n\r\ncontract,  usually  he  will  sub-contract  to  the  sub-contractors  who sometimes sub-contract to so  many  sub-contractors.  Has the Ministry any form of control on the\r\n\r\nmain contractor, ie, after getting the contract, how many\r\n\r\npercent  of  it  should  be  carried  out  by  the   main\r\n\r\ncontractor  and  how many percent by the  sub-contractor?\r\n\r\nThe Minister mentioned that the contract\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  not  awarded  to  the  lowest  tenderer.   Could  he\r\n\r\nenlighten  the  House, for the last two years,  how  many\r\n\r\ncontracts  under  MUP and IUP were  not  awarded  to  the\r\n\r\nlowest tenderer?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The issue of main contractor\r\n\r\nawarding jobs to sub-contractors is a peculiarity of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry in Singapore.  I am not saying that\r\n\r\nit does not happen in other countries.  The prevalence of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  practice in our industry is quite unique to  us.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Member suggested, it is not just one  level  but\r\n\r\nmaybe several levels down where the main contractors will\r\n\r\nappoint  sub-contractors,  sub-contractors  will  appoint\r\n\r\ntheir  own sub-contractors, and so on.  Why is  this  so?\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons.  One perhaps is the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  barrier to entry of contractors in Singapore is very\r\n\r\nlow  and  we  do not require too much qualifications  nor\r\n\r\nother prerequisites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is, by and large, I would say, an efficient\r\n\r\nsystem.   It is efficient in the sense that after getting\r\n\r\nthe  job  the main contractors find, on their own accord,\r\n\r\nthe  best people to help them to do the job.  They either\r\n\r\nappoint  sub-contractors, or they hire people to  do  the\r\n\r\njob.   Some  contractors prefer to hire their own  staff.\r\n\r\nThey  train  the  staff and keep them for the  long-term.\r\n\r\nOthers prefer to virtually hire all sub-contractors.  But\r\n\r\nshould  the Government get involved in deciding how  much\r\n\r\nsub-contracting  they should do, how much  of  their  own\r\n\r\ndirect workers they should employ?  I do not think so.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the main contractor is the one who knows best  how\r\n\r\nto  get  the  job done at the price that he has  tendered\r\n\r\nfor.   For  us  to specify these things is  virtually  to\r\n\r\nmanage the project for him.  How can the Government be in\r\n\r\na   better  position  than  the  contractor  to  actually\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  job?   And if we  were  to  do  that,  the\r\n\r\ncontractor would have every reason to come back to us  if\r\n\r\nthe  job  is not done properly and say, \"You are the  one\r\n\r\nwho told me to do all these things.  Now it is not done.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a system that has generally worked well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain problems in the system, one of\r\n\r\nwhich is this issue of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-payment.  But this is a problem that has surfaced now\r\n\r\nwhen  the  construction industry or the construction  pie\r\n\r\nhas shrunk rapidly.  This was not such a problem when the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry was booming.  The  sub-contractors\r\n\r\nwere  paid,  suppliers were paid, and nobody faulted  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  So we have to be careful that we do not try  and\r\n\r\ncome out with the wrong solutions to the problems that we\r\n\r\nare  facing.  I have indicated earlier that the issue  of\r\n\r\npayments  between the main contractor and sub-contractors\r\n\r\nis something that needs to be looked at.  The industry is\r\n\r\nnow  looking at it together with the Government  agencies\r\n\r\nand  I  hope that there will be some practical  solutions\r\n\r\narising out of this discussion.  But I would not advocate\r\n\r\nthe   Government   getting  involved   in   running   the\r\n\r\nconstruction companies or running the contracts  for  the\r\n\r\nmain contractors.  I would leave it to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question was on the number of contracts\r\n\r\nunder  MUP  and  IUP which have not been awarded  to  the\r\n\r\nlowest  tenderer.   I  am  afraid  I  do  not  have   the\r\n\r\ninformation  offhand.

In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Punggol 21, some projects were  stopped  for  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  period of time before work resumed.   In  a\r\n\r\nparticular  case  where  the blocks  of  flats  were  all\r\n\r\ncompleted  and in fact inhabitants had already moved  in,\r\n\r\nsome sub-contractors took away some installations at  the\r\n\r\nvoid  deck,  leaving exposed steel wires and all  because\r\n\r\nthe main contractor could not pay them.  That is a safety\r\n\r\nhazard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As far as resumption of work is\r\n\r\nconcerned, HDB will endeavour to make sure that the  work\r\n\r\nresumes  as quickly as possible.  As quickly as  possible\r\n\r\ncan  range from one or two months to probably four, five,\r\n\r\nor  six months.  The difficulty is mainly when there  are\r\n\r\nlegal  difficulties involved in the  winding  up  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  contractor.  This, of course, is no  comfort  to\r\n\r\nthe residents.

In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nPunggol Field, the example that was mentioned, the  delay\r\n\r\nwill  ultimately  be in the range of  anything  from  two\r\n\r\nmonths  to  as  long  as  10  months  from  the  original\r\n\r\nestimated completion date.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, last question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.

And having\r\n\r\nlooked  at  this  evidence,  would  he  take  this   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  as  a lesson learnt when  he  reviews  the\r\n\r\ntendering system?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The Member said that the contractor\r\n\r\nis already \"terminal\".

The safeguard of course for us  is  that\r\n\r\nwe do not have to automatically accept such bids.  The IM\r\n\r\ndoes   not   require  HDB  to  accept  the   lowest   bid\r\n\r\nirregardless, our own internal systems do not require  us\r\n\r\nto  do  so, and common sense tells us that if the bid  is\r\n\r\nreally  too  low, if we accept that bid, it  is  not  the\r\n\r\ncontractor alone which is committing suicide, we are also\r\n\r\ncommitting suicide because the amount of work involved in\r\n\r\ntrying to recover is not insignificant.  So it is not  in\r\n\r\nanybody's interest to accept such so-called suicide bids.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have two\r\n\r\nsupplementary questions.  One\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis in regard to Marine Terrace and the other is in regard\r\n\r\nto  Punggol  Field.  In regard to Marine Terrace,  can  I\r\n\r\nhave some clarifications?  Is this an MUP?  And if it is,\r\n\r\nhow  much has each resident there co-paid for the  works?\r\n\r\nThere are three contractors involved in Marine Terrace  - Seatown,  Hong  Lai Huat and Sum Keong  -  and  even  the\r\n\r\nMinister  says that he is not sure whether Sum Keong  can\r\n\r\nfinish the job.  I am just wondering whether HDB has been\r\n\r\nsoft  on  all these contractors and has not been rigorous\r\n\r\nin enforcing the contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other supplementary question is in regard to\r\n\r\nPunggol  Field.   It is quite obvious that,  for  Punggol\r\n\r\nField,  the contractors had breached the contract.   They\r\n\r\nwere  unable  to  complete  the  job  on  time  and  even\r\n\r\nabandoned  the  project.  I heard one  complaint  from  a\r\n\r\npurchaser  that, in fact, she had already sold  her  flat\r\n\r\nand  could not get the replacement flat at Punggol  Field\r\n\r\nin  time.  She had to go and find accommodation somewhere\r\n\r\nelse.   Such  a  case is clear cut that she has  suffered\r\n\r\ndamages.   I  am  a bit surprised when the Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  HDB has not paid any compensation at all.  In fact,\r\n\r\nI  would also imagine that the HDB has the right to claim\r\n\r\ndamages  from  the  contractors.  So, out  of  these  560\r\n\r\npurchasers, how many have been compensated in  regard  to\r\n\r\ntheir claims, if any?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, Marine Terrace is an MUP\r\n\r\nproject.   And  like all MUP projects, the residents  pay\r\n\r\nonly  a  fraction of the total cost.  It depends  on  the\r\n\r\nparticular  project itself.  It depends also on  what  is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  that particular MUP.  It could be  $10,000.\r\n\r\nIt  could  be  less,  or it could be more,  depending  on\r\n\r\nwhether  there is an SAI.  But it is heavily  subsidised.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in all MUP projects, the Government foots 70% or\r\n\r\n75%  and  for the smaller flats, as much as  90%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost.   I  am not sure what is the  point  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion.  That is a fact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the HDB has been soft on these contractors,\r\n\r\nas  I  explained  earlier, the works of  both  the  first\r\n\r\ncontractor  and  the second contractor were  satisfactory\r\n\r\nuntil  the  point of time when they felt that they  could\r\n\r\nnot carry on.  HDB has a system in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace to monitor the works, ie, regular monitoring of the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  works to make sure that disruption  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents is kept to a minimum and there are regular site\r\n\r\nmeetings.  I have seen records of these site meetings.  I\r\n\r\nam satisfied that HDB has carried out its work diligently\r\n\r\nand properly.  Notwithstanding all these, the contractors\r\n\r\ndid  get  into  difficulties,  and  once  they  got  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties and they could not carry on, HDB had to take\r\n\r\nthe necessary steps to recover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Marine Terrace, the first disruption\r\n\r\nwas  when  the first contractor could not finish  and  it\r\n\r\nwent  to  the  second contractor.  There was a  novation.\r\n\r\nThe  second contractor could not complete, and it novated\r\n\r\nto  the  third.  In Sum Keong's case, it was not able  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on.   So,  instead  of  novating  to  yet  another\r\n\r\ncontractor, HDB has decided to terminate the contract and\r\n\r\nto call for a new tender.  In calling for the new tender,\r\n\r\nthe  chances of the work being completed in time will  be\r\n\r\nthat  much  better.   Of course, in  calling  for  a  new\r\n\r\ntender, the cost involved would be much higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Would damages be paid?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Why should damages be paid? In the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Marine  Terrace,  the  work  is  going  on   as\r\n\r\nscheduled.   It  will be completed, but  with  a  minimal\r\n\r\ndelay  of  about two or three months, as I have explained\r\n\r\nto Mr Othman Haron Eusofe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Punggol Field, again the issue of\r\n\r\ncompensation does not arise because, first  of  all,  the\r\n\r\ncontractual obligation of HDB is very clear - that in the\r\n\r\nlease agreement that is signed between the buyer and  the\r\n\r\nseller,  this flat would be delivered by a certain  date,\r\n\r\nin  what  is  known  as the development completion  date.\r\n\r\nThat  obligation will be fulfilled.  In so far as  delays\r\n\r\nare concerned and residents getting alternatives, anybody\r\n\r\nwho  is in urgent need of a flat as a result of the  flat\r\n\r\nnot  being completed as originally estimated can approach\r\n\r\nHDB  for  assistance, and such assistance will be  given.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain,  I do not see any reason why there should  be  any\r\n\r\nquestion  of  a compensation.

These\r\n\r\ninclude  separate briefings to members of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  Federation  (SBF) on our FTAs  with  Australia,\r\n\r\nJapan and the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our programme for raising awareness ranges from open\r\n\r\nseminars    and   business   briefings   to    one-to-one\r\n\r\nconsultations  with  individual  companies,  which   have\r\n\r\napproached  MTI  officials to conduct tailored  briefings\r\n\r\nfor  them  after  attending our general briefings.   Some\r\n\r\ncompanies  have also sent in  enquiries through  the  MTI\r\n\r\nwebsite.   To  cast  as wide a net as possible,  we  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  organisations, such as  the  SBF  and  the\r\n\r\nindividual chambers of commerce.  For instance, we staged\r\n\r\na major event on the US-Singapore FTA in partnership with\r\n\r\nSBF  in  May 2003, which attracted over 600 participants.\r\n\r\nOur events are not solely conducted in English.  In June,\r\n\r\nMTI  organised a seminar in conjunction with SBF to reach\r\n\r\nout  to businessmen more familiar with Mandarin.  Another\r\n\r\nis  planned  for  late  July with the  Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce  and Industry.   We  will  also  be\r\n\r\nconducting a briefing for the Singapore Malay Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry on 8th July 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our activities are targeted at all businesses, both\r\n\r\nlarge  corporations  and  SMEs.   We  have  paid  special\r\n\r\nattention  to  SMEs. My Ministry has worked closely  with\r\n\r\nindustry-specific associations as well as through SPRING,\r\n\r\nIE Singapore and, in the future, ASME, to ensure that the\r\n\r\nSMEs are not left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall response to our outreach activities has\r\n\r\nbeen positive, with many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollow-up  enquiries  being received  after  the  events.\r\n\r\nMany  participants have indicated that the briefings have\r\n\r\nhelped  them to understand the FTAs much better, and  are\r\n\r\nkeen to explore the possible opportunities presented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pre-negotiation consultations for FTAs, like the\r\n\r\nIndia-Singapore CECA and the ASEAN-China FTA,  have  also\r\n\r\nattracted  more  interest since  our  outreach  programme\r\n\r\nstarted.   To  date, we have conducted seven sessions  of\r\n\r\npre-negotiation  consultations,  involving   nearly   100\r\n\r\nparticipants   from   the  processed   food,   chemicals,\r\n\r\nconstruction    and    logistics    industry    clusters.\r\n\r\nParticipants   at  such  consultations   are   now   more\r\n\r\nforthcoming with their inputs and are more aware  of  how\r\n\r\nthey can use FTAs to help them in these markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the results of the survey by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Confederation of Industries  (SCI).   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  first  commend the SCI for  its  initiative  in\r\n\r\nconducting the survey.  The results are extremely helpful\r\n\r\nto  both SCI and MTI in identifying the information  gaps\r\n\r\nthat  exist  in  the minds of our business community.  As\r\n\r\npart  of MTI's outreach activities, MTI had, even  before\r\n\r\nthe survey, worked with SCI to organise a seminar on 30th\r\n\r\nJuly 2003 for its members.  We hope that, like Miss Penny\r\n\r\nLow, SCI members will be intrigued by the results of  the\r\n\r\nsurvey, and attend the seminar so as to find out how they\r\n\r\ncan  benefit from the US-Singapore FTA.  The money is  in\r\n\r\nthe  details,  and  I  believe  that  once  our  business\r\n\r\ncommunity studies the parts of the agreement that  affect\r\n\r\ntheir industry, they will find numerous benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the US-Singapore FTA, tariffs on all products\r\n\r\nhave been eliminated, including electronics and precision\r\n\r\ninstruments.   Firms with a high volume of exports  where\r\n\r\nthere are substantial tariff elimination will get to gain\r\n\r\nmost.   Textiles companies, should they meet the rules of\r\n\r\norigin,  will  face  lower  tariffs  and  gain  a   price\r\n\r\nadvantage after the textile quota system lapses in 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These benefits will be immediately reaped by\r\n\r\ncompanies that already export\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the US.  I note from SCI's survey that although 71% of\r\n\r\nrespondents  perceive no benefits from  the  US,  50%  of\r\n\r\nrespondents also acknowledged that they do not  currently\r\n\r\nexport to the US.  I would urge these companies to review\r\n\r\ntheir  business  plans in the light of  the  US-Singapore\r\n\r\nFTA.  The US is a large market and will be a big boost to\r\n\r\ntheir business if they successfully enter it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Integrated Sourcing Initiative (ISI), it\r\n\r\nis  confined  to  266  IT products  and  certain  medical\r\n\r\ndevices.    Manufacturers  producing  these   goods   and\r\n\r\nexporting  them  through Singapore will benefit  directly\r\n\r\nfrom the provision. Although these products already enjoy\r\n\r\nzero  tariffs  going into the US, the ISI  confers  three\r\n\r\nadditional benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, such goods will enjoy a waiver of the 0.21%\r\n\r\nmerchandise processing fee imposed by the US Customs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the ISI reduces the paperwork relating to\r\n\r\ndocumentation  procedures, thus saving on  time-to-market\r\n\r\ncosts for these manufacturers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, these manufacturers will enjoy faster customs\r\n\r\nclearance  as Singapore-origin products.  Not  all  firms\r\n\r\nwill see direct benefits from the ISI.  But the exporters\r\n\r\nof the 266 ISI products should see higher sales which, in\r\n\r\nturn,   generate  a  greater  volume  of  business   with\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies that supply them with components  or\r\n\r\nsupport  their  activities here.  Hence,  our  industries\r\n\r\nwill benefit indirectly from the ISI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should emphasise that the benefits of the FTA\r\n\r\nextend beyond tariff savings.  Enhanced investment and IP\r\n\r\nprotection, liberalisation of trade in services and other\r\n\r\nimportant provisions of the agreement help us to draw  in\r\n\r\nmore     investments,     while     facilitating      the\r\n\r\ninternationalisation of Singapore-based enterprises.  All\r\n\r\nthese  will  have  important secondary spin-offs  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  We must therefore view the FTA in totality.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For firms, I would urge them to study the details of\r\n\r\nthose  portions that affect them directly,  and  see  how\r\n\r\ntheir  operations can be re-configured  to  benefit  from\r\n\r\nthese.

In fact, across\r\n\r\nall  town  councils, water consumption in the last  three\r\n\r\nmonths, from March to May, has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  down  by about 11-12% compared to a year  ago,  and\r\n\r\nabout 4-5% compared to the previous three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Potong Pasir, in fact, the water\r\n\r\nconsumption there has come down by 10% compared to a year\r\n\r\nago, and has gone up by 1.5% compared to December 2002 to\r\n\r\nFebruary  this  year.

This Bill contains a range  of\r\n\r\namendments.   Its  primary objective  is  to  update  the\r\n\r\nlegislation to support new developments and to facilitate\r\n\r\nLTA's operations.  In this regard, Sir, the Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) empowers LTA to carry out enforcement actions\r\n\r\nagainst obstructions, so as to keep passageways clear for\r\n\r\npedestrians;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) empowers LTA to require plans to be submitted\r\n\r\nbefore engineering works are carried out within the  road\r\n\r\nstructure  safety zone.  This is to ensure  integrity  of\r\n\r\nthe road structures;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) empowers LTA to enter into non-State lands to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  road  works and install traffic  control  and\r\n\r\nmonitoring equipment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) facilitates the introduction of a lodgement\r\n\r\nscheme to allow for self regulation; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) winds up the Municipal Provident Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now elaborate on these and highlight the\r\n\r\nkey provisions in the Bill for the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforcement actions against obstructions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to ensure that the public is\r\n\r\nnot   inconvenienced   by   obstructions   placed   along\r\n\r\npassageways.   These passageways include  public  streets\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbacklanes vested in Government, five-footways and certain\r\n\r\nprivate   footways  that  serve  as  key   linkages   for\r\n\r\npedestrians.  Currently, LTA only has the powers to seize\r\n\r\nand  remove  obstructions on public streets  but  has  no\r\n\r\npowers  to  dispose  of the articles should  they  remain\r\n\r\nunclaimed.  If the goods remain unclaimed, LTA  needs  to\r\n\r\nseek  further  directions from  the  court  via  a  court\r\n\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, LTA needs to be empowered to seize and\r\n\r\ndispose    of    obstructions   found   on   passageways,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those that are heavily used by pedestrians.\r\n\r\nClauses  17  and 18 create new sections  in  the  SWA  to\r\n\r\nempower  LTA  to clear obstructions on these passageways.\r\n\r\nThe amendment will also allow LTA to enact regulations to\r\n\r\ndispose  of  all seized articles if their owners  do  not\r\n\r\nclaim them within a specified time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the House to note that enforcement\r\n\r\naction   will   only  be  carried  out  against   movable\r\n\r\nobstructions.   Where  immovable  obstructions,  such  as\r\n\r\nillegal  structures  and walls are found  on  passageways\r\n\r\nthat  are  located  on State lands,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nsufficient powers under the State Lands Encroachments Act\r\n\r\nand the Building Control Act to deal with these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Powers to ensure integrity of road structures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 introduces a new section to empower\r\n\r\nLTA  to regulate engineering works carried out within the\r\n\r\nroad structure safety zone, which is defined as 20 metres\r\n\r\nfrom  the  outermost edge of any part of a road structure\r\n\r\nsuch  as bridges and flyovers.  Prior to the commencement\r\n\r\nof  such  works,  engineering plans  and  other  relevant\r\n\r\ninformation  will  have  to  be  submitted  by  qualified\r\n\r\npersons to LTA for approval.   Any failure to do so  will\r\n\r\nbe considered an offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Powers to enter into non-State lands</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also propose to amend the SWA to empower LTA\r\n\r\nto enter private lands to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) construct earth retaining walls and ancillary\r\n\r\nbuildings;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) install traffic control and monitoring\r\n\r\nequipment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) operate and maintain earth retaining walls,\r\n\r\nancillary  buildings and traffic control  and  monitoring\r\n\r\nequipment; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) improve walkways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, LTA has powers to enter private lands to\r\n\r\nconstruct  road  structures such as bridges,  underpasses\r\n\r\nand  tunnels.   However,  for the construction  of  earth\r\n\r\nretaining  walls  and  ancillary buildings,  LTA  has  to\r\n\r\nacquire  the  lands.  In some cases, only the underground\r\n\r\nportions  of these structures extend into private  lands.\r\n\r\nAs  LTA  does  not require the land above the underground\r\n\r\nportion, acquisition is not a good option as it will lead\r\n\r\nto unnecessary sterilisation of this land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this, clause 3(d) amends the definition of\r\n\r\n\"road  structure\"  to include earth retaining  walls  and\r\n\r\nancillary  buildings.  With the amendment,  LTA  can  now\r\n\r\nenter  private land to construct the underground  portion\r\n\r\nof these structures without the need to acquire the land.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, Members can be assured that as  far\r\n\r\nas  possible,  LTA will locate road structures  on  State\r\n\r\nland so as not to inconvenience private owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, LTA currently also has powers to enter\r\n\r\nprivate land to construct road-related facilities such as\r\n\r\ntraffic  signs, street name signs and directional  signs.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for  the  installation of traffic  control  and\r\n\r\nmonitoring equipment, the current practice is for LTA  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with  private landowners on commercial  terms.\r\n\r\nThis process of negotiation may take months, resulting in\r\n\r\ninefficiency  and delays in implementing traffic  control\r\n\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expedite the process, clause 3(d) expands the\r\n\r\ndefinition   of   \"road-related  facility\"   to   include\r\n\r\nelectronic   and  computerised  traffic  monitoring   and\r\n\r\ndisplay  equipment.  Examples of such  equipment  include\r\n\r\nEMAS  cameras, Junction Eyes, dynamic traffic information\r\n\r\ndisplay  signboards  and  electronic  signs.   With  this\r\n\r\namendment, LTA can now enter private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland   to  install,  operate  and  maintain  road-related\r\n\r\nfacilities   such  as  traffic  control  and   monitoring\r\n\r\nequipment, without engaging in lengthy negotiations  with\r\n\r\nthe  private owners.  Owners who wish to make a claim for\r\n\r\ncompensation  as  a result of this entry  can  do  so  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above, there are occasions when LTA\r\n\r\nwill  need  to tap electricity from private  premises  to\r\n\r\noperate  and  maintain road-related facilities,  such  as\r\n\r\ntraffic surveillance equipment erected on non-State land,\r\n\r\nor to light up signages at bus and taxi stands located on\r\n\r\nadjoining State land.  Clause 7 will empower LTA  to  tap\r\n\r\nelectricity from the private premises.  LTA will pay  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  supplier  directly  based  on   the   amount\r\n\r\nindicated  on the electrical meters.  In cases  where  no\r\n\r\nelectrical meters are installed, the electricity supplier\r\n\r\nwill be paid in accordance with the formula specified  in\r\n\r\nsection 10A.  In no circumstance will the owners  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  premises  from which the  electricity  is  being\r\n\r\ntapped  be billed for the electricity that is tapped  for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the SWA will also be amended to empower LTA\r\n\r\nto enter any land to improve walkways.  LTA currently has\r\n\r\npowers to enter any land to construct walkways for use by\r\n\r\nthe  public, but no powers to enter the land  to  improve\r\n\r\nit.   Clause 15 amends the SWA to enable LTA to do  this.\r\n\r\nLTA will only exercise this power as a last resort in the\r\n\r\ninterest of public safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Self-regulation for submission of plans</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with Government's policy to streamline\r\n\r\nthe  approval process, clause 10 amends the SWA to enable\r\n\r\nLTA to set up its own lodgement scheme for the submission\r\n\r\nof plans for the construction of new streets.  Instead of\r\n\r\nrequiring LTA's approval for each plan, the plans will be\r\n\r\ndeemed  as approved upon lodgement by a qualified  person\r\n\r\nwith  LTA.   The  new  scheme  will  be  based  on  self-regulation.  In other words, the onus will be on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualified persons to ensure that the street plans are  in\r\n\r\ncompliance  with  the requirements of  the  SWA  and  its\r\n\r\nregulations.  LTA will carry out random checks to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  submitted plans comply with  the  requirements\r\n\r\nstated in the SWA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA intends to start the scheme with landed housing\r\n\r\ndevelopments that are not affected by road widening.   It\r\n\r\nwill be extended to other developments if it proves to be\r\n\r\neffective in ensuring that qualified persons check  their\r\n\r\nplans  for  compliance  with  LTA's  requirements  before\r\n\r\nmaking  their submissions. It will be an offence  if  the\r\n\r\nqualified   person   makes  a  false   declaration   when\r\n\r\nsubmitting plans under the new scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Winding up of Municipal Provident Fund</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also propose to take the opportunity of\r\n\r\namending  the  Street Works Act to wind up the  Municipal\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund.   The  Municipal  Provident   Fund   was\r\n\r\nestablished  in the 1920s by the then City Council  under\r\n\r\nthe provisions of the Municipal Ordinance.  Currently, it\r\n\r\nis  provided for under the Second Schedule of the  Street\r\n\r\nWorks Act after the Local Government Integration Act  was\r\n\r\nrepealed in 1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund was set up to receive contributions from\r\n\r\nits  members  and  to make payments  to  them  on  death,\r\n\r\nresignation   or   retirement.   Its  members   comprised\r\n\r\nemployees  in the Housing and Development Board  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board as well as those  in  Government\r\n\r\nministries  who had prior service with the City  Council.\r\n\r\nThe last eligible member was paid in September 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund also has an unclaimed balance of $6,645 due\r\n\r\nto  some ex-members.  Many of these payments had remained\r\n\r\nunclaimed  since 1979, with some unclaimed  since  1960s.\r\n\r\nThe  Accountant-General's Department (AGD) has made  many\r\n\r\nattempts  to  contact these ex-members.   However,  these\r\n\r\nattempts  have not been successful.  As the AGD does  not\r\n\r\nenvisage any further transaction, it intends to  wind  up\r\n\r\nthe Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 seeks to dissolve the Fund. The balance\r\n\r\nin  the Fund will be transferred to the Consolidated Fund\r\n\r\nupon  the  Fund's dissolution.  Any person who wishes  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  claim  to the unclaimed moneys in the  Fund  may\r\n\r\nstill  do so at any time in the manner set out in  clause\r\n\r\n24.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments proposed in the Bill\r\n\r\nconcern   the  refinement  of  existing  procedures   and\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendments to the SWA  and  other  written\r\n\r\nlaws arising from the amendments I have spelt out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  rise in support of  the  Street  Works\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  moved by the  Minister  of  State  for\r\n\r\nTransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have two concerns with respect to this\r\n\r\nBill which I would like the Minister to clarify further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns clause 5 which amends section\r\n\r\n9(1)  to enable entry by LTA into non-State land and take\r\n\r\npossession  of  any land with the intent of  constructing\r\n\r\nand   improving  streets  or  install  or   remove   road\r\n\r\nstructures and road-related facilities thereon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope, Sir, that such works, as far as\r\n\r\npossible,  are  performed on State lands and  that  entry\r\n\r\ninto  private  properties is considered only  as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort with the interest of the general public in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Street Works Act 1995, subject to\r\n\r\nthe  provision of a two-month notice period, empowers the\r\n\r\nAuthority  to  enter  private land  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nconstructing   road-related  facilities   or   structures\r\n\r\nwithout  providing any compensatory claims to the  person\r\n\r\nentitled  beforehand. The person entitled is required  to\r\n\r\nfile his claim for losses if he desires so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our nation inches towards developed nation\r\n\r\nstatus, it is imperative that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe pay particular attention to legislation that leaves  a\r\n\r\nsegment  of our population without proper legal recourse.\r\n\r\nI  see the provision of the Act to acquire land which the\r\n\r\nAuthority feels necessary in the public interest  without\r\n\r\ndetermining   compensation  for  the  land   before   the\r\n\r\nacquisition  takes place, such as being provided  for  in\r\n\r\nthe  Land Acquisition Act, as denying property owners  of\r\n\r\ntheir  basic rights.  It appears not to be in  congruence\r\n\r\nwith   our  objective  of  building  a  nation   with   a\r\n\r\ncompetitive mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our Government enterprises and Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  sell land and charge rents based on prevailing\r\n\r\nmarket conditions, we need to bear in mind that acquiring\r\n\r\nland  under  such  forced  situations  and  uncompetitive\r\n\r\nconditions  is unfair and not in the direct  interest  of\r\n\r\nour  citizens.   This amendment to the Street  Works  Act\r\n\r\nshould therefore take this issue into account by removing\r\n\r\nthe   injustice  of  disregarding  due  process  for  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  who own land.  The amendment should  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  Singapore's maturing  status  and  address\r\n\r\nthis  issue so that land may be acquired under firm means\r\n\r\nbut  paid for at a reasonable and, preferably, prevailing\r\n\r\nmarket  price.  Consideration should also  be  given  for\r\n\r\ninconveniences that private property owners  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsubjected to when such works are carried out within their\r\n\r\npremises.  It is important that the message comes through\r\n\r\nto  those  outside of our Parliament's walls  that  their\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  firm  but  also  fair.   Clarifying  this\r\n\r\nsection  will  reinforce public sentiment that  a  fairer\r\n\r\nplaying  field is now on stage.  Private owners  of  land\r\n\r\nneed  not  worry about losing their properties  but  will\r\n\r\nfind   due   recourse  through  fair  consideration   and\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is the amendment to section 27 as\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in clause 15 of the amendment  Bill.   The\r\n\r\nsame concerns I have expressed earlier also apply to  the\r\n\r\nnewly substituted subsections (1) and (2) of this clause.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as Singaporeans are encouraged to use public\r\n\r\ntransport  and simpler modes of transportation,  we  will\r\n\r\nrequire better walkways and footpaths to traverse on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile subsection (2) of section 27 of the 1995 Act states\r\n\r\nin  minimal  wordage that \"footways should  be  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  3.6 metres wide\", the clause  is  silent  in\r\n\r\nspecifying a minimum width for footpath.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress as a nation, I think it is important\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to place on equal parity the  safety\r\n\r\nand  well-being  of the population that uses  its  public\r\n\r\nwalkways   for  its  everyday  needs  to  that   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  when  it  comes to managing  efficient  and\r\n\r\nsmooth-flowing roads.  This will help, albeit in a  small\r\n\r\nway,  to  encourage more to use public transport than  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  private  methods  of  transportation.   Every\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  counts  in our drive  to  conserve  land  by\r\n\r\ndiscouraging  the use of private vehicles.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nopportune  time for us to realise our vision as  part  of\r\n\r\nthis legislation.  What the public would like to see  and\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Street Works (Amendment) Bill should  consider\r\n\r\nproviding at the minimum is legislation that ensures  (a)\r\n\r\nconvenience; (b) safe; and (c) accessible walkways for  a\r\n\r\nlarge segment of the population.  I feel that our present\r\n\r\nBill needs a clearer mandate to help encourage people  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  our walkways in a manner that  provides  a\r\n\r\nseamless connector to their destinations or their  travel\r\n\r\norigins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose a broader and better defined\r\n\r\nset of characteristics that will help our population make\r\n\r\nuse  of  our walkways to get to our bus stops, MRT  train\r\n\r\nstations,  public  buildings  or  simply  move  from  one\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  to another.  These include (a)  setting  a\r\n\r\nminimum  width  for a footpath where two  adults  walking\r\n\r\nabreast can have enough room to traverse comfortably; and\r\n\r\n(b)  having a set of guidelines that would provide for  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable gradient when a footpath comes to an end, eg,\r\n\r\nat road crossings or at level shifts between buildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, it would also benefit our\r\n\r\npedestrians  to have these walkways offset some  distance\r\n\r\nfrom the road tarmac, wherever possible.  This would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  them  safer  in the minds of our  pedestrians  and,\r\n\r\npossibly,     discourage    jaywalking    if    immediate\r\n\r\naccessibility  to  the  road tarmac  is  removed.   These\r\n\r\nproposals  will go a long way in encouraging  our  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens,  families with children, those  with  strollers\r\n\r\nand  especially  the handicapped gain  greater  mobility,\r\n\r\nindependence and ease to get from one point  to  another.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  concern that as we progressively develop  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  modes  of public transportation  that  the\r\n\r\nlast  mile to and from our stations is left only for  the\r\n\r\nbrave and adventurous.  We must, as a progressive nation,\r\n\r\nlook  ahead  to  building a footpath  network  that  will\r\n\r\ncomplement   our   otherwise  world-class  transportation\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, once again, I support the\r\n\r\namendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me\r\n\r\nto speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot support this Bill. Some of its\r\n\r\nprovisions are too unfair.  For example, clause  5  which\r\n\r\namends  section 9 of the principal Act is  one  of  them.\r\n\r\nThis  clause  gives the Authority more power  to  acquire\r\n\r\nland  compulsorily  to  build roads  without  paying  any\r\n\r\ncompensation at all to the landowner whose land has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Authority.  I do not see why compensation\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  paid  to  the landowner.   The  land  is\r\n\r\nacquired  to make it into a public road.  True, a  public\r\n\r\nroad  does provide a public good.  But the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  providing  the  public good  for  nothing.   On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  in  these  days  of  COE  and  high   motorcar\r\n\r\nregistration and licence fees, the Government is  reaping\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars each year from motorists for road use\r\n\r\nand  the privilege of owning a car.  In view of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is making huge profits for road  use\r\n\r\nby  motorists, I think it is fair that clause  5  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  should  be amended to include a provision  for  the\r\n\r\npayment of compensation to landowners whose land has been\r\n\r\ncompulsorily acquired for building a public road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, in the past, the Government did pay\r\n\r\ncompensation to landowners\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose land was compulsorily acquired for construction  of\r\n\r\npublic  roads.   The amount paid was  normally  $1.   The\r\n\r\nreason  for  that  token payment is that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwants to protect itself  in law.  The Government does not\r\n\r\nwant  to  end  up  in  a situation  later  on  where  the\r\n\r\nlandowner  turns around and claims the land back  on  the\r\n\r\nground  that his land was acquired without payment  of  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  consideration.  As all lawyers know, a contract\r\n\r\nwithout  a  valuable consideration later may be  declared\r\n\r\nnull  and void.  So, the Government pays the landowner  a\r\n\r\ncompensation  of $1 which is a valuable consideration  in\r\n\r\nthe eyes of the law.  But with this amendment in clause 5\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill,  the  Authority is armed  with  statutory\r\n\r\npowers  to compulsorily acquire land for construction  of\r\n\r\npublic roads without payment of any compensation at  all.\r\n\r\nSo,  the past practice of paying $1 to provide a valuable\r\n\r\nconsideration for the compulsory acquisition of  land  is\r\n\r\nnow redundant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a former client, when I was still in legal\r\n\r\npractice, whose land was compulsorily acquired  for  road\r\n\r\nbuilding.  He was paid $1 compensation by cheque.  He did\r\n\r\nnot  bother  to  bank  in the $1  cheque  into  his  bank\r\n\r\naccount.  He had the $1 cheque framed up and hung on  his\r\n\r\noffice wall.  I am just wondering whether that $1 cheque,\r\n\r\nwhich  was in payment of compensation for land taken  for\r\n\r\nroad  building by the Government, is still on his  office\r\n\r\nwall.   If it is, then it is a valuable collector's item.\r\n\r\nBecause  with this amendment today, the Government  shall\r\n\r\nnot be making payment of $1 cheques anymore to compensate\r\n\r\nfor  the  compulsory  acquisition  of  private  land   to\r\n\r\nconstruct public roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision in the Bill which I am\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  is new section  10A(6).   Under  this\r\n\r\nclause, the Authority is allowed to tap electricity  from\r\n\r\nadjoining  land  when  the  Authority  is  carrying   out\r\n\r\nconstruction  or improvement works on a  piece  of  land.\r\n\r\nLater,  should  there be a dispute  in  the  quantity  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  used by the Authority, the landowner's  only\r\n\r\nrecourse is to make an appeal to the Minister.   We  must\r\n\r\nremember that it is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister's  department which is a party  to  the  dispute\r\n\r\nwith the appellant over the amount of electricity used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point, I must make it clear that I am\r\n\r\nnot  saying or insinuating that the Minister is an unfair\r\n\r\nperson,  and  is  sure to side the officers  of  his  own\r\n\r\ndepartment.  But in the eyes of the law, justice must not\r\n\r\nonly  be done but must be seen to be done.  In this case,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  cannot be made the arbiter  when  his  own\r\n\r\ndepartment's officers are involved in the case.  To me, I\r\n\r\nthink  it  would be fairer if this new section 10A(6)  be\r\n\r\namended  to  allow the appeal to be made to a  manifestly\r\n\r\nneutral  person, say, either a judge in chambers  of  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court or the subordinate court.  This clause, as  it\r\n\r\nstands,  makes  the  appeal to  the  Minister  where  his\r\n\r\ndecision is final very unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment which I do not agree is new\r\n\r\nsection 32A(3)(c).  New section 32A(1) states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No person shall -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) deposit or cause or allow any article or thing to be\r\n\r\ndeposited  on any public street, five-footway or  private\r\n\r\nfootway; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) cause or allow any article or thing to remain on any\r\n\r\npublic street, five footway or private footway,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  as to create any obstruction or inconvenience to  the\r\n\r\npassage of the public on such public street, five-footway\r\n\r\nor private footway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who contravenes the abovementioned clauses\r\n\r\nshall  be  guilty of an offence.  If such an  offence  is\r\n\r\ncommitted, the Authority can go after (a) \"the  owner  of\r\n\r\nthe  article  or  thing;\" (b) the person who  caused  the\r\n\r\narticle or thing to be illegally deposited; and (c)  \"the\r\n\r\nowner  or  occupier  of  any land or  building  fronting,\r\n\r\nadjoining  or abutting on the public street, five-footway\r\n\r\nor private footway.\"  I cannot agree with sub-clause (c).\r\n\r\nHow  can  the  owner  of any land  or  building  that  is\r\n\r\nfronting  or adjoining on the public street, five-footway\r\n\r\nor private footway be held liable when things or articles\r\n\r\nare  illegally dumped in his vicinity?  To me, he  is  an\r\n\r\ninnocent  party.   He  cannot be made  to  look  out  for\r\n\r\nillegal  dumping  in the adjoining public  street,  five-footway or private footway all the time.  I agree that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  owner or the person who throws unwanted bulky  items\r\n\r\non  the public street, five-footway or private footway be\r\n\r\nmade responsible, but not one who lives next  to a public\r\n\r\nstreet or private footway.  This is the first time I have\r\n\r\ncome across a provision where a person is made liable for\r\n\r\na  crime  by virtue of the fact that he is close  to  the\r\n\r\ncrime where the crime took place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Potong Pasir, there are high-rise blocks of flats\r\n\r\nwhich  are situated close or next to the central  rubbish\r\n\r\ncentres.   Sometimes,  there are outsiders  who,  in  the\r\n\r\nstealth  of the early hours of the morning, make  illegal\r\n\r\ndumping  of  bulky  items in these  centres.   When  that\r\n\r\nhappens,  my  Town Council has to spend quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  clear  all the illegal bulky  items  that  are\r\n\r\ndumped at our rubbish centres.  Can I, as the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Potong  Pasir Town Council, make the  residents  who\r\n\r\nlive  adjacent to the central rubbish centre pay for  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of those illegal items?  I certainly think  not.\r\n\r\nUp  to  now,  the  Potong  Pasir Town  Council  has  been\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  preventing  illegal  dumping  and  also\r\n\r\napprehending  those culprits that we find,  and  we  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility to remove the dumped items.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I do not think that those owners or\r\n\r\noccupiers  of  land adjoining the public  streets,  five-footways  and private footways should be made responsible\r\n\r\nfor  any  illegal  dumping on them.   I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to delete new section 32A(3)(c), under clause 18\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill, and let the Authority take on itself  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of preventing illegal dumping  on  public\r\n\r\nstreets and apprehending and punishing the wrongdoers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  in support of the Street Works (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a time when I see street works in progress, I\r\n\r\nwonder  how  much more public streets and  their  related\r\n\r\nroad structures and facilities can Singapore conti-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnue  to  bear  without encroaching onto private  land  or\r\n\r\nState  land  that  has already been  built  upon.   As  a\r\n\r\ncountry   progresses   and  aspiration   increases,   new\r\n\r\nbuildings  for offices and homes will continue to  sprout\r\n\r\nup.   Street works then become more complicated as demand\r\n\r\nfor  common  space in a limited land area  increases.   A\r\n\r\nsensible  and fair handling of plan for the construction,\r\n\r\nimprovement,   repair,  maintenance  and  management   of\r\n\r\nstreets  and back-lanes and the prevention of obstruction\r\n\r\nof footways are necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 introduces new definitions to section 2 of\r\n\r\nthe  Street Works Act (Chapter 320A).  Public streets are\r\n\r\nnow  clearly defined to mean only streets that are vested\r\n\r\nin  the  Government.  This is important as otherwise  any\r\n\r\nstreet  which is privately owned but through the goodwill\r\n\r\nof  the  owner  allows public to use  may  over  time  be\r\n\r\nwrongly    classified   as   \"public   streets\".     Such\r\n\r\nclarification will also help in the valuation of  private\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of a new section 32A (under clause 18)\r\n\r\nis certainly a necessary power for the LTA to ensure that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  public  streets, five-footways  and  private\r\n\r\nfootways are clear and clean.  However, I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to clarify what does \"obstruction\"  mean.   The\r\n\r\nnew section 32A, subsection (1), states that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) deposit or cause or allow any article or thing to be\r\n\r\ndeposited  on any public street, five-footway or  private\r\n\r\nfootway; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) cause or allow any article or thing to remain on any\r\n\r\npublic street, five-footway or private footway,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  as to create any obstruction or inconvenience to  the\r\n\r\npassage of the public on such public street, five-footway\r\n\r\nor private footway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does \"obstruction\" here extend to young saplings\r\n\r\nwhich  over  time will grow to become huge  public  trees\r\n\r\nblocking the path of a public footway?  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along East Coast Road, in front of the Katong\r\n\r\nShopping Centre at Mountbatten, is an overhead pedestrian\r\n\r\nbridge which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas been in existence for many years.  About a metre away\r\n\r\nat  the foot of the steps leading down from the bridge to\r\n\r\nthe  footpath, which leads to the bus stop, stands a huge\r\n\r\nAngsana tree obstructing pedestrians from having a  clear\r\n\r\npassageway.   One has to be nimble in his  footwork  when\r\n\r\nstepping  down from the steps onto the footpath to  avoid\r\n\r\nthe  roots  of  the  tree that have  protruded  from  the\r\n\r\nground.  In fact, one could literally hug the tree  after\r\n\r\nstepping down from the steps of the bridge.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nwhile  making a swing round the tree, one has to, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, make sure that he does not step onto the busy\r\n\r\nstreet before walking towards the bus stop.  I am not too\r\n\r\nsure  whether it was the tree that was planted after  the\r\n\r\noverhead  pedestrian bridge was built or  the  other  way\r\n\r\nround.  But, clearly, an obstruction is in the way  of  a\r\n\r\nbusy passageway.  Will this proposed amendment then allow\r\n\r\nthe  LTA  to  cut  down the tree which, I believe,  comes\r\n\r\nunder  the National Parks Board's care?  Or does it  mean\r\n\r\nthat LTA will have to move the pedestrian overhead bridge\r\n\r\naway  from  the obstruction?  I hope it does not  require\r\n\r\nanother  amendment  to  the  legislation  to  provide   a\r\n\r\ncommonsense solution to such a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, which is the opposite extreme, also\r\n\r\narises from matured trees.  But, this time, the trees are\r\n\r\nnot  obstructing the public streets.  It was to my horror\r\n\r\nthat  I  discovered on Friday last week, 27th June  2003,\r\n\r\nthat  the Land Transport Authority, in the name of street\r\n\r\nworks,  cut  down 10 healthy Casuarina pine  trees  along\r\n\r\nDunman  Road,  in front of the Guillemard military  camp,\r\n\r\nafter  the proposed Tanjong Katong MRT station that  will\r\n\r\nform  part of the new MRT Circle Line.  Those trees  have\r\n\r\nbeen  there for about 35 years.  They provided good shade\r\n\r\nand beauty, and are not obstructing any public street  or\r\n\r\nfootpath, nor are they in the way of the construction  of\r\n\r\nthe underground MRT station.  I understand that more will\r\n\r\nbe chopped off as I speak now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples show the exercise of powers without\r\n\r\ndue consideration to other factors that do contribute  to\r\n\r\na neighbourhood rich in history.  The serenity and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeauty  that  took  so  long to  achieve  have  now  been\r\n\r\ndestroyed.   Again,  a  commonsense approach  could  have\r\n\r\nsaved  those  trees  rather  than  treating  them  as  an\r\n\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 introduces a new section 29A that clearly\r\n\r\nstates that, \"The Authority shall be responsible for  the\r\n\r\nmanagement,  maintenance and repair of back-lanes  vested\r\n\r\nin  the  Government.\"  This is a welcome move as it  will\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  back-lanes are well looked  after  and\r\n\r\nprovided   for  because  additional  common   space   for\r\n\r\nresidents living along the lanes will benefit from  them,\r\n\r\nrather than letting these lanes become homes for unwanted\r\n\r\nanimals and undesirable characters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to amend section 9(1) to provide more\r\n\r\npowers  to  the Land Transport Authority of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nenter  upon  and take possession of any land,  not  being\r\n\r\nState  land, and construct or improve street, or  install\r\n\r\nor  improve  road  structure and  road  related  facility\r\n\r\nthereon.   While it is a good intention of the  Authority\r\n\r\nnot  to do anything that shall alter the ownership of the\r\n\r\nland  that  is affected, the owner may still  face  great\r\n\r\ninconvenience  and a loss of income in some  cases  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the road works.  This is especially so when the\r\n\r\nAuthority has the right to give them the minimum of  only\r\n\r\ntwo  months' notice, under section 9(2), of its intention\r\n\r\nto  enter  private land to construct new  streets.   Most\r\n\r\nland  owners would take a while to overcome the shock  of\r\n\r\nknowing  that their land would be encroached  upon;  thus\r\n\r\nleaving  a few short weeks after the news to prepare  for\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  the bulldozers start  going  into  their\r\n\r\nproperty.   Knowing  that this is  the  feeling  of  land\r\n\r\nowners, I trust the Authority will exercise fairness  and\r\n\r\ncompassion in the enforcement of its powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the amendment to section 20 (under clause\r\n\r\n11)  which  seeks to regularise the practice of accepting\r\n\r\nsecurity bonds from banks and insurance companies in lieu\r\n\r\nof cash is timely, especially when businesses are seeking\r\n\r\nways of making their cash balances work harder for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments to the Street Works\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State for explaining the rationale to the\r\n\r\namendments  in  this  Bill, which I agree  will  help  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  conditions for commuters  and  pedestrians.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have two concerns that I hope the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState will kindly clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like my other colleagues before me, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  refer to clause 5 which amends section 9(1)  to\r\n\r\nauthorise the Land Transport Authority to take possession\r\n\r\nof  any  land  to  construct or improve  any  street,  or\r\n\r\ninstall  or  remove any road structure and  road  related\r\n\r\nfacility.   Could  the Ministry please clarify  and  give\r\n\r\ndetails  on  how the owners of land will be  notified  or\r\n\r\ncompensated under this Bill?  Currently, there  are  such\r\n\r\nprovisions under the Land Acquisition Act for the LTA  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate with land owners for land that is needed  on  a\r\n\r\nnon-urgent  basis.  Does the property purchasing  section\r\n\r\nof  the  LTA  function in the same way under  the  Street\r\n\r\nWorks  Act when land is being acquired for better  roads?\r\n\r\nCould  the Ministry please clarify should some amendments\r\n\r\nbe included in the Schedule to this Bill?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern is in reference to clause 15\r\n\r\n(section  27).  Land can be acquired to improve  existing\r\n\r\nwalkways  or  to construct new ones.  In the  process  of\r\n\r\ndesigning or redesigning walkways, may I please ask  that\r\n\r\nprovision  be  made  for wider footpaths  to  accommodate\r\n\r\nespecially the width of wheelchairs.  In some cases, some\r\n\r\nfootpaths are really narrow.  And I think with  an  aging\r\n\r\npopulation and more people wanting to be mobile  as  they\r\n\r\nuse  their  wheelchairs, it becomes  important  that  our\r\n\r\nfootpaths  are wide enough.  Some of our elderly  do  use\r\n\r\nwalking  sticks; some mums and dads do push their  babies\r\n\r\nout  in  strollers; and where the walkways are  concerned\r\n\r\nhere, sometimes the quality is not there and they are not\r\n\r\nwell   maintained.   As  such,  under  the  Street  Works\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill, is it possible then to  add  a  clause\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafety  issues  are considered such that  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nwalkways  will  always be there, so that people  can  use\r\n\r\nthem  knowing  that they will not be  injured?   Like  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  Mr  Andy Gan said earlier, we have  seen  tree\r\n\r\nroots  in  the walkway itself.  We have seen  lamp  posts\r\n\r\nintruding  into  the footpath that has  been  beautifully\r\n\r\nconstructed.   We have also seen those huge grey  utility\r\n\r\nboxes  taking  up  almost  a third  of  the  width  of  a\r\n\r\nfootpath.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One special section of a footpath that I would\r\n\r\nperhaps  like to draw attention to would be  Bedok  South\r\n\r\nAvenue  1  along Upper East Coast Road.   It  is  a  very\r\n\r\nnarrow footpath that I think anyone who is not able  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to use.  While we spend much money on  such\r\n\r\nconstruction, it will be good to have a safety clause  so\r\n\r\nthat  that becomes a maintenance issue that we  can  take\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before one can support this Bill, I would like some\r\n\r\nassurance, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  their speeches on this  Bill  and  I  shall\r\n\r\nclarify  some  of the questions that have been  asked  by\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad asked if we were depriving property\r\n\r\nowners  of their basic rights with the amendment made  by\r\n\r\nclause  5.   Mr  Chiam See Tong was also concerned  about\r\n\r\nthis  and  so too were the other two Members.   Mr  Ahmad\r\n\r\nMagad  has  also mentioned that we should consider  using\r\n\r\nthe powers to enter into non-State land as a last resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that these are indeed our\r\n\r\nintentions,  ie, to try and protect the basic  rights  of\r\n\r\nowners  and to try and enter into their land  as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort.   As  I  mentioned earlier, this  amendment  will\r\n\r\nallow   LTA   to  construct  earth-retaining  walls   and\r\n\r\nancillary  buildings without the need  to  sterilise  the\r\n\r\nland  above  the underground portions of the  structures.\r\n\r\nThis will therefore reduce the need for land acquisition.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, LTA will try as far as possible to carry out\r\n\r\nall  such  works  on State lands and entry  into  private\r\n\r\nproperties will only be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarried  out as a last resort.  In cases where LTA  needs\r\n\r\nto  enter  private  land, LTA will  also  compensate  the\r\n\r\nowners for the displacement loss, ie, the loss of use for\r\n\r\nthe  period  of time when LTA is carrying out the  works.\r\n\r\nThe  owners are required to submit the claims because the\r\n\r\ndetails  may  vary  from  case  to  case.   Without  this\r\n\r\namendment,  LTA would be forced to acquire  the  land  in\r\n\r\norder to do this work.  But with this amendment, LTA  can\r\n\r\navoid  acquiring the land.  So the aim of this  amendment\r\n\r\nis  actually to allow property owners to keep their land.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in cases where the owners would prefer  LTA  to\r\n\r\nacquire  the land, the Bill also provides for flexibility\r\n\r\nfor LTA to consider this option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has also suggested minimum width and\r\n\r\nguidelines for gradient to be set for walkways to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat they are convenient, safe and accessible.  Ms Braema\r\n\r\nMathia  is also concerned about the width of the walkways\r\n\r\nso  that  the  disabled on wheelchairs can use  them.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to assure the House that the LTA  does  have\r\n\r\nstandards for the construction of footways.  This  varies\r\n\r\nfrom  between  2.4 metres and 4 metres and its  width  is\r\n\r\nmore than comfortable for more than two people to walk or\r\n\r\na wheelchair to be used.  However, the preferred approach\r\n\r\nis  to  use  these  standards as guidelines  rather  than\r\n\r\nmandatory   minimum  requirements,  as   there   may   be\r\n\r\nsituations  that call for flexibility in the exercise  of\r\n\r\nsuch standards.  For example, a footpath may need to be a\r\n\r\ncouple  of  inches short of the minimum width requirement\r\n\r\nat  a  specific  point,  for example,  when  there  is  a\r\n\r\nheritage tree.  In such an instance, we would not want to\r\n\r\nchop  down the tree so that we can meet the minimum width\r\n\r\nrequirement,  nor  would we want to  avoid  building  the\r\n\r\nfootpath because of the tree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan has asked what is considered an\r\n\r\nobstruction.    He  also  asked  whether   the   proposed\r\n\r\namendment  will allow us to remove trees.   Allow  me  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that obstructions in the context of  the  Street\r\n\r\nWorks (Amendment) Bill refer to articles or things that a\r\n\r\nperson deposits or allows to remain on any public street,\r\n\r\nfive-footways or private footways.  Trees\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not fall within this definition.  If any particular\r\n\r\ntree  is  causing an obstruction or danger to the public,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has powers under the Parks and Trees  Act\r\n\r\nto deal with it and NParks enforces this Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam was concerned about LTA tapping electricity\r\n\r\nfrom  private  premises.   The  purpose  of  having  this\r\n\r\namendment  is  so  that  in the  construction  of  roads,\r\n\r\nspecial  cables  need  not  be laid  just  for  obtaining\r\n\r\nelectricity for the purpose of the construction.  As this\r\n\r\nelectricity  tap from private premises will have  meters,\r\n\r\nit  is  quite easy to determine how much electricity  has\r\n\r\nbeen  used  by LTA and to pay directly to the Electricity\r\n\r\nBoard the amounts due.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also concerned about the liability of owners\r\n\r\nof  private property to obstruction in public land in the\r\n\r\nvicinity of the private property.  The amendment  in  new\r\n\r\nsection  32A  will only affect the owner of  the  private\r\n\r\nwalkway when he has a legal duty to maintain that walkway\r\n\r\nin a manner without obstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I get some\r\n\r\nclarifications  from the Minister  of  State.   I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  when  he  says  that,  under  clause  5,  the\r\n\r\nauthority can take possession of any land without  owning\r\n\r\nit.   Am  I  correct?   So you are only  taking  physical\r\n\r\npossession but not legal possession.  When the  authority\r\n\r\nuses this land for road use, is there a transfer of legal\r\n\r\ntitle   to  the  authority?   I  would  want  this  point\r\n\r\nclarified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got two more points. As regards the point on\r\n\r\ntapping  of  electricity, I was  more  concerned  of  the\r\n\r\nmanner in which the appeal is made. The appeal is made to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and the Minister is, at least, outwardly  a\r\n\r\nbiased  person because it is his own department  that  is\r\n\r\nappealing to him.  So in law, not only justice has to  be\r\n\r\ndone,  but it has to be seen to be done.  In other words,\r\n\r\nwhen  people say that the appeal is to the Minister, they\r\n\r\nwould straightaway say it is not fair.  But if you appeal\r\n\r\nto  a  neutral person, they will be quiet.  So we  should\r\n\r\nhave the appeal to a neutral person.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards new section 32A, I do not think there is\r\n\r\nanything in the section which says that the owner of  the\r\n\r\nland,  or the occupier of the land adjacent to the public\r\n\r\nstreet,  has the duty to take charge of the  street.   It\r\n\r\ndoes not say that.  As long as you are living adjacent or\r\n\r\nabutting  the public street and if somebody  throws  some\r\n\r\nrubbish  there, you are liable if a notice is  served  on\r\n\r\nyou  for  21  days and you do not do anything  about  it.\r\n\r\nThat is how I read it.  Is that correct?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without going\r\n\r\ninto  detailed legal arguments with Mr Chiam, as he is  a\r\n\r\nlawyer  and I am not, I would like to clarify  the  three\r\n\r\npoints  that he raised.  With regard to the first  point,\r\n\r\nyes,  LTA  will  possess  the  land  in  order  to  build\r\n\r\nancillary  structures, but it will not acquire the  land,\r\n\r\nand  it will pay compensation for the use or displacement\r\n\r\nduring that period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second point, I do not see a\r\n\r\nmajor problem in determining how much of electricity that\r\n\r\nis being taken from the private premises as there will be\r\n\r\na  meter which will record how much electricity is  being\r\n\r\nused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with regard to his third legal point, the\r\n\r\nprinciple is, if the owner has the legal duty to maintain\r\n\r\nthat  space  and  he  does not keep that  space  free  of\r\n\r\nobstruction,  such  that  pedestrians  cannot   use   the\r\n\r\nwalkway, then the LTA will act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am sorry I have to take\r\n\r\nup this point again. Whatever the Minister of State says,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  reflected in the amendment.   He  says  that\r\n\r\ncompensation  shall be paid to the land  owner  when  his\r\n\r\nland  is taken by LTA.  Where does it say that in  clause\r\n\r\n5?   Can he point out to me?  Under clause 5, there is no\r\n\r\nlegal  duty for the authority to pay any compensation  to\r\n\r\nthe  land  owner  for  the land in  which  it  has  taken\r\n\r\npossession of.  It does not say that at all.  And it does\r\n\r\nnot  say that the provisions of the Land Acquisition  Act\r\n\r\nshall also have effect.  It does not say that.  So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know where he gets the legal standpoint from.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards new section 32A, it does not say that the\r\n\r\nowner  or  occupier  of  any land or  building  fronting,\r\n\r\nadjoining  or abutting a public street, five-footways  or\r\n\r\nprivate footways has got any legal duty to take charge of\r\n\r\nthis  public street.  It does not say that.  As  long  as\r\n\r\nyou  are living or occupying next to a public street  and\r\n\r\nsomebody  throws something and you have a  21-day  notice\r\n\r\nserved on you, you have to clear the rubbish.  It  is  as\r\n\r\nsimple as that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, again, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to explain to Mr Chiam that the  reason  why\r\n\r\nthere  is no compensation for acquisition is that,  under\r\n\r\nthis  amendment,  we  are not acquiring  the  land.   The\r\n\r\ncompensation   that  is  being  paid  is  therefore   not\r\n\r\ncompensation   for  acquisition,  but  compensation   for\r\n\r\ndisplacement or loss, that is, the loss of  use  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time when LTA is carrying out the  work.   We\r\n\r\nhave  checked with the AG's Chambers on the  language  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  and it feels that it is sufficiently clear  in\r\n\r\nexplaining  these  and the other points  that  have  been\r\n\r\nraised by Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want to clarify one\r\n\r\npoint.

How temporary is temporary because if\r\n\r\nwe  are  widening  the walkways under the  other  clause,\r\n\r\nsurely  we  are not going to give back the land  at  some\r\n\r\npoint?   In other words, it is not a displacement  issue,\r\n\r\nis it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> You have got the clauses\r\n\r\nconfused.

Most of the ancillary  structures\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking  about here are underground  structures.\r\n\r\nYou  are  talking about the clause that covers  walkways.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment in the clause that covers walkways  is  to\r\n\r\nrepair  walkways.  Currently, we have the power to  build\r\n\r\nwalkways on private land but we do not have the power  to\r\n\r\nimprove\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor maintain them, and the amendment allows us to do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I just want a\r\n\r\nclarification.  In the new section 32A, it specifies that\r\n\r\nLTA can dispose of whatever that is taken or removed from\r\n\r\nobstruction.  It says that it would dispose of  within  a\r\n\r\nspecified  time.  Can the Minister of State clarify  what\r\n\r\nis  a specified time in new section 32A?

This was achieved by Singaporeans coming together\r\n\r\nto  deal  decisively  with the disease.   Our  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers in particular rose to the challenge.  The  battle\r\n\r\nagainst  SARS,  however, has been costly.   To  date,  32\r\n\r\npeople, including five healthcare workers, have died as a\r\n\r\nresult of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS has also imposed a high financial cost on\r\n\r\nSingapore. As of 31st May 2003, the Government has  spent\r\n\r\n$192  million  on direct SARS operating expenditure.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  also introduced a $230 million  economic\r\n\r\nrelief package to assist businesses adversely affected by\r\n\r\nthe SARS outbreak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest share of direct operating expenditure as\r\n\r\na  result of SARS has been incurred by my Ministry.

For  example,\r\n\r\nPolice crime patrols increased by 49% as compared to  the\r\n\r\nperiod  before 9-11.  Police was able to achieve this  by\r\n\r\nleveraging  on  every  available staff  including  Police\r\n\r\nNSmen.   Immediately after 9-11, Police froze all  leave.\r\n\r\nFor  2002,  Police  restricted  leave  to  urgent  cases.\r\n\r\nPolice  also scaled down non-essential services, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  handling of lost and found reports and  rescuing  of\r\n\r\ntrapped  animals,  in  order to  free  up  resources.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the re-organisation of the Neighbourhood Police\r\n\r\nPost  (NPP)  system  to the Neighbourhood  Police  Centre\r\n\r\n(NPC)  system  in 1996 has enabled the Police  to  deploy\r\n\r\nmore   officers   on  patrols,  thus  increasing   police\r\n\r\nvisibility in the neighbourhood and to respond quickly to\r\n\r\ncrime cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Police has been able to handle the\r\n\r\ntwin   challenges  of  combating  crime  and   preventing\r\n\r\nterrorism  because it taps the resources  of  other  Home\r\n\r\nTeam  departments,  as well as the  community  at  large.\r\n\r\nMany  Singaporeans are involved in the  Community  Safety\r\n\r\nand  Security  Programme  and  Neighbourhood  Watch  Zone\r\n\r\nactivities   such   as   Citizens-on-Patrol   and   crime\r\n\r\nprevention   discussions  for  the  elderly.

Sentosa  Development\r\n\r\nCorporation (SDC) is embarking on this project as part of\r\n\r\nits  Masterplan to remake Sentosa as a world-class resort\r\n\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make Sentosa a more attractive resort destination\r\n\r\nfor  both  Singaporeans  and  foreign  tourists,  SDC  is\r\n\r\nbringing  in  major  new leisure  offerings.   Under  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan, visitorship to Sentosa is expected to  grow\r\n\r\nfrom  4.1  million in 2002 to six million  in  2006,  and\r\n\r\neight  million in 2012.  The Sentosa Express will connect\r\n\r\nseamlessly  with  the  MRT network, and  facilitate  this\r\n\r\nlarger  movement  of  visitors  to  and  around  Sentosa.\r\n\r\nVisitors  will  be able to enjoy greater convenience  and\r\n\r\nmuch  shorter  waiting times.

The Republic of Singapore Air  Force\r\n\r\n(RSAF) has been minimising its aircraft from flying  over\r\n\r\ndensely populated residential areas.  However, due to our\r\n\r\ncountry's  limited  airspace, it is inevitable  that  our\r\n\r\naircraft  will  overfly some residential estates  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity of airbases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF needs to conduct day and night flying to\r\n\r\nmaintain  operational readiness for the  defence  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.   We  are already conducting a lot  of  aircraft\r\n\r\ntraining  overseas, but in-country flying still needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  done as our pilots need to be familiar with our local\r\n\r\nairspace environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSAF first instituted noise abatement measures in\r\n\r\nthe  late seventies.  Over the years, other measures have\r\n\r\nbeen   implemented  incrementally.   These  include   the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Raising the minimum transit altitudes of RSAF\r\n\r\naircraft overhead Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Revising departure and arrival routings to\r\n\r\nminimise over-flights of residential areas;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Having our aircraft take the quickest route to\r\n\r\nthe training areas;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Ceasing night-flying by 11.00 pm (unless\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary for operational reasons); and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Scaling down the flying activities during the\r\n\r\nyear-end examination period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to assure residents that MINDEF/RSAF\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to find ways to further  reduce  aircraft\r\n\r\nnoise, while maintaining the operational readiness of the\r\n\r\nRSAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NORTH-EAST LINE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTransport what is the consideration determining that  the\r\n\r\nNorth-East  line  be built underground  and  that  it  be\r\n\r\ndriverless.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East Line (NEL) has to be built\r\n\r\nunderground  because it passes through many  areas  which\r\n\r\nare   already   densely   developed.   By   building   it\r\n\r\nunderground, we also achieve several benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it gives us maximum flexibility to site\r\n\r\nstations  at  more accessible locations for  the  greater\r\n\r\nconvenience of commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it minimises the environmental impact by\r\n\r\nreducing   visual  intrusion  and  noise  pollution   for\r\n\r\nresidents living along the corridor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it allows us to optimise land-use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fully automated system was chosen for the NEL\r\n\r\nbecause of the significant benefits it would bring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is safer. Experience around the world\r\n\r\nshows  that  most  rail accidents  are  caused  by  train\r\n\r\ndrivers.   A  fully  automated system eliminates  such  a\r\n\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it provides greater operating flexibility as\r\n\r\nthe  deployment of trains is no longer dependent  on  the\r\n\r\navailability of train drivers.  This allows the  operator\r\n\r\nto   schedule  train  services  better  and   to   deploy\r\n\r\nadditional  trains  to cope with any sudden  increase  in\r\n\r\npassenger  volume.  This means shorter waiting  time  for\r\n\r\ncommuters on such occasions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it makes better use of manpower. Instead of\r\n\r\nputting  an officer in the driver cabin on each train  to\r\n\r\nperform routine and repetitive functions, the officer can\r\n\r\nnow,  if  necessary, provide direct customer services  to\r\n\r\ncommuters on the train while continuing to attend to  the\r\n\r\nother train operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUILDING COST OF NORTH-EAST LINE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTransport if he will give (i) the total cost of  building\r\n\r\nthe North-East Line and (ii) the breakdown of the cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East Line cost a total of $4.6 billion to\r\n\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comprised (a) $2.7 billion for civil and\r\n\r\narchitectural works, (b) $1.4 billion for mechanical  and\r\n\r\nelectrical works and systems (including the trains),  and\r\n\r\n(c) $0.5 billion for land costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire cost was funded by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB TENDER SELECTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development,  in  this  bad  economic  climate,\r\n\r\nwhether  HDB is willing to review its selection criteria,\r\n\r\nin  particular,  to deviate from its normal  practice  of\r\n\r\nawarding a tender to the contractor with the lowest bid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development whether he will review all contracts\r\n\r\nwhich  HDB  has accepted on the lowest tender  prices  to\r\n\r\nenable  these contractors to complete the jobs for  which\r\n\r\nthey have tendered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's tender system is guided by the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  to  award a tender to the company that gives  the\r\n\r\nbest  value  for  money, and not necessarily  the  lowest\r\n\r\nbidder.   First, contractors are pre-qualified  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir  financial  resources, professional  and  technical\r\n\r\nqualifications and track record, using the  Building  and\r\n\r\nConstruction Authority (BCA)'s Contractors Registry as  a\r\n\r\nguide.  Second, HDB will verify that the tender proposals\r\n\r\nfully  comply with the tender requirements.   The  tender\r\n\r\nproposals  are  then  evaluated  based  on  their   price\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,    conformance    to    the     required\r\n\r\nspecifications, the tenderer's ability to  undertake  the\r\n\r\nproject,  his  financial solvency and his performance  in\r\n\r\nother public sector projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, HDB conducts due diligence on the tenderers\r\n\r\nand  their  tender prices.  If HDB finds that the  lowest\r\n\r\ntender price is significantly below the other tender bids\r\n\r\nand its own estimates, it will interview the tenderer and\r\n\r\nask  him to re-examine his bid.  He can withdraw his  bid\r\n\r\nif he so chooses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, HDB's tender system is sound and\r\n\r\nworking  well.   Since 2000, the number of HDB  contracts\r\n\r\nthat had to be terminated was only 4% of the total number\r\n\r\nof  contracts  awarded.  However, even  with  a  rigorous\r\n\r\nselection  process, there is no guarantee  that  selected\r\n\r\nfirms  will  not meet business difficulties and  flounder\r\n\r\nlater, especially during this economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under HDB's tender system, the company that offers\r\n\r\nthe  best  combination of price, quality and  reliability\r\n\r\nwill  be  awarded the contract.  All things being  equal,\r\n\r\nHDB  will award to the lowest bidder who can do the  job.\r\n\r\nIt  is  objective and fair, and ensures transparency  and\r\n\r\naccountability in the use of public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in view of recent feedback, MND and BCA\r\n\r\nare  presently reviewing the current tender  system,  and\r\n\r\nseeking  views  from  industry  representatives  and  key\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies.   For ongoing  projects,  contracts\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  entered into  between  HDB  and  its\r\n\r\ncontractors  and  these are legally  binding.   HDB  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to monitor its contractors' performance closely.\r\n\r\nIf  any  contractor runs into difficulty, HDB  will  take\r\n\r\nimmediate  action to rectify the situation  and  minimise\r\n\r\nthe impact on the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRACE\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PUBLIC INQUIRY ON UPGRADING OF HDB FLATS AT MARINE TERRACE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  whether  he  will  hold  a  public\r\n\r\ninquiry to enquire why the upgrading of the HDB flats  at\r\n\r\nMarine Terrace could not be completed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading works at Marine Terrace stopped on 3rd\r\n\r\nJune  2003  due  to  the  latest  contractor's  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and cash flow problems.
