Based on Singapore\r\n\r\nTourism   Board's  (STB)  statistics,  from  11th   to   27th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  PRC  tourist arrivals registered an  increase  of\r\n\r\n12.87%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRC is currently the sixth largest visitor-generating\r\n\r\nmarket  for  Singapore.   Last year,  we  received  more  than\r\n\r\n400,000  visitors from the PRC, an increase of 16.5% over  the\r\n\r\nprevious year. Due largely to China's strong internal economy,\r\n\r\nthe  STB targets to achieve 1 million PRC visitor arrivals  to\r\n\r\nSingapore by 2005.  This will place PRC as one of our  largest\r\n\r\ntourism market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to tap this market to the fullest extent\r\n\r\npossible.   This large flow will feed our tourism  sector  and\r\n\r\nprovide  many  jobs for Singaporeans.  STB is working  closely\r\n\r\nwith other Government agencies to make this happen.  These\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninclude increasing airlinks between our two countries and more\r\n\r\nstreamlined  visa  procedures.

In Singapore, we  have  seen\r\n\r\nthe  demutualisation and merger of the securities and futures\r\n\r\nexchanges, a proliferation of electronic business models, and\r\n\r\na  diversity  of  new  products.  Cross-selling  has  blurred\r\n\r\nsectoral  boundaries whilst financial innovation has  blurred\r\n\r\nproduct lines.  Institutions no longer confine themselves  to\r\n\r\ntheir  domestic  markets or their immediate  hinterland,  but\r\n\r\nreach  out to pools of liquidity in other countries as  well.\r\n\r\nThe  liberalisation  of  the capital  markets  and  increased\r\n\r\ncompetition has catalysed these processes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fluid and rapidly-evolving financial landscape\r\n\r\nposes  new  demands on regulators.  It is important  that  we\r\n\r\ncreate  a sound and transparent legal framework within  which\r\n\r\nplayers  can operate.  The framework must balance  prudential\r\n\r\nconcerns  with market development.  Moreover,  it  should  be\r\n\r\nsufficiently   flexible  to  allow,   and   even   facilitate\r\n\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from these developments, there is a need to\r\n\r\nrecast  the existing legal framework in view of the shift  in\r\n\r\nMAS'  regulatory  philosophy  since  the  enactment  of   the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry Act (Chapter 289) (SIA).   The  SIA  was\r\n\r\ndrafted  and  enacted in the wake of the Pan-El crisis.   The\r\n\r\nintention  then was to tighten supervision of the then  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  of Singapore and the securities industry.  However,\r\n\r\nMAS   has,   since  1997,  embraced  a  different  regulatory\r\n\r\nphilosophy.   We  have  moved from a  merit-based  regulation\r\n\r\nwhere the regulator decides what comes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  market  to a disclosure-based regime which  empowers\r\n\r\ninvestors   to  make  informed  decisions.   We   have   also\r\n\r\ninstituted  a fundamental shift in emphasis away  from  \"one-size-fits-all\"  regulation  of institutions  to  risk-focused\r\n\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities and Futures Bill (SF Bill) responds to\r\n\r\nall  these  developments.  It sets out, in a single rulebook,\r\n\r\nthe   legislative  framework  governing  the  securities  and\r\n\r\nfutures industry by consolidating the provisions in the  SIA,\r\n\r\nthe  Futures  Trading Act (FTA) (Chapter  116),  as  well  as\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions  in  the Exchanges  (Demutualisation  and\r\n\r\nMerger) Act (Chapter 99B) and the Companies Act (Chapter 50).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impetus for the SF Bill can be broadly described as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redraft and update legislation to keep abreast of the\r\n\r\nmany  developments  that  have taken  place  in  the  capital\r\n\r\nmarkets since the enactment of the SIA and FTA;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a flexible regulatory framework for\r\n\r\nintermediaries,  to  enhance  competition   and   to   reduce\r\n\r\ncompliance cost;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the regulatory framework for clearing and\r\n\r\nsettlement activities, and to provide an exception to laws of\r\n\r\ninsolvency for clearing and settlement activities to minimise\r\n\r\nany systemic risk to our clearing and settlement system;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a comprehensive rulebook on capital markets activities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the development of a disclosure-based regime;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide an enhanced market enforcement regime, which\r\n\r\nsupports a disclosure-based regime; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To streamline the appeal process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the SF Bill, MAS has conducted a public\r\n\r\nconsultation of an earlier draft of the Bill.  The public has\r\n\r\nbeen  supportive of the policies introduced by the Bill,  and\r\n\r\nhas provided many comments.  MAS has studied and incorporated\r\n\r\nsome of these comments in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the major policy\r\n\r\nreforms in the SF Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Updating  Legislation  to  Cater to Developments  in  Capital Markets</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Recognised  Trading System Providers (Part II);  Redefinition of    \"Markets\"    (First   Schedule)   and    \"Dealing    in Securities/Trading  in  Futures\" (Second  Schedule);   Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction (Section 339)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and advances in telecommunication\r\n\r\ntechnology have led to more cross-border trade, especially in\r\n\r\nthe  electronic realm.  Connectivity to overseas  markets  no\r\n\r\nlonger  requires the manual intervention by broker-dealers  - it  can  instead  be provided by passive Alternative  Trading\r\n\r\nSystems  (ATS).   New  electronic  financial  services   also\r\n\r\ndeconstruct   traditional  value  chains,   allowing   market\r\n\r\nparticipants to offer services along specific segments of the\r\n\r\nvalue  chains,  and  blurring the time-honoured  concepts  of\r\n\r\neither \"operating a market\" or \"acting as an intermediary\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIA and the FTA - the two old Acts - were not\r\n\r\ndrafted  with these new business models in mind.  The arrival\r\n\r\nof  these business models calls for greater clarification  as\r\n\r\nto  how  these businesses would be regulated, ie, whether  as\r\n\r\n\"markets\" or \"intermediaries\".  MAS' policy intent is to only\r\n\r\nregulate  as  markets, facilities which bring  together  many\r\n\r\nbuyers  and many sellers, and allow the posting of sufficient\r\n\r\ninformation  to  result in a transaction taking  place.   The\r\n\r\nredefinitions of markets in the First Schedule of the SF Bill\r\n\r\nwould  provide  clarity on this issue.  We have  refined  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of markets to refer to a place or facility  where\r\n\r\noffers  to  sell, purchase or exchange securities or  futures\r\n\r\ncontract  are  made  \"on  a centralised  basis\".   Places  or\r\n\r\nfacilities  which  are  used by one person  to  provide  such\r\n\r\noffers are excluded from the definition of markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present regulatory framework in the SIA and FTA only\r\n\r\nallows for market operators to operate in Singapore as either\r\n\r\napproved exchanges, or exempt\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Neither is appropriate for the regulation  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  markets  maintained  by  ATS,  for  which   the\r\n\r\nimposition  of  a  full  gamut of  exchange  requirements  is\r\n\r\ninappropriate,  but for which MAS still wishes  to  retain  a\r\n\r\nreasonable extent of regulatory oversight.  The SF Bill  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  new recognition regime for such  markets.   ATS\r\n\r\noperators  who  operate  facilities which  are  predominantly\r\n\r\nproviding market-like services will require authorisation  to\r\n\r\noperate  in Singapore as Recognised Trading System  Providers\r\n\r\n(ReTS  Providers).  This is found in Part II, Division  4  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  The regulatory requirements to be imposed on ReTS\r\n\r\nProviders, to be spelt out in Regulations, would commensurate\r\n\r\nwith  the  nature  and scale of risks posed by  these  market\r\n\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the regulation of cross-border financial\r\n\r\nservices  that target or are made accessible to Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nclause  339  of  the Bill will introduce an extra-territorial\r\n\r\njurisdiction  provision for offences.  This is a codification\r\n\r\nof judicial pronouncements in common law jurisdictions that a\r\n\r\nforeign  act is justiciable in a country if it has an  effect\r\n\r\nin  that  country.   This  is the  practice  in  other  major\r\n\r\nfinancial  centres.  Clause 339 will confer  jurisdiction  on\r\n\r\nacts  outside Singapore that have substantial and  reasonably\r\n\r\nforeseeable effects in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Creating a Flexible Regulatory Framework for Intermediaries, to Enhance Competition and to Reduce Compliance Cost</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Single Licensing Framework for Securities and Futures Market Intermediaries (Part IV)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing licensing framework under the SIA and the\r\n\r\nFTA is characterised by the issuance of multiple licences  to\r\n\r\nmarket  intermediaries according to their business activities\r\n\r\nwithin the securities, futures and asset management industry.\r\n\r\nWith  the  blurring  of  boundaries  between  securities  and\r\n\r\nfutures products, and the breaking down of the value chain in\r\n\r\nthe financial services industry, such multiple licensing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstructure  has increasingly become less flexible  in  meeting\r\n\r\nthe business needs of intermediaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep pace with market developments and to better\r\n\r\naccommodate  changes  in  the  business  models   of   market\r\n\r\nintermediaries, the SF Bill will introduce a  single  modular\r\n\r\nlicensing   framework   for  the   securities   and   futures\r\n\r\nintermediaries,  to  replace the current  multiple  licensing\r\n\r\nregime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the SF Bill will require an intermediary to\r\n\r\nhold  only  a  single  licence, known as  a  Capital  Markets\r\n\r\nServices   licence,   to  conduct  one  or   more   regulated\r\n\r\nactivities.    These   regulated  activities   will   include\r\n\r\nsecurities   dealing,  futures  trading,  leveraged   foreign\r\n\r\nexchange   trading,  advising  on  corporate  finance,   fund\r\n\r\nmanagement,  securities financing and custodial services  for\r\n\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single licensing regime will reduce both capital and\r\n\r\ncompliance   cost,  and  allow  our  intermediaries   to   be\r\n\r\ncompetitive across a broader spectrum of financial services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will provide for licensing exemptions so\r\n\r\nlong  as  these  do not compromise the standard  of  investor\r\n\r\nprotection.   Banks,  merchant banks, finance  companies  and\r\n\r\ninsurance companies are already supervised by MAS under other\r\n\r\nprincipal  legislation.  They will be exempted from licensing\r\n\r\nfor  any regulated securities and futures activities so  long\r\n\r\nas  they  are not prohibited from undertaking such activities\r\n\r\nunder   those   principal  legislation.   This  will   reduce\r\n\r\nregulatory overlap and save on compliance costs.  However, to\r\n\r\nlevel  the playing field, these institutions will be  subject\r\n\r\nto   the   same   business  conduct  rules   and   regulatory\r\n\r\nrequirements, where appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing   the   Regulatory  Framework  for   Clearing   and\r\n\r\nSettlement Activities,  Creating an Exception to Laws of Insolvency  for \r\n\r\nClearing and Settlement Activities to Minimise Systemic Risks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Regulation of Clearing and Settlement Activities (Part III)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will introduce a legal framework for the\r\n\r\nregulation  of  clearing and settlement institutions  in  the\r\n\r\nsecurities  and  futures  markets.   Such  institutions  will\r\n\r\nrequire MAS' approval.  Part III, Division 2 of the Bill will\r\n\r\nintroduce provisions for MAS to approve and regulate clearing\r\n\r\nhouses separately from exchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect a clearing house that operates in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand thereby all the participants that utilise its facilities,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  in Part III, Division 3 also provides an exception\r\n\r\nto  the  laws of insolvency where a participant of a clearing\r\n\r\nhouse defaults on its obligations.  By giving primacy to  the\r\n\r\ndefault  rules  of  the  clearing house  over  the  rules  of\r\n\r\ninsolvency, the SF Bill will ensure that the insolvency of  a\r\n\r\nmember will not disrupt the clearing and settlement of trades\r\n\r\nalready  executed.   Such  giving  of  priority  to  systemic\r\n\r\nstability  is consistent with the practice in other financial\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Providing   a  Comprehensive  Rulebook  on  Capital   Markets\r\n\r\nActivities in Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Migration of Capital Raising Provisions from the Companies\r\n\r\nAct  - Shares and Debentures (Part XIII, Division 1)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill migrates the capital raising provisions in\r\n\r\nthe  Companies  Act  (CA)  into a comprehensive  rulebook  on\r\n\r\ncapital  markets  activities  in  Singapore.   This   is   to\r\n\r\nimplement   a   recommendation  of  the   Corporate   Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Collective Investment Schemes (Part XIII, Division 2)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as recommended by the Corporate Finance Committee,\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  in the CA (the Companies  Act)  relating  to\r\n\r\npublic offers of \"interests other than shares and debentures\"\r\n\r\nare  migrated  to the SF Bill.  The SF Bill has replaced  the\r\n\r\nconcept of \"interests\" under the CA, which governs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunit  trusts,  and  replaced  it  with  that  of  \"collective\r\n\r\ninvestment  schemes\".   The SF Bill requires  all  collective\r\n\r\ninvestment schemes to be approved by MAS before they  can  be\r\n\r\noffered to the public.  MAS is empowered to suspend or revoke\r\n\r\nschemes  detrimental to the public interest even after  their\r\n\r\napproval.   The  SF  Bill provides an additional  option  for\r\n\r\nforeign  funds to be offered directly to the public,  instead\r\n\r\nof only through feeder funds, which entail additional costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill provides for the offer of collective\r\n\r\ninvestment   schemes  to  sophisticated   investors   without\r\n\r\nprospectuses, as is the case for shares and debentures.   The\r\n\r\ncriteria for approval of such schemes are less stringent than\r\n\r\nthat for retail schemes, as sophisticated investors are in  a\r\n\r\nbetter position to fend for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the SF Bill, trustees for collective investment\r\n\r\nschemes will be approved on a one-off basis, instead  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  cumbersome practice of fund-by-fund approvals.   MAS\r\n\r\nwill  be  given the power to inspect such trustees, to  check\r\n\r\nthat  they  perform  their  statutory  duties  properly   and\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interests of investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will also introduce an industry Code setting out\r\n\r\ninvestment   and  operational  requirements  for   collective\r\n\r\ninvestment  schemes.  Examples are the investment  guidelines\r\n\r\nfor  various types of funds, rules governing soft  commission\r\n\r\npractices   and  disclosures,  and  contents  of  semi-annual\r\n\r\nreports to investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Facilitating the Development of a Disclosure-based Regime</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill seeks to create a legal framework that\r\n\r\nfacilitates  the  development of a  disclosure-based  capital\r\n\r\nmarkets  regime  in Singapore.  To this end, several  reforms\r\n\r\nhave been put in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancement in Prospectus Regime (Part XIII, Division 1)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First amongst these are the refinements made to the\r\n\r\nprospectus   regime.  To  deter  inadequate   or   misleading\r\n\r\ndisclosures and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaterial  omissions  from  prospectuses,  issuers  and  their\r\n\r\nadvisers  will  be  subject  to  greater  accountability  for\r\n\r\nprospectus disclosure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedures for registering prospectuses have been\r\n\r\nrefined.  Prospectuses lodged with MAS will be subject  to  a\r\n\r\ntwo-week  holding period, during which MAS will  conduct  the\r\n\r\nnecessary review for compliance with the prospectus law.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, the lodged prospectuses will be put on the MAS\r\n\r\nwebsite  and made accessible to the public.  The  public  can\r\n\r\nscrutinise  and  give comments on the lodged prospectuses  to\r\n\r\nMAS.  MAS may refuse to register a prospectus if it is not in\r\n\r\ncompliance with statutory disclosure requirements or  if  its\r\n\r\nregistration is not in the public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a registered prospectus is later found to be\r\n\r\nmisleading  or deficient, MAS is empowered to  serve  a  stop\r\n\r\norder  to prevent the issuance or sale of securities  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will provide for the return of monies to\r\n\r\ninvestors who have bought or subscribed for securities, after\r\n\r\na  stop  order  has been served or the issuer  has  lodged  a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  or  replacement document.  This  is  also  the\r\n\r\npractice in Australia.  These legal remedies are necessary to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  investing  public in the  few  instances  where\r\n\r\nserious breaches of the law occur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance regulatory transparency, the SF Bill will\r\n\r\nclarify that preliminary prospectuses, used for book-building\r\n\r\nto  ascertain the level of market interest in securities, can\r\n\r\nbe   distributed  only  to  sophisticated  and  institutional\r\n\r\ninvestors.   In addition, the SF Bill will allow issuers  and\r\n\r\ntheir   advisers   to  conduct  roadshow   presentations   to\r\n\r\nsophisticated and institutional investors before  registering\r\n\r\na prospectus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Continuing   Disclosure  Requirements  by  Listed   Companies\r\n\r\n(Clause 203)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will give legal teeth to the continuous\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of  material information by listed  corporations.\r\n\r\nPresently,   listed  corporations  are   required   to   make\r\n\r\ndisclosure of material information, on a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinuous  basis,  under  the Singapore  Exchange's  Listing\r\n\r\nManual.    Clause  203 of the Bill will make this  continuous\r\n\r\ndisclosure requirement a statutory one.  Failure by companies\r\n\r\nto  make  disclosure of material information could render  it\r\n\r\nliable  to the payment of civil fines or criminal prosecution\r\n\r\n(where the failure is intentional or reckless).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Notification of Substantial Shareholding in Listed  Companies\r\n\r\n(Clause 137)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with international practice, clause 137 of the\r\n\r\nSF  Bill will require persons to disclose their shareholdings\r\n\r\nto  the securities exchange within two days of their becoming\r\n\r\nsubstantial  shareholders of listed companies and  subsequent\r\n\r\nchanges  in  their shareholdings.  This will improve  on  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  two-stage  process  where  substantial  shareholders\r\n\r\ndisclose their ownership interests to the listed company  (as\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Companies Act), which in turn  relays  the\r\n\r\ninformation  to  the Singapore Exchange, as required  by  the\r\n\r\nExchange's rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Takeovers (Part VIII)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Companies Act governing company\r\n\r\ntake-overs  and  mergers are migrated  to  the  SF  Bill  and\r\n\r\nrationalised.   Part  VIII of the Bill will  empower  MAS  to\r\n\r\npromulgate,   and   the   Securities  Industry   Council   to\r\n\r\nadminister, the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers. The\r\n\r\nSF Bill also makes false or reckless take-over announcements,\r\n\r\ncriminal offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing Market Enforcement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disclosure-based regime demands an effective market\r\n\r\nenforcement  regime.  Any transgressions must be swiftly  and\r\n\r\nfirmly  dealt with, in order to preserve investor  confidence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore's  capital  markets.   The  SF  Bill  therefore\r\n\r\nintroduces provisions that enhance market enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of Insider Trading Provisions (Part XII Div 3)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill redefines the laws on insider trading. The\r\n\r\npresent  provisions  are based on the defendant's  connection\r\n\r\nwith the company and make only the insider and the tippee  (a\r\n\r\nperson acting in concert with the insider) liable for insider\r\n\r\ntrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove a case against tippees, the Prosecution has to,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  show that the tippee has received information  from\r\n\r\nan  insider.  Secondly, it has to show that the tippee had an\r\n\r\narrangement  or association with the insider.   Thirdly,  the\r\n\r\ntippee  must  be aware that the insider himself is  precluded\r\n\r\nfrom  dealing.  The balance is tilted too much in  favour  of\r\n\r\ntippees to the detriment of other market participants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is difficulty in extending liability\r\n\r\nto  others who are further down the information chain.  Where\r\n\r\nthe  tippee  himself  does not trade but communicates  price-sensitive   information  to  another  person  (the  secondary\r\n\r\ntippee),  who then trades in securities, it may be  difficult\r\n\r\nto prove any \"arrangement\" or \"association\" with the insider.\r\n\r\nThis  is  unsatisfactory, as the secondary tippee  (or  other\r\n\r\npersons further down the information chain) would have traded\r\n\r\nwith an unfair information advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who receives inside information from sources\r\n\r\nother  than a connected person is also not caught  under  the\r\n\r\npresent  approach, which requires the tracing of  information\r\n\r\nback to the connected person.  This needs to be remedied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core, the mischief of insider trading lies in\r\n\r\ntilting  the  playing  field unfairly  against  other  market\r\n\r\nparticipants.   Those who knowingly have  inside  information\r\n\r\nshould  be prohibited from trading, whether or not  they  are\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the company.  The intent is to  address  the\r\n\r\ncore  evil  of  trading  while in possession  of  undisclosed\r\n\r\nmarket  sensitive  information, instead of  having  liability\r\n\r\ndepend on a person's connection with the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new insider trading provisions in Part XII, Division\r\n\r\n3  of  the  SF Bill will no longer depend on the proof  of  a\r\n\r\nperson's connection with the company.   The test will instead\r\n\r\nshift  to  the  core  of the offence, ie,  trading  while  in\r\n\r\npossession of undisclosed price-sensitive information by  the\r\n\r\ndefendant.  The new provisions will also tighten the mens rea\r\n\r\n(or  mental intent) test for directors and connected persons.\r\n\r\nClause 218(4) creates a rebuttable presumption that connected\r\n\r\npersons with possession of inside information, are deemed  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  information  is undisclosed  and  is  price-sensitive.  This will introduce greater discipline for  those\r\n\r\nin fiduciary positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present section 103 of the Securities Industry Act\r\n\r\n(SIA) is silent on any mental intent or mens rea requirement.\r\n\r\nThe  High Court in Public Prosecutor v. Ng Chee Kheong & Tang\r\n\r\nSiu  Shing (in June 1999) imposed a 3-tier mens rea test  for\r\n\r\ninsider  trading, requiring the Prosecution to show that  the\r\n\r\nAccused:   firstly,  knew  that the  information  was  price-sensitive;   secondly,   knew  that   the   information   was\r\n\r\nundisclosed; and thirdly, intended to use the information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When section 103 of the SIA was introduced in 1986, it\r\n\r\nwas  meant to remedy the shortcomings of section 158  of  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  [Reprint of the Companies Act  (Chapter  50),\r\n\r\n<br><br>1985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised Edition].   Dr Richard Hu, in the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Securities Industry Bill 1986, stated that this  was\r\n\r\nthe  mischief  that  section 103 of  the  SIA  was  meant  to\r\n\r\naddress, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Part IX of the Bill contains revised provisions dealing\r\n\r\nwith  trading in securities.  The significant feature of this\r\n\r\nPart  is  the  new  provision for dealing  in  securities  by\r\n\r\ninsiders,   ie,   persons  with  access  to   price-sensitive\r\n\r\ninformation.  A notable difference under the new provision is\r\n\r\nthat  an  offence is committed whether or not the dealing  is\r\n\r\nundertaken with the intention of using information to gain an\r\n\r\nadvantage; the purpose of dealing is irrelevant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision in Public Prosecution v Ng Chee Kheong, by\r\n\r\nintroducing the \"intent to use\" test, effectively brings  our\r\n\r\ninsider  trading laws to the position in the repealed section\r\n\r\n158 of the Companies Act.  This interpretation of section 103\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Securities Industry Act negates the very intent  it  was\r\n\r\nmeant to remedy.  The requirement of proof of \"intent to use\"\r\n\r\ninformation  by  the  Prosecution makes it  too  onerous  and\r\n\r\nreduces the effectiveness of our insider trading laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 220 of the Securities and Futures Bill therefore\r\n\r\nmakes  it clear that it is not necessary to prove any  intent\r\n\r\nto use inside information by the defendant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insider trading provisions will also be extended to\r\n\r\ncover  futures  and  options contracts on  stocks  and  stock\r\n\r\nindices which are extensions of the underlying product.  This\r\n\r\napproach is consistent with international best practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension  of  Civil Fines/Civil Remedies to Other  Forms  of\r\n\r\nMarket Misconduct (Part XII Div 4)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will extend the civil fine/civil remedy\r\n\r\nregime  (presently  available only for  insider  trading)  to\r\n\r\nother  forms of market misconduct found in Part  XII   -  eg,\r\n\r\nmarket rigging, market manipulation, the publishing of  false\r\n\r\nor  misleading information, and the employment of  fraud  and\r\n\r\ndeceit  in  dealing.  The advantage of a civil remedy  regime\r\n\r\nlies  in  its  lower burden of proof.  The extension  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  remedy  regime to all forms of market misconduct  will\r\n\r\ncomplement  the  present framework of criminal  offences  for\r\n\r\nsuch misconduct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will be empowered to bring an action in court\r\n\r\nagainst  a defendant for a civil penalty.  The offender  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  liable  for civil damages to investors  who  suffer\r\n\r\nlosses as a result of the contravening act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforcement Powers for MAS Officers (Part IX Div 3)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill provides enhanced investigative powers for\r\n\r\nMAS  officers to enforce the civil penalty regime for  market\r\n\r\nmisconduct.   MAS  will  be  given  powers  to   compel   the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  relevant documents and  records,  to  conduct\r\n\r\nsearch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  seizure  with  a warrant from the court  and  to  record\r\n\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fines for Offences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for non-compliance with provisions of the\r\n\r\nSIA  and  FTA  have  remained largely unchanged  since  their\r\n\r\nenactment   -  except  for  penalties  relating   to   market\r\n\r\nmisconduct offences, which were increased in March 2000 by  a\r\n\r\nfactor  of  five.  There is a need to revise  the  fines  for\r\n\r\nother  offences  under  the SF Bill in  order  to  provide  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will therefore update and align the\r\n\r\npenalties  for  offences.   It will introduce  penalties  for\r\n\r\ncontinuing  offences, where appropriate.  The fines  in  most\r\n\r\ncases  (except  for Part XII offences) will be  raised  by  a\r\n\r\nfactor  of five while those for continuing offences  will  be\r\n\r\n10%  of that for the main offences.   Clause 333 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces higher fines for corporations - a maximum of twice\r\n\r\nthe amount imposed for individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction Clause for Market Misconduct</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than clause 339, clauses 196, 205 and 213 of Part\r\n\r\nXII (Market Misconduct) will specifically confer jurisdiction\r\n\r\nover  conduct  within Singapore in relation to securities  or\r\n\r\nfutures  contracts  listed and traded overseas;  and  conduct\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore  in  relation  to  securities  or  futures\r\n\r\ncontracts listed or traded in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first limb will deter perpetrators of market\r\n\r\nmisconduct  from  using  Singapore as  a  \"haven\"  for  their\r\n\r\nillegal  activities.  The second aspect will  confer  on  our\r\n\r\ncourts extra-territorial jurisdiction over foreign acts  that\r\n\r\naffect   the   integrity   of  Singapore's   markets.     The\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  these  provisions  will  be  facilitated  by\r\n\r\nvarious regulatory Memoranda of Understanding entered between\r\n\r\nMAS and foreign regulators.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Streamlining Appeal Processes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationalization of Appeal Processes (Part XIV)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, streamlining of appeal processes. There are some\r\n\r\ninconsistencies,  under the SIA and FTA,  in  the  provisions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  appeals (by licensees, exchanges  or  aggrieved\r\n\r\npersons)  against decisions made by MAS.  Under  the  present\r\n\r\nSIA  and  FTA,  most  appeals  are  heard  by  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in the revocation of a dealer's licence  under  the\r\n\r\nSIA, an appeal to the High Court is allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill streamlines the appeal processes by having\r\n\r\nthe  appeals heard by the Minister.  The SF Bill  creates  an\r\n\r\nindependent     advisory    panel,    comprising     industry\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and lawyers, to advise the  Minister.   This\r\n\r\nnew   approach  allows  MAS  to  tap  on  the  expertise   of\r\n\r\npractitioners  to  evaluate  MAS' decisions  objectively  and\r\n\r\nimpartially, before presenting their recommendations  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI wish to speak in support of this Bill.  The introduction of\r\n\r\nthe   Securities  and  Futures  Bill  serves  to  update  the\r\n\r\nlegislation  to keep in pace with the changes and advancement\r\n\r\nin  the  capital  markets.  It sets out  the  new  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework  for the securities and futures market and  put  it\r\n\r\nall into a single piece of legislation under the SF Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a few comments on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, areas of conflict in SGX as a securities industry\r\n\r\nregulator.   As  I  see it, one of the essential  operational\r\n\r\ndifferences  with  the  SF  Bill is that  several  regulatory\r\n\r\nfunctions of SGX are removed and put under MAS.  I feel  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  correct move in the right direction.  Currently,\r\n\r\nSGX  itself is listed on the Singapore mainboard.  There  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  instances of conflict of interest when SGX  has  to\r\n\r\nfunction as both the regulator as well as the player  in  the\r\n\r\nsecurities industry.  However, I note that, with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanges,  SGX  will  still retain some regulatory  functions,\r\n\r\nespecially  on listing functions.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister what is the rationale for doing so, and\r\n\r\nhow  are the regulatory functions divided between MAS and SGX\r\n\r\nunder  this  new  SF  Bill, such that it  will  minimise  the\r\n\r\navenues of conflict of interest on the part of SGX.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, effectiveness of the extra-territorial\r\n\r\njurisdiction.  Clause 339 of the SF Bill confers the power of\r\n\r\nextra-territorial jurisdiction on acts of having  substantial\r\n\r\nor  reasonably  foreseeable effects in  Singapore.   Here,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister how  we  can  be\r\n\r\neffective in policing and curbing undesirable securities  and\r\n\r\nfutures    trading   activities   that   occur   in   foreign\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  For example, if a foreign syndicate tries  to\r\n\r\nplay and corner certain local stocks from overseas, how do we\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  penalise them?  Similarly, if  a  foreign-based\r\n\r\nInternet company offers securities advisory services  without\r\n\r\nan  approved licence to Singapore residents, how do we ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  giving competent advice and  complying  with\r\n\r\nSingapore's listing, take-over and other securities rules and\r\n\r\ncode?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enhanced rules on insider trading, Part XII, Div 3 of\r\n\r\nthe  SF  Bill  deals with a new change in  the  treatment  of\r\n\r\ninsider  trading rules.  As I understand it, it  has  shifted\r\n\r\nfrom  person-connected  to  information-connected  rule.   In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I am in agreement with this change, as  it  gives\r\n\r\ngreater clarity and intent on insider trading.  However, I am\r\n\r\nunclear  on  the actual implementation of this change.   Will\r\n\r\nthe  \"person-connected\" approach be withdrawn such that  only\r\n\r\n\"information-connected\" rule will apply?  For example, during\r\n\r\nthe  restricted  buying period when a company  was  about  to\r\n\r\nannounce   its   financial  results,  for  \"person-connected\"\r\n\r\nparties  or persons who have no access or have no information\r\n\r\nof the company's results, could they then trade in the shares\r\n\r\nof  the company during the restricted buying period?  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to explain further  on\r\n\r\nhow this new ruling operates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my appreciation to\r\n\r\nMAS for being responsive to market changes by introducing  so\r\n\r\nspeedily  this  new  legislation  to  regulate  the   capital\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, many important developments have taken\r\n\r\nplace in all the major financial centres of the world, and we\r\n\r\nmust  keep  pace  by supporting progressive  changes  in  our\r\n\r\ncapital  markets  and the financial industry  with  laws  and\r\n\r\nregulations that are up-to-date and relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consolidation of several of the existing\r\n\r\nlegislation  into the Securities and Futures Act  (SFA),  the\r\n\r\nregulatory  roles  will, henceforth, be concentrated  on  and\r\n\r\nundertaken by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.   Until  a\r\n\r\nfew  years ago, I must say the MAS is a key institution  that\r\n\r\nis  little  known  to the public.  Even  today,  the  MAS  is\r\n\r\nregarded  with much respect and a fair amount of awe  by  the\r\n\r\nindustry.   It  has  a solid reputation  as  a  credible  and\r\n\r\ncompetent  financial  regulator.   It  acts  decisively   and\r\n\r\ncarries a heavy punch, as witnessed by some people who  dared\r\n\r\nto  speculate against the Singapore dollar and those who were\r\n\r\nadventurous  in trying to circumvent the rules  on  mandatory\r\n\r\ntakeovers.  But, much has been done over the last  few  years\r\n\r\nto  soften  that image by being more consultative,  open  and\r\n\r\nreceptive.   I  know  a  few  market  participants  who  were\r\n\r\npleasantly surprised to receive invitations to just  drop  by\r\n\r\nthe MAS anytime to talk about their future plans and on-going\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   In  this respect, I would  like  to  ask  DPM\r\n\r\nwhether  a Securities and Futures Commission will be  set  up\r\n\r\nwithin the MAS to undertake its new function under the SFA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fast-changing world, to maintain our position as\r\n\r\na premier financial centre, we must adopt fresh approaches to\r\n\r\nregulate and develop our financial sector.  The SF Bill  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  comprehensive attempt to update our laws  relating  to\r\n\r\nsecurities and futures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the provisions of the SF Bill, this\r\n\r\nconsolidation and centralisation of functions should lead  to\r\n\r\na  speedier  and  more  certain timeframe  for  capital  fund\r\n\r\nraising.  Clear time limits for registration of prospectuses,\r\n\r\nafter  they  are lodged, are set out in the Bill.  Situations\r\n\r\nunder  which the Authority will refuse registration are  also\r\n\r\nspelt out.  This is intended to provide much needed certainty\r\n\r\nin  terms of when an issue can be launched, which is critical\r\n\r\nin  fast-moving  capital markets, to capture  the  window  of\r\n\r\nopportunity.   This will be of great help to corporations  as\r\n\r\nthey  will now have a better idea of when the funds will come\r\n\r\nin for their business expansion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this outcome will be achieved in practice and its\r\n\r\nbenefits  realised.  My fear, that it may not turn  out  this\r\n\r\nway,  stems from a number of factors.  Prior to the SF  Bill,\r\n\r\nprospectuses  were  scrutinised by  the  SGX.   Comments  and\r\n\r\nqueries  for clarification might have resulted in  delays  at\r\n\r\ntimes.  But, ultimately, the issuer can proceed to issue  the\r\n\r\nprospectus  once  the  SGX is satisfied  that  the  investing\r\n\r\npublic is sufficiently protected.  If any of its contents  is\r\n\r\nsubsequently found to be misleading or untrue, the issuer can\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to  task in a court of law or by  the  regulators.\r\n\r\nBut,  now, the prospectuses will be open for public  scrutiny\r\n\r\nand   criticism.    Is  our  investing  public   sufficiently\r\n\r\nsophisticated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public and, probably, competitors who are\r\n\r\nout  to  cause  trouble, can ask for unnecessary  information\r\n\r\nunder  the guise that this additional information is required\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  make an informed assessment  of  the  matters.\r\n\r\nDisclosure  of  certain  information,  such  as  confidential\r\n\r\ndetails  about  margins and pricing, although  nice  for  the\r\n\r\ninvesting public to know, may, in fact, be detrimental to the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  the  company.  And  the  people  who  are  most\r\n\r\ninterested to know are usually the competitors.  In  addition\r\n\r\nto  that, imagine poison-pen letters coming in to the MAS one\r\n\r\nafter another from business rivals or personal rivals.   This\r\n\r\nmay lead to even more delays before the prospectus is finally\r\n\r\nallowed to be registered, and can even derail the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentire  exercise.   I hope the MAS will be firm  in  deciding\r\n\r\nwhat is and what is not reasonable request for clarification,\r\n\r\nand will dedicate adequate trained and competent resources to\r\n\r\ncarry out the intent of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM whether such a comprehensive\r\n\r\nrevamp of the legal framework is overwhelming, especially  at\r\n\r\nthis  present  time  when  it is  already  so  difficult  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  raise  funds from  the  market.   Are  we  too\r\n\r\nambitious  in  trying to do too much now under  this  present\r\n\r\neconomic  environment?  Valuations and pricing of new  issues\r\n\r\nhave  come down drastically.  Onerous responsibility  imposed\r\n\r\non  merchant bankers, lawyers, accountants, valuers and other\r\n\r\nprofessionals involved in the corporate fund raising exercise\r\n\r\nhas  led to a substantial increase in fees.  For a small  and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprise (SME) to raise $3-4 million, the  expenses\r\n\r\ninvolved  can  be in excess of $1 million.  My fear  is  that\r\n\r\nSMEs  can no longer afford to raise funds here and will  have\r\n\r\nno choice but to turn to other regional markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that I hope we get to reap the\r\n\r\nbenefits   of  this  revamp  that  is  intended  to  increase\r\n\r\ntransparency and improve the quality of the issues.  But have\r\n\r\nthese efforts produced rewards?  To a listed company and  its\r\n\r\nshareholders,  the cost of a new listing and continuing  that\r\n\r\nlisting has gone up, but they are still waiting to enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  in  terms  of  better  valuations,  higher  trading\r\n\r\nvolume,   closer  analyst  coverage  and  more  sophisticated\r\n\r\ninvestors.   Perhaps,  the lethargy is  due  to  the  present\r\n\r\nmarket  conditions.  Perhaps, the lack of interest is due  to\r\n\r\ninadequate investor relations by the listed company.  But, it\r\n\r\nis  certainly  hoped  that  the revamp  will  not  merely  be\r\n\r\nsomething  that looks good for the record, but will translate\r\n\r\ninto  real  and tangible benefits, whether now  or  when  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation improves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to certain provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Bill which relate to \"Market Conduct\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill provides three types of punishment for the\r\n\r\nperson  who  has  acted  in  contravention  of  any  of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of Part XII of the Bill which relates to  \"Market\r\n\r\nConduct\".   Offences included in this Part range  from  false\r\n\r\ntrading,  market rigging, disseminating false  or  misleading\r\n\r\ninformation,  bucketing to insider trading.  The contravening\r\n\r\nperson  faces civil penalty under clause 232, civil liability\r\n\r\nunder clause 234 and, of course, criminal penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that individual investors who have\r\n\r\nsuffered loss in respect of a contravention need not commence\r\n\r\nan  action,  either individually or as a  class,  to  try  to\r\n\r\nrecover  their  loss,  but can rely on  the  outcome  of  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  commenced by the Authority.  The relevant  court\r\n\r\nmay,  after  the conviction or the imposition  of  the  civil\r\n\r\npenalty, invite all claimants to file and prove their  claims\r\n\r\nfor compensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM: what if the Authority\r\n\r\ndecides  to  settle the contravention with  the  contravening\r\n\r\nperson?   Clause 232(5) provides that nothing in  clause  232\r\n\r\nshall  prevent the Authority from entering into an  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  any  person  to  pay,  with  or  without  admission  of\r\n\r\nliability, a civil penalty.  And, clause 236(1) implies  that\r\n\r\nif  a  consent  order  is made by the Authority  against  the\r\n\r\ncontravening   person,   with   or   without   admission   of\r\n\r\ncontravention, the court will not be involved and, therefore,\r\n\r\nother  aggrieved persons will not be invited  to  file  their\r\n\r\nclaims.   Under the settlement agreement with the  Authority,\r\n\r\nthe  civil  penalty, if any, imposed by clause  232  will  be\r\n\r\npayable  to  the  Authority.  How about  the  losses  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual   claimants?    Would  they   have   to   commence\r\n\r\nproceedings separately against the offender?  This may not be\r\n\r\neasy,  as  they  will be disadvantaged by the  difficulty  of\r\n\r\ngathering evidence and by the lack of resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM, whether in the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  investing public, we should set out the types  of  cases\r\n\r\nwhich the Authority should not settle bilaterally but should,\r\n\r\nif  there is sufficient evidence, bring the proceedings  into\r\n\r\nopen court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  guidelines  on  whether  the  case  can  be  settled  by\r\n\r\nagreement need not be based on the type of offence, but could\r\n\r\nbe  based on criteria, such as the number of people aggrieved\r\n\r\nor the amount involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in the event the Authority enters into an\r\n\r\nagreement for civil penalty to be paid, it should disclose to\r\n\r\na  bona  fide  claimant  the grounds for  its  decision,  the\r\n\r\nresults of its investigation and the evidence collated, so as\r\n\r\nto  assist  the  potential claimant in  deciding  whether  to\r\n\r\npursue the case separately against the contravening person.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support  of the Bill, as the new legislation  is  a\r\n\r\nfitting  enabling  legal  framework for  all  the  structural\r\n\r\nreforms and initiatives that the Government has undertaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort to consolidate the provisions in the various\r\n\r\npieces  of legislation is commendable and will go a long  way\r\n\r\ntowards  facilitating  further  development  of  our  capital\r\n\r\nmarkets.    As   a  consequence  of  the  amalgamation,   the\r\n\r\nprovisions cover a wide range of issues.  I shall, therefore,\r\n\r\nlimit my comments and questions to the following three areas,\r\n\r\nie,  the  specific  issues of developing  a  disclosure-based\r\n\r\nregime and market misconduct, and the general issue of public\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, developing a disclosure-based regime. The\r\n\r\nshift  from a prescriptive to a disclosure-based approach  is\r\n\r\ntimely.   It  is consistent with the increasing  emphasis  on\r\n\r\ntransparency and information disclosure.  Essentially, market\r\n\r\nparticipants should no longer rely solely on prospectuses  or\r\n\r\noffers  that have made the grade, ie, endorsed by  the  stock\r\n\r\nexchange, to make their investment decisions.  Instead,  they\r\n\r\nshould  now  carefully examine the substance of  the  offers.\r\n\r\nWhilst this may be a departure from the previous mindset that\r\n\r\nan   approved   public  offer  equals   a   good   investment\r\n\r\nopportunity,   it   will   cause   investors   to   be   more\r\n\r\ndiscriminating and savvy over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several provisions deal with enhancing market\r\n\r\naccountability   and  raising  the  standard   of   corporate\r\n\r\ndisclosure.  For example, draft prospectuses would be allowed\r\n\r\nexposure prior to a proposed offer although they may  not  be\r\n\r\nregistered  finally.  Therefore, investors,  especially  non-institutional investors, need to comprehend the  implications\r\n\r\nof  the  posting of such drafts.  My colleague, Mr  Ong  Kian\r\n\r\nMin,  has  already  elaborated on  the  preparedness  of  the\r\n\r\ninvesting public at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the SF Bill seeks to give legal teeth\r\n\r\nto  the  disclosure-based  regime by  making  the  continuous\r\n\r\ndisclosure  requirement  a  statutory  one.   Sir,  at   this\r\n\r\njuncture,  I  would  like  to  raise  the  notion  of   \"fair\r\n\r\ndisclosure\"  even though it is not specifically mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  to\r\n\r\ncomment on the Authority's stand on the extent to which  fair\r\n\r\ndisclosure would be a feature of this statutory requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me elaborate. I would like to know how listed\r\n\r\ncompanies  would  be  deemed  to  have  complied  with   this\r\n\r\nstatutory  requirement.  Would a filing  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange, for example through MASNET, be sufficient?  If  so,\r\n\r\nthe extent of dissemination to investors must be relevant  in\r\n\r\norder for the primary objective to be met, hence my reference\r\n\r\nto the notion of fair disclosure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the US, compliance with the spirit of Regulation\r\n\r\nFair  Disclosure takes the form of more press releases,  more\r\n\r\nForm 8K filings and more webcasts of earning calls.  This  is\r\n\r\naccompanied  by greater discomfort for listed companies  when\r\n\r\ndealing  with analysts and professional investors and  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore  care, if not paranoia, in providing earnings  guidance,\r\n\r\nif at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fair disclosure is a noble goal as it seeks to\r\n\r\nlevel  the playing field for all investors, small retail  and\r\n\r\nlarge institutions alike.  However, in deciding on how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompliance will be assessed, I seek the DPM's assurance  that\r\n\r\nlisted companies in Singapore would not find this onerous and\r\n\r\nbe  reduced to saying the very minimum, leading to an  \"equal\r\n\r\nmisery\" scenario for all investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, market misconduct and insider trading. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   shift   from   focusing  on  a  \"person-connected\"   to\r\n\r\n\"information-connected\" definition is significant  and  takes\r\n\r\ncognisance  of  the reality that price-sensitive  information\r\n\r\nper  se  drives  trading,  without  necessarily  involving  a\r\n\r\nconnection with the company.  This enlargement of the net  is\r\n\r\njustifiable, but it also imposes greater discipline on  those\r\n\r\nin  fiduciary  positions.  Ultimately, without  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprove any intent, a balance has to be struck so that it would\r\n\r\nnot  be  too  onerous for operators, especially non-executive\r\n\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related note, the power to be vested in the MAS to\r\n\r\nbring  an  action  in  court against perpetrators  of  market\r\n\r\nmisconduct,  such  as  rigging  and  manipulation,  is   much\r\n\r\nwelcome,  especially by the retail investors.  Once again,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to urge the DPM to strike a balance when executing\r\n\r\nthis    power,    especially   in   terms   of    undertaking\r\n\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, public education. Many of these provisions\r\n\r\nwill  pave  the  way for further development of  our  capital\r\n\r\nmarkets.   However, I would like to urge the  DPM  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat sufficient resources are devoted to public education  so\r\n\r\nthat  the desired end-states are achieved.  For example, many\r\n\r\nmight  mistakenly  think that draft prospectuses  are  actual\r\n\r\noffers  or that participating in a friendly scheme to make  a\r\n\r\nkilling out of an illiquid stock is being astute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many changes arising from the reforms over the past few\r\n\r\nyears  have  made visible improvements to the  operation  and\r\n\r\nintegrity of our capital markets.  I would like to  seek  the\r\n\r\nassurance of the DPM that market participants, especially the\r\n\r\nretail, individual investors, would be brought up to speed as\r\n\r\nbest as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I\r\n\r\nspeak  in support of the Bill, I wish to state at the  outset\r\n\r\nthat,  as a solicitor, I may have an interest in the  subject\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House is a bold attempt by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in reforming our legislative framework  to  bring\r\n\r\nour capital market in line with the best practices of capital\r\n\r\nmarkets  elsewhere.   This reform is,  indeed,  part  of  our\r\n\r\nenduring  effort to make Singapore the financial hub  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill is in part a consolidation of the various\r\n\r\npieces   of   legislation,  it  has  nonetheless  taken   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  introduce new changes and  policies.   These\r\n\r\nchanges take into account, amongst other things, advances  in\r\n\r\ntechnologies  that  allow for new and innovative  methods  of\r\n\r\ntrading,   convergence   in  the   financial   products   and\r\n\r\ninstruments   and  the  way  in  which  these  products   and\r\n\r\ninstruments are sold or delivered by intermediaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in itself is massive, running into 344 clauses,\r\n\r\nmany  of which are rather important in the way in which  they\r\n\r\nunderpin the capital market.  One regret, Sir, is that  there\r\n\r\nis  not  enough time between the last sitting and the present\r\n\r\nsitting  for  us  to  digest and analyse  the  Bill  and  its\r\n\r\nimplications.   I  hope that there would be  other  occasions\r\n\r\nwhere,  with the fullness of time, we will be able to  digest\r\n\r\nand debate this Bill in a more comprehensive manner.  Be that\r\n\r\nas it may, a number of comments and queries came to mind as I\r\n\r\nwent through the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the issue of overseas trading systems and\r\n\r\nexchanges  which  are  targeted at  Singaporeans.   With  the\r\n\r\nadvent  of  the  Internet, what has become  obvious  is  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  now  have alternative trading  systems.   These\r\n\r\nservices  can  provide  trading platforms  that  do  not  fit\r\n\r\ntraditional descriptions of market trading and dealing.  What\r\n\r\nis  critical is that these alternative trading systems can be\r\n\r\ncross-border   in   nature.    The   MAS   recognises    that\r\n\r\nincreasingly, Singaporeans are beginning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  trade on overseas exchanges and, as a consequence,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  need  to bring this new development into the  fold  of\r\n\r\nregulation.   Apart from either approving these exchanges  in\r\n\r\nwhich case, these exchanges would come under the entire gamut\r\n\r\nof  laws in Singapore, or exempting these exchanges from  the\r\n\r\napplication of relevant legislation here, the Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  extra-territorial reach in our  legislation  in\r\n\r\norder  to regulate these exchanges that do not operate within\r\n\r\nour  jurisdiction.  In this regard, the Bill deals  with  the\r\n\r\nsituation  by providing that if the act was partly  committed\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and partly committed outside Singapore,  or  if\r\n\r\nthat act, committed outside Singapore, has a substantial  and\r\n\r\nreasonably foreseeable effect in Singapore, and if  that  act\r\n\r\nis  an  offence if it is committed in Singapore, that  person\r\n\r\nwho committed the act would be guilty of an offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I appreciate the policy intent behind the\r\n\r\nextra-territorial  reach of the Bill, I would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nclause  in its present form is weak.  First, the Bill is  not\r\n\r\nclear  as  to  the extent, whether partial or  otherwise,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  it  must be committed in Singapore, or the  extent  to\r\n\r\nwhich  it  must  go  before it has a  substantial  effect  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  suppose this should be left  to  the  courts,\r\n\r\nalthough  I think it would help if legislation could  provide\r\n\r\nsome guidance here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill is not clear as to who the person\r\n\r\nshould  be.  For instance, what happens if that person  is  a\r\n\r\ncompany incorporated say, in Vanuatu.  In all probability, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  a company that would be set up by the operator  if\r\n\r\nthey are intent on breaking the law here.  The question which\r\n\r\nI  have  is:  does the law seek to catch the company  or  the\r\n\r\nagents operating behind the veil of these companies, and  how\r\n\r\nwould you enforce our laws against these people?  This is the\r\n\r\nsame point raised by my colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose, Sir, the way forward is to strengthen our\r\n\r\ninternational network by getting the cooperation of  as  many\r\n\r\ncountries  as  possible in our bid to regulate  these  cross-border activities.  The truth of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  matter  is that the veil of protection that we  seek  to\r\n\r\ngive  ourselves through legislation is bound to be  punctured\r\n\r\nwith  holes  as  foreign operators can  operate  almost  with\r\n\r\nimpunity, notwithstanding provisions in our legislation  that\r\n\r\nsay  otherwise.  Unless we get the cooperation of  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  I doubt very much if the cross-border  provisions\r\n\r\nin the Bill are going to work effectively.  In this regard, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether  we  are\r\n\r\nnegotiating  with other countries and, if so,  how  many,  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  these issues, and whether we ought to promote  an\r\n\r\ninternational legal framework to regulate these activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of a single licensing framework for\r\n\r\nsecurities   and  market  intermediaries.   As  proposed,   a\r\n\r\nsingular  modular framework allows for a range  of  regulated\r\n\r\nactivities that are better differentiated to accommodate  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  needs  of the intermediaries.  Accordingly,  market\r\n\r\nintermediaries  would  only  be required  to  hold  a  single\r\n\r\nmodular licence instead of multiple licences to engage in the\r\n\r\nactivities  listed in the Second Schedule.  These  activities\r\n\r\nset out in the Second Schedule include, for instance, dealing\r\n\r\nwith  securities, providing custodial services to securities,\r\n\r\nengaging  in  the business of advising on corporate  finance,\r\n\r\nand  so on and so forth.  What this actually means is that  a\r\n\r\nperson holding a capital market licence can engage in any  of\r\n\r\nthese activities provided he is suitably qualified.  For  the\r\n\r\nintermediaries  and professionals engaged in  capital  market\r\n\r\nservices, this is indeed good news as they no longer have  to\r\n\r\nchase up different legislation to get the necessary permits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern here, Sir, is one of detail. I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the application process\r\n\r\nfor  the licence could be made easier for the boutique  firms\r\n\r\nor  individuals who intend to provide e-services but who  are\r\n\r\nnot   in   the  same  league  as  the  banks  and   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  I say this, Sir, because of late,  we  see  in\r\n\r\nthe  industry,  a fair number of ex-bankers or  employees  of\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions providing services,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the area of corporate  finance.   No  doubt\r\n\r\nthese  consultants and professionals would  now  have  to  be\r\n\r\nregulated under this Bill, I hope that the conditions  to  be\r\n\r\nset  up  by  the  Authority would not be  so  onerous  as  to\r\n\r\neffectively  prevent them from undertaking this task.   These\r\n\r\nconsultants  perform  a  very useful  function  by  providing\r\n\r\nadvice  and services to the SMEs and to clients who  may  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  wherewithal  to engage the  services  of  merchant\r\n\r\nbankers or other financial institutions.  It would be helpful\r\n\r\nif  the  Minister could further elaborate on this  issue  and\r\n\r\nperhaps provide some assurance to the smaller players in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, providing a comprehensive rule book of capital\r\n\r\nmarket activities.  I do appreciate the intention on the part\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to migrate the fund-raising provision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Companies  Act into a more comprehensive  rule  book  on\r\n\r\ncapital  market activities in Singapore.  I have no  comments\r\n\r\non  this  migration,  save for some particulars  of  details.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, I was hoping that in migrating this provision,\r\n\r\nthe  Government would take the opportunity to spell  out  the\r\n\r\nactivities  that  would constitute an offer  to  the  public.\r\n\r\nThis  phrase  \"an  offer to the public\" is  indeed,  in  many\r\n\r\ncases, key to the question of whether or not a prospectus  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   This  is  the  question  which  has  vexed  many\r\n\r\nlawyers, with the consequence that some take the view that an\r\n\r\noffer  of  securities to five or 10 members of the public  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  public offer ostensibly because the size is not large\r\n\r\nenough.   And in the other extreme, there are some  who  have\r\n\r\ntaken the view that an offer of securities to even one member\r\n\r\nof the public, if that offer was indiscriminately made, would\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  public offer.  Very often,  a  judgement  call\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  be  made by the offerer or the  professional\r\n\r\nadviser  on whether or not a particular offer, when made,  is\r\n\r\nmade  to  the public.  Even until recently, the industry  was\r\n\r\nnot  even  sure  whether  or  not  shares  of  the  employees\r\n\r\nconstitute an offer to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be unfair to place such a responsibility on\r\n\r\nofferers and professional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvisers to make such a judgement call.  I believe our policy\r\n\r\nwould  be  better  served if legislation can perhaps  provide\r\n\r\nclearer  guidelines as to what constitute  an  offer  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.   At  this moment, Sir, the Bill does not  offer  any\r\n\r\nguideline  and  I  would appreciate it if  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister can give us a clarification on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 243 sets out broadly the content requirements of\r\n\r\nprospectuses.  Clause 243(3)(c) additionally seems to suggest\r\n\r\nthat the person making the offer of shares or debentures,  if\r\n\r\nthe   person  controls  the  corporation  whose  shares   and\r\n\r\ndebentures  underlie  the offer of invitation,  must  provide\r\n\r\ninformation  on  assets,  liabilities,  profits,  losses  and\r\n\r\nfinancial   position   in  respect   of   that   corporation.\r\n\r\nTypically,  in  a  prospectus,  information  on  a  group  is\r\n\r\nprovided on a consolidated basis.  If, as the provision seems\r\n\r\nto  suggest, the listing company is now required  to  set  up\r\n\r\ndetails  of  individual companies in the  group,  then  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that  the  prospectus may  get  rather  unwieldy  and\r\n\r\ncumbersome.   This may not serve any better  purpose  than  a\r\n\r\nconsolidated  group account is now able to  provide  and,  in\r\n\r\nthis regard, I would be grateful if the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncould also elaborate on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, collective investment schemes. The Securities\r\n\r\nand  Futures  Bill seeks to replace the term \"interest  other\r\n\r\nthan shares\" with collective investment schemes.  Ostensibly,\r\n\r\nthe  approach seeks to plug a gap in our present  legislation\r\n\r\nwhich  on the surface does not include investments in  actual\r\n\r\nproperty.  For instance, it seems that investments in ostrich\r\n\r\neggs  are  not  covered  by our current  legislation  because\r\n\r\npromoters  of such investments were able to sell  the  actual\r\n\r\ncommodity or property such as the egg and not the interest in\r\n\r\nthe  investment itself.  Because it is an investment into the\r\n\r\nactual  property, such schemes are not caught by our  current\r\n\r\nlegislation  and hence it would seem that the new  provisions\r\n\r\nin the Securities and Futures Bill would be able to deal with\r\n\r\nsuch  a  lacuna in law.  This, Sir, is a development that  is\r\n\r\nmost welcomed indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Bill in its present form, does not\r\n\r\nclarify the ambiguities\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurrounding  listed  unit trusts in the  Singapore  Exchange.\r\n\r\nUnder its present definition, securities means any unit in  a\r\n\r\ncollective investment scheme.  However, in the definition  of\r\n\r\nthe collective investment scheme, it is expressly stated that\r\n\r\nthe  scheme does not include closed-end funds constituted  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Such closed-end funds, Sir, are funds  that  are\r\n\r\nnon-redeemable.   In  the  case  of  unit  trusts,  they  are\r\n\r\nnormally constituted in a manner which is non-redeemable  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  are  typically regarded as closed-end.   It  would\r\n\r\nappear  therefore that any listed unit trust  constituted  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  not  be considered a collective  investment\r\n\r\nscheme under the Securities and Futures Bill.  A listed  unit\r\n\r\ntrust  will  not be deemed as a security for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill and if that was so, Sir, I think it would have grave\r\n\r\nramification in relation to the listing of unit trusts in our\r\n\r\nExchange.   This is because, based on the book entry  system,\r\n\r\nit does not appear that the provisions in our law relating to\r\n\r\nbook entry securities apply to listed unit trusts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, section 130G of the Companies Act provides\r\n\r\nthat  a  transfer of securities by the depository by  way  of\r\n\r\nbook entry to the depositor under the Act shall be valid  and\r\n\r\nshall  not  be challenged in any court of law on  the  ground\r\n\r\nthat  the  transfer  is  not accompanied  by  an  appropriate\r\n\r\ninstrument of transfer or that the transfer was not  made  in\r\n\r\nwriting.   This is a provision, Sir, to deal with  any  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  may  arise under the Civil Law Act which requires  such\r\n\r\ntransfers  ordinarily  to  be made  in  writing.   Under  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act, the definition of securities does not  appear\r\n\r\nto  include  unit trusts as well.  The implication  of  this,\r\n\r\nSir,  is that unit trusts may not have the benefit of a  book\r\n\r\nentry  system of trading.  Accordingly, any transfer arguably\r\n\r\nwould have to be governed by an instrument in writing and  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  therefore,  Sir, if unit  trusts  are  cleared\r\n\r\nthrough  the depository via a book entry system,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nopen to legal challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is shared by some in the industry who\r\n\r\nseem to have taken the view that the present legislation does\r\n\r\nnot cover unit trusts constituted in Singapore under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  book entry system.  And indeed in some prospectuses, the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the book entry system does not cover unit  trusts\r\n\r\nhas  been  raised  as a risk factor in the  prospectuses.   I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   for   a\r\n\r\nclarification in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, facilitating the development of a disclosure-based regime. The present Bill seeks to create a legal\r\n\r\nframework  which  seeks to facilitate the  development  of  a\r\n\r\ndisclosure-based   capital   market   in   Singapore.    This\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is in line with practices elsewhere,  especially\r\n\r\nin  the West which encourages participants in the industry to\r\n\r\ndisclose  as much information as possible in order  to  allow\r\n\r\ninvestors to make a more informed choice.  In order  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith this process, the Bill seeks to give legal teeth to  the\r\n\r\ndisclosure   regime  by  making  obligation  to  disclose   a\r\n\r\nstatutory  one rather than one that is based on an obligation\r\n\r\nto  the  Exchange  pursuant to the rules  under  the  listing\r\n\r\nmanual.    While  it  is  understandable  why  a  regime   of\r\n\r\ndisclosure is encouraged in the marketplace, the drawback  is\r\n\r\noften  one of uncertainty on the part of the listed  company.\r\n\r\nOne would expect that under the regime, particularly now that\r\n\r\nthe disclosure obligation is required by statute, there is  a\r\n\r\nlikelihood  of anxiety on the part of the listed entities  to\r\n\r\nwant  to  disclose,  and  disclose  as  much  information  as\r\n\r\npossible, in order not to run foul of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one has to have a certain balance in the whole\r\n\r\nregime.   Arguably, it may be said that to require a complete\r\n\r\ndisclosure of all material information without much  guidance\r\n\r\nwould be rather onerous on the listed entity itself.  I would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether  the\r\n\r\nAuthority would help to give better guidance as to  the  type\r\n\r\nand  quality of information to be disclosed in order to  help\r\n\r\nthe listed companies in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above comments, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers who have supported\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Let me address some of the points which they have\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked about conflict of\r\n\r\ninterest  in  SGX between MAS' and SGX's role.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nissue  which  arose when we first demutualised  SGX  because,\r\n\r\nonce  it was demutualised and focused more on the bottomline,\r\n\r\nthis may reduce SGX's commitment and resources to fulfil  its\r\n\r\nregulatory responsibilities.  MAS' view overall is that SGX's\r\n\r\ninterests  are  more aligned than divergent with  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest as represented by the users of the Exchange, because\r\n\r\nto  sustain  its  business  of success,  SGX  needs  a  fair,\r\n\r\ntransparent  and efficiently regulated market  and  a  market\r\n\r\nwhich  falls into bad reputation is not going to do  SGX  any\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, to mitigate any potential conflicts arising\r\n\r\nfrom  SGX's self-listing, MAS has assumed the role of listing\r\n\r\nauthority  for  SGX's own listing, conducts  surveillance  of\r\n\r\ntrading  in  its shares and has the power to issue directives\r\n\r\nto  SGX to resolve any conflict of interest arising from  its\r\n\r\nself-listing.  At the same time, MAS has defined more clearly\r\n\r\nits  regulatory  relationship with  SGX.   As  the  statutory\r\n\r\nregulator,  MAS will administer the corpus of laws regulating\r\n\r\nthe  capital markets.  It will also have oversight over SGX's\r\n\r\nregulatory  functions to assure that SGX  is  performing  its\r\n\r\nregulatory  functions competently and responsibly,  and  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  no gaps in the overall regulatory framework.   It\r\n\r\ninspects  SGX.  It carries out regulatory oversight of  SGX's\r\n\r\nlisting   and   business  rules,  and  it   conducts   market\r\n\r\nsurveillance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX retains the front-line responsibility of regulating\r\n\r\nthe   securities   and  futures  markets   and   its   market\r\n\r\nparticipants,  and ensuring compliance with its  rules.   SGX\r\n\r\nhas  also appointed a Conflicts Committee to deal with issues\r\n\r\nof potential conflicts of interest, with MAS as the approving\r\n\r\nauthority  for the composition of the Committee.  These  were\r\n\r\nissues   which  were  largely  addressed  in  the   Exchanges\r\n\r\n(Demutualisation and Merger) Act which was  passed  in  1999,\r\n\r\nwhen SGX was demutualised.  This Act does not change\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  situation  because we have just imported those  sections\r\n\r\nfrom the Exchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act into  the\r\n\r\nnew SF Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Leong asked about enforcement of extra-territorial jurisdiction, given that the players are\r\n\r\noverseas, and Mr Sin Boon Ann also highlighted this  problem.\r\n\r\nThey are right.  It is not straightforward.  You can pass the\r\n\r\nlegislation, but to actually have the reach to enforce it and\r\n\r\nput  things  right, there will be holes in the  armour.   The\r\n\r\nextra-territorial jurisdiction provisions in  clause  339  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill will make clear that acts outside Singapore,  which\r\n\r\ntarget   Singapore  investors,  would  be  subject   to   our\r\n\r\nregulatory  reach.  Without such a clause, we  may  not  even\r\n\r\nhave  a  legal  reach against operators of  such  businesses.\r\n\r\nHaving  created  that legal reach, Part  X  of  the  SF  Bill\r\n\r\nrelates  to  provisions  relating to  assistance  to  foreign\r\n\r\nregulatory  authorities.   Apart  from  this,  MAS  has  also\r\n\r\nentered   into   several  memoranda  of  understanding   with\r\n\r\nregulators  from  major financial centres.   These  MOUs  and\r\n\r\nmutual  assistance  provisions facilitate  the  procuring  of\r\n\r\nassistance  from  overseas regulators  and  would  facilitate\r\n\r\nenforcement processes.  It is not easy to do but you  need  a\r\n\r\nmemorandum  of  understanding, and  you  need  a  cooperative\r\n\r\nregulator  on  the  other side.  In some cases,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  to  have  a mutual legal assistance  treaty.   [MLAT\r\n\r\nnegotiations are multi-agency-led, coordinated by  AGC.]   We\r\n\r\npassed legislation to enable this a couple of years ago,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  in  the  process of negotiating  several  such\r\n\r\nmutual  legal assistance treaties, although none of them  are\r\n\r\nready yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about insider trading - how the information-connected approach works, and what\r\n\r\nhappens to the person-connected criterion, eg, trading during\r\n\r\na  restricted  period [in SGX-ST's Best  Practices  Guide  on\r\n\r\nDealing in Securities] by relatives of a person.  First,  may\r\n\r\nI  explain  that whether or not a trade violates the  insider\r\n\r\ntrading rules does not depend on the restriction period.   It\r\n\r\ndepends   on  whether  or  not  you  have  sensitive   inside\r\n\r\ninformation at the time of trading.  It can be outside the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestricted  period.   But if you have some  information,  you\r\n\r\nknow  something is going to happen, you trade on it, you have\r\n\r\nviolated  the  rule.   And  when we say  it  is  information-connected rather than person-connected, we mean that it  goes\r\n\r\ndown  the chain  -  I told you, he told the next person,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  It is information-connected.  Whereas under the  old\r\n\r\nperson-connected rule, you had to have a direct contact.   If\r\n\r\nit  went  to  the next person, then we had to establish  that\r\n\r\nthere was some joint activity amongst those three persons  in\r\n\r\norder  to establish that this was an insider trading offence.\r\n\r\nSo  it is not whether you are a member of the family or  not,\r\n\r\nor  whether you are trading within the restricted period.  It\r\n\r\nis  to do with whether there was information which was passed\r\n\r\nfrom  the insider to the tippee, and from the tippee  onwards\r\n\r\nto another person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Ong Kian Min asked whether we will be setting\r\n\r\nup  a  Securities and Futures Commission.  The answer is  no,\r\n\r\nbut  we  will be beefing up significantly MAS' department  in\r\n\r\ncharge of securities and futures.  We have appointed a Deputy\r\n\r\nManaging  Director in charge of this.  It is a big  function.\r\n\r\nIn  countries  like Malaysia or Hong Kong, it is  a  separate\r\n\r\nentity.   But in other countries like Britain and now  Japan,\r\n\r\nthe  trend  is  to  bring together the regulation  under  one\r\n\r\nconsolidated financial supervisory authority.  In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMAS  has  a  consolidated supervisor.  We have  derived  some\r\n\r\neconomies of scale and it has worked well for us.  So I think\r\n\r\nwe  will build up the securities and futures function  within\r\n\r\nMAS, but it does need to be built up substantially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Ong asked whether the benefits of the\r\n\r\ndisclosure-based regime will be realised in  practice.   This\r\n\r\nis  something which we will have to work out.   I  think,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, we have to move to a disclosure-based regime.  The\r\n\r\nold  regime  where the authorities exercise merit supervision\r\n\r\nand  guided  what  companies were fit to be listed  and  what\r\n\r\ncompanies really should not be allowed to raise funds because\r\n\r\nit is too dangerous, is not an approach which we can sustain.\r\n\r\nSo we have to go forward and we have to derive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit.  And if, in the process of working the disclosure regime,\r\n\r\nwe   run  into  difficulties,  we  have  to  overcome   those\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the uncertainties which Mr Ong raised was that\r\n\r\nwhen  an exposure copy of a prospectus is posted, there  will\r\n\r\nbe unreasonable requests for information. This will really be\r\n\r\nup  to  MAS  to administer, and MAS will have to be  firm  in\r\n\r\ndeciding   what  information  is  needed.   It  is   not   an\r\n\r\nunprecedented  arrangement.   The  Australians  have  a  very\r\n\r\nsimilar scheme, and it has worked for them.  I think  we  can\r\n\r\nmake it work for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the new corporate finance provisions making fund\r\n\r\nraising  prohibitively  expensive  for  SMEs,  I  would  say,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  that  the new provisions apply only  to  offers  of\r\n\r\nsecurities to the public on the stock market.  Many SMEs  are\r\n\r\nmore  likely  to  raise private equity from  venture  capital\r\n\r\nfirms,  business angels and family friends.  It  is  not  our\r\n\r\nintention to make things onerous for them.  In fact, we  have\r\n\r\na  committee presently led by the private sector  on  company\r\n\r\nlegislation and regulatory framework, which is studying  ways\r\n\r\nto make fund raising easier and less costly for the SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong said that it will cost $1 million in fees in\r\n\r\norder  to  do  an IPO for a listing on SGX.    This  probably\r\n\r\nincludes both professional and underwriting fees. If you  are\r\n\r\nmaking a public offer of unlisted securities, the cost should\r\n\r\nbe  much  lower.  It should be noted that, in fact,  our  IPO\r\n\r\nfees  in Singapore are much lower than IPO fees in many other\r\n\r\ncountries.   For example, in the US, to list a  company,  the\r\n\r\nunderwriting  fees  alone will amount  to  7%  of  the  funds\r\n\r\nraised.   So  a million dollars is a lot if you are  a  small\r\n\r\ncompany,  but  that  is the expense which is  involved  going\r\n\r\nthrough the processes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the fund raising cost down, the Bill provides\r\n\r\nfor certain exemptions from the prospectus requirements.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  when  securities are being offered to institutional\r\n\r\nor  sophisticated investors, a company would not be  required\r\n\r\nto prepare a prospectus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked about civil actions - what will happen\r\n\r\nif  MAS decides to settle a civil action instead of going  to\r\n\r\ncourt?  Our intent when we introduced the civil penalties and\r\n\r\ncivil remedies for insider trading in the Securities Industry\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Act last year, we wanted the civil remedies to be\r\n\r\nfiled as an independent course of action by investors who had\r\n\r\ntraded contemporaneously with the defendant.  We have applied\r\n\r\nthe  same  approach in this Bill.  We have  not  changed  the\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a civil fine action is initiated by MAS or where\r\n\r\ncriminal prosecution is commenced against the defendant,  the\r\n\r\ncivil  proceedings  will  be stayed.   When  a  defendant  is\r\n\r\neventually convicted in a criminal proceeding or found liable\r\n\r\nto  pay  a civil penalty in a civil action initiated by  MAS,\r\n\r\nclause  236 allows contemporaneous investors to ride  on  the\r\n\r\ncoat-tail  of  such criminal proceedings  or  of  civil  fine\r\n\r\naction.  This is because it would be a waste of resources for\r\n\r\na  court  to  rehear the entire action for the  civil  action\r\n\r\nbased  on the same set of facts.  So you have to see  clauses\r\n\r\n234  and 236 of the Bill in that context.  The civil remedies\r\n\r\nhave  always  been  intended  to  constitute  an  independent\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In out-of-court settlements - they occur, they are not\r\n\r\nunusual - it is a practice of securities regulators in  other\r\n\r\nfinancial centres.  MAS will exercise any discretion  it  has\r\n\r\nto  enter into a settlement judiciously, having regard to all\r\n\r\nthe  facts  and circumstances of the case and the seriousness\r\n\r\nof the transgression.  MAS will have to obtain the consent of\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General, and in exercising its discretion,  MAS\r\n\r\nwill take into account the impact of that settlement on civil\r\n\r\nclaims.   But  that  factor in itself,  the possibility  that\r\n\r\nthere are other civil claims, cannot determine whether or not\r\n\r\nan out-of-court settlement is entered.  Civil compensation is\r\n\r\nnot  barred by an out-of-court settlement with the Authority,\r\n\r\nunder clause 232(5) of the Bill.  Even where there is an out-of-court settlement, the claimants of civil compensation  are\r\n\r\nnot worse off than plaintiffs in other types of civil claims.\r\n\r\nBecause, even if MAS settles out of court,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  does  not stop other plaintiffs from pursuing  their  own\r\n\r\nclaims  independently.  Nor are these  plaintiffs  worse  off\r\n\r\nthan  claimants in situations in which neither  criminal  nor\r\n\r\ncivil penalty proceedings are commenced.  Under the rules  of\r\n\r\ncourt  which  will  be promulgated under the  Securities  and\r\n\r\nFutures Bill, claimants will have available to them discovery\r\n\r\nand  interrogatories.  However, we do not think  that  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable nor is it practicable to set guidelines as  to  the\r\n\r\ntypes  of cases that the Authority should not settle.   There\r\n\r\nare  many  variables that determine whether  or  not  a  case\r\n\r\nshould  be settled, the potential number of claimants or  the\r\n\r\namounts  involved cannot be used to determine the issue,  and\r\n\r\nthe  civil claim regime is meant to operate independently  of\r\n\r\nanything which anybody else may wish to pursue his claim in a\r\n\r\ncivil action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a settlement, MAS may, where it is\r\n\r\nappropriate, disclose the fact of the settlement and a  brief\r\n\r\ndescription of the transgression.  However, it would  not  be\r\n\r\nin  the public interest for MAS to disclose its investigative\r\n\r\nmethods, the results of its investigations and the source  of\r\n\r\nits  information.  No prosecution or investigative  authority\r\n\r\ndoes  that.   As  a  parallel, criminal  authorities  do  not\r\n\r\ndisclose  the  evidence that they uncover in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ninvestigations to facilitate civil claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about the disclosure-based\r\n\r\nregime and asked about fair disclosure, and to what extent we\r\n\r\nrequire fair disclosure as part of this regime.  The SF  Bill\r\n\r\nrequires listed companies to disclose information required by\r\n\r\nthe  rules  of  the  Exchange on  a  continuous  basis.   The\r\n\r\nExchange  has  a  system in place to ensure prompt  and  wide\r\n\r\ndissemination  of  such information to  the  public.   Listed\r\n\r\ncompanies  issue public announcements via MASNet which  is  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  network connecting listed companies,  SGX,  banks,\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  as  well  as  news  agencies.   Such\r\n\r\nannouncements  will  be  uploaded simultaneously  onto  SGX's\r\n\r\nwebsite,  which  is  fully accessible to  the  public  at  no\r\n\r\ncharge.   These arrangements ensure that the public  and  all\r\n\r\nmarket participants have equal and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediate access to material information disclosed by  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim also asked about investor education. Investor\r\n\r\neducation  is  a  collective effort by  all  players  in  the\r\n\r\nsecurities industry.  Local players have been doing their bit\r\n\r\nin  recent  years,  eg, Singapore Exchange  organises  public\r\n\r\ntalks  and  exhibitions  on  share  investments  and  trading\r\n\r\nregularly.  There is an Investment Management Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that  has  sponsored radio talks  and  contributed\r\n\r\narticles  to  the  press on investments in various  financial\r\n\r\nproducts.   The Securities Investors Association of Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  taken  its investor education programme to neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.   This  is  a  continuing  effort.    MAS\r\n\r\nsupports   and  encourages  these  initiatives  in   investor\r\n\r\neducation.   We  will be open to helping out with  co-funding\r\n\r\nfrom  the  financial  sector development  fund  for  specific\r\n\r\nprojects.   In  addition, MAS will play a coordinating  role,\r\n\r\nidentifying gaps and filling them where it is necessary.  And\r\n\r\nwe  will put general investor education materials on our  MAS\r\n\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to disclosure-based regulation makes investor\r\n\r\neducation  more important, because companies  now  no  longer\r\n\r\nrequire  MAS' approval to launch new investment  products  or\r\n\r\nschemes,  provided that basic requirements are  met  and  all\r\n\r\nrelevant information is disclosed to investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public will be reminded time and again that the\r\n\r\nprimary  responsibility for making investment decisions  lies\r\n\r\nwith themselves and, over time, they will be able to learn to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  look out for their own interest.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nalternative.   We have to shift.  We cannot go on  the  basis\r\n\r\nthat  the  regulator, or MAS, or the Exchange will make  sure\r\n\r\nthat every investment is safe and sure to make money.  If you\r\n\r\nwant to invest, you have to make your own judgement, find out\r\n\r\nyour own information and make your own decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Sin Boon Ann has raised several points in\r\n\r\nhis  speech,  many of them have to do with the implementation\r\n\r\nand operation of the legislation.  This is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  piece of legislation, it is complicated.  We have  tried\r\n\r\nour  best  to  address all the uncertainties  and  lacuna  by\r\n\r\nexposing  it to the industry for public comments,  taking  in\r\n\r\ncomments and then going several rounds of consultations.   We\r\n\r\nthink that what we have is workable but it is complicated and\r\n\r\nI  would not be surprised that as we operate the scheme  over\r\n\r\nthe next years, we will find problems or parts which need  to\r\n\r\nbe  changed  or fixed, and we will come back and  have  those\r\n\r\nparts amended by Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to address one point which Mr Sin\r\n\r\nraised,  which is the issue of boutique firms or  individuals\r\n\r\nwho  are  small and who want to become market intermediaries.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not our intention to make it difficult for ex-bankers\r\n\r\nand  employees of financial institutions to start up on their\r\n\r\nown  and enter corporate finance or other activities.  So  we\r\n\r\nwill have a level playing field.  And if they are able to  do\r\n\r\nit and if they have the expertise, I think the framework will\r\n\r\nenable them to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINANCIAL ADVISERS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.03 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overview</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Advisers (FA) Bill proposes to regulate\r\n\r\nFinancial  Advisers and their representatives, and to  repeal\r\n\r\nthe  Insurance Intermediaries Act (Chapter 142A of  the  2000\r\n\r\nRevised  Edition).   It  will govern all  financial  advisory\r\n\r\nactivities in respect of investment products, and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarketing  of  specific  investment  products,  namely,  life\r\n\r\ninsurance  policies and collective investment schemes  across\r\n\r\nall   financial  institutions,  from  banks,  life  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies and insurance brokers, to independent advisers.  As\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, corporate finance advisory activities will\r\n\r\nbe regulated under the Securities and Futures Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regulatory framework for Financial Advisers\r\n\r\nis  contained in various pieces of statutes, depending on the\r\n\r\nasset   class  they  advise  on.   These  statutes  are   the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry Act, Futures Trading Act  and  Insurance\r\n\r\nIntermediaries Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, product innovation has resulted\r\n\r\nin  the  emergence  of  new and complex  products  that  have\r\n\r\nblurred  product lines.  Financial institutions do  not  just\r\n\r\noffer  \"plain-vanilla\" instruments these days.  For instance,\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies offer investment-linked  life  insurance\r\n\r\nproducts  (ILPs),  which are similar to unit  trusts,  except\r\n\r\nthat they have an insurance element attached to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution channels for financial products are also no\r\n\r\nlonger  confined to traditional boundaries and  institutions.\r\n\r\nInvestors may now purchase unit trusts from various  sources:\r\n\r\ndirectly  from  fund managers, banks, stockbroking  firms  or\r\n\r\nInternet  portals.   Besides  the  traditional  agency  sales\r\n\r\nforce,  life  insurance  companies are  relying  on  external\r\n\r\nparties, such as life insurance brokers and banks, to  market\r\n\r\ntheir  policies.  Financial intermediaries are now  expanding\r\n\r\nbeyond  traditional  lines of business to provide  \"one-stop\"\r\n\r\nservice to meet investors' financial needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present regulatory model of multiple licensing has\r\n\r\nits  merits  when financial products are distinct  and  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by  different professions.  However, this is no  longer\r\n\r\nthe  case.   Therefore,  the FA Bill  will  introduce  a  new\r\n\r\nintegrated regulatory and supervisory framework for Financial\r\n\r\nAdvisers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Bill will consolidate the current regulatory\r\n\r\nregime governing the provision\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  financial  advisory  services in respect  of  securities,\r\n\r\nfutures  and  life  insurance products, which  are  currently\r\n\r\ncontained  in  three different Acts, namely,  the  Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Act (SIA), Futures Trading Act (FTA) and  Insurance\r\n\r\nIntermediaries Act (IIA), into a single legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several benefits from consolidating the\r\n\r\nlegislation regarding the provision of financial advice  into\r\n\r\none  Bill.  Firstly, streamlining the regulation of Financial\r\n\r\nAdvisers,  allowing a single licence to authorise the  giving\r\n\r\nof  advice  on  a wider spectrum of financial products,  will\r\n\r\nreduce administrative and compliance costs, as compared  with\r\n\r\nholding  multiple licences under the securities, futures  and\r\n\r\ninsurance laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it will establish a consistent set of\r\n\r\nregulatory   requirements  across  the   financial   advisory\r\n\r\nindustry.    This  will  reduce  the  scope   of   regulatory\r\n\r\narbitrage,  level  the  playing  field  and  facilitate   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  uniform professional  standards  across  the\r\n\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill will create a new class of licensed\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisers.  These professionals  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  investment  advice  on a  wide  array  of  financial\r\n\r\nproducts,   and  also  sell  unit  trusts  and  their   close\r\n\r\nsubstitutes,  such  as investment-linked products.   In  some\r\n\r\ncases, these financial advisers will not be connected to  any\r\n\r\nproduct   providers,  such  as  fund  managers  or  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies,   and  will  act  independently  of  them.    Such\r\n\r\nindependent  financial advisers will represent the  interests\r\n\r\nof  their  clients,  rather than the  interests  of  specific\r\n\r\nproduct providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial institutions that are already licensed by MAS\r\n\r\nand  also  provide similar advisory services, such as  banks,\r\n\r\nfund  managers and insurance companies, will be  exempt  from\r\n\r\nlicensing  under the Bill but will have to observe  the  same\r\n\r\nbusiness conduct requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Financial Advisers Bill, MAS has\r\n\r\nconducted  public  consultation on  an  earlier  draft.   All\r\n\r\ncomments were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered  and where relevant  were  incorporated\r\n\r\ninto  the Bill.  I will now highlight some of the key  policy\r\n\r\ninitiatives the Bill contains.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A Single Licensing Regime</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FA Bill will introduce a streamlined licensing\r\n\r\nregime for persons engaging in financial advisory services on\r\n\r\nsecurities,  futures and life insurance.  Clause  6  provides\r\n\r\nthat  a person must not act as a financial adviser in respect\r\n\r\nof  any financial advisory service unless he is authorised by\r\n\r\na  Financial  Adviser's  licence or is  an  exempt  financial\r\n\r\nadviser.   The Financial Adviser's licence will  replace  the\r\n\r\nexisting   licences  required  under   the   SIA,   FTA   and\r\n\r\nregistration under the IIA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 requires that any individual who acts on behalf\r\n\r\nof  a licensed Financial Adviser be similarly licensed by the\r\n\r\nAuthority.  As representatives act on behalf of the  licensed\r\n\r\nFinancial  Advisers  and, in most cases, deal  directly  with\r\n\r\nclients,  it is important that these individuals are suitably\r\n\r\nqualified and are subject to regulatory requirements and  are\r\n\r\nunder MAS' supervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prudential Requirements for Licensed Financial Advisers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensed Financial Advisers must meet certain prudential\r\n\r\nrequirements,  such as minimum paid-up capital and  financial\r\n\r\nresources, at all times.  These requirements are necessary in\r\n\r\norder  to  establish  the Financial Adviser's  commitment  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  Singapore  and to ensure  that  it  possesses  a\r\n\r\nminimum  level  of  financial  resources  to  discharge   its\r\n\r\nliabilities and obligations as and when they fall  due.   The\r\n\r\ncapital  requirements will be minimal and will be lower  than\r\n\r\nexisting   ones.   To  complement  them,  Licensed  Financial\r\n\r\nAdvisers  will  need  to  procure  a  professional  indemnity\r\n\r\ninsurance,  as is the practice in other professional  fields.\r\n\r\nClause  10  empowers MAS to take regulatory  actions  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  of  the  Financial Adviser's  inability  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nminimum  financial resource requirements or  its  failure  to\r\n\r\nhave  in  force  a  professional  indemnity  insurance.   MAS\r\n\r\nbelieves that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  right  mix  of financial requirements and insurance  cover\r\n\r\nwill  result in better utilisation of the Licensed  Financial\r\n\r\nAdviser's financial resources, without compromising  investor\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exemption for Financial Institutions Supervised by the\r\n\r\nAuthority under Other Acts</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, financial institutions which are\r\n\r\nalready  supervised  by  the MAS under  other  Acts  will  be\r\n\r\nexempted  from the need for licensing under the  Bill.   This\r\n\r\nwill  minimise regulatory overlap and reduce compliance costs\r\n\r\nfor  these institutions, which will be referred to as  Exempt\r\n\r\nFinancial  Advisers  in  the Bill.   However,  to  level  the\r\n\r\nplaying  field and to apply uniform standards to  all  market\r\n\r\nparticipants  engaging in the same types of activities,  such\r\n\r\nExempt  Financial Advisers will be required  to  comply  with\r\n\r\nsimilar requirements on market conduct and practices  as  the\r\n\r\nLicensed  Financial  Advisers in respect of  their  financial\r\n\r\nadvisory activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Power to Issue Prohibition Orders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, MAS has the power to issue an order to\r\n\r\nprohibit  undesirable persons from engaging in life insurance\r\n\r\nbroking  activities  in Singapore.  This  mechanism  is  also\r\n\r\nfound  in  other  jurisdictions with more developed  markets.\r\n\r\nMAS  has found this an effective regulatory tool and proposes\r\n\r\nto introduce it in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 59 to 62 of the Bill relate to prohibition\r\n\r\norders.  MAS will have the power to issue an order to  forbid\r\n\r\na  person from providing any or all of the financial advisory\r\n\r\nservices regulated by the Bill, either permanently or  for  a\r\n\r\nspecified  period.    MAS may vary or  revoke  a  prohibition\r\n\r\norder  either  on the application of the person against  whom\r\n\r\nthe  order is made, or on its own initiative if the Authority\r\n\r\nis  satisfied that it is inappropriate to continue  with  the\r\n\r\nprohibition order because of a change in the circumstances on\r\n\r\nwhich the prohibition order was issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment and Removal of officers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEOs and directors are the key persons of a company. It\r\n\r\nis  important that such key appointments are held by  persons\r\n\r\nof  integrity  who are fit and proper.  Therefore,  MAS  will\r\n\r\nrequire  Licensed Financial Advisers to seek the  Authority's\r\n\r\nprior  approval  for the appointment of these  key  personnel\r\n\r\n(under  clause  56).   The  fit and  proper  criterion  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  requirement.  Where MAS is of the view  that  any\r\n\r\nofficer of the Licensed Financial Adviser does not measure up\r\n\r\nto  this benchmark, it may direct the company to remove  such\r\n\r\nofficer  from his office if the Authority thinks it necessary\r\n\r\nin  the public interest or for the protection of investors to\r\n\r\ndo so (under clause 57).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Inspection Power of MAS</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-site inspection of intermediaries is an integral part\r\n\r\nof MAS' supervisory framework.  MAS' inspection power will be\r\n\r\nprovided for under clause 70 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appeals to be made to the Minister</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeals process in the Bill is similar to that in\r\n\r\nthe Securities and Futures Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I serve as a member\r\n\r\nof   the   Executive  Committee  of  the  Financial  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore and while I speak in support of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial   Advisers  Bill  in  general,   I   hope   certain\r\n\r\nrefinements  can  be made in the course of implementing  this\r\n\r\nAct.   Consultation draft of the Financial Advisers  Act  (or\r\n\r\nFAA) has been circulated for some time and some of the points\r\n\r\nI  am  raising  now  are not new, but I  think  they  deserve\r\n\r\nmention in this debate on the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FA Bill serves to consolidate and streamline the\r\n\r\nregulations   found  in  three  separate  Acts  relating   to\r\n\r\nprovision  of services in respect of securities, futures  and\r\n\r\nlife insurance products.  While the intention is commendable,\r\n\r\nI  feel that in the process of consolidating and in coming up\r\n\r\nwith  the FA Bill in this present form, we have missed a good\r\n\r\nopportunity\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  the  entire industry in the  area  of  financial\r\n\r\nplanning  and to promote Singapore as a centre of  excellence\r\n\r\nin this field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, by virtue of its origin, the FA Bill is\r\n\r\nproduct oriented.  It regulates financial advisory activities\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  a  range  of investment  products,  and  the\r\n\r\ndistribution  and  marketing of life insurance  policies  and\r\n\r\nunit trusts.  Any person presently permitted to carry on  his\r\n\r\nactivity  under  the  Securities Industry  Act,  the  Futures\r\n\r\nTrading Act or the Insurance Intermediaries Act will be  able\r\n\r\nto automatically migrate over to be a licensee under the FAA.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  presume an insurance agency presently operating under\r\n\r\nthe  Insurance Act will automatically qualify to be  licensed\r\n\r\nas  a  financial  adviser under the  FAA,  and  each  of  its\r\n\r\ninsurance  agents  can  be  now  called  \"financial   adviser\r\n\r\nrepresentative\"  simply  based on his present  qualifications\r\n\r\nwithout having to undergo any additional examinations of  his\r\n\r\nskills  and competency.  If this is not the case,  then  many\r\n\r\npeople  presently  working  in  the  insurance  industry  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  industry will not be able to carry  on  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  doing  once the FA Bill comes into  force.   This\r\n\r\nwould be a cause of concern as they will add to the number of\r\n\r\nretrenched  and unemployed.  I would like to ask DPM  whether\r\n\r\nthe  passing of this Bill into law will result in any  person\r\n\r\npresently engaged as an insurance agent, financial analyst or\r\n\r\ninvestment  adviser  representative  to  be  disqualified  or\r\n\r\nprohibited from doing what he has been doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, if everyone in the industry will be\r\n\r\nmigrated over and covered under the term \"financial adviser\",\r\n\r\nthen this generic term \"financial adviser\" can potentially be\r\n\r\nextremely confusing to the public.  This, I find, is the  big\r\n\r\nweakness of this Bill.  Now, when someone approaches you  and\r\n\r\nrepresents   to   you   that  he  is  a   financial   adviser\r\n\r\nrepresentative   licensed  by  the  MAS,  what   skills   and\r\n\r\nqualifications would you expect him to have?   What  kind  of\r\n\r\nadvice would you think he is competent to give?   I think  it\r\n\r\nis   reasonable   to   assume  that   a   financial   adviser\r\n\r\nrepresentative licensed by the MAS is competent to  give  you\r\n\r\nadvice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregarding  your  financial matters.  But, lo and  behold,  he\r\n\r\nmerely wants to sell you an insurance policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big difference between someone who can\r\n\r\nanalyse your financial needs and someone who is knowledgeable\r\n\r\nonly  about  a  particular product.  It is analogous  to  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  existing between doctors and pharmacists.   One\r\n\r\nwould  go  to a doctor for diagnosis of what sickness  he  is\r\n\r\nsuffering  from.   The doctor does the tests,  diagnoses  the\r\n\r\nillness  and prescribes the medicine to take.  One  does  not\r\n\r\nexpect  the  pharmacist  to  do  all  that  even  though  the\r\n\r\npharmacist  may  be  very  knowledgeable  about  the  medical\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the general public make a distinction between a\r\n\r\nfinancial planner and a financial adviser?  I believe  it  is\r\n\r\nhard  to change public perception once it is associated  with\r\n\r\nthe  usage of a certain term; it is easier to change the term\r\n\r\nto one that is in-line with the public's perception of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask DPM to consider changing\r\n\r\nthe  term  \"financial adviser\" as used in the  FA  Bill.   To\r\n\r\navoid  confusion,  the words \"financial adviser\",  \"financial\r\n\r\nconsultant\",  \"financial planner\", or words  to  the  effect,\r\n\r\nshould  be  reserved  for someone who  is  able  to  properly\r\n\r\ndiscover  and analyse the financial needs of his  client  and\r\n\r\nrender  more  comprehensive financial planning  advice  in  a\r\n\r\nholistic manner customised to the client's needs.  Could  DPM\r\n\r\nconsider whether other terms, such as \"insurance adviser\" and\r\n\r\n\"unit trust adviser\", that are more descriptive of the skills\r\n\r\nset,  could be adopted for other specialists in the  area  of\r\n\r\ninsurance and unit trust respectively?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative would be to split the licence for\r\n\r\n\"financial  adviser\" into distinct categories,  like  perhaps\r\n\r\nCat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 3, to denote specialty in the respective\r\n\r\nregulated   financial   advisory  services   and   investment\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of putting everyone into a single licence is\r\n\r\nthat   people  tend  to  just  strive  to  meet  the  minimum\r\n\r\nrequirements - enough to be qualified as a \"financial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadviser  representative\", enough to sell their  products  and\r\n\r\nearn  the  commission,  and will not  endeavour  to  progress\r\n\r\nfurther  to  upgrade  their skills  and  gain  competency  in\r\n\r\nfinancial  planning.   In  legal  practice,  we  are  \"Senior\r\n\r\nCounsel\".  For financial advisers, I would like to ask DPM to\r\n\r\nconsider  having  another category of licensee  who  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to have a higher level of competency and skills  to\r\n\r\nwhich the entire profession can strive towards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we push the FA Bill to go a\r\n\r\nlittle  further  and  differentiate  financial  advisory  and\r\n\r\nplanning  activities  from  the mere  selling  of  investment\r\n\r\nproducts.   In addition to consolidating existing regulations\r\n\r\ntouching  on the selling of insurance and financial products,\r\n\r\nwe  should go one step further with this piece of legislation\r\n\r\nto  cover new areas of financial planning so as to bring  the\r\n\r\nentire   industry  to  a  higher  level  of  competence   and\r\n\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Financial\r\n\r\nAdvisers Bill answers the need for a legal framework for both\r\n\r\nthe  burgeoning range of investment products and distribution\r\n\r\nchannels,  and the convergence of various financial products.\r\n\r\nI support the establishment of this framework which will help\r\n\r\nensure,  amongst other things, the integrity of our financial\r\n\r\nmarkets in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to however briefly raise two issues,\r\n\r\none  of  which  will arise as a result of a single  licensing\r\n\r\nconcept  and  the  other which concerns  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nunwitting discouragement of entrepreneurial efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, increasing competition. Whilst it makes\r\n\r\nperfect sense to adopt a consistent approach to the licensing\r\n\r\nof persons engaging in financial advisory activities, we must\r\n\r\nbe  mindful  of  the implications of such a convergence.   As\r\n\r\nalluded  to,  opportunities to advise on  a  wider  range  of\r\n\r\nfinancial products will increase, as will, on the flip  side,\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Sir, this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  precipitate  a falling out of the  less  sophisticated\r\n\r\nadvisers  who  have only very narrow and specific  expertise.\r\n\r\nFor  example, remisiers who are adept at broking  stocks  can\r\n\r\nnow   extend  such  expertise  into,  say,  investment-linked\r\n\r\ninsurance  policies,  which have hitherto  been  marketed  by\r\n\r\ninsurance  agents.   As such, product specialists  could  now\r\n\r\nface  even more competition.  I would therefore like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime  Minister if he envisages  this  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsignificant dislocation and, if so, whether assistance can be\r\n\r\nrendered   to   help   interested   persons   develop   other\r\n\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, capital requirements for independent financial\r\n\r\nadvisers.  Sir, in a market where most services are typically\r\n\r\noffered  on  a proprietary or an agency basis, the  need  for\r\n\r\nindependent  financial  advice  will  be  felt  increasingly.\r\n\r\nWhilst  our  market  does not appear  to  support  such  paid\r\n\r\nservices at the moment, it is felt that the Government  could\r\n\r\nhelp  facilitate  the  sustainability of any  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current consolidation within the financial sector\r\n\r\nmay  well  inspire some experienced professionals to consider\r\n\r\nproviding independent advice, say, on financial planning.  If\r\n\r\ncapital  and  licensing requirements  are  too  stringent  or\r\n\r\nprohibitive,  then fledgling efforts would  not  survive.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the Deputy Prime Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nfurther  measures to help nurture such a group  of  advisers,\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  believe, is performing a very useful role  in  the\r\n\r\nUSA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Kian Min about upgrading the entire industry, the  types\r\n\r\nof  services  provided  by financial  planners  vary  widely.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it assesses every aspect of the client's financial\r\n\r\nprofile  -  savings, investment, insurance, tax,  retirement,\r\n\r\nestate  planning - and help them to develop detailed strategy\r\n\r\nto meet the objectives.  Others may call themselves financial\r\n\r\nplanners  but may only provide advice on a limited  range  of\r\n\r\nproducts  and services.  MAS currently regulates all  aspects\r\n\r\nof financial planning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelating  to  securities, futures and  insurance.   But  tax,\r\n\r\nretirement and estate planning activities will not come under\r\n\r\nMAS'  regulatory ambit, and this is going to  continue  under\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Advisers Act.  Hence, only financial  planners\r\n\r\nwho  conduct  activities regulated  under  the  FAA  need  be\r\n\r\nlicensed as a financial adviser and only in respect of  those\r\n\r\nregulated  activities.   The financial  planner  may  conduct\r\n\r\nother  activities, such as retirement and tax  planning,  but\r\n\r\nthis  will not be subject to MAS' supervision.  This is  very\r\n\r\nmuch   in  line  with  the  regulatory  framework  in   other\r\n\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will engage the industry bodies representing\r\n\r\nfinancial  planners, where appropriate, and seek their  views\r\n\r\non regulatory issues affecting the financial advisory market.\r\n\r\nAs  a  regulator,  MAS will facilitate and encourage  healthy\r\n\r\nmarket development and work with industry bodies to encourage\r\n\r\nimproved  professional standards to promote  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ncentre of excellence in this field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Ong asked about retrenchment and unemployment\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  insurance agents, financial  analysts  and\r\n\r\npeople like that, as a result of this Bill.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nallay  this  concern because existing professionals  will  be\r\n\r\nable to engage in the existing activities that they have been\r\n\r\nauthorised  to  do  when the Bill is enacted.   However,  one\r\n\r\nmajor   objective  of  introducing  this  Financial   Adviser\r\n\r\nregulatory  regime is to provide an integrated and consistent\r\n\r\nregulatory  framework for market intermediaries  engaging  in\r\n\r\nsimilar  activities  across  a broad  spectrum  of  different\r\n\r\ninvestment  products.  This would facilitate the setting  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of consistent professional standards and business\r\n\r\nconduct rules for the provision of financial advice.   As  we\r\n\r\nintroduce  progressively new standards to raise the standards\r\n\r\nof  professionalism and knowledge, existing players will also\r\n\r\nbe  expected to meet these new standards.  And we are already\r\n\r\ndoing  it in insurance, for example, with the recommendations\r\n\r\nof the Committee on Efficient Distribution on Life Insurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question of different categories of licences,\r\n\r\nI think this would defeat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe objective of having a single licensing regime.  The whole\r\n\r\nidea  of  the  business  conduct  requirements  is  that  all\r\n\r\nindividuals should have the necessary professional competence\r\n\r\nand  standards before they can operate as representatives  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisers.   While  MAS  could  prescribe   minimum\r\n\r\nstandards  which  financial advisers' representatives  should\r\n\r\npossess  by  setting  examinations and continual  educational\r\n\r\nrequirements,  ultimately  it is the  responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisers to ensure that they upgrade their  skills\r\n\r\nto  provide value-added services to their clients.  Financial\r\n\r\nadvisers  who do not strive to upgrade their skills  and  who\r\n\r\nare  content with meeting only basic requirements can  expect\r\n\r\nto lose clients to more competent advisers who provide better\r\n\r\nand higher quality services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not keen to control many words, \"financial\r\n\r\nadviser\",  \"financial  consultant\", \"financial  planner\",  or\r\n\r\nwords to that effect.  I think what we will do is to restrict\r\n\r\nthe use of the term \"financial adviser\", one name, to holders\r\n\r\nof  a financial adviser's licence and exempted entities.   We\r\n\r\nare mindful that there are some market participants currently\r\n\r\nholding  themselves out as financial advisers.   However,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that restriction on the usage of the term \"financial\r\n\r\nadviser\"  will  better enable investors to  identify  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are receiving financial advice from an entity which  is\r\n\r\nlicensed  by  MAS, as opposed to an entity not  regulated  by\r\n\r\nMAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not intend to restrict the use of other titles,\r\n\r\nlike  \"financial planner\", \"financial consultant\", and  such.\r\n\r\nHowever, the investing public should be aware that people who\r\n\r\nuse  such titles may or may not be regulated by MAS depending\r\n\r\non  the  services  that they offer.  Financial  advisers  are\r\n\r\npermitted   to   provide   advice  on  investment   products,\r\n\r\ndistribute  unit trusts and arrange life insurance  policies.\r\n\r\nFinancial advisers can choose which of these activities  they\r\n\r\nwish   to  engage  in  for  which  there  will  be  different\r\n\r\nrequirements  that must be met, such as passing  of  relevant\r\n\r\ncompetency examinations.  It is not the intention of the Bill\r\n\r\nto license only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  class of professionals providing comprehensive financial\r\n\r\nplanning advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for splitting the licence into distinct categories 1,\r\n\r\n2  and  3,  one  objective of the Bill is to respond  to  the\r\n\r\nindustry  trend of product convergence and the  emergence  of\r\n\r\ndistribution  channels which cross-sell investment  products.\r\n\r\nI think if we introduce different sub-categories of licences,\r\n\r\nwe are likely to confuse the public.  We propose to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  problem by requiring advisers to disclose what  products\r\n\r\nthey  are qualified or authorised to provide financial advice\r\n\r\non before they deal with the investing public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim expressed concern about competition and whether\r\n\r\nthere will be significant dislocation and, if so, whether  we\r\n\r\ncan help intermediaries who will be affected.  The impact  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and  convergence  of  financial  products  and\r\n\r\nservices  have  affected all financial services  sector  even\r\n\r\nbefore  the  introduction of this Bill.  The  life  insurance\r\n\r\nindustry,  as  I  told you, has subjected  itself  to  higher\r\n\r\nstandards  following the recommendations by the Committee  on\r\n\r\nEfficient  Distribution of Life Insurance earlier this  year.\r\n\r\nThese  recommendations are being implemented and will  result\r\n\r\nin  improved knowledge, skills and efficiency of the  agents.\r\n\r\nLife insurance agents will also benefit from a wider range of\r\n\r\nproducts  for distribution with the introduction  of  the  FA\r\n\r\nBill.    There   will   be  more  competition   and   perhaps\r\n\r\ndislocation.   There  will  also be  more  opportunities,  as\r\n\r\nintermediaries  can broaden their activities if  they  master\r\n\r\ntheir skills.  So, I do not expect significant dislocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for nurturing a group of independent financial\r\n\r\nadvisers, indeed the introduction of this Bill will  help  to\r\n\r\nfoster  the  development  of independent  financial  advisers\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  hope,  will provide greater  depth  to  the  local\r\n\r\nindustry,  alongside  the existing  players  in  the  market.\r\n\r\nThese  IFA  firms  are  likely to be owned  and  operated  by\r\n\r\nexperienced professionals.  In licensing such IFA firms,  MAS\r\n\r\nwill take into consideration the financial resources of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany   as  well  as  the  qualifications,  integrity   and\r\n\r\nexperience of the key officers.  The capital requirements for\r\n\r\na corporation applying for a Financial Adviser's licence will\r\n\r\nnot  be onerous and will be lower than existing requirements.\r\n\r\nThese new capital requirements for financial advisers do  not\r\n\r\nmean  that MAS is relaxing its prudential standards;  rather,\r\n\r\nit  is  another example of MAS' shift away from the one-size-fits-all regulatory approach to a more risk-based supervisory\r\n\r\nregime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.32 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments introduced in the Insurance (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill are necessary because of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, with the introduction of the Financial Advisers\r\n\r\nBill,  which  DPM has just moved the Second Reading  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  this  will  result  in the repeal  of  the  Insurance\r\n\r\nIntermediaries Act.  As a result, we need to migrate some  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of the Intermediaries Act to  the  Insurance\r\n\r\nAct.  These provisions are those that relate to all insurance\r\n\r\nagents,   non-life  insurance  brokers  and  all  reinsurance\r\n\r\nbrokers,  which  will  henceforth  be  regulated  under   the\r\n\r\nInsurance Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is to ensure that prudential standards are\r\n\r\nkept  current  and  appropriate  while,  at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nproviding  a conducive environment for growth and competition\r\n\r\nin the insurance industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is to update the Insurance Act in line with\r\n\r\nthe provisions in the other financial regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the migration of the\r\n\r\nIntermediaries Act provisions, in clause 20 of the Bill.  The\r\n\r\nprovisions,  inserted as Part IIB of the Act, will  generally\r\n\r\nremain  the same.  However, MAS has taken the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nmake  some changes for alignment with the Financial  Advisers\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes are:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Financial institutions acting as insurance agents\r\n\r\nwill  be  required  to  have  written  agreements  with   the\r\n\r\ninsurers,  to set out clearly the rights and responsibilities\r\n\r\nbetween these parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Financial institutions acting as insurance agents or\r\n\r\ninsurance brokers will be subject to the same market  conduct\r\n\r\nrules    and    standards   applicable   to   all   insurance\r\n\r\nintermediaries.  This is to align with the Financial Advisers\r\n\r\nAct and to ensure a level playing field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Insurance agents will no longer be allowed to retain\r\n\r\nthe  interest  earned from the moneys held in  the  insurance\r\n\r\nbrokers' premium accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Insurance brokers will no longer be allowed to grant\r\n\r\nunsecured  loans  or  advances to their directors,  and  such\r\n\r\nunsecured loans to their employees will be capped at $3,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MAS will be empowered to direct the removal of the\r\n\r\nCEOs  or  directors of an insurance broker, if these  persons\r\n\r\nfail  to  perform their duties and functions.   MAS  will  be\r\n\r\npermitted to create a register of these key personnel removed\r\n\r\nfrom office, as well as of other persons prohibited under the\r\n\r\nAct from becoming intermediaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. MAS' powers to prohibit or to direct any removal of\r\n\r\nkey  personnel, will be subject to a right of hearing as well\r\n\r\nas to a right of appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other amendments which are not\r\n\r\nconsequential to the Financial Advisers Bill.  For prudential\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry   development  reasons,  we  have   introduced   the\r\n\r\nfollowing amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, removing the exemption for credit insurers.\r\n\r\nClause  2 of the Bill removes the current statutory exemption\r\n\r\nfrom  registration  granted to an insurer that  is  primarily\r\n\r\nengaged in export credit business.  With the removal of  this\r\n\r\nexemption,  all  credit  insurers  will  be  required  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Insurance Act, and be subject  to  MAS'\r\n\r\nsupervision.   These insurers will have to  comply  with  all\r\n\r\nprudential  regulations, such as minimum paid-up capital  and\r\n\r\nsolvency margin requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, facilitating players like Lloyds to operate\r\n\r\nhere.   Clause 19 of the Bill inserts a new part of the  Act,\r\n\r\nPart  IIA,  to provide for the creation of schemes that  will\r\n\r\nallow  a  defined  group,  class or  association  of  foreign\r\n\r\ninsurers to be established in Singapore under the Scheme,  to\r\n\r\nunderwrite  insurance business.  Players such  as  Lloyds  of\r\n\r\nLondon,  which  is essentially an insurance marketplace  with\r\n\r\ninsurance  capacity  provided by members  who  are  organised\r\n\r\nannually  into syndicates, will then be permitted to  set  up\r\n\r\nsuch a scheme here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the insertion of Part IIA, section 34 will be\r\n\r\nrepealed and the current arrangements for Lloyds will be  re-created  as a Scheme under Part IIA, to be called the Lloyds'\r\n\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS would like Lloyds to go beyond the current\r\n\r\narrangements and, in fact, establish a physical  presence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  To permit this physical establishment,  a  second\r\n\r\nScheme,  called the Lloyds Asia Scheme, will be  set  up  and\r\n\r\nService Companies representing the underwriting syndicates of\r\n\r\nLloyds  will operate under this Scheme.  The added  insurance\r\n\r\ncapacity  from  these  syndicates  in  Singapore,   and   the\r\n\r\nexpertise  to  be brought in with the Service Companies  will\r\n\r\nenhance our market as a regional insurance centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, appointment of actuaries. This is covered in\r\n\r\nclause  22  of  the  Bill.   The appointed  Actuary  of  life\r\n\r\ninsurers currently certifies the financial condition  of  the\r\n\r\nlife insurer annually.  Non-life\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsurers   and   reinsurers  are  not  subject   to   similar\r\n\r\nrequirements at the moment.  This amendment will require non-life    insurers   and   reinsurers   to   obtain   actuarial\r\n\r\ncertification  of  their insurance liabilities  annually,  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the reserves maintained are sufficient  to  meet\r\n\r\nall  ultimate  liabilities.   These changes  are  made  after\r\n\r\nconsultation with the non-life insurance industry, and MAS is\r\n\r\nworking closely with industry representatives on the detailed\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, improving regulatory supervision. Clause 27\r\n\r\ninserts a new Part IIIA to provide for the mutual exchange of\r\n\r\nassistance  between regulators of different countries.   With\r\n\r\nthe growing internationalization of insurers and cross-border\r\n\r\nfinancial  services,  cooperation  and  information  exchange\r\n\r\nbetween  regulators of different jurisdictions  is  an  added\r\n\r\nadvantage  to achieve efficient supervision.  The  amendments\r\n\r\nwill   provide   a   framework   for   such   agreements   or\r\n\r\nunderstandings  to be given due effect, while ensuring  that,\r\n\r\nin the process, persons affected are given the due process of\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the final set of amendments which\r\n\r\nupdates  the Insurance Act and brings the provisions in  line\r\n\r\nwith the other financial regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill inserts new Part IIIB, providing\r\n\r\nfor  the  procedures to handle appeals to  the  Minister.   A\r\n\r\nright of hearing is currently provided, in both the Insurance\r\n\r\nAct and the Intermediaries Act, when the Authority intends to\r\n\r\ncancel an insurer's or a broker's registration.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  an  appeal  to  the High Court is provided  against  a\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Authority in relation to approval  of  key\r\n\r\npersonnel.   To streamline existing provisions, it  has  been\r\n\r\ndecided  that  a  right of hearing, plus an  appeal  process,\r\n\r\nshould  be  made available in relation to the exercise  of  a\r\n\r\ndiscretionary power by MAS, in respect of:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Cancellation of registration;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The removal of key personnel; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Prohibition from carrying on business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the appeal process more efficient, the amendment\r\n\r\nwill provide for the appeals to be made to the Minister,  who\r\n\r\nshall  convene an appropriate Advisory Committee of  relevant\r\n\r\nbut  independent appointees, to hear the appeal,  and  advise\r\n\r\nthe Minister accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 33, section 55 of the Act will be\r\n\r\namended to allow the MAS to compound offences to carry a fine\r\n\r\nonly as a penalty.  The power to compound will be limited  to\r\n\r\nsituations  where the offender has admitted the offence,  and\r\n\r\nhas  agreed,  in  writing, to have the fine compounded.   The\r\n\r\namendment  will reduce the administrative cost  of  enforcing\r\n\r\nthe  Act in circumstances where the offender has admitted the\r\n\r\noffence and agreed to pay the fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties imposed under the Act will also be\r\n\r\nincreased  to achieve a more appropriate level of  deterrence\r\n\r\ntoday.   At  the same time, the maximum fine for corporations\r\n\r\nwill  be  set  at twice that for individuals, as corporations\r\n\r\nhave more financial resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to clause 35 of the Bill, which gives\r\n\r\nour Courts jurisdiction to adjudicate on acts that take place\r\n\r\nextra-territorially.  The increased use of the  Internet  for\r\n\r\nsale   and  distribution  of  financial  products,  including\r\n\r\ninsurance,  has resulted in a situation where it is  possible\r\n\r\nfor  a  person outside Singapore to target sales at consumers\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  These acts, carried on externally, may have an\r\n\r\neffect in Singapore and could harm consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other clauses of the Bill that I have not elaborated on\r\n\r\nare  minor  technical  amendments to clarify  or  expand  the\r\n\r\nexisting provisions, or to remove obsolete provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Insurance\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill is introduced mainly because of  changes  to\r\n\r\nthe other Bills, ie, the SF Bill and the FA Bill,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  have just been passed by this House.  There  are  also\r\n\r\nother  measures on improving and updating the  regulation  of\r\n\r\nthe insurance industry, and these new rules are also welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to express my support for the Bill.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would  like  to ask the Minister  the  following\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, cost impact on the insurance industry. I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether the Bill will have an impact\r\n\r\non the operating and training costs to the insurance industry\r\n\r\narising  from  the several new requirements to  upgrade  this\r\n\r\nindustry.   For example, the Bill requires non-life insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  obtain  actuarial  certification   of   their\r\n\r\ninsurance  liabilities.   This is to  ensure  that  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  appropriate reserves to  meet  all  ultimate\r\n\r\nliabilities.  Would this requirement add to their costs?   As\r\n\r\nthe  intention  is to continuously upgrade the knowledge  and\r\n\r\nexpertise  of insurance agents and brokers, would the  higher\r\n\r\noperating costs also add to the companies' operating burden?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, under the division of the various\r\n\r\nfunctions  between  the  new legislation  where  direct  life\r\n\r\ninsurance  brokers will be governed under the  new  FA  Bill,\r\n\r\ncould  insurance companies also participate in the  financial\r\n\r\nadvisory and planning business?  If they could, would they be\r\n\r\ngoverned by the Financial Advisers Act as well?  And how does\r\n\r\nMAS ensure that insurance companies and their agents have the\r\n\r\nnecessary  competency to give financial  planning  advice  to\r\n\r\ntheir clients?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on interest income from insurance broking premium\r\n\r\naccount,  under  the  new Bill, the MAS will  prescribe  that\r\n\r\ninterest earned from insurance broking premium account should\r\n\r\nbe  distributed to insurers.  Previously, the interest can be\r\n\r\nretained   by  the  insurance  brokers.   This  has   enabled\r\n\r\ninsurance   brokers  to  quote  lower  and  more  competitive\r\n\r\ninsurance  premiums.   I  wonder  why  the  MAS  has  decided\r\n\r\nunilaterally  to dictate that interest earned should  now  be\r\n\r\ndistributed to the insurers, instead of being retained by the\r\n\r\ninsurance brokers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the register of prohibited persons, I understand that\r\n\r\nthe  MAS will keep a register of prohibited persons who would\r\n\r\nbe debarred from participation in the insurance business.   I\r\n\r\nam  concerned about easy accessibility of the public to  this\r\n\r\nregister,  as  that could be subject to abuse or  undesirable\r\n\r\nusage,  since  it is available for public inspection.   Could\r\n\r\nthe  Minister allay the public's fear on how the handling  of\r\n\r\nthe register would not be subject to abuse?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the impact on the insurance industry of risk\r\n\r\nexposure  caused  by terrorist attacks.  Sir,  on  a  general\r\n\r\nissue  relating to the insurance industry which could  be  of\r\n\r\npublic interest, I would like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nrecent  terrorist attacks on the World Trade  Centre  in  New\r\n\r\nYork  have  affected our insurance industry.  Are  our  local\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies  affected  and  exposed  to   the   huge\r\n\r\npotential  insurance claims arising from  this  incident?   I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether risks against terrorist attacks are insurable\r\n\r\nand,  if so, how would our local insurance industry deal with\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and  could  it give rise  to  higher  insurance\r\n\r\npremiums payable in the event of potential claims for damages\r\n\r\ncaused by acts of terrorists.  Of course, Sir, we do not hope\r\n\r\nthat there will be a terrorist attack in Singapore, but it is\r\n\r\nan area which we should look into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  Mr  Leong Horn Kee for supporting the Bill.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to respond to his questions.  First, on the cost impact\r\n\r\non  the insurance industry, let me assure the House that  one\r\n\r\nof  the objectives of putting this amendment in place  is  to\r\n\r\nmake   the  insurance  industry  more  competitive  and  cost\r\n\r\nimplication is one of the considerations high in  our  minds.\r\n\r\nAt   the   same  time,  we  do  need  to  enhance  prudential\r\n\r\nregulations.   So the example that Mr Leong  posed,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nrequirement   to   have   actuarial  certification   of   the\r\n\r\nliabilities,  we  consider  this  to  be  a  very   important\r\n\r\nprudential  requirement.   It should  not  add  to  the  cost\r\n\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the operation of the Financial Advisers Act\r\n\r\nand the Insurance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct, the whole idea is to align the two Acts together so that\r\n\r\nthe  requirements for the different intermediaries  operating\r\n\r\nunder  these two Acts would be the same, and the requirements\r\n\r\nwould  not  be onerous.  A life insurance broker, who  has  a\r\n\r\npermit  under the Financial Advisers Act, would not face  the\r\n\r\nadditional requirements because both Acts have been aligned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question on interest income from premium\r\n\r\naccounts.  If you look at it logically, when somebody buys an\r\n\r\ninsurance policy and pays a premium, that premium is actually\r\n\r\ndue to the insurer and should not be kept by the broker.  But\r\n\r\nthe current rules allow the broker to hold the premium during\r\n\r\nthe  transition period, and in fact, keep the interest income\r\n\r\nfrom the premium during this transition period.  This is  not\r\n\r\ndesirable because then it incentivises the broker to hold  on\r\n\r\nto the premium for a much longer time and enjoy the interest.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  changes  that we put into  this  Bill  are  to\r\n\r\nregularise this, so that when somebody pays a premium  for  a\r\n\r\npolicy,  that  premium  should go  to  the  insurer  and  the\r\n\r\ninterest that comes from the premium should go to the insurer\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also raised the point about the register of\r\n\r\nprohibited  persons.  I would like to assure the  House  that\r\n\r\nalthough  we  allow access to this register,  this  would  be\r\n\r\nrestricted.   It would not be open to public  scrutiny.   The\r\n\r\nway we would operate it is that anybody who intends to employ\r\n\r\nsomebody, whether as a director, an employee or as a  broker,\r\n\r\ncan  come  to  MAS  and query whether  such  a  person  is  a\r\n\r\nprohibited  person.  Therefore, the register is not  intended\r\n\r\nfor  public scrutiny, but it is for somebody to check whether\r\n\r\nthat person has been under prohibition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about the impact on the insurance\r\n\r\nindustry  arising  from the terrorist attacks  on  the  World\r\n\r\nTrade  Centre.   MAS is monitoring the impact.   Our  initial\r\n\r\nassessment is that Singapore-based insurers do not  have  any\r\n\r\nknown  direct  exposure  to  the  losses  arising  from   the\r\n\r\nterrorist attacks.  Singapore-based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreinsurers  have minimal exposure to US risks as their  major\r\n\r\nmarkets  are  in  the Asia Pacific region.   So,  our  direct\r\n\r\nimpact is minimal.  The main impact would be indirect.  First\r\n\r\nof  all, weaknesses experienced by parent offices and foreign\r\n\r\nreinsurers  may give rise to negative spill-over  effects  on\r\n\r\nlocal  operations.   Secondly,  as  Singapore  insurers  rely\r\n\r\nheavily  on  reinsurance support, they may be affected  by  a\r\n\r\nreduction   or   even  cancellation  of  reinsurance   cover,\r\n\r\nrestricted  coverages and higher premium charges.   Mr  Leong\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  because of the risk from  such  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks, the premium for reinsurance is likely to go up.  And\r\n\r\nthis is one of the indirect consequences that Singapore would\r\n\r\nhave to face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is also paying close attention to the claim\r\n\r\nsituation and solvency position of local insurance companies.\r\n\r\nWhile  there  has  been  no  immediate  concern  about  their\r\n\r\nliability risk, we are closely monitoring the asset  position\r\n\r\nof  insurance companies, including life insurance, given  the\r\n\r\ndecline of the equities markets and the other assets markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  beg  to  move, \"That the Bill be now read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is essentially a law reform measure,\r\n\r\nwhat  I would call lawyer's law.  It is to reform the law  by\r\n\r\nmaking  provision  for  enforcement of contractual  terms  by\r\n\r\nthird parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of background, let me say that, at present, under\r\n\r\nthe general principle of law, a person who is not a party  to\r\n\r\na  contract has no legal right to enforce the contract,  even\r\n\r\nif the contracting parties intended the contract to confer  a\r\n\r\nbenefit on him.  This principle is known as the \"third  party\r\n\r\nrule\".  For example, under the third party rule, a person who\r\n\r\nbought  a house on the resale market will have no contractual\r\n\r\nrecourse  against the housing developer for  defects  in  the\r\n\r\nhouse even though the developer had contractually agreed with\r\n\r\nthe  original  purchaser to confer a  benefit  on  subsequent\r\n\r\npurchasers.   This  is because, unlike a  person  who  bought\r\n\r\ndirect  from  the developer, the resale buyer has  no  direct\r\n\r\ncontractual   relationship  with  the   developer.    Another\r\n\r\ninstance is where a couple is getting married, and a relative\r\n\r\ngoes  to  a  shop  where a wedding list is  kept,  buys  them\r\n\r\nwhatever  gift,  a  dining table or sofa set,  as  a  wedding\r\n\r\npresent  and arranges to have it delivered directly to  them.\r\n\r\nIt  is made clear in the discussions with the shop that holds\r\n\r\nthe  list that the item is a gift for the couple.  Under  the\r\n\r\nthird  party  rule,  the couple would not have  any  recourse\r\n\r\nagainst  the  shop,  because they were  not  parties  to  the\r\n\r\ncontract.  Any action against the shop for breach of contract\r\n\r\nwould  have  to be taken by the relative who was one  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal contracting parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherited this third party rule from England and it\r\n\r\nforms  part  of  the  law of contract.  The  United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nhowever,   itself   has  modified  the  third   party   rule.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Law  Reform and  Revision  Division  of  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers reviewed the third party rule  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  has recommended this amending law  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this reform, Singapore's law will then be in line\r\n\r\nwith  developments in other advanced economies of the  world,\r\n\r\nincluding  the leading international financial centres,  such\r\n\r\nas New York and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon.   The  \"third party rule\" has already been  abrogated\r\n\r\nthroughout much of the common law world; in countries such as\r\n\r\nthe  United States, New Zealand, parts of Australia and, most\r\n\r\nrecently,  in  the UK.  Most member states  of  the  European\r\n\r\nUnion  also  recognise and enforce the rights of third  party\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries under contracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reform is clearly needed as it enables\r\n\r\ncarrying  out the intention of contracting parties to  confer\r\n\r\nbenefits  on  third  parties.  The third party  rule,  as  it\r\n\r\nstands,  causes  injustice  to a third  party  who  may  have\r\n\r\nreasonable  expectations about his rights under the  contract\r\n\r\nand, for example, may have arranged his affairs accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third party rule has led to many ad hoc statutory\r\n\r\nand  common  law  exceptions to circumvent  the  inconvenient\r\n\r\neffects  of  the  third  party rule.   It  has  also  led  to\r\n\r\ncomplicated legal documentation and consequently higher legal\r\n\r\ncosts.  In the example I gave earlier, to overcome the effect\r\n\r\nof the third party rule, additional legal documentation, such\r\n\r\nas  an assignment of rights, a collateral warranty or a  deed\r\n\r\nof  indemnity, would have to be effected.  All these and  the\r\n\r\nresulting  litigation  cause  legal  uncertainty  and  it  is\r\n\r\ncommercially not convenient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This law reform Bill will facilitate business and\r\n\r\ncontractual  practice by providing a simple  method  to  give\r\n\r\nthird  parties rights to enforce a contract.  It will  bring,\r\n\r\nin  my  view,  certainty to the law and help to  lower  legal\r\n\r\ncosts incurred by business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now turn to the provisions of the Bill, the\r\n\r\nprovisions   are  essentially  modelled  after   the   United\r\n\r\nKingdom's Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, which came\r\n\r\ninto   force  in  November  1999.   It  provides  a  detailed\r\n\r\nlegislative scheme spelling out when a third party will  have\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  enforce a contract and how  a  third  party's\r\n\r\nrights can be exercised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill provides that a third party would\r\n\r\nhave the right to enforce a term of a contract in one of  two\r\n\r\nsituations:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, where the contract says so expressly; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where the term purports to confer a benefit on\r\n\r\nthe  third  party unless, on a proper interpretation  of  the\r\n\r\ncontract,  the contracting parties did not intend  the  third\r\n\r\nparty to have the right to enforce it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, paragraph (3), provides that the third party\r\n\r\nmust  be expressly identified in the contract by name,  class\r\n\r\nor  description.  However, there is no requirement  that  the\r\n\r\nthird party should be in existence when the contract is made.\r\n\r\nThis  allows  contracting parties,  for  example,  to  confer\r\n\r\nenforceable rights on an unborn child or a future spouse or a\r\n\r\ncompany that has not yet been incorporated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides that the parties to a contract lose\r\n\r\ntheir  right  to vary the contract without the consent  of  a\r\n\r\nthird party beneficiary if:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the third party has communicated his assent of\r\n\r\nthe term to the promisor; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the third party has relied on the term, and\r\n\r\nthe promisor is either aware of the third party's reliance on\r\n\r\nit;  or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that  the\r\n\r\nthird party would rely on the term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that any defence which the promisor\r\n\r\ncan  use against a claim by the other contracting party  will\r\n\r\nalso be usable against a claim by a third party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 preserves the right of the contracting parties\r\n\r\nto  sue  each  other  on  the contract,  notwithstanding  the\r\n\r\nexistence of third party rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 protects the promisor from double liability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out a list of subject matter to which the\r\n\r\nBill will not apply.  The list includes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts of employment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negotiable instruments;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts for carriage of goods by sea covered by the\r\n\r\nBills of Lading Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts for carriage of goods by air covered by the\r\n\r\nCarriage by Air Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts for international carriage of goods by land\r\n\r\nwhich are covered by such international conventions as may be\r\n\r\nprescribed by the Minister; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts formed among a company and members of a\r\n\r\ncompany  as  a  result  of  the memorandum  and  articles  of\r\n\r\nassociations of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, contracts of employment are excluded so that\r\n\r\nemployees who breach their duties to their employers will not\r\n\r\nbe exposed to law suits from their employers' customers.  The\r\n\r\ncustomer's  remedy  should be against the employer,  not  the\r\n\r\nemployee.   The  other categories are excluded because  these\r\n\r\nare  areas  of  laws where clear and established  rules  have\r\n\r\nalready  emerged concerning the rights of third  parties  and\r\n\r\nthe limitation to such rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards commencement, let me say that the Bill will\r\n\r\ncome  into  operation in two stages.  During  the  first  six\r\n\r\nmonths of its operation, the new law will apply to a contract\r\n\r\nonly  if the parties expressly opt into the new regime.  This\r\n\r\nwill  change to an opt-out regime after six months.  The six-month  phasing-in period will ensure that parties who are  in\r\n\r\nthe midst of negotiating contracts are not taken unawares  by\r\n\r\nthe  new law.  It will also allow time for publicity  on  the\r\n\r\nnew  law to reach various sectors, the legal profession,  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community and the public.  In the meantime,  having\r\n\r\nan  opt-in  regime  during the first six  months  will  allow\r\n\r\ncontracting parties who wish to take advantage of the new law\r\n\r\nto do so immediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me say that in the drafting of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  feedback  from  various  agencies  such  as  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Finance, the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety  as well as leading academics and practitioners  were\r\n\r\nsought.  Parties consulted were generally supportive  of  the\r\n\r\nBill,   and   felt  that  the  change  was  a  positive   and\r\n\r\ncommercially progressive one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  with your leave, may I firstly say that it is an honour\r\n\r\nand  a  privilege for me to be chosen to serve as a Nominated\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the Contracts (Rights of Third\r\n\r\nParties)  Bill.  This Bill is to be welcomed as  it  protects\r\n\r\nthird parties in certain instances, as the Hon. Minister  has\r\n\r\nindicated,  even  though there may not be what  is  known  as\r\n\r\nprivity  of contract (or agreement) between the parties,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe parties were not originally parties to the agreement.  On\r\n\r\na proper construction, may I just clarify that I take it that\r\n\r\nthis Bill covers both written contracts and oral, or what  is\r\n\r\nknown  as  verbal contracts, so that that point is  clarified\r\n\r\nand  members  of  the  public would be fully  aware  that  it\r\n\r\napplies to all contracts, and not just to written contracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, Sir, I think the provisions in this\r\n\r\nBill  are  to be welcomed, as indicated by the Minister.   It\r\n\r\nwould  save, in many ways, legal costs and also documentation\r\n\r\nthat   might  be  required  if  third  parties  are  involved\r\n\r\nsubsequently, in terms of assignments of contractual  rights.\r\n\r\nI  take  it  that in this situation, it is only the  benefits\r\n\r\nthat  are  passed on, and not the burdens of a contract  that\r\n\r\napplies to the original parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, although there are, as indicated, other\r\n\r\njurisdictions that have this particular kind of law, would it\r\n\r\nbe   proper   for  me  to  suggest  also,  for  purposes   of\r\n\r\nparliamentarians to consider some of the Bills  as  presented\r\n\r\nto  Parliament, that there would be access to information and\r\n\r\nmaterial that are prepared by various Ministries to  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  also to those parliamentarians who are  interested\r\n\r\nin  having access to them, except perhaps on sensitive pieces\r\n\r\nof  legislation where sensitive information is made available\r\n\r\nto the Minister or to the Minister of State, for instance, on\r\n\r\nDefence matters perhaps.  If so, parliamentarians would  have\r\n\r\naccess to this research that is probably thoroughly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  by  Permanent Secretaries from various  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nlegal  officers and senior officers of the relevant Ministry.\r\n\r\nAnd  if that is so, it will give a more positive approach  to\r\n\r\nus parliamentarians also doing research and contributing in a\r\n\r\nbetter fashion in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I do support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of some business and consumer transactions\r\n\r\ncan be quite complicated involving several parties.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  transactions involve significant amounts of money  and\r\n\r\nlong-term  warranties on the product.  It  is  fair  that  we\r\n\r\ngrant  protection to third parties in a transaction, and  not\r\n\r\njust to the original parties who signed the contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while, promisors have been shielded by the rule\r\n\r\nof  privity  of  contracts when the issue  involves  a  third\r\n\r\nparty.   For example, property developers have been  shielded\r\n\r\nby  this  rule  from  resale property  buyers.   And  certain\r\n\r\nhousehold appliance suppliers have been shielded by this rule\r\n\r\nfrom  third  party  consumers.  In  the  interest  of  making\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  consumer transactions fairer, it is  therefore\r\n\r\nappropriate  that  we enact this Bill.  In  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nbringing  our  law to be in line with developments  in  other\r\n\r\nadvanced  economies  and  leading financial  centres,  it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate that we enact this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two clarifications that I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to respond.   The Minister has  clarified  the\r\n\r\nrationale  for allowing a time lag in applying the  Bill,  as\r\n\r\nstated  in  clause 1(2).  The Bill applies to contracts  made\r\n\r\nmore than six months after the commencement of the Bill, with\r\n\r\nthe  exception  of contracts made within six  months  of  the\r\n\r\ncommencement  of the Bill, which expressly provides  for  the\r\n\r\napplication of the Bill.  However, if we agree to  the  merit\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill,  I  would  have  thought  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\npreferable to apply it straightaway, rather than wait for six\r\n\r\nmonths for it to take effect.  I also would have thought that\r\n\r\nit would be more confusing to have a provision to allow, by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexception,   contracts  made  within  six   months   of   the\r\n\r\ncommencement  of the Bill to grant third party  rights  where\r\n\r\nthe  term  of contract provides for the Bill to apply.   Does\r\n\r\nthis  mean  that during the six-month period, the law  grants\r\n\r\ncertain  people who have knowledge of it the right  of  third\r\n\r\nparties and disadvantaging others?  May I seek the Minister's\r\n\r\nfurther clarification on this point, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, under clause 2(2) of the Bill, third\r\n\r\nparty rights shall not apply if, on a proper construction  of\r\n\r\nthe  contract, it appears that the parties did not intend the\r\n\r\nterm  to  be  enforceable by third party.  This clause  gives\r\n\r\nsome  flexibility for the promisor and promisee not to confer\r\n\r\nthird party rights.  I believe that this proviso may be valid\r\n\r\nunder  certain circumstances.  But it can be a  loophole  for\r\n\r\nthe  promisor  to  include as a fine print in  the  contract,\r\n\r\nespecially  if the promisee is ignorant of the  relevance  of\r\n\r\nthird  party  rights.  Hence, I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether third party rights can be enforced  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes  for  some  transactions,  making  it  irrelevant   for\r\n\r\ncontracts  to  expressly state otherwise.  These transactions\r\n\r\nthat  will  grant  compulsory third party  rights  should  be\r\n\r\ncontracts  involving substantial value, such as property  and\r\n\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis for my suggestion is that, too often,\r\n\r\nconsumers  are  ignorant of what is in  the  agreement.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  for  most  first-hand property buyers,  their  main\r\n\r\nconcern would be the location, the value, the finishing,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   Whether the contract conferred the right  to  third\r\n\r\nparty  or  not  is likely to be of a much lesser  concern  to\r\n\r\nthem.  It may not be something that they would pay particular\r\n\r\nattention  to.  After all, a typical agreement  for  consumer\r\n\r\ntransaction,  such  as  property and cars,  is  usually  very\r\n\r\nlengthy  and couched in terms that would test one's  patience\r\n\r\nin  trying to understand it fully.  It is possible for  these\r\n\r\nproperty buyers to miss the fine print in the agreement  that\r\n\r\nexpressly takes away third party rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I suggest that for transactions involving a\r\n\r\nsubstantial amount, we should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotect  consumers who are ignorant of third party rights  by\r\n\r\nmaking third party rights compulsory.  My concern is that  no\r\n\r\nmatter  how  we  try  to educate the public  on  third  party\r\n\r\nrights, there will still be some who may not be aware of  it.\r\n\r\nThe  law  should  still  seek to protect  those  unsuspecting\r\n\r\nconsumers  from promisors who delete the third  party  rights\r\n\r\nfrom  the contract, especially if the transaction involves  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial amount of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two clarifications which I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister to respond to us, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Noris\r\n\r\nOng  for  their support of the Bill and I will  turn  to  the\r\n\r\ncomments that they have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a general point was made by Mr Chandra Mohan as\r\n\r\nto  whether parliamentarians could have access to information\r\n\r\nor  materials which the relevant Ministries may have, on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  which  Bills and amendments are proposed  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  Let me say that it has always been the approach of my\r\n\r\nCabinet colleagues and myself that where Members request  for\r\n\r\nsuch information, we will be happy to consider it.  But it is\r\n\r\nbest  that  specific  requests  be  made  according  to   the\r\n\r\nparticular  issue  that  is  before  the  House  because  the\r\n\r\nMinistry may have a whole array of files and papers  and  the\r\n\r\nMember concerned may be interested in one particular part  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  And if he can tailor the request accordingly, I am\r\n\r\nsure   the  Ministry  will  be  happy  to  oblige.   In  this\r\n\r\nparticular case, the basic materials and research  were  done\r\n\r\nby  the  Law  Reform and Revision Division of  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers and they produced most of  the  essential\r\n\r\nresearch  work.  And if the Member is interested, I  will  be\r\n\r\nhappy to furnish him with a copy of that report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised one substantive point and that is to seek\r\n\r\nclarification whether the Bill only covers written  contracts\r\n\r\nor  would  it  also cover oral contracts.  To that,  I  would\r\n\r\nrespond  by saying that the Bill does not distinguish between\r\n\r\noral   contracts  and  written  contracts,  and   by   normal\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the word \"contract\", it would also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninclude oral contracts, granted that some of the requirements\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill  may  be  more easily fulfilled  by  a  written\r\n\r\ncontract than an oral contract.  But I should think  that  it\r\n\r\nis  not impossible for an oral contract to meet them.  And if\r\n\r\nan oral contract were to meet the requirements, then the Bill\r\n\r\nwould  apply.  Indeed, Sir, examples which were given in  the\r\n\r\nreport  of the United Kingdom Law Reform Commission indicated\r\n\r\nthat even there, the Law Commission envisaged application  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  law  to  oral  contract and examples  included  the\r\n\r\npurchase of wedding gifts in a department store.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong has raised at least two points to which I\r\n\r\nshould  respond.   First,  the  six-month  period.   Let   me\r\n\r\nclarify, Sir, first, that the six-month period does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  parties who wish to benefit would actually have to wait\r\n\r\nfor  six  months.  I hope my Second Reading  speech  made  it\r\n\r\nclear that it really provides for a two-stage process for the\r\n\r\nnew  law  to  come  into operation.  During the  initial  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  parties  who  wish  to  benefit  from  the  new  law\r\n\r\nimmediately  can  expressly opt into the  new  law  and  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of it.  This phasing-in period actually is to allow\r\n\r\ntime for lawyers and the public to be educated about the  new\r\n\r\nlaw so that there will be less risk of confusion once the new\r\n\r\nlaw comes completely into force after the phasing-in period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add also that the United Kingdom also adopted\r\n\r\nthis  six-month phasing-in period, and I am not aware of  any\r\n\r\nnegative consequences or effects from that approach.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  it occurs to me that even if we did not have the  six-month  period written into the Bill, I think we  would  still\r\n\r\nhave  to  provide for sufficient time before the commencement\r\n\r\nof  the Bill for the lawyers and other sectors of society  to\r\n\r\nfamiliarise themselves with the new law.  If we  did  not  so\r\n\r\nprovide,  I think there will be some inconvenience.   Lawyers\r\n\r\nwho are ready to take advantage of this new law, for example,\r\n\r\nin  preparing  corporate finance instruments, would  then  be\r\n\r\nforced to wait.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns Mr Noris Ong's comment that\r\n\r\nthis rule ought to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  obligatory or mandatory for certain types of  important\r\n\r\ncontracts,  like  purchase  of  property  and  cars.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant for me to stress and clarify that this Bill is  not\r\n\r\nintended  to be a consumer protection measure.   That  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant point.  Although I can see that some, including  Mr\r\n\r\nNoris  Ong,  may  see  the benefits for some  consumers,  the\r\n\r\npurport  of  this  law is not a consumer protection  measure.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose  is  not  to  impose liabilities  on  businesses\r\n\r\nagainst their wishes.  What then is the purpose?  The purpose\r\n\r\nis really to meet the needs of parties who contractually wish\r\n\r\nto confer rights on third parties but find it inconvenient or\r\n\r\nnot possible to do so under the existing law.  So the new law\r\n\r\nis  to  give  them a convenient way or method to achieve  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  conferring rights to third parties.   If  the\r\n\r\ncontracting party has no intention to confer rights on  third\r\n\r\nparties,  then  we  would  not want to  force  an  unintended\r\n\r\nconsequence on unwilling parties.  In other words, the  basic\r\n\r\nprinciple  is  to  give  effect  to  the  intention  of   the\r\n\r\ncontracting parties.  And that principle of giving effect  to\r\n\r\nthe  intention of contracting parties is a cardinal principle\r\n\r\nin  the law of contract.  So, it would be difficult for me to\r\n\r\naccept  the  proposal of Mr Noris Ong because it  would  mean\r\n\r\ndeparting  from that cardinal principle.  It also means  that\r\n\r\nthe  legislation will interfere with the parties' freedom  to\r\n\r\ncontract.   I  hope  my  explanations  have  clarified  these\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumar].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper  for today be exempted at this day's sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>3.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

Section 85 of the main Act requires\r\n\r\nall complaints against lawyers to be made to the Law Society.\r\n\r\nThe  Council or the Society is to forward every complaint  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Inquiry Panel for him to form an Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittee to look into the complaint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1986, the Council could only refer to the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Inquiry Panel those complaints relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of a lawyer in his professional capacity.   The\r\n\r\nCouncil  therefore weeded out those complaints which did  not\r\n\r\nrelate to a lawyer's professional conduct.  In 1986, the  Act\r\n\r\nwas  amended to allow any complaints relating to any  conduct\r\n\r\nof  a  lawyer, not just conduct in his professional capacity.\r\n\r\nThis was because, sometimes, misconduct by a lawyer, even  in\r\n\r\nhis  private capacity, may be sufficient to render him  unfit\r\n\r\nto continue being a member of the honourable profession.  The\r\n\r\nCouncil  thereafter acted on the assumption that they  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  play  a sifting role in the  post-1986  regime.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year that the\r\n\r\nCouncil should not be performing such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  sifting function, but should simply forward all complaints\r\n\r\nto be dealt with by the Inquiry Committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not practical and has resulted in some\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   The  Law  Society  receives  more  than   100\r\n\r\ncomplaints  a  year.   More than half  of  them  are  without\r\n\r\nsubstance  and  are  sifted out by  the  Council,  while  the\r\n\r\nremainder  goes to an Inquiry Committee for a  full  inquiry.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Council is not to sift, the caseload on the  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittees will more than double.  Each Inquiry Committee  is\r\n\r\nmade  up  of  two lawyers of at least 12 years'  standing,  a\r\n\r\nLegal  Service  Officer of at least 10 years'  experience  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  a lay person.  Doubling the caseload of the Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittees  will create a serious strain on scarce  resources\r\n\r\nand  slow  down  the disciplinary process.  Therefore  a  new\r\n\r\nmachinery known as the Review Committee will be set up to act\r\n\r\nas a sifting mechanism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Review Committee will have two members. One will\r\n\r\nbe  a  lawyer of at least 12 years' standing.  The other will\r\n\r\nbe  a  Legal Officer of at least 10 years' experience.  Under\r\n\r\nthe new arrangement, the Council will forward every complaint\r\n\r\nto  the  Chairman  of the Inquiry Panel who  will  convene  a\r\n\r\nReview  Committee.  The Review Committee will have two  weeks\r\n\r\nto  decide  whether  there  is sufficient  substance  in  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint to warrant an inquiry by an Inquiry Committee.  The\r\n\r\nReview Committee does not have a blank cheque to dismiss  any\r\n\r\ncase.  Its mandate is limited.  It can only dismiss a case if\r\n\r\nboth  members  of the Committee agree that the  complaint  is\r\n\r\nfrivolous,  vexatious, misconceived or lacking in  substance.\r\n\r\nIf  either one of the Committee members feels that  there  is\r\n\r\nsome substance to the complaint, the case must proceed to  an\r\n\r\nInquiry  Committee.  This new arrangement seeks to  carefully\r\n\r\nbalance  the  need to have an efficient disciplinary  process\r\n\r\nand the need to ensure that every complaint is looked into as\r\n\r\nthoroughly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 16 removes the cap on the number of lawyers\r\n\r\nand  lay persons which can be appointed to the Inquiry Panel.\r\n\r\nThis is the panel from which members of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Inquiry  Committees and the Disciplinary Committees  are\r\n\r\nchosen.  Currently, there is a maximum of 40 lawyers  and  40\r\n\r\nlay  persons.   Experience has shown  that  this  number  can\r\n\r\nsometimes  be  insufficient.  To ensure that the disciplinary\r\n\r\nsystem  retains sufficient flexibility to deal with  changing\r\n\r\ncaseload  in a timely manner, it is proposed that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice  be given the flexibility to appoint as many  lawyers\r\n\r\nand lay persons to the Inquiry Panel as may be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, section 90 of the Act says that the Chairman\r\n\r\nof a Disciplinary Committee is to be appointed from a pool of\r\n\r\nnot  more than five senior lawyers.  This means that  we  can\r\n\r\nonly    have   five   Disciplinary   Committees   functioning\r\n\r\nconcurrently  at any one time.  Clause 19 removes  this  cap,\r\n\r\nfor the same reasons of flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21, Sir, amends section 93 of the Act to allow a\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Committee to recommend that a lawyer be  ordered\r\n\r\nto  pay  a  monetary penalty.  This is really to  correct  an\r\n\r\nanomaly in the current process.  At present, after an Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittee makes a report to the Council, the Council can make\r\n\r\none  of  four recommendations - (1) to send the matter  to  a\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  Committee  for  a  formal  investigation,   (2)\r\n\r\ndismiss  the  complaint,  (3) dispose  of  the  complaint  by\r\n\r\nreprimanding  the lawyer, or (4) dispose of the complaint  by\r\n\r\nordering the lawyer to pay a monetary penalty.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nInquiry  Committee stage.  But at the end of the Disciplinary\r\n\r\nCommittee  process,  the  Council  can  only  (1)   make   an\r\n\r\napplication to the court to strike off or suspend the lawyer,\r\n\r\n(2) dismiss the complaint, or (3) dispose of the complaint by\r\n\r\nreprimanding  the  lawyer.  The option  of  monetary  penalty\r\n\r\nwhich  is  available at the Inquiry Committee  stage  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing made available at the Disciplinary Committee stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related amendment, Sir, all penalties which lawyers\r\n\r\nare ordered by the Council to pay as a result of disciplinary\r\n\r\nproceedings go to the Consolidated Fund.  The Law Society has\r\n\r\nrecently  asked  the Government to allow the Law  Society  to\r\n\r\nretain  the penalties paid by lawyers, in order that the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  these  moneys for worthy causes, such as  promoting  law\r\n\r\nawareness,  providing  legal aid or  assistance.   They  have\r\n\r\npointed   out  that  other  professional  bodies,   such   as\r\n\r\naccountants,  architects and engineers are similarly  allowed\r\n\r\nto  retain  the penalties paid by their members  pursuant  to\r\n\r\ndisciplinary proceedings.  The Government has considered this\r\n\r\nand  agreed  to  the request, and clause 23 therefore  amends\r\n\r\nsection 95 for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amendments have also been made to provide for more\r\n\r\ntransparency to the disciplinary process.  Clause  21  amends\r\n\r\nsection  93  to  require  the findings  of  all  Disciplinary\r\n\r\nCommittees  to  be  published either  in  the  Singapore  Law\r\n\r\nGazette  or  in such other medium as would adequately  inform\r\n\r\nthe  public  of  the findings of the Committees.   Clause  18\r\n\r\namends   section  88  to  require  the  publication  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment Gazette of all orders by the Council to  a  lawyer\r\n\r\nto  pay  penalty.   Currently, only orders to  pay  penalties\r\n\r\nexceeding  $1,000  have  to be published  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nGazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Legal Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to some amendments concerning the Board of\r\n\r\nLegal Education and the qualifications for practising law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 5 to allow the Board of Legal\r\n\r\nEducation to make rules requiring pupils to keep dining terms\r\n\r\nbefore  they  can  be admitted to the Bar.   The  keeping  of\r\n\r\ndining  terms will provide an additional avenue for imparting\r\n\r\nthe  values  and  tradition of the legal  profession  through\r\n\r\nsocial  interaction with senior members of the Bar and  also,\r\n\r\nthrough interaction, to pick up relevant social skills needed\r\n\r\nfor a successful legal practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 7 to widen the Board's\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to  recognise as qualified persons  lawyers  who,\r\n\r\nalthough not graduates from universities recognised  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  admission  to the Singapore  Bar,  nevertheless\r\n\r\npossess  such qualifications or expertise as would contribute\r\n\r\nto, promote or enhance the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality  of  legal services in Singapore or the economic  and\r\n\r\ntechnological development of Singapore.  This amendment is to\r\n\r\ngive  effect  to a recommendation of the Second Committee  on\r\n\r\nSupply  of Lawyers that we should empower the Board to  admit\r\n\r\npersons  who  possess  such  skills  and  expertise  as   the\r\n\r\nSingapore legal profession needs.  The Second Committee  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the  current  wording of section 7  was  overly  tight,\r\n\r\nresulting in only a small handful qualifying under it in  the\r\n\r\nlast five years.  While the new section 7 will allow more  to\r\n\r\nqualify, I wish to stress, Sir, that this is not meant to  be\r\n\r\nused  as  a backdoor to enter the Singapore legal profession.\r\n\r\nThe  Board  will be vigilant in ensuring that the quality  of\r\n\r\nentrants to the legal profession is at the high standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the widened discretion in section 7, the\r\n\r\nSecond  Committee  on  Supply  of  Lawyers  also  recommended\r\n\r\nallowing  the  Board  wider powers to  grant  exemption  from\r\n\r\npupillage.  Currently, the Board can only grant exemption for\r\n\r\nup  to  three months' pupillage.  The wider exemption  powers\r\n\r\nwill  allow the Board to better take into account the varying\r\n\r\nlevels  of  experience of persons seeking  admission  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Bar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these increased roles being given to the Board, two\r\n\r\namendments  touching on the administration of the  Board  are\r\n\r\nalso  being  proposed.  First, clause 4 amends section  8  to\r\n\r\nmake the President of the Law Society an ex-officio member of\r\n\r\nthe  Board of Legal Education.  The Attorney-General and  the\r\n\r\nDean of the Law Faculty, NUS, are already ex-officio members.\r\n\r\nSir,  the President of the Law Society has also traditionally\r\n\r\nalways been appointed to the Board.  Putting it into law that\r\n\r\nthe  President is an ex-officio member would signify a formal\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the important role played by the Law  Society\r\n\r\nin  its  work of the Board.  Second, section 5 is amended  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  Board's powers to invest its funds,  including\r\n\r\nallowing  the  Board  to lend money to law  firms  to  pursue\r\n\r\nprojects which the Board finds worthy of its support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Limited Purpose Practising Certificates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next group of amendments, Sir, deals with special\r\n\r\ncategories of persons who can be issued with limited  purpose\r\n\r\npractising  certificates notwithstanding that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nactually practising law as a member of a law firm.  Clause  7\r\n\r\namends section 26 of the Act to allow the Attorney-General to\r\n\r\nissue  limited  purpose practising certificates  to  a  legal\r\n\r\nofficer  of a foreign government to appear in our  courts  to\r\n\r\nrepresent their governments on certain matters.  Sir, let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  that this amendment is mainly meant for  cases  like\r\n\r\nextradition  cases and proceedings for taking of evidence  in\r\n\r\nour  courts  under  the schemes for mutual legal  assistance.\r\n\r\nAllowing legal officers of foreign governments to participate\r\n\r\ndirectly in appropriate cases can indeed speed up proceedings\r\n\r\nand free up our prosecutors to handle other work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 26 is also amended to enable law lecturers from\r\n\r\nNUS  and  other institutions of higher learning in  Singapore\r\n\r\n(who  are  advocates and solicitors) to appear in  court,  if\r\n\r\nthey  have a certificate from the Attorney-General  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  This amendment, Sir, is intended mainly to cater to\r\n\r\ncases  where  the  law  lecturer has  been  instructed  by  a\r\n\r\npractising  lawyer, or where the law lecturer is  invited  by\r\n\r\nthe  court  to  assist on a particular issue.  The  Attorney-General's certificate will only be issued to those  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  employed as a member of the academic staff by  the  law\r\n\r\ndepartment of any institution of higher learning in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  at  least  three continuous years (unless the  Attorney-General shortens the period).  Sir, this proposal would allow\r\n\r\nthe law lecturers to enhance their skills which in turn would\r\n\r\nbenefit their students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For consistency, section 34(h) of the Act, which\r\n\r\npresently  applies only to a law lecturer of the Law  Faculty\r\n\r\nof  the NUS, is amended by clause 10 of the Bill to extend to\r\n\r\nall  law  lecturers  of institutions of  higher  learning  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  would  enable them  to  render  any  legal\r\n\r\nopinion  or  act  in an advisory capacity.   Again,  this  is\r\n\r\nintended  to  be  limited to only matters in  which  the  law\r\n\r\nlecturer has been instructed by an advocate and solicitor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments Concerning Law Society's Operations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final group of amendments consists mainly of\r\n\r\nhousekeeping amendments to improve the administration of  the\r\n\r\nLaw  Society.  Clause 15 amends section 51 to make  provision\r\n\r\nfor electronic voting in Council elections, to exempt the Law\r\n\r\nSociety  members who are overseas from having to comply  with\r\n\r\nthe compulsory voting requirements.  Clause 13 amends section\r\n\r\n48  to  allow  the  Council to co-opt more members  into  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.    The  Law  Society  requested  this  because  many\r\n\r\nlawyers  are willing and prepared to volunteer their time  to\r\n\r\nhelp  out with the work of the Council but they are unwilling\r\n\r\nto  campaign  for  election  into  the  Council.   Clause  12\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the Law Society to take in as non-practitioner\r\n\r\nmembers   foreign  lawyers  working  in  offshore  firms   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Clause 28 allows the Law Society to intervene  in\r\n\r\na  lawyer's  practice in two additional instances to  protect\r\n\r\nthe  public.  These two instances are where  the  Council  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that a sole solicitor has abandoned his  practice,\r\n\r\nand  where  the  Council is satisfied  that  a  solicitor  is\r\n\r\npractising without a practising certificate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to speak in support of this Bill.   This  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  several important changes to the  conduct  and\r\n\r\nregulation  of  the legal profession.  The legal  profession,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  other  professions  in  Singapore,  is  going\r\n\r\nthrough  a  period of necessary change, both in  the  way  it\r\n\r\nworks  and in the way it seeks to upgrade itself to meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of the so-called New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer, first, to clause 3 that seeks to broaden the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of  the  Board to certify  persons  who  are  not\r\n\r\nqualified   persons   to  be  so,  if  they   possess   \"such\r\n\r\nqualification or expertise as would contribute to, promote or\r\n\r\nenhance  the  quality of legal services in Singapore  or  the\r\n\r\neconomic or technological development of Singapore\".  This is\r\n\r\nwider in at least two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespects from the original provision which requires the Board\r\n\r\nto  act  only  in  exceptional cases and where  the  person's\r\n\r\nqualification or expertise would enhance the quality of legal\r\n\r\nservices.   Under  the new provision, once an  applicant  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the quality of legal services or  economic  or\r\n\r\ntechnological development of Singapore, he can be  certified.\r\n\r\nThis is really open-ended and there may be difficulty for the\r\n\r\nBoard  to exercise this discretion in a focused way.  It  may\r\n\r\nopen  the  door for judicial review of the Board's decisions.\r\n\r\nI  should  also like to ask the Minister what is intended  in\r\n\r\nthis  broader  provision and what type of legal professionals\r\n\r\nwould therefore be expected to gain entry through this route?\r\n\r\nMy  concern  is  that such persons may be  admitted  to  fill\r\n\r\ncertain  needs of the time but, subsequently, may not  be  so\r\n\r\nuseful.  Would these individuals still be welcomed to general\r\n\r\npractice   in  Singapore?   After  admitting  them   to   the\r\n\r\nprofession, it may not be so easy to tell them to leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to turn to clause 7, which\r\n\r\ncontains  disqualifications for practising certificates.   In\r\n\r\nthe  new provision, it is envisaged that the Attorney-General\r\n\r\ncan,   through  his  certificate,  allow  certain  types   of\r\n\r\nsolicitors, such as those working in the university, to get a\r\n\r\npractising  certificate.   I  would  just  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to confirm that this is the new procedure that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's certificate is required for solicitors who\r\n\r\nare  working for statutory bodies or for universities  before\r\n\r\nthey  can  apply for a practising certificate.  If so,  could\r\n\r\nthe    Minister   explain   why   there   is   a   need   for\r\n\r\ndisqualifications?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I welcome the new complaints provisions set out\r\n\r\nin the Bill and, especially, in clause 17.  In particular,  I\r\n\r\nnote  that  the Council is obliged to inform the  complainant\r\n\r\nand  the advocate concerned if the complaint is dismissed  as\r\n\r\nfrivolous,  vexatious, misconceived or lacking in  substance.\r\n\r\nThis  is certainly most welcome.  Anecdotal evidence  in  the\r\n\r\npast  suggests that complainants do not really know  why  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints are dismissed without further action.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister whether some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  public-friendly mechanism can be found to inform  those\r\n\r\nwho   wish  to  complain  about  legal  services.   Is  there\r\n\r\nsufficient  information given to those who wish to  complain?\r\n\r\nCan  the complaints mechanism be made simpler for the public?\r\n\r\nMany  Members in this House must have come across cases where\r\n\r\na   member  of  the  public  informs  them  of  some  alleged\r\n\r\nmishandling  of  legal  matters  and  professes  a  lack   of\r\n\r\nknowledge  as to what to do.  The other problem is that  they\r\n\r\nfear the lawyers and do not expect a satisfactory outcome  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases.  I hope the Minister can look into ways  on  how\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public  can be  informed  of  their  rights\r\n\r\nconcerning  allegations  of mishandling  of  cases  by  their\r\n\r\nsolicitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above comments, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Sir, I rise to support this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment to section 5 regarding the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Legal Education's powers to invest its monies,  my\r\n\r\ncomment  is:  what  is the effect of this  amendment  on  the\r\n\r\nfinances  of the Board of Legal Education?  These  are  trust\r\n\r\nmonies,  and  the  persons in charge  should  be  careful  in\r\n\r\nventuring  into perhaps speculative forms of investment.   It\r\n\r\nmay  be  prudent  to  remain conservative and  obtain  modest\r\n\r\nreturns instead of being too active in wanting to get  higher\r\n\r\nreturns.  The Trustees Act must be observed by the custodians\r\n\r\nof funds belonging to the Board of Legal Education.  No doubt\r\n\r\nthere are responsible persons in charge of these matters, but\r\n\r\nit  would be prudent to be careful.  I would suggest that the\r\n\r\nexperiences  of  other similar organisations,  including  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Academy of Law - and the Board of Legal  Education\r\n\r\nis, in a way, part and parcel of the Singapore Academy of Law\r\n\r\n- the Law Society of Singapore and other professional groups,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  those  of  accountants, doctors and  engineers,  be\r\n\r\nstudied   closely   before  embarking  on   any   speculative\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Board of Legal Education is part of the Academy\r\n\r\nof Law, I would also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the members of the Singapore Academy  of  Law,\r\n\r\nwhich   include  both  practitioners,  legal  officers,   the\r\n\r\njudiciary and the Law Faculty members, be consulted  as  they\r\n\r\nare  the  equivalent  of  shareholders,  and  the  Board   of\r\n\r\nDirectors  should  give the members a chance  to  give  their\r\n\r\ninputs on this matter.  And it may be a point to note to  see\r\n\r\nwhether even the Academy of Law should have an annual general\r\n\r\nmeeting  where  these matters could be reviewed  by  all  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the Academy of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision which provides for the Board\r\n\r\nof  Legal Education to be allowed to invest in other business\r\n\r\nor   professional  bodies.   Perhaps,  there  could  be  some\r\n\r\nclarification  of  the ambit within which  we  would  include\r\n\r\nbusiness or professional bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provisions regarding dining terms, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  English  concept that  we  have.   I  hope,  in\r\n\r\nintroducing the concept of dining terms, that it will be done\r\n\r\nprofessionally  so that the young graduates do  benefit  from\r\n\r\nit,  and the senior members of the Bar, the judiciary and the\r\n\r\nlegal  fraternity would participate so that it will  come  to\r\n\r\nfruition where there would be dissemination of experiences of\r\n\r\nsenior  members  and the professional standards  as  a  whole\r\n\r\nwould  be increased.  The ethical standards could be  imbibed\r\n\r\ninto  younger  members through the concept of  dining  terms,\r\n\r\nprovided it is done properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof Chin has indicated, in new section 7, there is\r\n\r\nthe  removal of the term \"exceptional cases\", and there seems\r\n\r\nto  be a more liberal approach even to allowing non-qualified\r\n\r\npersons  to  be  qualified persons because, under  the  Legal\r\n\r\nProfession Act, the term \"qualified persons\" is defined,  and\r\n\r\nI  would think that, through these amendments, it is given  a\r\n\r\nwider  scope now.  And what exactly would it mean by \"or  the\r\n\r\neconomic or technological developments of Singapore\"?   In  a\r\n\r\nway,  it is progressive but, as indicated, it could have some\r\n\r\nnegative  effect, if there are too many of them coming  in  a\r\n\r\nlittle too easily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would welcome the amendments in section 48 where there\r\n\r\nis provision for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-option of new members into the Council of the Law Society.\r\n\r\nThis is a welcome provision because, as indicated, there  may\r\n\r\nbe some persons who may not be willing to stand for elections\r\n\r\nbut  who are capable and can contribute to the Council of the\r\n\r\nLaw  Society,  including lady members.  Now we have  a  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  where women make up at least half its membership,\r\n\r\nand  they  could  be of much benefit to the efficacy  of  the\r\n\r\nrunning of the Law Society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sections 93, 94 and 97, the further amendments\r\n\r\nempowering the disciplinary committee and courts with greater\r\n\r\npowers  and  a variety of punishments are also welcome  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  more  discretion given to these bodies  to  impose\r\n\r\npunishment instead of having stricter rules before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also welcome the monies that are paid in the\r\n\r\nform  of  penalty  to be used by the Law Society  for  public\r\n\r\nservice, eg, criminal legal aid and law awareness, instead of\r\n\r\npassing  it on to the Consolidated Fund.  That is  a  welcome\r\n\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  deeply obliged to you for allowing me this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  speak.  I rise to support the Bill and, before I do that,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to declare that I am a Member of  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological  University's Law  Department  in  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nBusiness  School.  But the topic I raise will  not  have  any\r\n\r\neffect on me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I would like to mention that I support the\r\n\r\nBill  because, as the Minister has said, where clauses 7  and\r\n\r\n10 are concerned, these are amendments to allow law lecturers\r\n\r\nto  enhance  their skills.  In the past, the Legal Profession\r\n\r\nAct only allowed the law lecturers from the Faculty of Law to\r\n\r\nhave  these privileges.  I would like to applaud the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  extending  this  now to law lecturers  in  all  the  law\r\n\r\ndepartments  of the other institutes of higher  learning  and\r\n\r\nother   law   departments  of  the  National  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is because I have always believed  that  law\r\n\r\nlecturers, whoever they may be, wherever they may be, should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  practical experience.  They should stay in  touch  with\r\n\r\nbusiness  realities,  and  what  they  teach  ought  to  have\r\n\r\nrelevance to the students.  Therefore, these opportunities to\r\n\r\nappear  before the courts and to give legal opinions  without\r\n\r\nbreaching any provision of the Legal Profession Act are  much\r\n\r\nto be welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this also as a fulfilment of the Minister's\r\n\r\npromise, in response to what Prof. Walter Woon said  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  1996, when the Minister introduced, for the  first\r\n\r\ntime,  amendments  in  sections  75C  and  75D.   These   new\r\n\r\namendments  recognise the fact that, since 1996,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  many  law  departments filled and  there  are  now  new\r\n\r\nuniversities which have staff who are every bit as  good,  if\r\n\r\nnot  better  than, the staff from the National University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I want to ask the Minister to consider if\r\n\r\nthere  could  be further amendments on the lines  of  section\r\n\r\n75D.   I  know  Prof. Walter Woon mentioned these  points  in\r\n\r\n1996, but let me assure the Minister I am not retreading  the\r\n\r\nsame ground.  Prof. Woon wanted to see that sections 75C  and\r\n\r\n75D  be  extended  to law lecturers who have  no  experience,\r\n\r\nperhaps  very  young  and inexperienced  law  lecturers.   My\r\n\r\npurpose,  Sir, is to urge the Minister, perhaps in  the  next\r\n\r\namendment  of  the  Legal Profession Act,  to  consider  this\r\n\r\npoint,  that there is in section 75D this entitlement  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled a \"consultant\", to practise as a consultant.  When the\r\n\r\nMinister  introduced this section in 1996,  he  mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthis House that it was important - this was in relation to  a\r\n\r\nrequest from the Law Society, and maybe Mr Chandra Mohan  was\r\n\r\nthere  then - and it was a request that we should  not  allow\r\n\r\njust  any  person to hang up a signplate that says  he  is  a\r\n\r\nconsultant.   And  I agree that anyone who  calls  himself  a\r\n\r\nconsultant has to have the experience and the expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise to the notice of this House and to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that with the universities we have now, eg,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Management University, our foremost expert  on\r\n\r\ncontract in Singapore and Malaysia, Dr Andrew Pang, is there.\r\n\r\nUnder section 75D, as it stands currently\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  there is no amendment today in this House, it would mean\r\n\r\nthat the years that he spends in SMU are useless to him.   He\r\n\r\ncannot  count those years towards being called a  consultant.\r\n\r\nThere  are  others:  Dr Low Kee Yang, who  is  an  expert  in\r\n\r\nguarantees,  also  in  SMU; in NTU itself,  we  have  several\r\n\r\ndoctorates   in   law  who  are  experts  in  Internet   law,\r\n\r\nintellectual property rights and e-commerce;  in the National\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, outside the Law Faculty,  there  are\r\n\r\nexperts on land law.  I say these are experts, not because  I\r\n\r\nsay  so,  Sir,  but  these  are  recognised  experts  in  the\r\n\r\nprofession  because they have been asked to write volumes  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  edition of the Halsbury's Laws of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  they  are also well-known authors of different books  on\r\n\r\ndifferent areas of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these experts - and I believe they should be\r\n\r\nqualified persons also, with more than 10 years' experience - if  the  Minister feels that should be so, I think these  are\r\n\r\nexperts that we ought to recognise.  And if they want  to  go\r\n\r\nout  and  hang up a signplate that says they are consultants,\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  stop them from doing so.  Otherwise,  it  is\r\n\r\nrather anomalous.  We allow them to appear before the courts,\r\n\r\nwe  allow them to advise lawyers, but, for a lesser privilege\r\n\r\nsuch as a title, we say no to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this would be relevant, Sir, when, for example,\r\n\r\none  day, after many years of teaching, they decide  to  come\r\n\r\nout,  but  they do not want to be a partner and,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthey are too senior to be a legal assistant in a law firm.  I\r\n\r\nthink  these  are  times when they would want  to  be  called\r\n\r\nconsultants.   There are also serving staff of the  different\r\n\r\nuniversities  who  would want to take up  a  full  practising\r\n\r\ncertificate  because  they are qualified  persons  and  their\r\n\r\nemployers  allow  them  to do so, but because  they  are  too\r\n\r\nsenior  to  be legal assistants and they do not  want  to  be\r\n\r\nemployees of any law firm in Singapore, it would not be right\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  take up a practising certificate  as  a  legal\r\n\r\nassistant or even as a partner.  So, this is when,  again,  a\r\n\r\ntitle like \"consultant\" would be useful to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is also anomalous that after 10-15 years as\r\n\r\na  law  lecturer  in the Law Faculty you  can  come  out  and\r\n\r\npractise as a law consultant but nobody else can do  so  even\r\n\r\nthough  he  may be an expert, say, Dr Andrew Pang.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a reasonable request to make.  I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  consider  this.   As I have  said,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nreiterate that these points are not relevant to me because  I\r\n\r\nhold  a  practising certificate and by the time my practising\r\n\r\ncertificate  expires, I have the number of  years  needed  in\r\n\r\npractice to be called a consultant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken in support of the Bill and I would touch on  the\r\n\r\npoints that they have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about the broader wordings for section\r\n\r\n7,  whether  it would pose some difficulties and wanted  some\r\n\r\nidea  on  what  sort of legal professionals we expect  to  be\r\n\r\nmaking  an  entry  through  this  route.   Let  me  say  that\r\n\r\npreviously, the applicant must be an exceptional one in  that\r\n\r\nhis  qualifications and expertise must be such that it  would\r\n\r\nenhance  the quality of legal service in Singapore.   Out  of\r\n\r\nthe  many  applications we received under section 7 over  the\r\n\r\npast  six years, the Board could only grant approval for four\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new wordings will provide the Board with a little\r\n\r\nbit  more  flexibility  because it  emphasises  more  on  the\r\n\r\neconomic contribution that an applicant can make to Singapore\r\n\r\nin such areas of economic activities where there is presently\r\n\r\na lack of expertise both qualitatively as well as in numbers.\r\n\r\nIt  would allow the Board to take into consideration  whether\r\n\r\nthe  expertise or experience of the applicant is required  or\r\n\r\ndesirable   for  Singapore  generally.   This   would   allow\r\n\r\nsuccessful applicants to contribute to an emerging  range  of\r\n\r\nnew  economic activities in which there is insufficient legal\r\n\r\nexpertise.  As Prof. Chin has said and Mr Chandra Mohan  also\r\n\r\ncommented,  the world of legal practice is changing  rapidly.\r\n\r\nAnd   for  Singapore,  the  legal  service  is  an  important\r\n\r\nsupporting pillar for our effort\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  maintain  our competitiveness.  This means not  just  the\r\n\r\ntraditional  role of a lawyer, as understood by most  laymen,\r\n\r\nit  means  getting into the cutting edge where  there  is  an\r\n\r\ninterplay  between intellectual properties, genetics,  patent\r\n\r\nlaw  and  so  forth,  where you need  to  have  some  experts\r\n\r\nknowledgeable   about  the  law  and,  at  the   same   time,\r\n\r\nknowledgeable about other areas.  For example, a law graduate\r\n\r\nwith   multiple   skills  and  experiences  may   apply   for\r\n\r\ncertification under this provision.  Another example would be\r\n\r\nan  IP  lawyer  with science or engineering  background.   So\r\n\r\nreally, it does not mean that by this amendment, we are going\r\n\r\nto  have  a deluge of applications.  It is that the  previous\r\n\r\ncriterion was very rigid for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that the amendment does not mean that\r\n\r\nthe  Board has to approve every case.  The Board is given the\r\n\r\ndiscretion,  and  I  am  sure  that  it  would  exercise  its\r\n\r\ndiscretion judiciously.  I think it has to be very  selective\r\n\r\nin  its use of powers under this new provision to ensure that\r\n\r\nhigh  quality persons are admitted under this route,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill not be a backdoor entry to get to the Singapore Bar.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the Board will have to establish its own guidelines,\r\n\r\nand the broader wordings of this new section would enable the\r\n\r\nBoard   to  have  the  flexibility  to  adjust  its  internal\r\n\r\nguidelines to suit changing needs and circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin posed the question whether Singapore's needs\r\n\r\nmay  be  changing and people who are admitted to fulfill  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  certain times, may not be useful  later.   We  are\r\n\r\nreally  talking about outstanding people and I hope  he  does\r\n\r\nnot mind if I were to mention that many years ago, when I was\r\n\r\nthe Dean of the Faculty, I had interviewed a young, promising\r\n\r\nlawyer from Sabah for the Law Faculty.  I was impressed  with\r\n\r\nhim  and  he was thinking of just a three-year contract  with\r\n\r\nthe  Law  Faculty.  But he stayed on, became a PR and  he  is\r\n\r\nnone  other than Prof. Chin.  But at that time, how could  we\r\n\r\nsay that this outstanding graduate was just going to meet the\r\n\r\ndemands  of  the Law Faculty at that time and  would  not  be\r\n\r\nuseful later?  So, we are talking about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  outstanding people like Prof. Chin.  I think it  would\r\n\r\nbe a provision that would be used judiciously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to clause 7, let me say that it does not impose any\r\n\r\nnew  limitations  but  actually  it  creates  exceptions   to\r\n\r\nlimitations which are already found in section 26(1)  of  the\r\n\r\nLegal Profession Act.  Because section 26(1) says that no one\r\n\r\ncan be issued with a practising certificate unless he intends\r\n\r\nto practise law as a sole proprietor, in partnership or as an\r\n\r\nemployee of a law firm or law corporation or as a director of\r\n\r\na law corporation.  This naturally means that lawyers working\r\n\r\nin  statutory  boards and universities are disqualified  from\r\n\r\nholding practising certificates.  The existing section  26(3)\r\n\r\ncreated an exception for lawyers working in statutory boards,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  certification  by  the  Attorney-General.   What\r\n\r\nclause  7 does is to widen the exception to include also  law\r\n\r\nlecturers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that this creation of a new exception for law\r\n\r\nlecturers   would  create  greater  opportunities   for   law\r\n\r\nlecturers  to sharpen their legal skills which will  in  turn\r\n\r\nbenefit their students.  The requirement for certification by\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General  would allow  the  Attorney-General  to\r\n\r\nimpose  conditions and controls over situations in which  the\r\n\r\nlaw lecturers can make use of the practising certificate.  As\r\n\r\nI  have  said in my speech, it is not the intention to  allow\r\n\r\nlaw lecturers to set up a full-fledged legal practice.  It is\r\n\r\nreally  intended  to  cater mainly  for  cases  where  a  law\r\n\r\nlecturer has been instructed by a practising lawyer, or where\r\n\r\nthe  law  lecturer is invited by the court  to  assist  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also made the point about the need for the\r\n\r\nLaw Society to print and disseminate information about how it\r\n\r\ndeals  with complaints.  This is a suggestion which  I  would\r\n\r\ncertainly  take up with the Law Society.  But,  in  fairness,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say that the Law Society does publish and distribute\r\n\r\npamphlets  explaining to the public the procedure for  making\r\n\r\ncomplaints about lawyers and the pamphlets are also available\r\n\r\non the Internet.  For Members of the House who previously had\r\n\r\ndifficulties explaining the procedure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto their constituents, I can also get my officials to forward\r\n\r\nthe relevant website address to the constituency secretariats\r\n\r\nso that MPs can advise their constituents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan was particularly concerned with two\r\n\r\npoints.   One  was on the Board's investment powers.   It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  these amendments have given a new flexibility  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board.  But one should not conclude that this means that\r\n\r\nthe   Board  is  going  to  be  speculative  and  engage   in\r\n\r\nquestionable investments.  This new provision on the  Board's\r\n\r\ninvestment  powers is actually similar to those on investment\r\n\r\npowers of many other statutory bodies in Singapore.  So it is\r\n\r\nnot  unprecedented.  The idea is really  to  give  the  Board\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility to invest its funds to better  meet  its\r\n\r\nobjectives.  I believe that the Attorney-General  hopes  that\r\n\r\nthis   flexibility  would  allow  the  Board,   on   suitable\r\n\r\noccasions,  for example, to selectively grant  loans  to  law\r\n\r\nfirms to assist with operations on worthwhile projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also hoped that this would allow the Board and\r\n\r\nfirms  to  engage in win-win partnerships for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  legal profession as a whole.  I myself do not fear  that\r\n\r\nthis  would lead to imprudent and unwise investments  because\r\n\r\nthe  control over these investments rests with members of the\r\n\r\nBoard,  which is chaired by the Attorney-General and includes\r\n\r\nthe  Dean of the Law Faculty, as well as the President of the\r\n\r\nLaw Society, all of whom, I am sure, would make it a point to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  investments are  defensible  and  on  good\r\n\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point about dining terms, let me say the Board of\r\n\r\nLegal Education has been trying out this idea informally  for\r\n\r\nthe past two years.  But unlike the way dining terms are kept\r\n\r\nin  England,  the  arrangement here would  have  considerable\r\n\r\neducational  flavour or component and I understand  that  the\r\n\r\nintention  is  to invite prominent speakers for  such  dining\r\n\r\nsessions,  and the pupils would be seated with practitioners.\r\n\r\nI  think  this idea should be encouraged as it  would  add  a\r\n\r\nfurther dimension to education of our younger budding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  hopefully, it would enable them to  absorb  the\r\n\r\nvalues  and  traditions of the Bar by interacting  with  more\r\n\r\nsenior practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note of what Prof. Toh See Kiat has said.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  want  to make it clear that I do not underestimate\r\n\r\nthe  expertise  and competence of the law  teachers  who  are\r\n\r\nteaching law outside the NUS Law Faculty.  But in response to\r\n\r\nhis  points,  let  me say that there is a difference  between\r\n\r\nteaching law full-time to law students in the Law Faculty and\r\n\r\nteaching   law  to  engineering,  accountancy   or   business\r\n\r\nstudents.   The  Member may or may not agree  with  me.   The\r\n\r\nlecturers   in   the   Law  Faculty   are   training   future\r\n\r\npractitioners of law and they have to constantly keep up with\r\n\r\nthe  legal  skills and knowledge, well-honed, up-to-date  and\r\n\r\neven  a  cutting edge.  It is for that reason that Parliament\r\n\r\nsaw  it fit to regard each year spent teaching law in the NUS\r\n\r\nLaw  Faculty  as  equivalent  to one  year's  legal  practice\r\n\r\nexperience for the purposes of qualification used in the term\r\n\r\n\"consultant\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without appearing to underestimate those teaching law\r\n\r\noutside  the  Law  Faculty,  I should  say  that,  relatively\r\n\r\nspeaking,  the  demands  on a law lecturer  teaching  non-law\r\n\r\nstudents may not be as intense as the Law Faculty because the\r\n\r\nLaw Faculty lecturers are in a total law environment and they\r\n\r\ninteract  with  some  40  to  50  other  colleagues  who  are\r\n\r\nspecialists in their law disciplines.  I am not sure that the\r\n\r\nother departments outside the NUS Law Faculty have this total\r\n\r\ninteractive  environment which is not unlike  a  leading  law\r\n\r\nfirm in town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Bill has opened up certain NUS law lecturers'\r\n\r\nprivileges  to  also  non-law  faculty  lecturers  and  other\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  they  do  not  make  the  conferment  of  such\r\n\r\nprivileges  automatic.   For  example,  the  issuance  of   a\r\n\r\npractising  certificate is subject to the  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\napproval  and  the  Attorney-General can  impose  conditions.\r\n\r\nThis  would  allow  the  Attorney-General  to  exercise  some\r\n\r\ncontrol.   My  response may not satisfy Prof.  Toh  See  Kiat\r\n\r\nbecause he would favour a result where all law lecturers  are\r\n\r\nconferred the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefit  which is given to the NUS Law Faculty.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill repeals the Arbitration Act. In its\r\n\r\nplace, the Bill enacts a new Arbitration Act which is more in\r\n\r\nline  with  our  International  Arbitration  Act  (IAA)   and\r\n\r\ninternational  practices, as reflected in the UNCITRAL  Model\r\n\r\nLaw on International Commercial Arbitration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arbitration is a useful and efficient alternative\r\n\r\ndispute   resolution  (ADR)  process  to  settle   commercial\r\n\r\ndisputes.  Hence, it is important that our arbitration laws\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand practices effectively support the business infrastructure\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and at the same time encourage and  facilitate\r\n\r\nits greater use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Arbitration Act was enacted in 1953. It is\r\n\r\nlargely  based  on UK arbitration law.  In 1995,  this  House\r\n\r\npassed  the International Arbitration Act to adopt the  Model\r\n\r\nLaw   as   our  governing  law  on  international  commercial\r\n\r\narbitrations.   At  that  time,  it  was  decided  that   the\r\n\r\nmigration  to the UNCITRAL Model Law be conducted in  phases,\r\n\r\nwith   the   first   phase   involving   only   international\r\n\r\narbitration.   As  the Model Law has been  well  received  by\r\n\r\nSingapore arbitrators and practitioners, the next step is  to\r\n\r\nalign our domestic laws with the Model Law.  This will narrow\r\n\r\nthe  differences between the two regimes.  In  1996,  the  UK\r\n\r\nrevamped   their  arbitration  laws  and  incorporated   many\r\n\r\nprovisions  from  the  Model Law.   In  the  light  of  these\r\n\r\ndevelopments, the Attorney-General initiated a review of  our\r\n\r\nArbitration  laws, spearheaded by the Chambers' newly  formed\r\n\r\nLaw  Reform  and  Revision Division.  The Division  consulted\r\n\r\nmany  bodies  in  this  review.  They include  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute   of   Arbitrators,  the  Singapore   International\r\n\r\nArbitration  Centre,  the  Law  Society  of  Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Institute of Architects, the National University of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Economic Development  Board  and  the  Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. The Bill is therefore the product  of  all\r\n\r\nthese  consultations.  In fact, it is the  first  law  reform\r\n\r\nproposal  from  the Law Reform and Revision  Division  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced as a Bill in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is largely based on the UNCITRAL Model\r\n\r\nLaw,   which   already   forms  the  basis   of   Singapore's\r\n\r\nInternational  Arbitration Act.  The Bill  also  incorporates\r\n\r\nuseful  provisions  from the 1996 UK Arbitration  Act.   This\r\n\r\napproach allows the creation of an arbitration regime that is\r\n\r\nin  line  with international standards and yet preserves  key\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  those existing arbitration practices  that  are\r\n\r\ndeemed to be desirable for domestic arbitrations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the main features of the Bill.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the Bill adopts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  territorial criterion recommended in the Model  Law  and\r\n\r\naffirms the position that every arbitration held in Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  be governed by an applicable law of arbitration  either\r\n\r\nunder  the International Arbitration Act or under this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  concept of a `delocalised' arbitration unconnected  with\r\n\r\nany  system  of municipal laws would not be recognised  under\r\n\r\nSingapore law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill adopts the position that some\r\n\r\nsupervision by the Courts over the conduct of arbitration  in\r\n\r\ndomestic arbitration is desirable.  For example, the power to\r\n\r\ngrant  Mareva  injunctions and Anton  Piller  injunctions  is\r\n\r\nvested  in the Court, and not in the arbitral tribunal.   The\r\n\r\nBill  also  provides for the Court to be able to determine  a\r\n\r\npreliminary point of law, to set aside the arbitral award  on\r\n\r\ncertain grounds and for appeals to be made against the  award\r\n\r\non a point of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill allows a party to apply for stay of\r\n\r\ncourt  proceedings in favour of arbitration in the  court  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  proceedings  were  first  commenced.   Under  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   position,  if  an  action  is  commenced   in   the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts and a stay of the proceedings is sought in\r\n\r\nfavour  of arbitration, the person seeking the stay needs  to\r\n\r\napply  to  the  High  Court to stay the  proceedings  in  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts.   The new arrangements  under  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwould therefore remove this inconvenience in having to submit\r\n\r\nthe matter for determination by the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also allows the Court, on its own motion, to\r\n\r\ndiscontinue certain stayed actions if at least two years have\r\n\r\nelapsed  since  the  order of stay  was  made.   This  is  in\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the fact that most disputes under arbitration\r\n\r\nwould  take  less than two years to resolve, and  that  if  a\r\n\r\ncourt proceeding is stayed for more than two years on account\r\n\r\nof  an  ongoing arbitration, the subject matter of the  court\r\n\r\nproceeding  would  most probably have been  resolved,  and  a\r\n\r\nfurther  continuation  of  the  stay  would  be  unnecessary.\r\n\r\nEither  party may still apply for the discontinued action  to\r\n\r\nbe reinstated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Model Law concept of separability is\r\n\r\nadopted.  What this means is that an arbitration clause in  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  contract  is treated as a separate  and  distinct\r\n\r\nagreement  from the underlying contract itself, and  as  such\r\n\r\nwould survive the termination of the underlying contract.  An\r\n\r\narbitration  clause  in a contract thus constitutes  a  self-contained  contract  that  is  ancillary  to  the  underlying\r\n\r\ncontract and is capable of independent existence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the Chairman of the Singapore International\r\n\r\nArbitration Centre (SIAC) will now be the default  appointing\r\n\r\nauthority  where  the  parties are unable  to  agree  on  the\r\n\r\nappointment   of  arbitrators.   Currently,  the   appointing\r\n\r\nauthority  is  the  High Court.  This change  recognises  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  the SIAC as the premier arbitration  centre  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  region. The SIAC has  been  the  default\r\n\r\nappointing  authority  for  international  arbitration  since\r\n\r\n1995.   The  steady  increase in the number of  international\r\n\r\narbitrations confirms the confidence of parties in the  SIAC.\r\n\r\nWith  the  expertise  of the SIAC and its  panel  of  eminent\r\n\r\narbitrators,  the  SIAC is well-positioned  to  fulfill  this\r\n\r\nfunction.   This  change  will  also  conserve  the  valuable\r\n\r\nresources of the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, the existing provisions on the institution of\r\n\r\numpires have been removed from the Bill.  Having umpires is a\r\n\r\nunique English concept to break deadlocks arising out of  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of two-man arbitral tribunals.  Umpire  provisions\r\n\r\nhave been found to be cumbersome and expensive to employ, and\r\n\r\nthe  concept of umpires does not exist at all under the Model\r\n\r\nLaw.  The Bill thus makes no mention of umpires and there are\r\n\r\nonly  provisions for appointing one-man or three-man arbitral\r\n\r\ntribunals.   This  is  consistent  with  the  Model  Law  and\r\n\r\ninternational  commercial  practice.   The  Bill  contains  a\r\n\r\ntransitional  provision  to cater  for  existing  arbitration\r\n\r\nagreements  that  contain  references  to  umpires.   Out  of\r\n\r\nrespect for party autonomy, the Bill allows for the continued\r\n\r\noperation  of the existing legislative provisions on  umpires\r\n\r\nfor  existing  arbitration agreements that  make  mention  of\r\n\r\numpires.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a related change, there are no longer provisions\r\n\r\ngoverning the appointment of two-man tribunals as the  umpire\r\n\r\nprovisions for breaking deadlocks have been removed from  the\r\n\r\nproposed Arbitration Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the Bill provides for a modification of the\r\n\r\nUNCITRAL  Model  Law approach in the default  appointment  of\r\n\r\nthree-man tribunals.  Under the Model Law, where parties wish\r\n\r\nto  appoint  a  three-man tribunal, each party  appoints  one\r\n\r\narbitrator  and the two so appointed would then  appoint  the\r\n\r\nthird arbitrator.  As arbitrators would appoint persons  they\r\n\r\nknow or are familiar with, the participation in international\r\n\r\narbitrations   may  be  limited  to  a  few  and   home-grown\r\n\r\narbitrators  may  not have an opportunity to  participate  in\r\n\r\nthese arbitrations.  After extensive discussions between  the\r\n\r\nSIAC and the Law Reform and Revision Division of the Attorney-General's   Chambers,  it  is  proposed  that   the   default\r\n\r\nappointment  for  three-man tribunals be  modified  to  allow\r\n\r\nparties   to  appoint  the  third  arbitrator  by  agreement.\r\n\r\nFailing  the  agreement,  the  SIAC,  as  default  appointing\r\n\r\nauthority, would appoint the third arbitrator.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nwhere   the   SIAC  has  an  opportunity  to   make   default\r\n\r\nappointments, it may do so to promote and develop  home-grown\r\n\r\narbitrators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequential amendments are also made to the\r\n\r\nLimitation  Act  and  Bankruptcy  Act.   In  particular,  the\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the existing Arbitration Act that  deals  with\r\n\r\nadoption of an arbitration agreement by the Official Assignee\r\n\r\nin  the event of a party's bankruptcy has been enacted in the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy Act.  In the UK, this approach is also taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will help facilitate arbitration as a\r\n\r\nmeans of resolving commercial disputes in Singapore and  will\r\n\r\nensure that our domestic regime continues to stay on par with\r\n\r\ninternational  standards.   It  will  reinforce   Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition as a desirable venue for the conduct of arbitration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is positioning itself as a centre for\r\n\r\nservices,  and one of the most important form of service  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  dispute settlement.  Arbitration is increasingly\r\n\r\nbecoming  important  as  a means of  settling  disputes.   It\r\n\r\naffords  advantages  beyond litigation,  which  is  far  more\r\n\r\nformal  in its procedures.  I therefore welcome the  Bill  in\r\n\r\nits  entirety.  I only wish to ask the Minister of  State  to\r\n\r\nclarify a couple of issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what steps are being taken to develop Singapore\r\n\r\nas  an arbitration centre in the region?  How is the Ministry\r\n\r\nand other relevant agencies going to train sufficient quality\r\n\r\narbitrators   to   enhance  Singapore's  reputation   as   an\r\n\r\narbitration centre?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in clauses 62 and 63, reference is made to\r\n\r\narbitrators acting as mediators.  Mediation is, of course,  a\r\n\r\ndifferent dispute settlement mechanism than arbitration.  And\r\n\r\nit seems that arbitrators in this Bill are expected to act as\r\n\r\nmediators.   Are arbitrators now expected to  be  trained  in\r\n\r\nmediation as well?  And if so, what steps are taken to ensure\r\n\r\nthat arbitrators know how to mediate properly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  for  supporting the Bill and for  making  useful\r\n\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin's first query is on how we can further ensure\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  becomes the centre for  arbitration  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   As I have mentioned, we are always looking  at  how\r\n\r\nour laws can be improved.  Indeed, what we are doing today in\r\n\r\npassing these amendments to the Arbitration Act is a big step\r\n\r\nin  that  direction.  After all, the Arbitration Act has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  amended  very often since its enactment  in  1953.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  we are providing two regimes for  parties  who\r\n\r\nwant  to  arbitrate in Singapore to choose from,  either  the\r\n\r\nInternational Arbitration Act regime or the domestic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArbitration Act regime.  My assurance to Prof. Chin  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General's Chambers will continue to monitor all\r\n\r\ntrends   and   developments  overseas  and,   if   necessary,\r\n\r\nincorporate  these, as we have done in these amendments  this\r\n\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other approach is to ensure that the Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is well  run.   As  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned in my speech, the SIAC, since  its  inception\r\n\r\nabout  10 years ago, has made giant steps.  Currently, it  is\r\n\r\nchaired by a former High Court Judge.  And not only him,  but\r\n\r\nhis  predecessor, and others working with him  have  promoted\r\n\r\nthe  SIAC  to  parties,  especially  overseas  and  also   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The SIAC was launched in 1991.  In 1992,  it  had\r\n\r\ntwo  international arbitrations, one year after  its  launch.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  the number rose to about 60.  So there  is  some\r\n\r\nincrease.   But the Chairman of the SIAC tells me  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  further  promote  the Centre,  and  that  will  include\r\n\r\nworking  with  relevant agencies like the  Trade  Development\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the quality of the arbitrators. I\r\n\r\nthink that is another selling point of any centre.  The  SIAC\r\n\r\nhas on its panel over the years built up a group of local  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  foreign  arbitrators.  There  are  about  70  local\r\n\r\narbitrators, not just eminent and distinguished  lawyers  but\r\n\r\nalso  people  in  the various fields where parties  may  want\r\n\r\nexpertise  in  arbitration.  So there are  engineers,  marine\r\n\r\ncaptains  and  architects.   That  is  the  local  panel   of\r\n\r\narbitrators.   That is complemented by a panel  of  about  70\r\n\r\nforeign distinguished arbitrators.  Here again, parties  have\r\n\r\na  choice,  which  is important, because  the  key  tenet  of\r\n\r\narbitration  is  party's autonomy.  They  can  choose.   They\r\n\r\nchoose  the venue, they choose the rules, they have a  choice\r\n\r\nof arbitrators, and how it is conducted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the training of arbitrators, a point\r\n\r\nwhich  Prof. Chin mentioned is also important.  Let me assure\r\n\r\nhim that this is being done, not just by the SIAC but also by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Institute of Arbitrators, which has been around\r\n\r\neven\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlonger  than  the  SIAC.  And together with  the  SIAC,  they\r\n\r\nconduct  continuing legal education.  I understand  that  all\r\n\r\nthese years, the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators has  been\r\n\r\ntraining  and  accrediting arbitrators.  They have  a  scheme\r\n\r\nwhere  people join as members and, over time, when they prove\r\n\r\nthemselves,  they  are upgraded to Fellows.   There  is  also\r\n\r\ntraining  done in conjunction with the UK Chartered Institute\r\n\r\nof Arbitrators.  So, let me again make this point, which is a\r\n\r\ngood  point,  that training is important, and I  thank  Prof.\r\n\r\nChin for that reminder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also talks about clause 62. As I mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now,  one of the key tenets of arbitration  is  party's\r\n\r\nautonomy.  In fact, clause 62, where an arbitrator may act as\r\n\r\na  mediator,  is  not  a new provision because  it  is  found\r\n\r\ncurrently  in  the  International  Arbitration  Act.   So  in\r\n\r\nbringing the two Acts closer together, this has been co-opted\r\n\r\ninto  the Arbitration Act.  But let me assure Prof. Chin that\r\n\r\nthis provision only applies where the parties agree that  the\r\n\r\narbitrator  shall  have the powers to act;  in  other  words,\r\n\r\nparty's  autonomy.  Some parties may very well think that  it\r\n\r\nis  a  good  thing  to do that, ie, before  they  submit  the\r\n\r\ndispute  to  an  arbitrator,  they  give  the  arbitrator  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to mediate.  Then, of course, we all know that it\r\n\r\nis a tenet that all arbitrators must remember that if they do\r\n\r\nmediate before that, they are wearing different hats  and  it\r\n\r\nis  very  important not to mix the two.  So all  parties,  in\r\n\r\nother words, enter into this arrangement with eyes open - the\r\n\r\nparties  in  dispute as well as the arbitrator.  Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nprovisions are there to guide the arbitrator, if he  does  so\r\n\r\nwear  this other hat, what he should or should not  do.   So,\r\n\r\nagain, let me assure Prof. Chin that this provision has  been\r\n\r\nadded after much thought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc.

Indeed,\r\n\r\nconsultation  on this Bill was done jointly with  those  that\r\n\r\ntook place on the Arbitration Bill.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.49 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill effects the following changes in order to\r\n\r\nharmonise it with the proposed Arbitration Act:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the stay of proceedings provisions will be\r\n\r\nstreamlined.  I think I have mentioned this already just now.\r\n\r\nBecause under the existing International Arbitration Act, all\r\n\r\nstay  of  proceeding applications must be filed in  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt,  regardless  of  whether  the  action  was  originally\r\n\r\ncommenced in the Subordinate Courts or the High Court.   This\r\n\r\nBill  will remove this inconvenience because now the  parties\r\n\r\nneed  not  submit the matter for determination  by  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill amends the International Arbitration\r\n\r\nAct  to  allow  the  Court on its own motion  to  discontinue\r\n\r\ncertain  stayed  actions if at least two years  have  elapsed\r\n\r\nsince  the  order of stay has been made.  As I have explained\r\n\r\njust now, this amendment follows from that in the first Bill,\r\n\r\nbecause  two  years is a long enough time for the  action  to\r\n\r\nproceed  if  the parties have so intended and, in  any  case,\r\n\r\neven if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscontinued, they can take up an action to restart it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill provides limited immunity to the\r\n\r\ndefault appointing authority and arbitral institutions.  This\r\n\r\nstates that arbitral institutions are not liable for anything\r\n\r\ndone  or  omitted  in  respect  of  the  discharge  of  their\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  appointing  or nominating  arbitrators  unless\r\n\r\nthere is shown to have been bad faith involved in the act  or\r\n\r\nomission.   The provision also clarifies that the  appointing\r\n\r\nauthority or arbitral institution is not liable for the  acts\r\n\r\nof the arbitrator appointed or nominated by it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the foregoing, two main amendments are\r\n\r\nmade to provide clarifications, so that there will be greater\r\n\r\ncertainty   as   to   the  operation  of  the   International\r\n\r\nArbitration  Act.  Firstly, clause 14 provides  clarification\r\n\r\non  the  finality of an interim award.  Under UK  arbitration\r\n\r\nlaw  and our domestic Arbitration Act, an interim award, once\r\n\r\ngiven,  is  binding and cannot be reviewed by the arbitrator.\r\n\r\nThe  Model Law says nothing about the finality of an  interim\r\n\r\naward  but practitioners have long assumed that the  position\r\n\r\nis  the same as well.  The Attorney-General, the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  SIAC and leading arbitrators, including members  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Institute  of Arbitrators, have  recommended  that\r\n\r\nlegislation  be  passed  to clarify this  position  to  avoid\r\n\r\nuncertainty  in the law.  Thus, clause 14 of the Bill  amends\r\n\r\nthe  Act to state clearly that the position in Singapore  for\r\n\r\ninternational arbitrations is that interim awards  are  final\r\n\r\nand binding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clause 12 of the Bill amends section 15 of the\r\n\r\nInternational Arbitration Act to clarify its scope.   Section\r\n\r\n15  was intended to allow parties who desire a greater degree\r\n\r\nof  judicial intervention to opt out of the Model Law  regime\r\n\r\ninto  the domestic Arbitration Act as the applicable  law  of\r\n\r\narbitration.   In  its  existing form  it  has  created  some\r\n\r\nuncertainty in the industry and requires clarification.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  question  to  be  resolved is whether  parties  to  an\r\n\r\narbitration agreement should be regarded as having opted  out\r\n\r\nof the Model Law if the arbitration agreement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontains  a reference to the use of institutional arbitration\r\n\r\nrules,  eg, ICC rules, without more.  A new section 15(2)  is\r\n\r\ntherefore added to clarify that a reference in an arbitration\r\n\r\nagreement  to any institutional arbitration rules would  not,\r\n\r\nby  itself,  be regarded as an agreement to opt  out  of  the\r\n\r\nModel Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question to resolve is which legal regime\r\n\r\nwill  apply  in  the event that parties to  an  international\r\n\r\narbitration conducted in Singapore opt out of the Model  Law.\r\n\r\nFor  the  avoidance of doubt, section 15 is amended to  state\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore's  domestic  arbitration   law   under   the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Act  would apply to the arbitration  if  parties\r\n\r\nexpressly  choose to opt out of the International Arbitration\r\n\r\nAct or the Model Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will help ensure that our International\r\n\r\nArbitration  regime  continues to keep  pace  with  the  best\r\n\r\npractices  among  international  standards  and  more  firmly\r\n\r\nestablish  Singapore  as  an  attractive  place  to   conduct\r\n\r\ninternational commercial arbitrations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to speak in support of the Bill which together with  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Bill  that  was just considered  will  form  the\r\n\r\nsubstantive  basis for Singapore to develop as  an  important\r\n\r\narbitration  centre.   But as rules  are  just  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprocess  and  the practice of how to encourage  international\r\n\r\narbitration  has to be taken into account, I should  like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister of State to clarify a couple of points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of international arbitration, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  him how we can ensure that Singapore would be looked\r\n\r\nupon, regarded as a good forum for international arbitration.\r\n\r\nFor  example, how do we make sure that our arbitrators  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  high standard of objectivity and independence,  even\r\n\r\nwhen  they are considering disputes between Singapore parties\r\n\r\nand parties from abroad?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to know whether we have taken steps\r\n\r\nto  facilitate  entry  into Singapore of  well-known  foreign\r\n\r\narbitrators.   I understand, for example, that  when  foreign\r\n\r\narbitrators come to Singapore, they are uncertain  about  the\r\n\r\ntax position and some of them have expressed unhappiness over\r\n\r\nthe  red  tape  encountered,  especially  with  reference  to\r\n\r\nwithholding  tax.   Could the Minister of  State  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  steps will be taken to smoothen the  process  of\r\n\r\nadmitting foreign arbitrators to Singapore so that  with  the\r\n\r\nnew regime of rules and practices, Singapore can continue  to\r\n\r\nbe a good base for international arbitration as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, once again, I thank\r\n\r\nProf. Chin for his comments and support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his first point is the attractiveness of the\r\n\r\ncentre, in particular when parties are in dispute, and one of\r\n\r\nthe parties is a non-Singaporean party.  I think that has  to\r\n\r\ndo  with  two  areas.   The first will  be  the  quality  and\r\n\r\nintegrity of the panel of arbitrators.  This is because  SIAC\r\n\r\nthat  forms  these  two lists of arbitrators  stands  by  the\r\n\r\nreputation of these arbitrators.  If Prof. Chin looks at  the\r\n\r\nlist  of arbitrators, he will see that they comprise  men  of\r\n\r\ngood professional standing, proven expertise not just in  the\r\n\r\nlegal  field but also in other fields, and that also goes  to\r\n\r\nsay  for the other list of international arbitrators.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  track record is important.  People who have  done\r\n\r\narbitration in Singapore must feel good about what they  have\r\n\r\nexperienced  and then word can get around.  And I  think  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  that have increased over the years do show that  the\r\n\r\nSIAC has built up a track record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, of course, on how the centre is run.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I think it must be well run.  So here we have\r\n\r\ngot  a  former High Court Judge who heads the centre, working\r\n\r\nwith  a  team  of  very committed people.  Also,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nlinked, for example, to the Government, because that is  also\r\n\r\nan issue, especially if one of the contracting parties is the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government.  We also want parties to such contracts\r\n\r\nto consider Singapore as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvenue  for arbitration.  This, of course, has been helped  by\r\n\r\nwhat  we  did  in August 1999 when previously  the  SIAC  was\r\n\r\norganised   and  came  under  the  auspices  of   the   Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  which is a statutory  board  under  MTI.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  to  say  that  at that  time,  there  was  any\r\n\r\nwrongdoing, but more in terms of perception and holding  out.\r\n\r\nAt  that  time,  we switched it and now it  comes  under  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Academy  of  Law, which  all  of  us  know  is  an\r\n\r\ninstitution of high standing and of repute overseas.  So that\r\n\r\nis the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is again part of this\r\n\r\nprocess  I  have  talked  about earlier  on,  how  to  always\r\n\r\nconsider  requests  and ways in which we can  make  Singapore\r\n\r\nmore  attractive.  On the point of tax that  Prof.  Chin  has\r\n\r\nasked, what MinLaw has done is that we have asked Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  to consider whether if there is any situation  where\r\n\r\nforeign arbitrators who come to Singapore as arbitrators  may\r\n\r\nbe   in   a  disadvantaged  position,  vis-a-vis  their   tax\r\n\r\nliability.   We should look at it and see whether  there  are\r\n\r\ngrounds and, if so, how we can ameliorate it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE BUSINESS FEDERATION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale   for  Bill  -  Formation  of  Singapore   Business\r\n\r\nFederation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the formation\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Business Federation (or SBF) as the new apex\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation  to represent Singapore business interests  both\r\n\r\nlocally and abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is a wide array of business chambers\r\n\r\nand  associations  representing the various  sectors  of  our\r\n\r\nbusiness community.  Each organisation plays a niche  role  - serving  members  and the economy along ethnic  lines  or  by\r\n\r\nindustry, professional or national groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  (or  SFCCI) was set up in 1978 as a  national  body\r\n\r\nrepresenting  local business interests and  employer  groups.\r\n\r\nIts  members  comprise the three ethnic  chambers,  Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Chambers  of  Commerce  (SICC)  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nConfederation of Industries (SCI).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the SFCCI has done much to represent the\r\n\r\ninterests of our private sector in local and regional forums,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the NWC and the ASEAN Business Council.  It has also\r\n\r\nhelped many local businesses expand overseas and network with\r\n\r\noverseas partners.  Let me take this opportunity to thank the\r\n\r\nSFCCI  for  the good work that it has done over the  last  23\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and rapid technological progress have\r\n\r\nfundamentally  changed the way business  is  done  worldwide.\r\n\r\nOur  companies  are  relatively small and they  face  growing\r\n\r\nchallenges overseas.  They have to work together and leverage\r\n\r\non  each  other's strengths.  Even as they compete  at  home,\r\n\r\nthere are benefits to be gained from working together to  tap\r\n\r\nregional and global opportunities.  Domestically, there is  a\r\n\r\nneed   to  strengthen  the  representation  of  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity in forums, such as the NWC, ASEAN, APEC,  ASEM  and\r\n\r\nmany  bilateral  business councils.  In our  bilateral  free-trade   negotiations,  there  are  opportunities  which   our\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  should help to identify.   We  therefore\r\n\r\nneed a stronger collective voice to strengthen our tripartite\r\n\r\nstructure,  facilitate  better co-ordination  between  public\r\n\r\nagencies  and the business community and assist our companies\r\n\r\nwhen  they  venture  overseas.  This is much  like  the  role\r\n\r\nKeidandren plays in Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged the SFCCI to\r\n\r\nreview  its structure so that it could play a more  effective\r\n\r\nrole  in  Singapore.   In response, the  SFCCI  proposed  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  a  Singapore  Business  Federation  funded  by\r\n\r\ncompulsory  contributions from larger companies.   The  SFCCI\r\n\r\nrecognises that its current policy of voluntary membership by\r\n\r\nbusiness  chambers and associations has not  been  effective.\r\n\r\nThe  business community in Singapore remains fragmented.   We\r\n\r\nlack   a   strong   and   united  private   sector   umbrella\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government fully supports SFCCI's proposal. To\r\n\r\noperationalize  it, I requested Mr Stephen Lee,  Chairman  of\r\n\r\nSNEF, in March this year to head an SBF Pro tem Committee and\r\n\r\nstudy  in detail issues, such as the composition of  the  SBF\r\n\r\nCouncil, the Constitution of the SBF and the legislation  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory membership of larger companies.  SFCCI's intention\r\n\r\nis to dissolve itself once the SBF has been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Main recommendations by SBF Pro tem Committee</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This SBF Bill, before the House, was drafted based on\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of  the SBF  Pro  tem  Committee.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee has had extensive consultations with the local  and\r\n\r\nforeign  business  community  in  Singapore.   Let   me   now\r\n\r\nhighlight  the main recommendations of the Pro tem  Committee\r\n\r\nwhich are contained in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, while the SBF should be run by the business\r\n\r\ncommunity,  it  needs  the Government  to  enact  legislation\r\n\r\nrequiring  local companies with paid-up capital  and  foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies with authorised capital of  $0.5 million and  above\r\n\r\nto  be members of the SBF.  Mandatory membership is not  new.\r\n\r\nCountries like Germany, France and Brazil have laws requiring\r\n\r\ncompanies to contribute to their chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we should not burden small businesses with the\r\n\r\ncompulsory SBF subscription.  With the cut-off set at above\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$0.5  million paid-up capital, most of our SMEs will not need\r\n\r\nto  pay  SBF fees.  We allow membership of the SBF indirectly\r\n\r\nthrough  a  chamber or association.  Therefore, the  SBF  can\r\n\r\nstill  represent  the  interest of  small  companies  through\r\n\r\nexisting chambers and associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a Board of Trustees must be formed to protect the\r\n\r\nassets  of  the SBF as these assets will be mainly  built  up\r\n\r\nfrom the collection of mandatory fees and to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nSBF   does  not  deviate  from  its  mission.   Beyond   such\r\n\r\nprotection,  the Trustees will not interfere in the  workings\r\n\r\nof the SBF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we should not reserve seats in the SBF Council\r\n\r\nfor particular chambers or associations, except for the three\r\n\r\nethnic  chambers.  Nothing is static.  As the nature  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  changes,  it  is  natural  that  some  chambers   or\r\n\r\nassociations would become more important while others  become\r\n\r\nless  so.  Some may have to be closed.  New ones may have  to\r\n\r\nbe   formed.    The   Council  would  draw   up   rules   for\r\n\r\nrepresentation  which are fair and transparent.   Recognising\r\n\r\nthe important role of the international business community in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  up to a quarter of the SBF Council  will  be  set\r\n\r\naside  for  foreign representation.  Only  the  three  ethnic\r\n\r\nchambers  will be given permanent seats as they represent  an\r\n\r\nimportant part of our multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some concerns that the SBF may supplant\r\n\r\nexisting   chambers  and  associations   and   reduce   their\r\n\r\nmembership.   This is not the purpose for creating  the  SBF.\r\n\r\nSo  long as the chambers and associations serve their members\r\n\r\nmeaningfully, they will continue to play important roles.  In\r\n\r\ncountries with compulsory membership like France, Germany and\r\n\r\nBrazil,  the  apex  chambers  work  closely  with  the  other\r\n\r\nchambers  which continue to flourish alongside.  In the  same\r\n\r\nway,  the  SBF  will work closely with existing chambers  and\r\n\r\nassociations to serve our business community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Role of the SBF</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBF, thus proposed, is a network and not an\r\n\r\nexclusive   organisation.   It  provides   a   facility   for\r\n\r\ninformation exchange\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  for  promoting  dialogue not  only  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment but with foreign governments as well.   It  should\r\n\r\nalso  advance the interests of Singapore businesses  overseas\r\n\r\nand  link  up  with  Singapore business  clubs  and  chambers\r\n\r\nestablished in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Features of Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill addresses key aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  SBF  Council relating to the representation  of  the\r\n\r\nthree  local ethnic chambers and foreign chambers, compulsory\r\n\r\nmembership  and payment of subscriptions by larger companies.\r\n\r\nThe  legislation also provides for the appointment of a Board\r\n\r\nof Trustees, prescribes supervisory powers for this Board and\r\n\r\nrequires  SBF  to  keep  proper accounts  for  the  Board  to\r\n\r\noversee.   The  Bill includes the steps to be taken  for  the\r\n\r\ndissolution of the SBF, should this be done one day.  Let  me\r\n\r\nnow outline the key provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill spells out the main role and\r\n\r\nobjectives of the SBF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 specifies the requirement for the SBF Council\r\n\r\nto have the three ethnic chambers permanently represented and\r\n\r\nfor up to one-quarter of the seats to be allocated to foreign\r\n\r\nchambers.   The Pro tem Committee has proposed 20  seats  for\r\n\r\nthe Council.  Apart from the ethnic and foreign chambers, the\r\n\r\nrest  of the Council seats will be allocated to various local\r\n\r\nchambers,     business    associations    and    professional\r\n\r\norganisations based on an objective set of criteria, such  as\r\n\r\ntheir   membership  base  and  the  relative  importance   of\r\n\r\ndifferent  sectors  in our economy.   A  few  seats  will  be\r\n\r\nallocated  to  representatives who are  directly  elected  by\r\n\r\nmember  companies,  those which are not  represented  through\r\n\r\nchambers.  In addition to the 20 seats, the Council will  co-opt up to six members.  This arrangement will ensure that the\r\n\r\nSBF  leadership  structure is not rigid and unchanging.   The\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  the  Council will be specified  in  the  SBF\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that local companies with paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital of S$0.5 million and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabove and foreign companies with authorised share capital  of\r\n\r\nS$0.5 million and above shall be members of the SBF.  Smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies who have an interest in the SBF can still join  it.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  they are welcome to join it.  Alternatively,  they\r\n\r\nmay  find that joining an industry association or one of  the\r\n\r\nethnic chambers might serve their needs sufficiently.   Paid-up  share capital was chosen as it is a simple proxy for  the\r\n\r\nsize of a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7 provide for the appointment by the\r\n\r\nMinister  of a Board of Trustees and its functions.   As  the\r\n\r\nSBF will be financed by compulsory subscriptions, the Board's\r\n\r\nrole  is  to ensure that the SBF acts in furtherance  of  its\r\n\r\nConstitution  and the law, that the funds and assets  of  the\r\n\r\nSBF  are properly accounted for and safeguarded, and that the\r\n\r\nCouncil members are fit and proper to hold office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 9 pertain to the proper maintenance and\r\n\r\naudit  of the accounts and records of the SBF and the Board's\r\n\r\npowers to access these records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides that the SBF cannot be dissolved\r\n\r\nwithout  the  prior approval of the Minister,  and  that  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of the assets of the SBF, upon dissolution, shall be\r\n\r\napproved by the Board of Trustees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to perform its role effectively, the SBF needs\r\n\r\nadequate  resources.  As specified in clause 12, SBF  members\r\n\r\nwill  pay  an  annual  subscription not exceeding  a  cap  of\r\n\r\n$1,500.   The schedule of subscription fees will be drawn  up\r\n\r\nby  the SBF and must be approved by the Minister.  Under  the\r\n\r\nschedule  proposed  by  the  Pro tem  Committee,  the  annual\r\n\r\nsubscription  ranges  from  $300  to  $800.   Based  on   the\r\n\r\nsubscription rates proposed by the Pro tem Committee, the SBF\r\n\r\nwill  have an annual income of about $6 million to carry  out\r\n\r\nits programmes and activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends the Small Claims Tribunal Act to allow\r\n\r\nthe  SBF Council or an authorised SBF employee to recover any\r\n\r\nunpaid subscriptions through the Small Claims Tribunal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up its recommendations on the Bill, the Pro\r\n\r\ntem Committee worked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclosely  with  MTI and consulted widely and intensively  with\r\n\r\nthe   various   business  chambers  and  associations,   with\r\n\r\nprofessional  groups and with members of the general  public.\r\n\r\nMany  of the suggestions received have been incorporated into\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all\r\n\r\nthose who have given us their valuable feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the SBF is\r\n\r\nan  important initiative of the Singapore business  community\r\n\r\nwhich the Government supports.  With this Bill, the SBF  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  apex business organisation in Singapore representing\r\n\r\nthe  collective  interest of Singapore  businesses  here  and\r\n\r\nabroad.   The Government supports this initiative because  it\r\n\r\nwill benefit our economy, enhance tripartite co-operation and\r\n\r\nstrengthen our international position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe  Bill as it serves to create a new super chamber or  body\r\n\r\nto  act  as a powerful and concerted voice to speak  for  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community.  Similar federations of business  bodies\r\n\r\nhave  been  formed,  as  the  Minister  has  mentioned,   the\r\n\r\nKeidandren  in Japan, and others elsewhere.  In Britain,  the\r\n\r\nConfederation of British Industry (CBI) has been  formed  for\r\n\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I previously asked some Questions for Oral Answer\r\n\r\nin the House regarding this Bill.  At that time, the Minister\r\n\r\nreplied that the Bill was being formulated and he would  give\r\n\r\na   more   complete  answer  when  the  Bill  is  ready   for\r\n\r\npresentation to this House.  So I shall take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto ask a few questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on compulsory membership. According to clause\r\n\r\n5(1)   of  the  Bill,  membership  is  compulsory  for  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  with  paid-up capital of more  than  $500,000  and\r\n\r\nforeign companies with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthorised  share capital of over $500,000.   I  have  a  few\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Is it advisable to have compulsory membership by\r\n\r\nlaw,  for  both  local and foreign companies?   There  are  a\r\n\r\nmyriad of local and foreign companies.  Some may not find any\r\n\r\nreason  or need to join the SBF, or some can be dormant  even\r\n\r\nthough they have the qualifying $500,000 paid-up capital.  So\r\n\r\nwhy  not make the membership voluntary, instead of making  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory?   Under the compulsory scheme,  as  I  heard  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  they  would have collected  $6  million  from  the\r\n\r\nmembership fees.  That seems to be a large sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Why is there a difference in the definition used for\r\n\r\npaid-up  capital  for local companies and another  definition\r\n\r\nused for authorised share capital for foreign companies?   As\r\n\r\nI  understand  it,  unless  I am mistaken,  authorised  share\r\n\r\ncapital may not necessarily equate to paid-up capital because\r\n\r\nfull  equity  may  not  be  paid by  the  foreign  companies,\r\n\r\nalthough they may have the authorised share capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, representation of varied interests in the SBF.\r\n\r\nGiven that the SBF will be a large gathering of companies,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  how it can be effective in representing the wide  and\r\n\r\nvaried  interests  of  all its members.   Would  the  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies  feel that they have lesser representation  because\r\n\r\nthe  Council  could  be dominated by the  big  boys  and  the\r\n\r\nprominent businessmen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the role of the SBF vis-a-vis other business\r\n\r\nbodies,  a  query I have is how is the SBF going  to  operate\r\n\r\neffectively.  At present, the Bill provides for  three  local\r\n\r\nchambers  of  commerce and industry, ie, Chinese,  Malay  and\r\n\r\nIndian, to be represented on the Council.  But there are also\r\n\r\nmany  other  business and trade bodies that  are  already  in\r\n\r\nexistence.   They speak for their own industries'  interests.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  there is the Association of Small  and  Medium\r\n\r\nEnterprises   (ASME)   and  there  is  also   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConfederation of Industries (SCI).  What are their roles  now\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis  the  SBF?   The Minister has  explained  that  the\r\n\r\nSFCCI, which is the confederation of chambers of commerce,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis going to be closed.  But what about the SCI?  Will it also\r\n\r\nbecome  defunct or will it be invited to join the  SBF  as  a\r\n\r\ncomponent  member?   I  would like to  ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nenlighten us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the introduction of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is timely as it will see the birth of a  new  and\r\n\r\npowerful organisation which can represent the interest of all\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  It will also help look after the interest of the\r\n\r\nbusiness community within Singapore and represent Singapore's\r\n\r\nbusiness interest overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the SBF will provide mandatory\r\n\r\nrepresentation  on its Council for the three ethnic  chambers\r\n\r\nof  commerce.  This has been a matter of serious  concern  to\r\n\r\nthe three chambers concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I would like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nis  going to happen to the other two organisations,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Confederation of Industries (SCI) and the Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether there will be any\r\n\r\nmandatory provisions to provide for these organisations to be\r\n\r\nrepresented  on  the  SBF Council or whether  there  will  be\r\n\r\nspecial  provisions made in the Constitution of  the  SBF  to\r\n\r\nprovide for the membership of these two organisations on  the\r\n\r\nCouncil itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also unclear as to what exactly is the full\r\n\r\nscope  of activities of the SBF, as the Constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nSBF has not been disclosed to-date.  Perhaps the Minister can\r\n\r\nhighlight  the  principal areas SBF will be  concerned  with.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  matter of significance as some of  the  existing\r\n\r\nchambers rely on certain activities like issuing certificates\r\n\r\nof  origin  and  bar coding as a source of  income,  and  any\r\n\r\ncompetition from SBF in these areas will affect the income of\r\n\r\nthese chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the appointment powers. Clause\r\n\r\n6(1) of the Bill gives the Minister the power to appoint  the\r\n\r\nBoard of Trustees.  The Board of Trustees, in turn, is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  the  power to ensure that Council members are  persons\r\n\r\nwho are fit and proper to hold the position.  I am puzzled as\r\n\r\nto  why  the  Council is given the power when the  qualifying\r\n\r\ncriteria should be laid down in the Constitution of  the  SBF\r\n\r\nitself,  together  with other qualifying  criteria,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nperson should not be a bankrupt or have criminal records.  In\r\n\r\naddition, it would be a better idea if the tests of  fit  and\r\n\r\nproper  persons are clearly stated, ie, what are the criteria\r\n\r\nwhen  we  mean  \"a fit and proper person\", so that  everybody\r\n\r\nknows  whether  he  falls  within  these  criteria.   If  the\r\n\r\nindividual is not a fit and proper person, then he should  be\r\n\r\ndisqualified from standing for the elections to  the  Council\r\n\r\nright at the beginning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister why the Board\r\n\r\nof  Trustees must approve the appointment of the  members  to\r\n\r\nthe Council after they are properly elected by the members of\r\n\r\nthe  SBF  in  an election within the SBF.  This unnecessarily\r\n\r\ncurbs  the  freedom of the members of the SBF  from  electing\r\n\r\nmembers  who  they feel will represent their interests.   The\r\n\r\ninstances,  of when the Board of Trustees should not  approve\r\n\r\nthese  Council  members who are duly elected,  are  also  not\r\n\r\nspelt out clearly anywhere in the Bill, unless it is going to\r\n\r\nbe  provided  for in the Constitution of the  SBF.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that this clause be deleted as it curbs the right  of\r\n\r\nthe  SBF members to decide who represents them.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can share with us the experiences of  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  where  there  are  similar  organisations  on  how\r\n\r\nelections of their council members are done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the concern of the Government is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment view should be voiced in the Council, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmodel  of  the  Law  Society Council is  one  that  could  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.   The  Law  Society has  a  Council  where  three\r\n\r\nGovernment  appointees  are appointed  to  represent  certain\r\n\r\nviewpoints.  This is a model that the Minister could  perhaps\r\n\r\nconsider  for  the SBF.  Otherwise, it will be seen  by  some\r\n\r\nmembers  that the clause impinges on the right of  choice  of\r\n\r\nSBF members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the exemption powers of the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Clause 5(2)(c)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngives  the  Minister  the  power  to  exempt  companies  from\r\n\r\nbecoming  members  of  the SBF.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  clarification on the type of  companies  which\r\n\r\nwill  be exempted from membership.  A matter of concern among\r\n\r\nsome companies relates to holding companies that have several\r\n\r\nsingle-purpose companies, eg, shipping companies and property\r\n\r\ncompanies.   These are done primarily to protect  the  parent\r\n\r\ncompany  and other sister companies in the group  from  legal\r\n\r\nliabilities.   In  the case of property companies,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  that  a  separate company be  set  up  for  each\r\n\r\nproperty  development project.  Will exemption be granted  to\r\n\r\nsuch companies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to subscription monies. Clause\r\n\r\n12(3)  caps the maximum amount of subscription fee at  $1,500\r\n\r\nper  year.   I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  the  exact\r\n\r\nsubscription that will be collected from all companies  which\r\n\r\nqualify  to  be members as of today.  I think the figure  the\r\n\r\nMinister highlighted is $6 million.  I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  would consider  a  lower  subscription\r\n\r\namount as there are many companies which are going through  a\r\n\r\ndifficult phase now because of the economic climate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the last topic. I am happy that\r\n\r\ncompanies with a lower paid-up capital can become members  of\r\n\r\nSBF, as many may find a benefit in joining SBF because of the\r\n\r\nmany  activities  and programmes that it may  offer.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould also like to ask the Minister whether:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. partnerships and sole proprietorships can also\r\n\r\nbecome members of SBF, besides companies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. professional partnerships or sole proprietorships,\r\n\r\neg, lawyers, accountants and doctors, can also become members\r\n\r\nof the SBF; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. SBF will allow for individual members, as some\r\n\r\nexisting  chambers  allow  for  individual  membership   from\r\n\r\ncertain categories, eg, lawyers, IT professionals, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my main concerns. Despite all these\r\n\r\ncomments, I am confident that, with strong support  from  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community and the broad spectrum of support from all\r\n\r\nlarger  companies,  the SBF will grow  to  become  a  dynamic\r\n\r\norganisation.    I  am  also  confident,  as   the   Minister\r\n\r\nhighlighted,  that  the SBF will develop into  a  strong  and\r\n\r\nunited private-sector umbrella organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I support the Bill in principle  to  establish\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Business Federation (SBF) to take over the role\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore  Federation of Chambers  of  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  (SFCCI) as the apex body of the Singapore  business\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the SFCCI has, since its\r\n\r\ninauguration in 1978, been depending on its five  constituent\r\n\r\nmembers,  ie,  Singapore  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  Singapore  Confederation of Industries,  Singapore\r\n\r\nIndian   Chamber   of   Commerce  and   Industry,   Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Singapore\r\n\r\nMalay Chamber of Commerce and Industry for financial support.\r\n\r\nDespite its financial constraints, it has fulfilled its  role\r\n\r\nin  maintaining a useful channel of communication between the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community and the Government, as well  as  a  close\r\n\r\nworking relationship with its counterparts in ASEAN and other\r\n\r\ncountries.   It  has represented and safeguarded  Singapore's\r\n\r\ninterests  actively and consistently in ASEAN  CCI,  ICC  and\r\n\r\nother international fora.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective in its role, the SBF will require much\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources  to fund its activities,  especially  in\r\n\r\neconomic  research  and  overseas  assignments.   Since   the\r\n\r\nbusiness community will be the eventual beneficiary of  these\r\n\r\nservices,  it  is fair and reasonable for the  Government  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  this Bill to enable SBF to collect a small  annual\r\n\r\ncontribution from the larger and more successful companies to\r\n\r\nfund  its  activities.  And I sincerely hope  that  with  the\r\n\r\nstronger  financial resources and continued  support  of  the\r\n\r\nSFCCI\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituent members and other business associations, the  SBF\r\n\r\ncould  play  a  much more effective role in representing  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  our  business  community  within  and  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the SFCCI has effectively been\r\n\r\nfunctioning  as the apex body of major business chambers  and\r\n\r\nassociations  in  Singapore, successfully carrying  out  this\r\n\r\nfunction  in  close  cooperation with  its  five  constituent\r\n\r\nmembers without having to recruit direct corporate members in\r\n\r\ncompetition with its individual constituents.  It  has,  over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  accumulated  a wealth  of  practical  knowledge,\r\n\r\nnetworking experiences and negotiating skills in dealing with\r\n\r\nthe  national  and international issues which  are  of  great\r\n\r\nconcern to the business community.  It is, therefore, in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the SBF to tap the existing  human  and  other\r\n\r\nresources  of the SFCCI and its five constituent  members  to\r\n\r\nperform a larger role in the New Economy.  Naturally, we hope\r\n\r\nthat  SBF  will  stay with this practice and avoid  competing\r\n\r\nwith   its  constituents  in  recruiting  corporate   members\r\n\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill, however, provides that every local\r\n\r\ncompany  with a paid-up share capital of or above the  amount\r\n\r\nof  $500,000 shall automatically become a member of  the  SBF\r\n\r\nand be expected to pay an annual subscription of up to $1,500\r\n\r\nto SBF in any calendar year.  This has raised a great deal of\r\n\r\nconcern  among the SFCCI constituent members and the business\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFCCI's constituent members and many other trade\r\n\r\nassociations in Singapore want to know their role in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  role of SBF in addressing the needs and problems  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual companies and the specific industries.   Will\r\n\r\nthe  SBF  choose to ignore or compete with all  the  existing\r\n\r\nassociations  with a view to replacing or  diluting  them  in\r\n\r\nrepresenting the interests of their members?  Rather,  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  SBF will encourage smaller companies  with  less\r\n\r\nthan  $500,000  paid-up  share  capital  to  join  any  other\r\n\r\nchambers  of  commerce and industry and business associations\r\n\r\nso that their individual business needs can be catered to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  effectively  by  appropriate  associations  within  the\r\n\r\nrespective industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has clearly spelt out the payment obligations\r\n\r\nof  companies affected but failed to specify the services and\r\n\r\nbenefits  they will enjoy as members of SBF.  Many local  and\r\n\r\nforeign  companies  question the need to compel  them  to  be\r\n\r\nmembers  of  SBF  when they are already members  of  existing\r\n\r\nbusiness  chambers and trade associations.   These  companies\r\n\r\nwant  to know what specific kinds of membership services  the\r\n\r\nSBF  will provide and whether there will be a duplication  of\r\n\r\nservice at their expense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further concerns as regards the compulsory\r\n\r\nmembership  to  SBF and the quantum of annual  contributions.\r\n\r\nCompanies  are  worried that the SBF Council  could,  at  the\r\n\r\nslightest   excuse  in  the  future,  obtain  the  Minister's\r\n\r\napproval  to  increase  the annual  subscription  up  to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $1,500  under clause  12(1)  of  the  Bill.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  many SMEs are also worried that the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nlower the amount of paid-up share capital under clauses  5(1)\r\n\r\nand 5(2)(b) of the Bill to compel more SMEs to be members  of\r\n\r\nSBF  for  fund-raising  purposes in the  near  future.   This\r\n\r\nscenario may cause undue hardship to individual companies and\r\n\r\nthere  is no way for them to avoid payment except to wind  up\r\n\r\ntheir  business in Singapore.  Companies, therefore, want  to\r\n\r\nknow  what  are  the  safeguards against amendment  of  these\r\n\r\nclauses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business elites and professionals have also\r\n\r\nexpressed their concerns over the proposed appointment of the\r\n\r\nBoard of Trustees by the Minister to oversee the work of  SBF\r\n\r\nas  provided under clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill.  One possible\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the two clauses is that  it  will  be  the\r\n\r\nMinister and the Board of Trustees appointed by him  and  not\r\n\r\nthe  general membership of the SBF or its Council, that  will\r\n\r\nultimately decide who will run the SBF and how SBF should  be\r\n\r\nrun.    The  strong  Government  presence  within   the   SBF\r\n\r\ninevitably raises the question of accountability and  whether\r\n\r\nthe   SBF   will   be   able  to  function  effectively   and\r\n\r\nindependently as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  credible  and  representative body of the entire  business\r\n\r\ncommunity in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many want to know what kind of persons are deemed to be\r\n\r\nfit and proper persons to serve on both the Board of Trustees\r\n\r\nand  Council  of the SBF.  What will happen if  the  nominees\r\n\r\nelected  by  SBF  members  or the local  ethnic  and  foreign\r\n\r\nchambers of commerce and industry cannot be accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister?    Could   we  successfully  encourage   the   more\r\n\r\nsuccessful  and capable business elites and professionals  to\r\n\r\nserve  in the SBF Council with pride and commitment?  Can  we\r\n\r\npromote spontaneity, creativity and initiative in the SBF  to\r\n\r\nexpect   its  Council  members  to  speak  their   minds   in\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the specific industries without  any  fear  and\r\n\r\ninhibitions?  Can we ensure that the SBF is not perceived  as\r\n\r\nanother Government organisation or statutory body?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have painstakingly voiced the\r\n\r\ngenuine  concerns of the business community over the specific\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Bill because I strongly believe  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  a  strong and creditable SBF to serve as  an  effective\r\n\r\napex  business  body for the private sector.   The  SBF  must\r\n\r\ntruly  represent the entire Singapore business  community  in\r\n\r\nthe tripartism of our economy and in the international scene.\r\n\r\nIt is important for the Minister to address the issues raised\r\n\r\nat  the outset and make appropriate amendments to the Bill if\r\n\r\nnecessary.   This  is  to ensure that  we  reach  a  national\r\n\r\nconsensus in establishing the SBF for the benefit of  all  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Horn Kee, Mr Ravindran and Mr Tay Beng Chuan for their\r\n\r\nvery thoughtful comments about the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a step back and ask ourselves why such a\r\n\r\nBill is necessary.  I agree with Mr Ravindran and Mr Tay that\r\n\r\nit  is important that the SBF is a business organisation  and\r\n\r\nnot a Government organisation.  Our objective is not to have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  Government voice in it through our appointees, like in the\r\n\r\nLaw  Society, not at all.  Our objective is really to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  SBF to do the kind of good work which the SFCCI has done\r\n\r\nin the past and to do much more because of all the challenges\r\n\r\nthat   we   are  facing,  brought  about  as  a   result   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation and global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFCCI, within its framework, as Mr Tay Beng Chuan has\r\n\r\npointed out, has done an excellent job.  But because  of  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  nature  of  the  organisation,  it  faces  certain\r\n\r\nlimitations  and  the  principal limitation  is  a  financial\r\n\r\nlimitation.  And when Prime Minister Goh challenged SFCCI  to\r\n\r\nrestructure itself to become more effective, it came back  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Look,  the  only  way  is:  we  must  have  compulsory\r\n\r\nmembership  of larger companies so that it has got  a  steady\r\n\r\nflow  of  income.\"  So their request to us was to  legislate.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  legislate, we have responsibility.  And  since  the\r\n\r\npower   to   legislate   is  vested  in   this   House,   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility must come back to this House. Hence, the  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  Board  of Trustees.  We cannot have one  without  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee asked a fundamental question:</b> is it\r\n\r\nnecessary, in the first place, to have compulsory membership?\r\n\r\nOur  first  choice  was  never to have compulsory  membership\r\n\r\nwhich is why we never had this Bill all this while.  The fact\r\n\r\nis  we need it now and since we need it, and since it is this\r\n\r\nHouse  which would give power to the SBF to collect  payment,\r\n\r\nwe  must  set limits to it to ensure that the money collected\r\n\r\nand  the  assets accumulated are properly protected.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  a Board of Trustees, who will be  responsible\r\n\r\npeople,  people who are respected by Singaporeans, by members\r\n\r\nof  the  business community and it is for them to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  when  the Constitution is amended, that it  is  amended\r\n\r\nwith the mission in mind.  And that when Council members  are\r\n\r\nappointed, nominated or elected, these are people who are fit\r\n\r\nand proper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Ministry be involved? The Ministry should\r\n\r\nnot  be involved.  Should Parliament be involved?  Only  when\r\n\r\nbig\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings  are  impacted upon.   But as to issues  like  whether\r\n\r\nprofessional  groups should be allowed membership,  what  the\r\n\r\ndetailed aspects of the Constitution are, I would say, let us\r\n\r\ngo  back to one of the fundamental principles, which is  that\r\n\r\nSBF  is  not  a  statutory  board, it  is  not  a  Government\r\n\r\norganisation,  it  should  be left  mostly  to  run  its  own\r\n\r\naffairs.   Therefore, many of the comments  which  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought up, which are very important comments, are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nbuilt  into the heart of the Bill, which is a balance between\r\n\r\nhaving  a  business  federation  which  is  independent   and\r\n\r\ncreative  and accountable to its own members, and one  which,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  relies  upon Parliament to  give  it  powers  to\r\n\r\ncollect subscription, is also ultimately responsible for  the\r\n\r\nmission which we have set out in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go into some of the detailed questions which\r\n\r\nhave  been  raised  by our three Members of  Parliament.   Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee asked about the differences in definition  for\r\n\r\nlocally registered companies and foreign companies.  There is\r\n\r\na   difference  because,  for  local  branches   of   foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies,  there  is  no  reporting  mechanism  for  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital.   So  we  have  to  use the  best  proxy,  which  is\r\n\r\nauthorised paid-up capital.  About a thousand local  branches\r\n\r\nof foreign companies would be involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the \"fate\", to use the language of by Mr Leong and\r\n\r\nothers, of organisations like ASME, SCI, SICC, frankly,  that\r\n\r\nis    not   Parliament's   business.    These   are   private\r\n\r\norganisations.   It  is for them to decide  how  they  should\r\n\r\nreact to the formation of SBF.  How they should work the  SBF\r\n\r\nis  something between them and the SBF to decide.  I have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  SBF  would  not want to duplicate  or  replicate\r\n\r\nfunctions  already effectively performed by  these  chambers.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it is completely in the interest of the SBF to work\r\n\r\nwith  an economy of effort, to work through and with existing\r\n\r\norganisations.  Some of these organisations like SCI had done\r\n\r\na  very good job and I see no reason why there should be  any\r\n\r\ndiminution  in  their roles.  Others are less  effective  and\r\n\r\nthey will have to respond to the fact that there is now a new\r\n\r\norganisation with a clear\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose  and  with  a  steady source of income  to  fund  its\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked about issues concerning certificates\r\n\r\nof  origin and bar codings.  Where these are franchises given\r\n\r\nby  TDB,  it  is  really  for TDB  to  decide  whether  these\r\n\r\nfranchises  should  continue in the future.   Obviously,  TDB\r\n\r\nwould  make  no change without consultation with the  various\r\n\r\nagencies  involved.  As to questions concerning the exemption\r\n\r\nclause, single purpose companies like shipping companies  and\r\n\r\nproperty companies, MTI has had discussions with the Pro  tem\r\n\r\nCommittee,  which  in  turn  has  had  discussions  with  the\r\n\r\nindustry  players  involved.  The Pro tem Committee  told  me\r\n\r\nthat once you allow for certain groups to be exempted, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to draw the line because  there  are  always\r\n\r\nworthy causes to be exempted.  My response to them is, \"Well,\r\n\r\nI will have this clause in the Bill so that if I have to give\r\n\r\nan  exemption, I can.  But you must advise me whether you are\r\n\r\nmaking  any recommendations.\"  To-date, the Pro tem Committee\r\n\r\nhas  recommended  no  exempted  category.   So  that  is  the\r\n\r\nposition as it stands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On subscription rates, although we have set a cap at\r\n\r\n$1,500,  the  Pro  tem Committee has in fact,  worked  out  a\r\n\r\nschedule ranging from $300 to $800 for companies of different\r\n\r\nsizes.  They will take a practical approach and if these  are\r\n\r\nreasonable numbers, I, as the Minister, will approve them.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not intend to second guess why they set certain schedules\r\n\r\nfor  certain  groups  of  companies.   Can  they  raise  this\r\n\r\nsubscription  lightly, a point raised by Mr Tay  Beng  Chuan.\r\n\r\nNo, they cannot, because firstly, they must have my approval.\r\n\r\nI  am  accountable to this House and if I want to  go  beyond\r\n\r\n$1,500,  I  have  got to amend the Act which cannot  be  done\r\n\r\nlightly.   In  the same way, the fear that we may  lower  the\r\n\r\nthreshold of $0.5 million and suddenly make many SMEs pay up,\r\n\r\nthis  is  something  that  we cannot  do  lightly.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  we can only do when we come  back  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   I  am sure if we were to do that, many of you  would\r\n\r\nhave your views.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked whether partnerships and sole\r\n\r\nproprietorships will be allowed as members of the SBF.   That\r\n\r\nis  for the SBF to decide.  I have told them that they should\r\n\r\nconsider  it  and  I  believe they  are  favourably  disposed\r\n\r\ntowards  that idea.  In fact, the SBF Pro tem Committee  does\r\n\r\nnot  see the SBF as representing only the interest of  larger\r\n\r\ncompanies   who  are  its  compulsory  members.    They   see\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  representing  all  businesses  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding SMEs.  I believe that the interest of SMEs would be\r\n\r\nadequately  represented,  even  if  they  are  not   directly\r\n\r\nmembers,  by chambers such as the Chinese, Malay  and  Indian\r\n\r\nchambers and ASME.  But of course, if an SME does not want to\r\n\r\nbe  a  member  of such a chamber, but wants to  be  a  direct\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  SBF, it is free to do so.  We  allow  for  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of healthy competition but, as  Mr  Tay  Beng\r\n\r\nChuan  pointed  out,  without  wanting  to  cannibalise   the\r\n\r\nmembership of existing chambers and associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of SICC, which was raised by Mr Ravindran,\r\n\r\nis  an important one.  We had draft structures circulated  to\r\n\r\nthe  business  communities earlier  and  some  of  them  were\r\n\r\nconcerned that the SICC may not be able to represent national\r\n\r\nchambers sufficiently.  What we have done is to say  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, we allow up to one quarter of the Council's  seats\r\n\r\nto be allocated to foreign chambers, but it is for the SBF to\r\n\r\ndraw  up  rules  in  consultation with the  foreign  business\r\n\r\ncommunity on how best they should be represented.  And I  see\r\n\r\nthe  compromise being a combination of representation by  the\r\n\r\nSICC  and by the chambers of the major national groups  which\r\n\r\nare  in  Singapore.   I  believe  I  have  answered  all  the\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EDUCATION SERVICE INCENTIVE PAYMENT BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education plays a critical role in moulding the future\r\n\r\nof  our  nation.   Education  is  not  just  about  imparting\r\n\r\nacademic  knowledge.  It is about nurturing the whole  child.\r\n\r\nIt  is  about  developing the child morally,  intellectually,\r\n\r\nphysically,   socially  and  aesthetically.   It   is   about\r\n\r\nequipping our students for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers play a vital role in educating and developing\r\n\r\nour  young.   We  must have good teachers and  we  must  have\r\n\r\nenough  of  them.  Building up a strong teaching  force  with\r\n\r\ngood  experience  levels is one of the  challenges  we  face.\r\n\r\nMany countries face the same challenge.  This is all the more\r\n\r\nimportant for us because of the profile of our teachers.   We\r\n\r\nproject that one quarter of our 24,000 trained teachers  will\r\n\r\nretire  over  the  next 10 years.  We must therefore  attract\r\n\r\nyoung  people  with the right motivations and  commitment  to\r\n\r\njoin the teaching profession and, more importantly, to retain\r\n\r\nsufficient numbers of them.  We must ensure that our teachers\r\n\r\nare properly developed and properly rewarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with this in mind that the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nembarked  on  a  fundamental review of  the  pay  and  career\r\n\r\nstructure  of the Education Service in September  last  year.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the review was to better shape the Service to meet\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's organisational needs as well as the  personal\r\n\r\naspirations of teachers.  The Ministry completed  the  review\r\n\r\nin  April  this  year.    The package,  which  is  named  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Service Professional Development and Career  Plan,\r\n\r\nor  Edu-Pac  in  short, has been announced to  all  teachers.\r\n\r\nFeedback  on  the package has been positive.  Under  Edu-Pac,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  will implement a new career structure,  a  new\r\n\r\nrecognition structure and will enhance the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperformance    management   system   for    teachers.     The\r\n\r\nrecommendations are in the process of being implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The CONNECT Plan</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key component of Edu-Pac is the recognition structure,\r\n\r\nand  a  key component of the new recognition structure is  an\r\n\r\nincentive  payment  scheme  to  encourage  teachers  to  make\r\n\r\nteaching their life-long career, and at least their long-term\r\n\r\ncareer.   We are calling this the CONNECT Plan, which  stands\r\n\r\nfor CONtiNuity, Experience and Commitment in Teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will implement the Plan from 1st January next year.\r\n\r\nUnder  the Plan, the Ministry will set aside a sum  of  money\r\n\r\nevery  year  for each Education Officer who meets performance\r\n\r\nrequirements.  The amount will be a flat rate  based  on  the\r\n\r\nofficer's substantive grade and the number of years  that  he\r\n\r\nor  she  has been with the Ministry.  The amount, of  course,\r\n\r\nwill  be dependent on other factors such as the state of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposit amounts will range from $2,000 to $4,800 a\r\n\r\nyear.  At defined points every 3 to 5 years, officers will be\r\n\r\neligible  for a payout from the Plan.  The payout will  be  a\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the money that has been accumulated.   Larger\r\n\r\npayouts will be made at the 15th year of service and near the\r\n\r\nofficer's retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payouts and the money set aside are not an\r\n\r\nentitlement.  Officers will receive the payouts only if  they\r\n\r\nremain  in service and meet eligibility conditions.  Officers\r\n\r\nwho  resign will lose the money that has been set  aside  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newly trained teacher who joins service when the Plan\r\n\r\nis  implemented  and  stays for a full 40-year  career  could\r\n\r\npotentially  receive a total payout ranging from  $90,000  to\r\n\r\n$120,000, spread over nine payments throughout his career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CONNECT Plan will be available to all trained\r\n\r\nofficers  in  the Timescale grades employed on the  permanent\r\n\r\nestablishment.  Superscale officers will not be eligible  for\r\n\r\nthe Plan, as they will draw\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  benefits from their overall remuneration package.   So\r\n\r\nthis  Plan is really aimed at the main teaching force,  those\r\n\r\nwho work in the classrooms daily with the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both serving officers and new officers will benefit from\r\n\r\nthe  CONNECT  Plan.   Serving  officers  will  be  placed  at\r\n\r\nappropriate  points  of  the  Plan.   We  will   manage   the\r\n\r\ntransition such that the longer-serving officers will see  an\r\n\r\nearlier payout from the Plan.  There will however not be  any\r\n\r\nretrospective amounts given for past service as this is a new\r\n\r\nfund that has been set aside from next year onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House entitled \"The Education\r\n\r\nService Incentive Payment Act\" provides for the establishment\r\n\r\nof  the  CONNECT Plan and the CONNECT Fund.  Let me highlight\r\n\r\nthe key clauses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for regulations to be made to\r\n\r\nestablish and administer the CONNECT Plan.  This will  enable\r\n\r\nus  to  fine-tune the CONNECT Plan as we progress  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the CONNECT Plan remains effective and relevant towards\r\n\r\nits objective of helping to retain teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 10 provide for the CONNECT Plan to be an\r\n\r\neligibility and not an entitlement.  Officers will  not  have\r\n\r\nabsolute  rights  to any payment under the CONNECT  Plan  and\r\n\r\nGovernment's  rights to dismiss officers without compensation\r\n\r\nwill  also not be limited.  The money set aside for  officers\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  transferable and will not  form  part  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers'  properties or estates.  The Government  will  also\r\n\r\nreserve  the  right  to  withhold or refuse  any  payment  to\r\n\r\nofficers who have been convicted in court or have been  dealt\r\n\r\nwith disciplinarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 to 18 provide for the establishment and\r\n\r\nmanagement of a new Government Fund called the CONNECT  Fund.\r\n\r\nMoney  will be set aside each year from the Ministry's budget\r\n\r\nand  paid  into the Fund.  The periodic payouts  to  officers\r\n\r\nwill  be made from this Fund.  By setting aside money in  the\r\n\r\nFund,  we can be assured that there will be sufficient  money\r\n\r\nto pay officers eligible for the payouts and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  their payouts will not be affected by the state of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  budget  in  any  particular  year.   Besides  the\r\n\r\npayouts under the CONNECT Plan, the Fund will also be used to\r\n\r\nmeet expenses related to the administration of the Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the CONNECT Plan and the other\r\n\r\nparts  of Edu-Pac are now being implemented and taking shape.\r\n\r\nThe  Education Service Incentive Payment Act is a key element\r\n\r\nof  the  comprehensive plan that the Ministry is  putting  in\r\n\r\nplace to build a high quality Education Service.  This is our\r\n\r\ninvestment for our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to  establish the CONNECT Plan as a  means  to  retain\r\n\r\nteachers,  particularly  young  teachers,  in  the   teaching\r\n\r\nservice.  It is an award scheme with payments at intermediate\r\n\r\nbreak  points  in a teacher's career.  With  this  scheme  in\r\n\r\nplace,  the  teachers would have some monetary  incentive  to\r\n\r\nlook  forward to as they progress in their careers.  It  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  valuable  tool  to motivate the  teachers  when  their\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  starts to wane, commitment starts to  waver,  and\r\n\r\nrealism sets in after a few years of service.  For those  who\r\n\r\nwould otherwise have quit the teaching profession, the scheme\r\n\r\nwould give them cause to pause and weigh the pros and cons of\r\n\r\ncompleting  the remainder of a prescribed qualifying  period.\r\n\r\nAs  such, Sir, I support this initiative by the Ministry,  as\r\n\r\nany programme that helps to retain teachers in the service is\r\n\r\nworthy  of consideration.  Without a doubt, we shall try  our\r\n\r\nvery best to retain the best teachers in the education of our\r\n\r\nnext generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in presenting the scheme to the teachers, I think\r\n\r\nit is important to re-emphasise that the CONNECT payments are\r\n\r\nover  and  above the existing compensation for the  teachers.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Ministry has already just reviewed teachers' pay  in\r\n\r\nthe past year, there is no question in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy mind that this money paid into the CONNECT Fund is removed\r\n\r\nfrom  funds that would have otherwise been incorporated  into\r\n\r\nthe  pay  increases of the teachers concerned in  the  future\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already elaborated on some of the\r\n\r\ndetails of the scheme and I believe the total sum to be  paid\r\n\r\nout is quite attractive and shall be welcome by the teachers.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  while  financial incentive  is  an  important\r\n\r\nuseful  tool,  we should not depend entirely on  a  financial\r\n\r\nincentive scheme like the CONNECT Plan to solve the retention\r\n\r\nproblem of the teachers.  Many teachers left the service  for\r\n\r\nother  reasons  as  well, and these reasons  or  root  causes\r\n\r\nshould be addressed.  Therefore, I think it is useful for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to review the issue of retention in total  and  not\r\n\r\ndepend  principally on the CONNECT scheme.  In his speech,  I\r\n\r\nheard  the Minister mention that he has implemented the  Edu-Pac  scheme  to  review the Education Service in  total,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps  he should take this opportunity in implementing  the\r\n\r\nscheme to review all the related issues of teacher retention,\r\n\r\neg, workload, career path, training and upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the heavy workload of the\r\n\r\nteachers   is   a  perennial  issue.   The  introduction   of\r\n\r\nadministrative assistants in the school is a  good  start  to\r\n\r\nreduce the workload, but we should not stop there.  We  could\r\n\r\nreview  the  course load and other unnecessary demands  on  a\r\n\r\nteacher's time.  A lower workload might have a better effect,\r\n\r\nin  the  sense that it would make the pace more bearable  for\r\n\r\nthe teachers who are in for the long haul.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also look into the career development and\r\n\r\nretraining  of the teachers.  Other staff retention  measures\r\n\r\nshould continue to be pursued.  These include the pursuit  of\r\n\r\nhigher  qualifications,  career opportunities  in  education,\r\n\r\nattendance at seminars, workshops and other courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now touch on a few\r\n\r\ndetails   of   the  Bill.   I  believe  this  Bill   excludes\r\n\r\nindependent schools.  I understand that the teachers employed\r\n\r\ndirectly by the eight independent schools\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not included, for the reason that their terms of service\r\n\r\nare  different.   I am wondering whether the Government  will\r\n\r\ntake  care  of these teachers through some parallel measures,\r\n\r\nso that they do not feel left out by the introduction of this\r\n\r\nscheme when the majority of teachers in Singapore would start\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  something over and above their  current  salaries.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  since we have a different category  of  schools\r\n\r\ncalled   independent  schools  and  if  more  schools  become\r\n\r\nindependent,  how do we treat the transition of  teachers  in\r\n\r\nthose schools going independent in the future when they  have\r\n\r\nalready  been vested by an endowment or award scheme in  this\r\n\r\nCONNECT Plan?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 7 states that the contributions or awards\r\n\r\ndue to a member will be \"excluded property\" from the bankrupt\r\n\r\nmember's  estate.  This gives the impression that  a  teacher\r\n\r\nwho  has  served the prescribed period and qualified for  the\r\n\r\nawards would still be entitled to the money even though he is\r\n\r\nadjudicated a bankrupt later.  However, the Explanatory  Note\r\n\r\non  clause  8, which is the clause on \"Effect on  conviction,\r\n\r\ndismissal,  etc.\",  dealing with the  effect  of  bankruptcy,\r\n\r\nconviction,  dismissal,  states that  \"Contributions  may  be\r\n\r\nwithheld  and awards refused if the member is a bankrupt  .\".\r\n\r\nSir,   this  means  that  a  bankrupt  might  lose  all   his\r\n\r\nentitlements under the scheme for past contributions and  for\r\n\r\nservice rendered.  I wonder why the Explanatory Note of  this\r\n\r\nBill   needs   to  include  this  statement  on   bankruptcy,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  we are taking measures  in  this  House  to\r\n\r\nrender this society more tolerant of failures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8: Effect on conviction, dismissal, etc on Awards\r\n\r\nand  Contributions.  I believe it is justifiable to  withhold\r\n\r\nor  refuse to pay, in part or in whole, if a member has  been\r\n\r\ndismissed  or  charged with any disciplinary charge  for  any\r\n\r\nnegligence  or misconduct.  It also would seem reasonable  to\r\n\r\ndeny  payment if a member is convicted and sentenced to death\r\n\r\nor  for  other penal servitude.  But there is a provision  to\r\n\r\ndeny  payment to a member if he or she were sentenced to  any\r\n\r\nterm of imprisonment for any crime or offence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  seems to me rather punitive.  Perhaps that is  the  way\r\n\r\nall  Bills  in this House are written.  But if we read  those\r\n\r\nclauses,  one  gets  the impression that  a  member  of  this\r\n\r\nCONNECT  Plan  might lose his entitlement  even  if  he  were\r\n\r\nimprisoned for one day for a non-criminal offence.  I realise\r\n\r\nthat in the Explanatory Note of the Bill, it did mention that\r\n\r\nclause 8 would come into force if the member is sentenced  to\r\n\r\ncertain  penalties due to conviction.  This implies  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  necessarily  come into  force  for  all  offences\r\n\r\nresulting  in imprisonment.  But, nonetheless,  I  feel  that\r\n\r\nperhaps the Minister could elaborate on the types of offences\r\n\r\nthat would be covered by this clause 8.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nSir,  for the time and thank you also, Members of the  House,\r\n\r\nfor believing that I can do something as an NMP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support, in principle, this Bill but I have a few\r\n\r\nreservations  that  I  hope  the  Education  Minister   would\r\n\r\nelaborate.   The first one being that the objective  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  is to keep teachers in the fore.  While these are great\r\n\r\nmonetary  benefits that are coming by for  teachers  who  are\r\n\r\njust beginning as well as teachers who have been there for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time, I fear that in the implementation of this scheme,\r\n\r\nteachers  who  have  been there for a  long  time,  here  the\r\n\r\npremise we are talking about is good loyal teachers, might be\r\n\r\ndemoralised in seeing younger teachers catch up in  a  matter\r\n\r\nof  a  few years under this scheme and with better incentives\r\n\r\nthan  themselves.   So  I just wonder whether  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  could go further with the CONNECT Plan and  perhaps\r\n\r\ngive a token lump sum payment in appreciation to teachers who\r\n\r\nhave given long years of service so that they continue to  be\r\n\r\ngood serving officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I have here is that all this is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be based on a good appraisal scheme.  I think  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  a lot of good things coming the teachers'  way  - performance bonuses and good promotion prospects.  And now we\r\n\r\nhave the CONNECT Plan too.  It then becomes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimperative, I believe, for the Education Ministry to  have  a\r\n\r\nstaff  appraisal scheme that is consistent - it is a daunting\r\n\r\ntask  -  because we are talking about 22,000 teachers  spread\r\n\r\nacross  more than 200 schools of different streams and school\r\n\r\ntypes.  But when the Government is giving out quite a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  in terms of incentives, I would like to know  how  the\r\n\r\nEducation Ministry would implement a good standardised system\r\n\r\nof appraisal better than what it already has.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point here is the whole question of exclusion.\r\n\r\nLike  Dr Wang, I too have questions about independent  school\r\n\r\nteachers.  Perhaps, is it possible that there is a co-sharing\r\n\r\npayment scheme for independent schools such that teachers who\r\n\r\nteach  in independent schools do not lose out on the  CONNECT\r\n\r\nPlan?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group that I would like to talk about is the\r\n\r\nspecial education teachers.  I know that for years they  have\r\n\r\nfallen  between the cracks of the Ministry of Education,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development and Sports as well  as  the\r\n\r\nNational Council of Social Service.  There are many among the\r\n\r\nalmost  500  teachers  giving lots  of  long  years  of  good\r\n\r\nservice.   Without belabouring their contributions,  I  think\r\n\r\nperhaps  it  would be timely if the Education Ministry  could\r\n\r\nmainstream  special education teachers and  include  them  in\r\n\r\nplans  like  this  or  see how there  can  be  some  kind  of\r\n\r\ncontribution    across   the   Ministries    and    different\r\n\r\norganisations  such  that they too do not  lose  out  in  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I do agree with Dr Wang that these are great\r\n\r\nplans  -  the  CONNECT Plan is good; it is a good  incentive.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think there is something greater,  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nsystemic situation, within the education system that we  need\r\n\r\nto  look  at closely.  And I think right now there may  be  a\r\n\r\nsituation, with the recession, that we might have one or  two\r\n\r\nyears'  lead  time  to perhaps see who among  our  retrenched\r\n\r\nofficers can support the school system as a parallel layer of\r\n\r\nsupport staff, or whatever, so that we can beef up the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole education system and teachers do not feel overburdened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nit  has been a long day and I think actually Dr Wang and Miss\r\n\r\nBraemaputhri  have covered a lot of ground and issues  I  had\r\n\r\nwanted  to  raise.  So I am just going to be very  brief  and\r\n\r\nrestrict myself to saying I fully support the Plan.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  wonderful that we have been hearing in the  media  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes and plans that the Ministry put up for  the  high-flyers,  principals'  training, and, I  think,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nLeaders  in  Education  Programme and Master  Teachers.   But\r\n\r\nthese are the high-flyers and they are important because  you\r\n\r\nleverage  on  them.   You  get  a  multiplier  effect.   But,\r\n\r\nessentially,  the high-flyers alone cannot do the  job.   You\r\n\r\nneed the rank-and-file, the majority of those 25,000 teachers\r\n\r\nwho  you  have to keep on board, who you have to acknowledge,\r\n\r\nand  keep their spirits up, and give them incentives to  stay\r\n\r\non.  Because, regardless of what wonderfully well-crafted and\r\n\r\nfarsighted policies you may have coming out of the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nyou   cannot  have  successful  implementation  without  that\r\n\r\ncontinuity  and that mass of teaching workforce  staying  on.\r\n\r\nSo  I  think this is a great plan.  Details of issues  to  be\r\n\r\nraised,  I think, have pretty much been covered.  So I  would\r\n\r\njust like to say I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often, we tend to associate economic downturn with\r\n\r\ngloom  and doom.  We tend to miss out on the silver  linings.\r\n\r\nThere  are  opportunities  even in  downturns,  sometimes  in\r\n\r\nunexpected  forms.   For example, I see the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  as  opportune  to  incentivise  both  prospective\r\n\r\nteachers  and  current teachers to join  and  remain  in  the\r\n\r\nteaching   profession.   After  all,  the  current   economic\r\n\r\ndownturn has caused many mid-career professionals to look for\r\n\r\nalternatives  and  possibly  making  teaching  their   second\r\n\r\ncareer.   The  current economic climate has  also  helped  to\r\n\r\ntransform  our universities and polytechnics into  favourable\r\n\r\nhunting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrounds  to recruit more teachers for our schools.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  many  schools are finding it easier to engage  contract\r\n\r\nteachers as compared to last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the current economic uncertainty, one\r\n\r\nthing remains certain - our people are the best resources and\r\n\r\nthat  we  should continue to invest in our people, especially\r\n\r\nin  educating and equipping our next generation to  face  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  ahead.  To succeed in educating our children  for\r\n\r\nthe new millennium, we need to retain and enlarge our pool of\r\n\r\ndedicated  teachers  over  time.   Too  often,  due  to   the\r\n\r\nresignations of teachers, our students' learning  journey  is\r\n\r\ndisrupted.   I  understand that in some of our  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools,  some  students have to endure up to four  different\r\n\r\nteachers  for  the  same subject during  the  year  owing  to\r\n\r\nresignations, contract teachers leaving to study in NIE,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   Our students' learning journey requires experienced\r\n\r\nteachers  who  are  committed to teach and impart  the  right\r\n\r\nvalue to our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is ultimately human enterprise requiring\r\n\r\ncommitted  teachers to reach out and touch the lives  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  To do this, we need more experienced teachers.  We\r\n\r\nneed  to  both  attract and retain our  teachers.   For  this\r\n\r\npurpose, I commend MOE for their Edu-Pac strategy to help  to\r\n\r\nattract and retain our teachers.  The salary revisions are in\r\n\r\nthe  right  direction.   The creation of  Senior  and  Master\r\n\r\nTeachers, appointments under the Teaching Track Scheme, is in\r\n\r\nthe right direction.  I understand that some of our teachers,\r\n\r\nincluding contract teachers, are very bright and can  go  far\r\n\r\nif  they  are  prepared to commit themselves to the  teaching\r\n\r\ncareer, which is to seek to incentivise both current teachers\r\n\r\nand  teachers-to-be to remain in service through longer  term\r\n\r\nmeasures such as the CONNECT Plan.  We must ensure that their\r\n\r\nfuture is properly taken care of and we must ensure that  our\r\n\r\nteachers get their due respect and reward.  After all, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  a situation where teachers join the profession  by\r\n\r\nthe  hordes  only to leave a couple of years later  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy  rebounds.   This  would  defeat  the  purpose.   Our\r\n\r\nschools are not a dumping ground for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who  are only interested in seeking shelter  from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic  storm.   The teaching  profession  is  for\r\n\r\nprofessionals committed to the mission of preparing our  next\r\n\r\ngeneration  for  new millennium changes  and  not  for  fair-weather job seekers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I support the Bill. I would also, however,\r\n\r\nlike  to  raise  two concerns which I hope the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nclarify.   My fellow MPs have asked the Minister to  consider\r\n\r\nways in which the CONNECT Plan can recognise in part the past\r\n\r\nservices of teachers.  As it is, the teachers' past years  of\r\n\r\nservice are not recognised to any extent in the CONNECT Plan,\r\n\r\nas  specified in the Bill.  Our older teachers, those in  the\r\n\r\nlate  40s  and 50s, are on the old pension scheme  and  their\r\n\r\nretirement  needs taken care of.  But the teachers  who  have\r\n\r\nserved five, 10 or 15 years and so on are not likely to be on\r\n\r\nany  incentive payment scheme.  To start them with  the  same\r\n\r\nyear as newly graduate teachers is no incentive for them.   I\r\n\r\nam  not suggesting that the past years of service of teachers\r\n\r\nnot  on  the pension scheme should be recognised in full.   I\r\n\r\nacknowledge that these teachers are on different remuneration\r\n\r\nschemes altogether.  As a gesture of goodwill and recognition\r\n\r\ntowards  the  long service of these teachers, I propose  that\r\n\r\nMOE consider their past years of service partially.  I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  CONNECT Plan should be so clinical  in  its\r\n\r\nstarting  date  for these teachers as it may send  the  wrong\r\n\r\nsignals to our older teachers not on the pension scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nclarify  how  his  Ministry intends to implement  the  scheme\r\n\r\nwithout  a  concomitant pension scheme  mentality.   By  this\r\n\r\nterm,  I refer to the mindset of teachers who have lost their\r\n\r\ninterest  and passion for teaching but are still  staying  on\r\n\r\nthe job for the sake of the incentive payment scheme.  Having\r\n\r\nlost  their interest and passion for teaching, these teachers\r\n\r\nalso exhibit none of the innovative and creative quality that\r\n\r\nI   feel  are  the  necessary  qualifications  for  our   new\r\n\r\nmillennium teachers.  Going forward would witness  even  more\r\n\r\nrapid changes to our environment and the use of technology in\r\n\r\nthe teaching syllabus and in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   methods  of  teaching.   Instead  of  accelerating  the\r\n\r\nlearning  journeys  of our students, these pension  mentality\r\n\r\nteachers  may instead put the brakes on the learning journeys\r\n\r\nbecause they themselves are finding it difficult to cope with\r\n\r\nthe  changes.   To  this end, I wish to seek  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance  that there are measures taken to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nCONNECT  Plan  does not breed a pension mentality  among  our\r\n\r\nteachers.  After all, the principal aim of this plan  is  not\r\n\r\nmerely to attract and retain more teachers but to enlarge the\r\n\r\npool  of  dedicated and experienced teachers.  We should  not\r\n\r\nmerely  be  looking  at  numbers  but  also  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these concerns that I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nclarify, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the CONNECT Plan because it is an\r\n\r\ninnovative and radical scheme.  Unless we try and  test  this\r\n\r\nout,  we  would not be able to know the results.   I  support\r\n\r\nthis because it is a radical departure from all other efforts\r\n\r\nthat  have  been undertaken.  However, I feel that incentives\r\n\r\nalone  are not sufficient because there is a need to look  at\r\n\r\nother  efforts to try and improve the whole education system.\r\n\r\nWhat   I  would  like  to  see  is  a  need  to  review   the\r\n\r\norganisational   structure,   both   at   the   middle,   the\r\n\r\nadministrative level and at the school level.  I  would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister whether there will be more efforts  to\r\n\r\nallow  teachers to make decisions, to be able  to  take  more\r\n\r\ncharge at the school level and whether we are also looking at\r\n\r\nproviding  more  autonomy to various schools  to  manage  and\r\n\r\ndirect themselves because these are issues which will address\r\n\r\nthe   organisational  culture  and  the  structure   at   the\r\n\r\nimplementation level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that these issues which have a direct bearing\r\n\r\non  the  sustenance of teachers, to improve their morale,  to\r\n\r\nallow  more creativity and innovation to take place,  to  me,\r\n\r\nare equally important.  What I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to  find  out  from  the  Minister  is,  since  he  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  number  of changes to  the  teaching  service,\r\n\r\nwhether the attrition of teachers has been arrested over  the\r\n\r\nlast five years.  Is he able to retain more teachers and,  if\r\n\r\nso,  is  he satisfied that the earlier incentives and changes\r\n\r\nhave in fact addressed some of the attrition problems?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that I would also like to point out is\r\n\r\nthat we should not neglect teachers who are providing support\r\n\r\nto  the special education sector.  There is a large number of\r\n\r\nteachers  who  have  been contributing to  the  education  of\r\n\r\nspecial children and they have spent many dedicated years  of\r\n\r\nservice.   I hope that this CONNECT Plan will be extended  to\r\n\r\nthem.  What I would like to ask the Minister is whether he is\r\n\r\nlooking at the needs of these teachers who deserve attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to find out from the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether teachers from independent schools would benefit  from\r\n\r\nthis CONNECT Plan too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I would like to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to thank all the Members who spoke for their support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.

The recognition\r\n\r\nsystem is part of Edu-Pac and this CONNECT Plan is also  only\r\n\r\none  part  of the recognition scheme.  In Edu-Pac, there  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  a  revision  in  the whole  career  structure  of\r\n\r\nteachers  to have different tracks - the teaching track,  the\r\n\r\nprofessional track and the leadership track.  This  would  go\r\n\r\nsome  way  to  address some of the concerns  that  have  been\r\n\r\nraised  by  Dr  Wang and some of the other Members  who  have\r\n\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some specific questions have been raised: whether\r\n\r\nmonetary incentives are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenough  and whether we have to do many other things to retain\r\n\r\nour teachers.  Certainly, we have to do many other things  to\r\n\r\nretain  our teachers.  And under Edu-Pac and in the  revision\r\n\r\nof  the way that we manage our schools, we intend to do that.\r\n\r\nWe  are giving a lot more autonomy to our schools.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  see  much more initiative and creativity  being\r\n\r\nexercised  by the school leadership in the middle  management\r\n\r\nas  well as giving teachers more room in order to make use of\r\n\r\nnew  strategies in the classrooms.  These are all the  things\r\n\r\nwhich  we  want to encourage, and which we want to  see,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  we  believe would also give the teachers  a  lot  more\r\n\r\nsatisfaction in the kind of work that they do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of workload, this is also an area which we are\r\n\r\nvery  concerned about, and we watch that carefully.   One  of\r\n\r\nthe  ways in which we can reduce the workload of teachers  is\r\n\r\nreally to have more teachers so that there are more shoulders\r\n\r\nin  which to spread the load.  Edu-Pac, I believe, will  help\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  we have more teachers in the  schools.   In\r\n\r\nfact, I am happy to report to this House that, over the  last\r\n\r\nfour  to five years, we have actually been able to fill  most\r\n\r\nof  the vacancies in the schools.  There are of course always\r\n\r\nsome  frictional  issues  because teachers  may  leave  at  a\r\n\r\nparticular  point in time and there will be  some  vacancies.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  managed to fill most of the vacancies  in  the\r\n\r\nschools.   Not  only  that, we have managed  to  add  to  the\r\n\r\nestablishments  of  the schools so that, today,  compared  to\r\n\r\nfive years ago, I would say that, on average, each school has\r\n\r\nbetween five and seven more teachers than they used to  have.\r\n\r\nAnd  each school has three more support staff than they  used\r\n\r\nto  have,  compared to five years ago.  So the  situation  of\r\n\r\nworkload  and support staff is improving.  But there  are  no\r\n\r\nmagical  solutions.  I cannot click my fingers  and  suddenly\r\n\r\nproduce tens of thousands of people who will meet the quality\r\n\r\nstandard that I am sure this House will demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On independent schools, independent school teachers are\r\n\r\nnot  covered  under the CONNECT Plan because the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation does not employ them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  independent schools employ them directly.  What we would\r\n\r\ndo  is that, in our subvention to the independent schools, we\r\n\r\nwould  increase the subvention to include what we would  have\r\n\r\ngiven under the CONNECT Plan.  So it is up to the independent\r\n\r\nschools to devise their own structures in order to reward the\r\n\r\nteachers in the way that they feel is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have all these exclusions in the Bill for the\r\n\r\npay-out from the CONNECT fund?  The reason that we have to do\r\n\r\nso  is  basically  because we want to make  sure  that  these\r\n\r\nCONNECT pay-outs do not become an entitlement, and that we do\r\n\r\nhave  provisions in the Act to allow us to withhold  payments\r\n\r\nfor  good  reasons.  So we include all the  reasons  that  we\r\n\r\nthink  may  arise  which would result in  us  saying,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nperhaps  it  is not such a good idea to pay out these  monies\r\n\r\nfrom  the CONNECT fund to this particular teacher because  it\r\n\r\nwould reflect badly on the service if we were to do so.\"   So\r\n\r\nall these exclusions are there for that purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we taking care of the older teachers? The principle\r\n\r\nunder  which we will do the pay-outs is this.  First of  all,\r\n\r\nthis  is new money.  So I do not have funds basically  to  go\r\n\r\nback and reward teachers for the last 20, 30, or 40 years  of\r\n\r\nservice.  But in any case, those teachers would have received\r\n\r\ntheir  fair remuneration for those periods of time.  Teachers\r\n\r\nwho  are  longer  in the service would also be  generally  on\r\n\r\nhigher  salary scales because they have had more  increments.\r\n\r\nBut  what  we  will make sure of in the CONNECT Plan  in  the\r\n\r\ndesign of the pay-outs is that those who have been longer  in\r\n\r\nservice  will see their pay-outs earlier than those who  have\r\n\r\nbeen shorter in the service.  We will stagger it that way  so\r\n\r\nthat  the first people to get pay-outs from the CONNECT  fund\r\n\r\nwill  be  the older teachers.  And then we will schedule  the\r\n\r\nyounger teachers to receive their pay-outs later.  They  will\r\n\r\nall  receive  their pay-in into their own little accounts  at\r\n\r\nthe same time.  But the older teachers will be the first ones\r\n\r\nto be able to draw on their CONNECT fund, and I think that is\r\n\r\nquite fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff appraisal system is also a very important part of\r\n\r\nthe system.  We have to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  able to appraise our staff well in order to put in  place\r\n\r\nbonuses,  and  so  on.   Staff  appraisal  is  probably  more\r\n\r\nimportant  for  bonuses and promotions than for  the  CONNECT\r\n\r\nPlan  because the CONNECT Plan applies to everybody.  But  we\r\n\r\nare  putting in place quite a new staff appraisal system  and\r\n\r\nwe  are going to introduce some revisions to that also at the\r\n\r\nend of this year.  And this is important so that the teachers\r\n\r\nwill be incentivised to perform well and will not have, as Mr\r\n\r\nNoris Ong said, a \"pension mentality\".  So bonuses, appraisal\r\n\r\nsystems,  promotions, are the kinds of things which  we  will\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that teachers will remain motivated  if  they  do\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On special education teachers, I cannot apply the\r\n\r\nCONNECT  Plan  to special education teachers because  special\r\n\r\neducation  teachers  are  not employed  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and we will not be able to pay them.  I would  have\r\n\r\nno standing to pay them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some suggestions about making use of the\r\n\r\nrecession to employ more people.  Yes, certainly, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare doing that.  Our recruitment has been excellent over this\r\n\r\npast period and our attrition has been relatively low.  But I\r\n\r\nam  realistic enough to know that it is not just  because  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education, the economy has helped a lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I have answered most of the questions\r\n\r\nposed by Members.  And I would just like to thank Members for\r\n\r\ngiving  me this extra weapon in the arsenal to build  a  good\r\n\r\nteaching force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [RAdm Teo Chee Hean].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Friday, 12th October\r\n\r\n2001.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-eight minutes past Six o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to Friday, 12th October, 2001.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
