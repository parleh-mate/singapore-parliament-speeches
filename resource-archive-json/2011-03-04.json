It also enhanced the PIC, giving the businesses more incentives to improve their productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the Government has prepared a full basket of carrots for the rabbits&nbsp;&ndash; SMEs&nbsp;&ndash; to eat. This is exciting news indeed! However, I have asked many people and they have raised this concern: the carrots are strung up too high, so how can the rabbits reach them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the Government has been supporting the SMEs unswervingly all along. However, due to the somewhat complicated application procedures and a&nbsp; rather long approval process, many companies have been held back.&nbsp; SMEs that have benefited are few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take SCCCI as an example. We set up our first overseas office in Shanghai as a response to the Economic Strategies Committee's (ESC) call.&nbsp; Last July, we applied for the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) scheme. Although we could not ascertain if the application would be approved, we still resolved to set up the Shanghai office in October last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made the right decision. So far, we have signed MOUs with five local trade associations and the Chongqing Liangjiang New Area.&nbsp; Our Shanghai office will facilitate mutual visits and business matching. Meanwhile, we are also in discussion with other ethnic associations on collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 25th&nbsp;February this year, the grant was finally approved.&nbsp; We were relieved. Here, I would like to thank MTI and IE Singapore for their trust and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3626</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the NPF has increased to $2 billion. This is a huge sum which promises a lot of carrots for the rabbits. However, what we are concerned about is how SMEs can meet the requirements of the Government agencies to enjoy the grant.&nbsp; SCCCI waited seven months for the approval; this was not long, but do other SMEs have the resources to wait this long?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I suggest we streamline the application process and shorten the time needed to apply and get funds. This will make the first step easy for SMEs and the rabbits would have the chance to eat the carrots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget has greatly enhanced the PIC scheme. Companies, however, can only reap benefits in the next financial year.&nbsp; Water afar cannot slake the thirst now.&nbsp; Many SMEs are short of capital.&nbsp; Purchase of new equipment, training of staff, innovation and development all need large upfront capital. When the rabbit is hungry, you present it with a carrot; it may not be a whole carrot, it can be half or one-third. With that, the rabbit can develop some strength first and then will have energy to grab more carrots to improve productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that we change the way PIC is applied. We can let the companies enjoy the incentives earlier. This may increase the workload of Government agencies, but the most meaningful thing is for the rabbit to be able to eat the carrots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both NPF and PIC are designed to help companies improve productivity. The next thing we are concerned about is how to implement them effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean announced that the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council has identified 12 sectors that \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3627</p>\r\n\r\nhave greater room to improve productivity. Among the 12 sectors, seven have already formulated their roadmap. SCCCI has 137 trade association members; we are more than willing to help the Government implement the roadmap according to industry characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a smooth implementation, I suggest that trade associations be invited to join the review and implementation process. Being insiders with most knowledge about their own trades and industries, they can provide effective suggestions which can lead to \"double the results with half the effort\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the tantalising carrot in front of him, the little rabbit will try its utmost to eat it. As long as the carrot is not placed too high, it will be within reach of the rabbit. We need to encourage the rabbits to build up team spirit and work together to find good ways to improve productivity.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> Mr Chairman, let me thank Members for their comments.&nbsp; First, let me&nbsp;make some general remarks then I will deal with the issues raised.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2010 was indeed an exceptional year.&nbsp; Our economy grew by 14.5%.&nbsp; We had a strong recovery because we responded effectively to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Our good performance also validated our economic strategies in the last decade.&nbsp; Let me highlight three lessons learnt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it validated our strategy of diversifying trade partners and growth clusters.&nbsp; This minimises concentration in any single market or industry, and smoothens economic volatility.&nbsp; Going forward, we can expect global economic volatility to remain a feature so \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3628</p>\r\n\r\ndiversification in our economy is of critical importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, it reinforces our policy of welcoming talent who can contribute to our economy.&nbsp; This has helped us to anchor higher value-added activities that&nbsp;created good jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many of our sectors thrive because Singaporeans and foreign talent work together.&nbsp; Can you imagine our financial services sector or&nbsp;our manufacturing sector, our offshore trading sector, competing without the participation of foreign talent?&nbsp; This would be like competing with one hand tied behind our back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;our support for the internationalisation of Singapore companies.&nbsp; Due to our small domestic market, our companies have no choice but to expand overseas relatively early in their growth cycle.&nbsp; This is our <I>karma</I>.&nbsp; We are not a huge continental economy like the US, India, Europe or China.&nbsp; Our domestic market is limited and our companies have to go overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, I will deal with the economic strategies specific to the next few years but I thought I should reinforce these three key fundamentals.&nbsp; We should not lose track of these fundamentals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take a longer-term view, we have done fairly well.&nbsp; Over the last five years, our GDP grew by 6.4% per year.&nbsp; Median resident household income grew by 2.6% per annum in real terms.&nbsp; For our residents, the average unemployment rate in each year over the last&nbsp;five years stayed within the range of 3% to 4.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, as we have forecasted, we expect the economy&nbsp;to grow&nbsp;by 4% to 6%.&nbsp; Over the medium term, our growth prospects remain positive.&nbsp; Emerging Asia will become a key growth engine and we can take advantage of the growth opportunities arising from that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3629</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan,&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim and Mdm Ho Geok Choo have asked&nbsp;how the Government is helping Singapore-based companies seize growth opportunities, become competitive and expand into Asia.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me outline three key strategies to achieve this. They are:&nbsp;(i) to make a Singapore a global Asia business hub; (ii)&nbsp;re -position existing clusters and grow emerging ones; and (iii)&nbsp;p ursue productivity-led growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first strategy is to develop Singapore as a global Asia hub.&nbsp; The companies of today operate globally.&nbsp; Many site their activities across Asia and coordinate them from control towers.&nbsp; Control tower functions will include things like innovation, commercialisation, supply chain and talent management, amongst&nbsp;others.&nbsp; Our political stability, connectivity, access to talent and our educated workforce make Singapore a compelling destination for global and regional control towers.&nbsp; We, in fact, target three groups of companies: multinational corporations, global mid-sized companies as well as Asian champions.&nbsp; We can be a base for MNCs and global mid-sized companies to penetrate the Asian market.&nbsp; At the same time, Asian champions wanting to expand from their domestic base to other parts of the world will also find Singapore very useful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our global Asia hub strategy is working.&nbsp; Take, for example, Applied Materials, a leading global semi-conductor equipment supplier.&nbsp; Last year it set up its first Asian semi-conductor equipment manufacturing plant in Singapore. Applied Materials expects 50% of its global semi-conductor equipment supplies to be manufactured here.&nbsp; The company also manages its regional supply chain out of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoya Surgical Optics is another example.&nbsp; It is world-leading manufacturer \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3630</p>\r\n\r\nof intraocular lenses which are implanted in cataract patients.&nbsp; Hoya's presence in Singapore dates back to 2003 when it first set up a plant to manufacture intraocular lenses for global markets.&nbsp; Earlier this week, Hoya announced the relocation of its global&nbsp;headquarters to Singapore.&nbsp; The integration of its&nbsp;headquarters and manufacturing activities in Singapore will improve its overall operational efficiency and bring the company closer to the emerging Asian markets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a global Asia hub, our value is not just location.&nbsp; Our companies must also understand the business environment in Asia, they must know the business regulations, the demand conditions, have insights to consumer as well as HR best practices in various Asian markets.&nbsp; To support this, we are growing niche capabilities in our professional services cluster.&nbsp; PricewaterhouseCoopers, the fifth largest HR consulting player in the world by revenue, set up the Asia-Saratoga Centre here last year.&nbsp; The centre will develop a database of HR performance matrix pertaining to companies in Asia.&nbsp; Examples of such matrix include recruiting costs and workplace productivity.&nbsp; Using this database, the centre will be able to analyse how well its Asian-based clients are doing in HR management compared to their peers in the region.&nbsp; The database will also allow it to advise its clients on how their HR operations can be optimised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also helping companies access Asia-ready talent.&nbsp; Many companies have fed back to us that they lack managers who are ready for Asia; managers who understand the Asian business environment and are comfortable operating in Asia.&nbsp; So, last year, we launched the Human Capital Leadership Institute (HCLI) to develop business leadership capabilities in Asia.&nbsp; Come May, HCLI will roll out the Singapore business leaders' programme which will help prepare senior executives for regional leadership positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3631</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second strategy is about strengthening Singapore's export base and diversifying our industrial portfolio.&nbsp; Let me share with you examples from some of our key clusters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In electronics, we have remained competitive by scaling the value chain.&nbsp; In the 1990s, we engaged in four-inch, six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication, now we have 12-inch wafer fab plants.&nbsp; As a result, our share of global semi-conductor output has risen from 6% to 11% over the past decade.&nbsp; The renewal process continues.&nbsp; We are developing deep capabilities in integrated circuits.&nbsp; These are vital components of portable devices such as laptops and handphones.&nbsp; Last year, we launched an Integrated Circuit Design Centre of Excellence in NTU called VIRTUS.&nbsp; VIRTUS specialises in developing technologies required for applications in medical technology, clean technology and consumer electronics.&nbsp; It also helps train talent in emerging electronic sectors such as power management and energy harvesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In logistics, we are similarly undergoing a renewal process.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be closer to their main markets, companies are relocating their logistic centres&nbsp;to Asia.&nbsp; This creates opportunities for us, too.&nbsp; Hitachi Data Systems, for example, found it too slow to ship products from the US to its growing customer base&nbsp;in Asia, so last year it opened a regional distribution centre in Singapore to aim for faster delivery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, a competitive logistic cluster serves as an enabler for all our other clusters.&nbsp; So, to cement our position as a&nbsp;logistics hub, we are developing competency in new niches.&nbsp; For example, SATS recently launched Coolport, a facility that can store perishable foodstuff as well as heat-sensitive pharmaceutical products in a temperature-controlled\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3632</p>\r\n\r\nenvironment.&nbsp; This will help us anchor new investments in biomedical sciences as well as other clusters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts in nurturing new clusters are also progressing well.&nbsp; For example, we foresee good prospects for clean technology which encompasses solar power, wind energy and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading players like Vestas, Siemens and Bosch already engage in high-value innovation and manufacturing in Singapore.&nbsp; To strengthen our base, we have also set up public R&amp;D centres specialising in clean technology.&nbsp; This includes the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) in NUS and the Energy Research Institute at NTU.&nbsp; All in all, clean technology is on track to add S$3.4 billion to our GDP.&nbsp; This is slightly over 1%, and generate an additional 18,000 jobs by 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know turn to our third strategy which is to pursue productivity-lead growth.&nbsp; From the comments on productivity from Ms Jessica Tan, Assoc. Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal and Mr Teo Siong Seng, it is clear that Members share the view that productivity will be crucial to our ability to achieve sustained economic growth in the future.&nbsp; To achieve our productivity growth target of 2% to 3% per year, we&nbsp;have to achieve sustained productivity improvements at all four levels.&nbsp; At the economy level, we must move towards higher value-added sectors.&nbsp; This is part of the ongoing restructuring of our economy, shifting from low value-added activities to higher value-added sectors and growing new clusters.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I highlighted just now about the developments in our key clusters as well as the new clusters that are nurturing reflect this effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, at the sectoral level, we must move up the value chain within existing industries.&nbsp; Efforts at this level recognise that each sector faces its own challenges and requires different solutions to improve\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3633</p>\r\n\r\nproductivity.&nbsp; This is something that Assoc. Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal also highlighted.&nbsp; We will work with companies that have made headway in their productivity efforts.&nbsp; These companies will serve as productivity champions and help demonstrate the value of productivity improvements to the rest of the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trade associations and chambers (TACs) have a key role to play as champions of productivity.&nbsp; We will engage the TACs through our Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme which offers sectoral-based customised assistance that target unique industry needs.&nbsp; Mr Teo Siong Seng also highlighted the importance of engaging with the TACs and we intend to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the third level &ndash; at the firm level &ndash; this is where much of the heavy lifting will be done and therefore the Government has enhanced the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC)&nbsp;to further encourage companies to invest in activities that foster productivity and innovation.&nbsp; The PIC will allow the individual firm to respond to the productivity call, so, in this way, we can reach out to a very broad base.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, at the individual worker level, it is also very important that workers continue to upgrade themselves and take advantage of the many avenues in our Continuing Education and Training (CET) system to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal asked about our plans for the various sectors such as construction, retail and F&amp;B.&nbsp; I think in the MND debate yesterday we highlighted the roadmap for the construction sector, Deputy Prime Minister Teo has also provided updates and some examples from the retail and F&amp;B sectors, so let me share with you two others sectoral examples: precision \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3634</p>\r\n\r\nengineering and hotels.&nbsp; In precision engineering (PE), the level of productivity in the sector is only about 50% of that in developed countries such as the US, Germany and Japan.&nbsp; To catch up, our PE players have to move up the value chain.&nbsp; The industry needs to be transformed beyond one that supplies standard parts for local customers to one that designs and makes its own sophisticated final products for the export market.&nbsp; Meiban Group&nbsp;is a local PE player that has successfully made such a transition. They started off as a contract manufacturer of plastic products.&nbsp; It then began to pursue industrial design a few years ago.&nbsp; This has paid off.&nbsp; Meiban is now able to design and patent tools that have doubled the output of current equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to anchor global players to improve the dynamism of our PE sector.&nbsp; This is not restricted to manufacturing but extends to the entire value chain.&nbsp; This is something that Ms Jessica Tan also raised &ndash; the need to have the entire ecosystem and the supply chain.&nbsp; An example is Kulicke &amp; Soffa.&nbsp; This is a market leader in the manufacture of semi-conductor wire bonders.&nbsp; The company started operations here with a modest sales team in 1993, it has since moved on to include manufacturing and product management, and recently also made Singapore its global corporate headquarters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hotel industry, we face a different set of challenges.&nbsp; Based on the Singapore Tourism Board's&nbsp;(STB) study, our hotel industry's productivity level is comparable to that of Hong Kong.&nbsp; Here, our main challenge lies in attracting manpower for rank-and-file jobs in an already tight labour market.&nbsp; To raise productivity, more hotels have to improve their operational efficiency.&nbsp; They need to review systems and leverage technology to optimise manpower resources.&nbsp; An example of a hotel that has done so is Grand Park Orchard.&nbsp; It purchased passport \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3635</p>\r\n\r\nscanning devices to facilitate guest check-ins, dispensing with the need for manual entries.&nbsp; In this way, their guest services officers are now able to check in a guest in two-and-a-half minutes compared to four minutes previously.&nbsp; To complement the move to improve operational efficiency, rank-and-file jobs in hotels need to be upgraded and redesigned to become higher-skilled ones with better remuneration.&nbsp; More Singaporeans will then be attracted to these jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the hotel industry, high service standards are also critical.&nbsp; I agree with Ms Jessica Tan that we need a quantum step improvement in service excellence &ndash;&nbsp;visitors must go away with a happy experience.&nbsp; Productivity is not just about reducing the denominator, it is also about increasing the numerator &ndash; the value-add.&nbsp; And raising the service standards, in fact, allows us to also raise the value-add.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, let me conclude.&nbsp; Singapore is, in fact, in a very good position to tap the opportunities in a rising Asia. Our medium-term growth prospects are promising.&nbsp; However, constraints in labour supply compel us to raise productivity and make the best use of our resources.&nbsp; We therefore need to persevere in our restructuring efforts. &nbsp;We will then have an economy that will create a better quality of life for&nbsp;all Singaporeans.&nbsp; There are some cuts which overlapped with what we are going to&nbsp;talk about in SMEs, so I will leave to&nbsp;Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan to deal with this later.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Bravo!&nbsp; But, Sir,&nbsp;<I>The</I> <I>Economist</I> magazine defines \"innovation\" as \"new products, business processes, or organic changes that create wealth or social welfare\", or simply put, \"the fresh thinking that creates value.\"&nbsp; To achieve quantum leap growth, fresh thinking and organic changes &ndash; or systemic innovation&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; is the way to go.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systemic innovation involves changing the mind's eyes to see and think in new ways&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;from economic assumptions to social arrangements, impacting the demand and supply of basic needs.&nbsp; Often, they are catalysed by crisis,&nbsp;disruptive technology, social needs or cumulative physical and cultural changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3637</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;the mother of innovation usually arises out of needs, and the most compelling needs are those that relate to improving human&nbsp;condition, and not just financial value.&nbsp; Some examples are the spread of education, green and infotech revolution&nbsp;&ndash; all of which points&nbsp;not to profit maximisation but to making life better.&nbsp; Perhaps what we need is a systemic paradigm shift from private innovation to social innovation,&nbsp;to yield&nbsp;both economic and social dividends.&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;what are&nbsp;the&nbsp;schemes that prompt systemic innovation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; To this end, I advocate refocusing innovation on the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) A paradigm shift and changing the language from product and service innovation to social innovation, tackling human needs and making life better for Singaporeans.&nbsp; An example can be found in Singapore Polytechnic that adopted humanitarian values as their ethos, changed the curriculum to give&nbsp;meaning to studies.&nbsp; For example, the engineering and design students team up with VWOs and allow them to empathise firsthand with the disabled's daily struggles, and create meaningful solutions to improve the quality of life for real people.&nbsp; Some of the solutions are so good that commercial interests are found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Demand-side innovation.&nbsp; Our incentives are heavily supply-side bias.&nbsp; But with the advent of new media, demand-side innovations like crowd sourcing, consumer and social needs-driven collaborative innovation offer unprecedented opportunities to harness global creativity and value-add to&nbsp;our products and services.&nbsp; From Google to Facebook, companies that adopt open and user needs-driven processes to their products and business development have become an integral part of our lives.&nbsp; What are some of the schemes that incentivise our demand-side innovations?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3638</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; Information innovation.&nbsp; We have an excellent data collection system that unveils latent assets and maps future trends and challenges.&nbsp; Why not make our national challenges known in digestible form in a checklist and then invite innovators to tackle them?&nbsp; Doing so would also allow the frontliners to better understand the issues and users to share visions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; Collaborative innovation.&nbsp; Cross pollination of ideas combining many elements in new ways has been the most transformative.&nbsp; For example, mobile phones combine micro-processors, transmitters, network of masts and&nbsp;applications that create new businesses that satisfy lifestyle needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To encourage collaborative innovation, the Government can help build trust-creating devices like eBay's peer rating systems or provide public database.&nbsp; Government should also support existing platforms that focus on peer-to-peer, 3Ps and intra-industry collaboration, including that in the social sector.&nbsp; One such platform&nbsp;&ndash; and I declare my interest here since I also help to create this platform&nbsp;&ndash; is the Global Social Innovators Forum, which is a locally created, internationally recognised annual event&nbsp;that brings together change leaders from the 3Ps and academic circle to build a more inclusive, sustainable and better world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, the Government can also think&nbsp;about developing a social Silicon Valley where the 3Ps can come together to solve Singapore's most pressing concerns.&nbsp; One such park&nbsp;also called the Social Innovation Park is found in Spain.&nbsp; They visited Singapore's SIP, took&nbsp;our ideas and found great government support, and is now abuzz with many cross-sector collaborations and host more than 50 international companies and associations.&nbsp; Can we do the same?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3639</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, innovation in&nbsp;distribution. Just as central planning has become less efficient, distributed periphery network gains&nbsp;weight. Local smart&nbsp;grids,&nbsp;step-down care, telemedicine&nbsp;are some examples.&nbsp; Can we also incentivise the creation of new infrastructure, or adapt&nbsp;old ones to expand into a more efficient distribution centre?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these would also need a new legislative vehicle, a regulatory architecture and investment&nbsp;flow to unlock these systemic changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion,&nbsp;where innovation in the private sector is designed to reserve benefits for financial gains and those who can pay for it, social innovation is structured to favour the rapid diffusion of an&nbsp;innovation rather than keeping it private.&nbsp; In so doing, open sourcing solutions and mass distribution lower costs, increase efficiency and create a value system that is different and KPIs that will truly transform our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, higher economic profits and social dividends &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Ms Indranee Rajah.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Integrated Resorts</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Chairman, it has been a year since the Integrated Resorts&nbsp;(IRs) have opened, and there have been reports on the strong performance of the IRs since their opening.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update on their performance, in particular, how does that performance so far compare with the earlier projections, and what does the Government expect to be the IRs' economic contribution in the long term.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, the two Integrated Resorts&nbsp;&ndash; the Marina Bay \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3640</p>\r\n\r\nSands and Resorts World Sentosa&nbsp;&ndash; are both in operation albeit not at their maximum capacity.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, the opening of these two IRs has brought significant economic benefits to Singapore with increased tourist arrivals and betting taxes amounting to $2.3 billion.&nbsp; In addition to the casinos, Singaporeans and tourists alike can enjoy other entertainment amenities, including the delightful culinary skills of Michelin-starred chefs, theme parks, conference and exhibition facilities.

How do we encourage tourists coming here to&nbsp;slow down their pace a little, enjoy our eco-system, enjoy our heritage and enjoy our nice and cool place?&nbsp; I understand that the average tourist stays about four days.&nbsp;

Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal asked how we plan to harness innovation for growth, and what benefits would accrue to researchers, industries and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our investment in R&amp;D is really part of our long-term capabilities to underpin our future economic growth.&nbsp; It has strengthened our economy by promoting innovation and catalysing new area of growth.&nbsp; For example, A*STAR's Bioprocessing Technology Institute has helped to seed the capabilities and the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3644</p>\r\n\r\nexpertise that has supported, subsequently, the emergence of the biologics industry in Singapore.&nbsp; Today, that industry has attracted $2 billion in investments and it will create more than&nbsp;1,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our SMEs have also gained from our R&amp;D initiatives.&nbsp; Under A*STAR's GET-Up, Growing Enterprises through Technology Upgrading programme, researchers have been attached to some 200 SMEs to help develop new products and services by using technology.&nbsp; One example is Tru-Marine&nbsp;Pte Ltd which developed a new process to repair rather than replace worn engine rotors.&nbsp; This allowed the company to offer a new niche service and, consequently, it has grown its annual revenues from $20 million to $50 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our commitment to research and innovation remains unstinting. Last year, the Prime Minister announced the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2015 plan which would render enhanced support to our researchers, industries and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; As many Members have already noted the Government will invest $16.1 billion in R&amp;D for the next five years.&nbsp; That is an increase of 20% over the previous five-year plan.&nbsp; At a time when many countries are cutting back on R&amp;D due to fiscal constraints, Singapore stands out for continuing to build its research and innovation eco-system.&nbsp;&nbsp;This investment will yield three main benefits: scientific excellence and talent; greater economic outcomes; and, solutions for challenges that Singapore faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RIE 2015, first of all, will continue to support scientific excellence and nurture talent.&nbsp; We will invest in the creation of new knowledge and ideas, which are the basis of future innovations.&nbsp; The pool of competitive research funding will be enlarged to ensure that the best ideas are supported.&nbsp; Multi-disciplinary and collaborative efforts will be encouraged, as it is often at the intersection of these \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3645</p>\r\n\r\ndifferent branches of knowledge that new ideas and discoveries are made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will leverage on our scientific capabilities to encourage and generate greater economic outcomes.&nbsp; Under EDB's Research Incentive Scheme, $2.5 billion will be set aside to co-fund the establishment of corporate centres of R&amp;D excellence in Singapore.&nbsp; We have also introduced a new $1.35 billion Industry Alignment Fund for collaboration between public and industry researchers in order to align Government-funded research more closely with the needs of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next five years, the allocation to innovation and enterprise will be doubled to $1 billion to enable researchers and entrepreneurs to take more ideas from research to commercialisation.&nbsp; One example, the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology received a grant to further existing nanotechnology research and develop a new process for producing self-cleaning paint.&nbsp; This technology was licensed to Haruna Singapore Pte Ltd, a local paint company, for commercial production.&nbsp; This budget will then help&nbsp;match the commercial needs of companies like Haruna with the intellectual property developed in our research centres.&nbsp; It will support entrepreneurs in proto-typing and test-bedding new products and services, and provide seed funding for growing technology enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, R&amp;D will help to address some of Singapore&rsquo;s pressing challenges.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has suggested that the Government adopt a broader definition of innovation that delivers not only economic outcomes but also solutions that address social concerns. I am assuming the Member does not think that the pursuit of economic outcome is inherently wrong in its own terms.&nbsp; But this is more about the remit that MTI and its agencies have, which is primarily to focus on economic \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3646</p>\r\n\r\noutcomes.&nbsp; But the dichotomy between social and economic, in some ways, is a false one because most of the commercially viable ideas start by seeking to address a need in the market which is a social need usually.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, that is the Government&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; We want to encourage research which is geared towards meeting needs that are pressing or that are long term in nature, in&nbsp;the marketplace, in the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We established the $1 billion National Innovation Challenge programme to encourage, as Miss Penny Low put it, \"systemic innovation\" to develop solutions to Singapore&rsquo;s national challenges.&nbsp; It will not only help solve our problems but also serve to build a better life for Singaporeans and spawn new industries and business opportunities in the process.&nbsp; The first challenge, \"Energy Resilience for Sustainable Growth\", aims to develop cost-competitive energy solutions for deployment within 20 years to help Singapore improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and increase energy options.&nbsp; The Government has also applied the collaborative innovation approach to address longer-term public sector needs.&nbsp; The $450 million Co-Innovation Partnership Programme will help private enterprises to collaborate with the public sector to develop innovative solutions for specific needs in the public sector.&nbsp; Each collaboration can receive up to $1.75 million under the programme.&nbsp; There is a good pipeline, for example, the Ministry of Health is exploring ways to use remote technology to monitor diabetic patients.&nbsp; JTC is looking at how we can transform excavated soft materials into alternative reclamation fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, we agree with Mr Wee Siew Kim that innovation should be encouraged in as many sectors as possible.&nbsp; We have established grant schemes for test-bedding ventures in areas such as urban solutions, health&nbsp;and \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3647</p>\r\n\r\nwellness, lifestyle and media amongst others.&nbsp; We will continue to encourage this diversity and vibrancy in our R&amp;D landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning now to tourism. &nbsp;As with R&amp;D, we are breaking new ground in tourism.&nbsp; Last year, riding on the Asia&rsquo;s recovery and the opening of the two Integrated Resorts (IRs), we welcomed 11.6 million visitors and registered $18.8 billion in tourism receipts, an increase of 20% in visitor arrivals from the year before and 49% for tourism receipts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min and Ms Indranee Rajah have asked about the long-term economic impact of the IRs.&nbsp; MTI recently announced that based on initial numbers, we are on track to realise the previously projected $2.7 billion in value-add per year per IR, and 50,000 to 60,000 economy-wide job creation in the steady state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen asked how much of last year&rsquo;s growth is due to the IRs.&nbsp; It is not possible to give the Member&nbsp;a definitive breakdown but clearly there are many factors at play, we were starting from the low base in 2009; there is also the growth in Asia in general, and there was therefore much greater tourist traffic and then, of course, the IRs which brought&nbsp;a significant addition to our tourism landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must recognise that it is still early days yet, with the IRs in their first year of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must expect that the novelty will diminish even as the IRs continue to roll out new attractions. We must also anticipate increasing regional competition for the tourism dollar.&nbsp; It is really too early to draw a&nbsp;definitive conclusion about their long-term economic impact or, indeed, to form a view as to whether we should have more IRs in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3648</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Chan Soo Sen have asked about the outlook for the tourism industry.&nbsp; For 2011, STB&rsquo;s forecast is for 12 million to 13 million visitor arrivals and $22 to $24 billion in tourism receipts.&nbsp; That is an increase in visitor arrivals that range between 3% to 12% and 17% to 28% in tourism receipts.&nbsp; These are significant increases and, if they are achieved,&nbsp;will take us another step closer towards achieving STB&rsquo;s target of 17 million tourist arrivals and $30 billion in tourism receipts in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason we have been able to come this far in tourism is partly because of our investments in a strong portfolio of attractions and that has helped us to tap the growth in Asia.&nbsp; We have heard these attractions&nbsp;&ndash; the International Cruise Terminal, Gardens by the Bay and the National Art Gallery &ndash; these are some of those that are coming&nbsp;in the pipeline that will add to the momentum.&nbsp; Eco-tourism is not really the strongest suit of most cities including Singapore, but tourists who are so inclined can clearly immerse themselves in the verdant environment of&nbsp; the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves, as well as the Sungei Buloh Wetland Park.&nbsp; It is not really the central prong on which the STB markets Singapore as a tourist destination.&nbsp; But clearly, Singapore can be a launch pad from which to explore those options in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen asked about the cultural tourism and STB is working on curating a diverse calendar of events ranging from lifestyle events, like the F1 and the Asian Fashion Exchange, to cultural experiences such as the Chingay Parade, Thaipusam and Hari Raya celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a longer-term view of tourism, we must acknowledge the constraints on our resources especially land and labour.&nbsp; We cannot keep increasing indefinitely the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3649</p>\r\n\r\nnumber of visitor arrivals, which Dr Lam described as massive, or the number of workers in our tourism industry.&nbsp; So, we need to place greater emphasis on increasing the value-add we derived from each visitor and raising productivity.&nbsp; To raise the yield per visitor, we need to offer a greater experience and&nbsp;value.&nbsp; For example, STB has made a deliberate effort to create a series of lifestyle events around the F1.&nbsp; Consequently, average&nbsp;F1 visitor&nbsp;spending in 2010 was close to four times that of the regular visitors&nbsp;&ndash; more on F&amp;B, more on entertainment and accommodation.&nbsp; Another way to add value, and Minister has elaborated on this already, is to meet the rising expectations of&nbsp;visitors by enhancing service quality.&nbsp; Our GEMS Up&nbsp;(Go the Extra Mile for Services) effort is part of a broader national effort to ensure that we are able to raise service standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Productivity push is key.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;had a lot of discussion on it. I just want to make the point that we need to explore ways to enhance efficiency and job redesign.&nbsp; Swiss&ocirc;tel&nbsp;has a programme where selected room attendants are given the additional responsibility of preparing the rooms according to specified individual preferences to enhance guest experience.&nbsp; They are also<br>\r\nentrusted to do their own quality control checks to ensure that cleanliness and all the other expectations are met. By empowering room attendants and&nbsp;imbuing them with this greater sense of pride and ownership in their work, and increasing job value and wages, this programme should help to increase job satisfaction and improve staff retention.&nbsp; We also encourage businesses to identify more areas where such improvements can be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now turn to energy.&nbsp; Even as we pursue growth, we are mindful of the resource challenges that we face. &nbsp;Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Michael Palmer, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Indranee Rajah have all raised questions over the impact of the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3650</p>\r\n\r\npolitical turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa on our energy prices and security.&nbsp; It is important that we first recognise that rising energy prices are part of a long-term trend which reflects fundamental demand and supply drivers in the global energy market.&nbsp; Barring major shifts in the global energy supply, energy will become a relatively scarce resource as demand grows, particularly because of a resurgent Asia.&nbsp; If there is a global initiative to price the cost of carbon emissions to the environment, this will exert further upward pressure on energy prices.&nbsp; As a&nbsp;small economy that is almost wholly reliant on imported energy, we cannot be insulated from these global trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against that backdrop of that long-term trend, we must also be prepared for greater volatility in energy markets.&nbsp; In 2008/2009 because of&nbsp;the global financial crisis, there was demand uncertainty and that depressed energy prices.&nbsp; Today, the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa has created supply uncertainty.&nbsp; It does not affect us directly as an energy source because most of our sources are primarily in the region.&nbsp; But oil futures have risen by about 21% since the protests in Egypt began.&nbsp; Not all of these will translate into increases in our electricity prices: the strength of the Singapore dollar, our use of natural gas as our primary fuel and&nbsp;Combine Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plants, which are very efficient for power generation, and a competitive electricity market will cushion us to some extent.&nbsp; But we cannot be fully shielded from the impact of these increases if they persist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diversification is key to ensuring that Singapore continues to have secure and competitively-priced energy supplies.&nbsp; The Government will, therefore, continue to explore the development of viable alternative fuel sources.&nbsp; We now import gas from Malaysia and Indonesia through pipelines.&nbsp; We are building the LNG \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3651</p>\r\n\r\nterminal which will provide access to a global gas market and&nbsp;the terminal will come on stream in 2013.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other options include coal and electricity imports.&nbsp; Coal is relatively abundant, and new technologies can help to reduce its environmental impact, so this is something&nbsp;which we should be keeping a close watch on.&nbsp; The Economic Strategies Committee recommended electricity imports as another possibility.&nbsp; A competitive proposal might allow us to access energy sources in our region while freeing up valuable land and other resources in Singapore.&nbsp; We are reviewing our regulatory framework to consider this&nbsp;option for the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI is also leading a multi-agency pre-feasibility study on nuclear energy.&nbsp; The study is looking at key factors such as technological developments, safety and security issues as well as the economics of nuclear energy.&nbsp; The aim is to inform the Government&rsquo;s understanding of the risks and possibilities arising from nuclear energy, given the global and regional developments in this space.&nbsp; We cannot rely extensively on alternative energy sources such as wind, geothermal or solar to meet our baseload energy requirements due to our natural disadvantages in these areas.&nbsp; But we will augment our fuel mix with these options where it is technically feasible and economically viable.&nbsp; For example, the Government has invested $31 million in&nbsp;pilot programmes to install solar panels on the rooftops of some HDB buildings by 2015 in order&nbsp;to assess their efficacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we are somewhat constrained on the supply side, we can help ourselves significantly by using energy more efficiently.&nbsp; We can do more with less energy.&nbsp; The private sector has shown this. For example, 3M has made a concerted effort to imbue an energy-\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3652</p>\r\n\r\nefficiency culture in its manpower team and, as a result, they have achieved a 35% improvement in energy efficiency, with a cumulative cost saving of US$1.4 billion.&nbsp; We can aspire to do the same&nbsp;&ndash; as households, as companies and as a nation as a whole.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key aspect in managing such demand is pricing energy right.&nbsp; Consumers will adjust their behaviour when they appreciate the full cost of energy as reflected in its price.&nbsp; Conversely, subsidising energy will only lead to&nbsp;inefficient use of&nbsp;a scarce and precious resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some households may face difficulties in coping with rising and volatile energy prices.&nbsp; Our approach is to provide targeted assistance to those who need it.&nbsp; In Budget 2011, the Finance Minister has announced $200 million in utilities rebates which will&nbsp; help Singaporeans cope with high energy prices.&nbsp; I can put it in more specific terms.&nbsp; This year, a 1-room household will receive enough in rebates to cover most of its annual electricity bill, while a 3-room household will receive about five months' worth of electricity bills in rebates.&nbsp; These are signficant rebates which are provided in a targeted manner to those who will need them the most.&nbsp; Since 2007, the Government has provided close to $800 million of such rebates, benefiting about 800,000 households.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, beyond households, we want to encourage energy efficiency amongst all industry players, across sectors, and the Energy Efficiency Programme (E2PO) coordinates these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked about the electric vehicle (EV) pilot project.&nbsp; This is another R&amp;D initiative.&nbsp; The project will test if EVs can become a viable mode of transport in Singapore.&nbsp; We are currently \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3653</p>\r\n\r\ndeveloping the charging infrastructure for the pilot.&nbsp; The first charging stations are due to be completed by mid-2011.&nbsp; The first EVs should arrive in Singapore around that time.&nbsp; We will run the pilot for about two years, and&nbsp;use the data to evaluate the costs and benefits of EVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, if I may conclude, as the Minister had emphasised earlier, growing the economy requires efforts at various levels.&nbsp; First, we must&nbsp;grow capabilities.&nbsp;R&amp;D is one of the ways we can try which MTI does this.&nbsp; Second, we must seize opportunities arising in Asia.&nbsp;MTI's efforts&nbsp;in tourism seek to do this.&nbsp; Third, we must address our resource constraints.&nbsp; Our multi-pronged approach to addressing our energy challenge will help put the economy on the path of&nbsp;more sustainable growth.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

One missing element here is empowering our people to think of alternative means of reaching the same results.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know of a HR professional with more than 20 years of experience abroad as a consultant at a well-known bank whose application for certification as a consultant was stalled by the secretariat staff just because he could not show that he had chalked up 1,000 hours of consulting work in Singapore prior to the application.&nbsp; His application was automatically rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An appeal was made.&nbsp; This HR professional was one of the pioneers of the Management Services Division (MSD) of PSD.&nbsp;

I acknowledge that the Government has been tireless over the past year in launching productivity initiatives.&nbsp; Some SMEs, though, feel that the Government should not introduce too many new productivity programmes but should instead make it easier for them to adopt existing schemes and to allow them time to show results.&nbsp;

Currently, the Department of Statistics regularly monitors the sale of necessities, tracking the price of items such as rice, fish, meat, eggs, vegetables island-wide, and even prices of chicken rice and fish ball noodles commonly sold at food centres. From this month, the Department of Statistics will also monitor food prices at food centres, to see which stalls have raised prices. I \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3660</p>\r\n\r\nthink the coffee stall patronised by Mr Liang can also be included in the list. The Retail Price Watch Group also welcomes more people to provide more tip-offs and take part in the tracking of prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the Watch Group suggests that Mr Liang visit Bao Hua Drinks Stall and Ah Di Drinks Stall at Block 527, in Ang Mo Kio Cheng San Constituency, to enjoy coffee at just 50 cents. According to a report in the <I>New Paper</I> dated 15th February, there is another stall in Cheng San Constituency called \"Lao Li Coffee\". I have nothing to do with this stall. &nbsp;[<I>Laughter.</I> ]&nbsp; It also sells freshly brewed coffee at 60 cents. MP Mr Liang Eng Hwa said that $1 is a fixed price, but I say this is not fixed as the market is very competitive and people are trying all means to fight for business. Thus, not all can fix the price at $1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, ensure that the market operates highly effectively. For the market to operate effectively, getting the support of big retailers is the key. Big retail chain stores are all over the island. If big retail shops do not raise prices, it will have a positive effect on stabilising prices. Currently, NTUC FairPrice has promised that for the next six months, prices of its 500 housebrand items will remain the same. Apart from NTUC FairPrice, Cold Storage, Giant and Shop&nbsp;N Save have also made similar commitments. I hope that the other retailers will also follow their example and offer low-cost options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, take tough actions against monopolistic and profiteering practices.&nbsp; The newly established Retail Price Watch Group includes representatives from Competition Commission of Singapore and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) and their role is to monitor and take action against businesses involved in profiteering, engaging in anti-competition or unfair practices, as well as those who fail to deliver what they promise. In the event that the Watch Group finds any \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3825-3826.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3661</p>\r\n\r\nshops or stalls involved in inappropriate business practices, the Competition Commission and CASE will take action and investigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, educate the consumer to understand how the market works. For almost all daily necessities and food, there are relatively low-cost alternatives or brands available.&nbsp; The Watch Group will improve communication with consumers through various ways. Our education efforts will focus on letting the consumers know that they have many choices, and be aware of various money-saving tips. The Watch Group launched a new hotline 64611880 and website, www.pricewatch.gov.sg today. This will make it more convenient for our consumers to give feedback and suggestions. I hope that members of the public will generously share tips on getting value-for-money deals. Of course, they can also report businesses that raise prices unreasonably, so that the Watch Group can understand the reasons and source of price increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Sir, I would like to move on to address concerns of&nbsp;raising costs for SMEs.&nbsp; As pointed out by some Members, some SMEs may also face rising costs, especially for wages and rentals. Many of the measures that the&nbsp;Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Speech to help companies, such as the one-off SME cash grant of 5% of the company's revenue capped at $5,000, corporate income tax rebate up to $10,000, and the Productivity and Innovation Credit will help SMEs cope with rising costs.&nbsp; But even as they address the challenges of rising costs, SMEs should not lose sight of the more important task of raising productivity by embracing innovation, automation and workers' training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address short-term cost pressures,&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to reinvent our businesses for our long-term competitiveness.&nbsp; Consider, \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3662</p>\r\n\r\nfor instance, Q&amp;M Dental Clinic which has a chain of 40 clinics and two dental centres across the island.&nbsp; Q&amp;M faced the problem of increasing material cost eating into their profits.&nbsp; It was difficult to reduce cost from their manual&nbsp;pen-and-paper procurement system. The system was not only&nbsp;prone to human error but also resulted in wastage and many unhappy staff would have to spend time doing very tedious paperwork.&nbsp; These problems are not uncommon among&nbsp;SMEs.&nbsp; Q&amp;M decided to tap on SPRING Singapore's&nbsp;Technology Innovation Programme to develop a computerised procurement system with a database of nearly 4,000 products.&nbsp; This new system allows each clinic to easily&nbsp;place orders, track its monthly expenditure against budget, and reduce wastage&nbsp;through timely reminders on expiry dates&nbsp;of their materials.&nbsp; It saved them many hours of manual submissions and queries.&nbsp; It&nbsp;led to&nbsp;higher staff morale and teamwork.&nbsp; With&nbsp;its new system in place, Q&amp;M sees scope to eventually lower material cost to around 5% of its revenue from the current 8%.&nbsp; By freeing up their staff from administrative chores, Q&amp;M can now commit more time to human&nbsp;resource training as the next phase of their&nbsp;productivity efforts.&nbsp; Q&amp;M has recently embarked on their customer-centric initiative and are sending their staff for customer service training to improve customer service.&nbsp; What we see here is one good step leading to another, along the journey of productivity improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;Members another example of productivity improvement in one of our well-known seafood restaurants, Jumbo Seafood. There was a time when they used to receive frequent customers' feedback on inconsistency of taste across their outlets, specifically for the chilli crabs.&nbsp; There are customers&nbsp;who prefer certain outlets and shun others.&nbsp; The reason was simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday, each individual kitchen had to marinate and prepare their own sauces and food items.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3663</p>\r\n\r\nThis was done before work, in between the afternoon and&nbsp;night shifts.&nbsp; The difference in taste and quality across outlets was affecting customers' satisfaction, brand recognition and market positioning.&nbsp; Jumbo Seafood then decided to set up a central kitchen to prepare their sauces and fast-selling items.&nbsp; This allowed them to maintain consistency and freshness in the food quality across their outlets and to cut down the repetitive work carried out&nbsp;at every outlet. Without having to prepare food each day before work and after the afternoon shift, overall working hours were shortened and their outlet staff had more time to rest and get ready for the intense night shifts.&nbsp; This had led to higher workers' productivity.&nbsp; The central kitchen also reduced the need for large kitchen areas at each outlet, thus creating more space for tables to increase revenue which also means land productivity versus worker productivity.&nbsp; After setting up the central kitchen, Jumbo Seafood experienced a surge in sales with more repeat customers and an improved market position.&nbsp; In fact, F&amp;B chains equipped with central kitchens are in a very good position to offer additional value proposition, such as off-site catering service and takeaway sales.&nbsp; These new services will actually raise the sales per worker and make better use of the equipment and machinery which means assets productivity.&nbsp; This is one way to expand sales beyond the limitation of physical shop fronts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help more companies to do what Q&amp;M and Jumbo Seafood have done, the Government will be injecting substantial resources in the next five years, including the $850 million Enterprise Development Fund announced by the Minister for Finance.&nbsp; This will be managed by both IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore.&nbsp; The fund will&nbsp;support broad-based efforts to help all SMEs upgrade our industry clusters and help our high-growth companies build up \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3664</p>\r\n\r\nfurther capabilities and spur entrepreneurship.&nbsp; It will also help our companies expand overseas.&nbsp; The additional $1 billion injected into the National Productivity Fund will give us more resources to support our industries and companies moving towards higher productivity.&nbsp; The Government will continue to ensure SMEs are aware of the various schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked if our Enterprise Development Centres are effective in reaching out to SMEs to improve productivity, and whether our system schemes could be simplified. The Enterprise Development Centres (EDCs)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;five of them now &ndash; play a key role, both in reaching out to SMEs, regardless of their membership with&nbsp;Trade Associations and Chambers, to improve productivity.&nbsp; They help SMEs understand and navigate the grant application process.&nbsp; The EDCs proactively engage the SMEs to educate them on relevant Government schemes and provide advice in areas such as finance, operations and management.&nbsp; Some EDCs have helped SMEs to diagnose their productivity's performance and develop appropriate plans to move ahead.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that in 2010 alone, the five EDCs have provided assistance and business advisory services to about 10,000 SMEs, out of which, 900 also embarked on the productivity management programme under the SME productivity roadmap.&nbsp; In our grant application process, the Government continues to simplify our schemes by having enough customisations to best meet the wide diversity of SMEs' needs.&nbsp; Broad-based schemes are designed to be as simple&nbsp;as possible for SMEs&nbsp;to use.&nbsp; For instance, consider the iSPRINT scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs looking for packaged solutions pre-qualified by IDA to support basic business functions, such as accounting and payroll, do not need to submit any business proposals under the Increase SME Productivity with Infocomm \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3665</p>\r\n\r\nAdoption&nbsp;and Transformation (iSPRINT) or grant application form.&nbsp; They can proceed with the purchase of the solution, implement it and make that claim through IDA,&nbsp;all in about eight weeks.&nbsp; Since its launch, more than 750 SMEs have benefited from iSPRINT&nbsp;programme, generating a projected $400 million in value-added over the next three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For people capability development, involving larger sums of money, more customisation is needed to better understand the SMEs' needs so as to provide the right time of assistance.&nbsp; For example, SMEs looking to build capabilities, such as branding, had to go through a diagnostic process to identify the key areas which need to be addressed and most appropriate scheme for them. Behind the scenes, of course, we have further integrated the collaboration among agencies, such as SPRING and IE Singapore to better serve the common clients more effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Government will do what it can to make the schemes easier to understand and&nbsp;access, I must also emphasise that SMEs themselves must be proactive in wanting to improve before the right assistance can be rendered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, IE Singapore has rolled out a number of programmes to take SMEs overseas.&nbsp; They include market studies, meeting potential partners and connecting&nbsp;with Singaporeans' firms already in overseas markets.&nbsp; IE also runs programmes that help companies build specific strengths in branding, franchising, intellectual property protection and access to finance.&nbsp; For first-timers, IE also runs SME Market Access Programme.&nbsp; So far, 87 SMEs have gained from this programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them is Bee Cheng Hiang, a very well-known Singapore-based barbecue meat retailer with more than 130 overseas outlets.&nbsp; Recently, it made its \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3666</p>\r\n\r\nfirst foray&nbsp;into Seoul.&nbsp; To prepare for this, the company applied for intellectual property rights for its brand in Korea and tapped on the programme to reduce the associated costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the opportunities in Asia grow, MTI and our economic agencies will step up efforts to open doors.&nbsp; We will also facilitate projects for SMEs through the many bilateral G-to-G platform and business councils we have established with many countries.&nbsp; SMEs should also tap on our wide network of 18 FTAs, including those with key Asian markets, such as China and India, to enhance their market access. We will keep improving our outreach to SMEs on how to take advantage of the FTAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Siong Seng asked about the role of Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs)&nbsp;in helping SMEs make use of productivity-related schemes and to expand overseas.&nbsp; Indeed, TACs are our important and natural partners.&nbsp; As representatives of the various industries, the TACs understand the needs and aspirations of their members and the challenges facing different sectors in improving productivity or expanding overseas.&nbsp; It also have many SMEs in their membership.&nbsp; TACs are thus well-placed to advise SMEs on using the various Government's programmes for productivity improvement and internalisation.</p>\r\n</span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a long history of working with TACs.&nbsp; We continue to explore new ways in helping TACs.&nbsp; For instance, we are now exploring with TACs to improve the needs and interests of their members when applying to use programmes under the National Productivity Fund.&nbsp; This may be one way to ease the administration burden on smaller companies.&nbsp; The TACs have been playing an active role in leading business missions and trade fairs.&nbsp; Last year, the various \r\nChambers&nbsp;led a total of \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3667</p>\r\n\r\n150 trade fairs and over 50 missions to overseas markets, benefiting some 3,300 companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I conclude, Mr Chairman, let me address Mr Chiam's question on orchids.&nbsp; MTI works closely with agencies like the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore and IE Singapore to facilitate the growth of Singapore's orchid export sector.&nbsp; Our efforts have seen our global market share of orchid exports grow from 7.3% in 2007 to 11% in 2009.&nbsp; Today, Singapore is the third largest exporter of fresh orchids.&nbsp; We promote orchid exports by negotiating free trade agreements that remove or reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers imposed by our major markets.&nbsp; For instance, in Australia, one of our major export markets, we managed to secure exemption from mandatory fumigation for Singapore's orchid exporters.&nbsp; We will continue with such efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, let me conclude, our SMEs are the backbone of our economy, making up 99% of the enterprises in Singapore.&nbsp; Six out of every 10 workers in Singapore are hired by SMEs.&nbsp; Investing in our SMEs is investing in our future.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;let me, firstly, thank Mr Yeo Guat Kwang for his feedback and keen interest in championing consumer protection.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has a multi-tiered consumer protection framework with <I>caveat emptor</I>, or \"buyers beware\", as its cornerstone.&nbsp; Given the diverse and evolving range of consumer products and services, consumer education and awareness to enable them to discern the best deals for themselves, and also to reject unrealistic promises is the most sustainable approach.&nbsp; This has been&nbsp;the principle \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3668</p>\r\n\r\nwhich CASE has been promoting all these years. CASE&rsquo;s active role in consumer education is thus key to our overall consumer protection framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our consumer protection legislation provides the next level of defence.&nbsp; Our legislation needs to carefully balance risks against costs, as sweeping and prescriptive legislation will lead to higher business costs that may be passed on to the consumers.&nbsp; So, we regularly review and update our legislation to be in line with the international best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang enquired on the progress of the consumer product safety&nbsp;framework.&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to report that MTI has completed a review of the consumer product safety framework.&nbsp; Beyond the 45 categories of controlled goods mentioned by Mr Yeo, we will&nbsp;be also enhancing our consumer products safety regime to cover general consumer goods to align them&nbsp;with the latest international standards.&nbsp; MTI will be issuing the Consumer Goods Safety Requirements Regulations (CGSR) to give SPRING Singapore the power to stop the supply of consumer goods that do not meet international safety standards.&nbsp; Under these regulations SPRING will also have the power to direct suppliers to inform their customers of the potential dangers of such goods.&nbsp; Suppliers who do not comply can face a maximum penalty of up to $10,000 fine or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.&nbsp; The CGSR, drafted with feedback from the stakeholders, such as CASE, consumers and retailers, will take effect from 1st April 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned the need to provide safety information such as age group, health and hazard warnings on products.&nbsp; With the implementation of the CGSR, all consumer products are required to meet the applicable international standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will actually protect the&nbsp;consumers more effectively as \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3669</p>\r\n\r\ncompared to merely asking them to supply the product information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this, currently many&nbsp;manufacturers&nbsp;are already stating information such as suitable age groups and health warnings on their products.&nbsp; Consumers who find such information useful will likely to purchase these products, which will encourage importers to bring in more products with safety information clearly stated. Nonetheless, we will consider a regulatory approach if the market mechanisms are unable to provide consumers with information critical to the safe use of the products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also asked for an update on the lemon law.&nbsp; At the last Committee of Supply debate, I mentioned that MTI was studying the necessary legislative changes to introduce a lemon law in Singapore.&nbsp; Most of the key features of lemon laws, as implemented in other developed economies, are already present in Singapore&rsquo;s legislation.&nbsp; For example, under the existing law, a consumer may reject goods purchased within a reasonable period and obtain a refund if the purchased goods&nbsp;are not of satisfactory quality.&nbsp; However, the lack of express legal provisions for the repair and replacement of defective products in the current legislation make it less easy for consumers to seek these remedies. By providing greater clarity, the new provisions will address the problems of some suppliers refusing to replace a defective product after repeated failed attempts at repair.&nbsp; I am pleased to announce that we have completed the public consultations on the proposed legislative changes.&nbsp; The feedback from the public has generally been very positive.&nbsp; We intend to move the legislation on the lemon law in Parliament later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is to limit the legislating of specific consumer practices to targeted industries, where the proliferation of \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3670</p>\r\n\r\nerrant businesses makes it difficult for the industry to self-correct through consumer education and accreditation alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also asked whether&nbsp;the five-day cooling-off period can be extended to the beauty industry.&nbsp; Sir, the cooling-off period has already been part of the CaseTrust accreditation programme, launched with MTI&rsquo;s support.&nbsp; It recognises and encourages good practices such as giving consumers a cooling-off period and not selling to customers during treatment.&nbsp; The accreditation programme enables consumers to make better choices without going down the route of imposing prescriptive regulations on the entire industry, which will result in higher business costs that will<br>\r\n ultimately be borne by the consumers.&nbsp; As the accreditation programme has just been launched last year and it is currently being enhanced, we believe it will be best for now to monitor the effectiveness together with CASE and we will tighten the regulations in the industry if necessary.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That can start from a wholesale sale of the IP in which case the private enterprise takes it over after a period of co-development.&nbsp; There are instances where they jointly own the IP and there are other instances like the one I highlighted in my speech where they are licensed.&nbsp; The approach is a fairly flexible one.&nbsp; The key objective is really this: first, we want to ensure that the research that is undertaken in our institutes has productive application which means collaboration with the private sector is quite essential.&nbsp; But at the same time, we want to ensure that our institutes and the researchers get a fair deal.&nbsp; Within those broad parameters, they are fairly flexible in their pursuit of a range of options.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Having said that,&nbsp;we are not just relying on price mechanism. There is a slew of efforts underway in a range of sectors.&nbsp; If the Member&nbsp;looks at the building sector, for example, we have the patent marks, and so on, which are really \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3673</p>\r\n\r\ndesigned to encourage developers to adopt energy-efficient building designs and we have already seen that coming on-stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Member&nbsp;looks at the industries, we have the Efficient Energy Programmes Office (E2PO) which focuses on various programmes which are targeted at and helping industries develop energy-efficient solutions.&nbsp; Because the industries are so diverse, you need fairly customised solutions and so there is a whole new industry around this,&nbsp;of&nbsp;energy consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at households, we got the ticks that MEWI does and this is part of the process of encouraging our consumers to be more prudent in the way they select their appliances.&nbsp; We are also testing out smart meters.&nbsp; There is a trial run that is taking place in Singapore.&nbsp; The real purpose of these smart meters is to give households and residents a real-time sense of how the consumption of electricity on their part is affecting their bill so that they can correct it.&nbsp; Normally there is a bit of a disjoint because we consume, then the bill comes later.&nbsp; So, this is to give them a bit more of a real-time feel and they can track it and make adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a range of measures and I think those, together with our core approach on pricing and targeted subsidies,&nbsp;are really designed to create a more energy-efficient system.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Sir, the Senior Minister of State said that all innovations, whether academic or social, will ultimately benefit the user.&nbsp; I fully agree.&nbsp; As such, can the Minister also clarify why do we then continue to use language and focus on products or supply or&nbsp;services-centric and specific innovations rather than cause-specific?&nbsp; As we hear on Radio FM93.8, \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3674</p>\r\n\r\n\"change&nbsp;your perspective and change&nbsp;your life\".&nbsp; Otherwise, outcome may be just incremental improvements rather than real innovations.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second clarification is on collaborative innovation and funding schemes.&nbsp; The Senior Minister of State repeatedly mentioned public and private sector collaborations.&nbsp; I cheer that but the end-user, the people sector, is conspicuously missing from his entire speech.&nbsp; This serves the point I made earlier on in my speech that the $16 billion fund is very much supply-side-centric but most transformational innovations today are driven by demand-side innovations.&nbsp; I wonder if the Senior Minister of State can clarify if there would be more schemes to look into demand-side innovations and push it to the limit and transform some of the thinking and paradigms that we have today and heavily include people and the people sector in the entire innovation drive.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Mr Chairman, I regret that the Member takes exception to the vocabulary we used in describing innovation.&nbsp; But this is&nbsp;a reflection of the DNA of what MTI and its agencies are about.

Indeed, as I have explained, for example, when you talk about meeting a healthcare need &ndash; that is actually quite social in its outcome but it has also got an economic dimension.&nbsp; If you want something to be sustainable in the marketplace, then you need a certain economic viability test to be applied to it.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, I think we need to look at it in totality and not just from the context of what MTI and its agencies are doing, although even within that context we have got considerable allowances made for these kinds of efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think most companies probably understand.&nbsp; We want to drive productivity &ndash; while there are foreign worker levies on one side, on the other hand, we give rebates and incentives to companies.&nbsp; The issue is for many smaller companies, for example, they are never going to transform overnight.&nbsp; I think the easiest way for them is to transfer the cost of increased levies into cost to the consumers.&nbsp; To some extent for the Ministry, it is a little difficult to balance.&nbsp; I would like&nbsp;to hear from the Ministry how it plans to balance productivity on the one&nbsp;side and potential inflation on the other.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue with SMEs is the issue of cashflow.&nbsp; Now that we have increased levies, they get hit on a monthly basis.&nbsp; But cashflow for SMEs &ndash; if you understand their business &ndash; many of them have very poor collection terms, they tend to face collection issues.&nbsp; At the same time as well, they can only collect items like GST claims once every quarter and sometimes even later, depends on when they get revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the two areas for my clarification.&nbsp; I do have to commend MTI for sharing a lot of examples of small companies making it good.&nbsp; It is important that we have small companies to be the champions because the SMEs like to say that a lot of examples MTI gives tend to \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3677</p>\r\n\r\nbe of big companies with scale.&nbsp;

Some issues can also be horizontal issues, like IT applications, so we have another scheme for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan explained, we have a very elaborate outreach programme to the SMEs through either the&nbsp;trade associations, which then gives us a very sectoral approach, or through the EDC&nbsp;which is a very&nbsp;broad-based approach.&nbsp; Ultimately, of course, the heavy lifting comes from the firms themselves.&nbsp; They must want to improve.&nbsp; There are a lot of schemes and we are open to suggestions how we can make the schemes more easily available to them.&nbsp; But I do not doubt the heavy lifting will, in the end, be borne by the firms and we hope that the firms will rise to the occasion.&nbsp; The impetus to all these is really competition.&nbsp; The companies must realise that this is the way forward.&nbsp; We are providing all these schemes, we are providing all the mechanisms and the help.&nbsp; If they do not restructure and change and others do, then the competition will come from the other companies who will do much better than them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, that would be the main impetus.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The main purpose of the labelling is to provide information for consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing home appliances. Sir, despite the mandatory labelling, not many consumers are purchasing energy- and water-efficient appliances&nbsp;for their homes. The take-up rate for energy- and water-efficient home appliances is low and slow. This means that many homes in Singapore are not using electricity and water efficiently, thus wasting money, energy and water resources.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, consumer education to encourage households to purchase eco-friendly home appliances is an ongoing concern. But not many people in Singapore are living in eco-homes and adopting an eco-friendly lifestyle. Changing living habits and value system of people is always an uphill task. To be effective, I would propose a two-pronged approach to make households eco-friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we must share more eco-friendly home appliances information, and eco-friendly lifestyle tips with homemakers and household decision makers. I would propose that the Ministry consider providing an eco-friendly education kit for every household, and monitor the take-up rate of eco-friendly home appliances and eco-friendly lifestyle closely.&nbsp; To further incentivise consumers to purchase&nbsp;four ticks energy-efficient and water-efficient home appliances, the Ministry should consider providing cash rebates or tax incentives. Second, we must adopt an experiential learning approach to teach children to adopt eco-friendly lifestyle. \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3682</p>\r\n\r\nChildren must be taught and be inspired from young to do their part to protect the environment.

To promote the use of green vehicles, I understand that LTA and NEA have jointly introduced the Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR).&nbsp; This GVR aims to bring about a change in consumer behaviour to support clean emerging technologies, by narrowing the cost differential between a green vehicle and the conventional equivalent model. \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3684</p>\r\n\r\nThe rebate is calculated based on&nbsp;40% of the open market value (OMV) at registration, for&nbsp;passenger vehicles, and&nbsp;10% of the vehicle's OMV for electric motorcycles.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are certainly&nbsp;fewer green motorcycles than green cars on the road. Can the Government consider increasing the rebate for electric motorcycles to encourage the take up of electric motorcycles?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another obstacle to green vehicles is the lack of support facilities such as refuelling as well as recharging stations and infrastructures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the current status of green vehicles utilisation and what progress have we achieved so far in this area?

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to thank Mr Cedric Foo, our GPC Chairman, and Members for their questions and suggestions.&nbsp; My colleague,&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and I will&nbsp;do our best to answer the queries.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Foo asked whether Singapore&nbsp;has been developing sustainably.&nbsp; Sir, over the last decade, we have made good progress in enhancing Singapore's environment through the combined efforts of the Government, businesses and Singaporeans.&nbsp; We are making better use of resources. Water and energy efficiency have improved, so are our recycling rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of our living environment has also gone up with the upgrading of our hawker centres, sustaining good air quality and keeping down the incidence of vector-borne diseases like dengue.&nbsp; However, as noted by Members, we cannot afford to&nbsp;be complacent. From time to time, we are reminded of the need to continue to adapt to new challenges. Despite a low incidence of food poisoning in the past five years, at an average of about four incidents per 1,000 retail food establishments, the 2009 food poisoning incident linked to a stall&nbsp;at Geylang Serai's temporary market was a timely reminder for more stringent regulations. NEA increased the frequency of inspecting food establishments, stiffened penalties for food hygiene offences and re-emphasised education for food handlers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, all the flood-prone areas have been reduced by 98%, from 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to 56 hectares \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3688</p>\r\n\r\ntoday. Last year's flooding incidents led us to review the existing drainage infrastructure.&nbsp; The PUB has begun work on several key locations including Orchard Road.&nbsp;Sir, given the uncertainties in weather patterns, PUB will design new drains to cope with more intense rain within the constraints of cost-effectiveness and competing land use.&nbsp; For more extensive monitoring of water levels in the key canals and drains, we have expanded our network of water level sensors from 32 to 90 since December 2010, and will increase it further to 150 this year.&nbsp; An SMS alert system to&nbsp; provide early warning of&nbsp;potential floods will be rolled out to the public later this year.&nbsp; We will also continue to invest in infrastructure and work with building owners and managing agents, businesses and residents to ensure adequate flood protection of their properties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes more than technology and infrastructure to meet environmental challenges. It requires all of us to do our part.&nbsp;This is why, over time, we have broadened our focus to sustainable solutions which &nbsp;encourage, enable and empower people.&nbsp; Beyond its role as a regulator, the Government will take the lead in sustainable practices and facilitate businesses and households towards being more environmentally responsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our businesses have responded well to our incentive schemes, coming up with innovative ideas that reduced the environmental footprint.&nbsp; Let me just cite one example.&nbsp; Siemens was awarded a $4 million grant from the Environment and Water Industry Programme Office (EWI)&nbsp; to develop an electrochemical-based desalination&nbsp;process that aims to&nbsp;cut energy consumption by half.&nbsp; A small-scale pilot plant has been in operation since February this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our communities have also played their part in the progress that we have&nbsp;made over the years. A&nbsp;Public&nbsp;Perception \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3689</p>\r\n\r\nSurvey conducted last year shows that Singaporeans are taking greater ownership of the environment.&nbsp; Eighty per cent of&nbsp;respondents said&nbsp;that they would buy energy-efficient household appliances, even without incentives, while 84% acknowledged that they had a personal role to play in water conservation.&nbsp; Eighty per cent of respondents checked their home&nbsp;every week to guard against mosquito breeding.&nbsp; My colleagues&nbsp;and I are encouraged by these findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These survey findings are borne out&nbsp;in our interactions with the community. I commend the ground-up initiatives by organisations such as the Waterways Watch Society,&nbsp;as well as individuals such as the 2010 Bayer Youth Environmental Envoy, Mr Chua&nbsp;Ang Hong,&nbsp;and the 2010 EcoFriend Award winner, Mrs Dhillon Awtar Singh, a school principal, who actively&nbsp;show&nbsp;the way in preserving, protecting and promoting our&nbsp;environment and water resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Safeguarding the environment for present and future generations amidst new challenges will require our continued commitment and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Sustainable&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;Blueprint released in 2009 provides the framework for responding effectively to these challenges. The Bueprint identified&nbsp;key goals for 2030 across various aspects of the environment. This will guide us towards our vision of a liveable and lively Singapore that Singaporeans are proud to call home. In the coming year, my Ministry will focus on the key thrusts of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, namely, boosting our resource efficiency, protecting and enhancing our environment, building capabilities and fostering community action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me first cover our efforts&nbsp;to improve resource efficiency, given our constraints in water, energy and land. \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3690</p>\r\n\r\nBoth Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked about the implications of the 1961 Water Agreement expiring later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we know Singapore imports water from Malaysia under two agreements&nbsp;&ndash; the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements. Our first Water Agreement with Malaysia will expire on 31st August 2011, while the second Water Agreement will expire in 2061. Through the years, as part of our Four National Taps strategy, Singapore has been building up our local sources by developing new reservoir schemes as well as desalination and NEWater. With the completion of the Punggol and Serangoon Reservoirs by the end of 2011, and the&nbsp;Marina Reservoir which was completed in November 2010, our water catchment will increase&nbsp;to two-thirds of Singapore's land area. The second desalination plant in Tuas, which will be ready in 2013, will add another 70 million gallons of water a day to our water supply.&nbsp;We will continue to introduce NEWater into our reservoirs, especially during dry spells such as the one we experienced in February last year. Together, NEWater and desalination can now meet 40% of our total water demand, the rest can be met by both imported water and water from our local catchments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, by 2060, we plan to increase our desalination and NEWater capabilities to be able to meet up to 30% and 50% of our water needs respectively. These local sources are sufficient to replace the water imported under the 1961 Water Agreement.&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;the expiry of the 1961 Water Agreement will have no impact on our water supply and water tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak has two specific questions: First, upon the expiry of&nbsp;1961 Water Agreement, Singapore will hand all of the assets under this agreement back to Malaysia and we will continue to sell \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3691</p>\r\n\r\ntreated water to Malaysia, as provided for under the 1962 Water Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for water sustainability, however, having a robust water supply is only half the story. We must continue our efforts in water conservation. Last year, we introduced the Water Efficiency Management Plan, a voluntary initiative under PUB's 10% Challenge to help non-domestic customers. These plans include the analysis of current water use, identification of potential water-saving measures and an implementation&nbsp;roadmap. Non-domestic customers who meet the funding criteria will also be able to tap our existing Water Efficiency Fund to implement these measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government is setting an example. Close to 70% of all public sector buildings have achieved the Water Efficiency Building certification as part of their efforts to reduce water consumption. The private sector is also demonstrating commitment to improve water efficiency. To date, 86 premises have submitted their Water Efficiency Management plans, with overall water-saving targets of up to 10%. As an example, SATS Catering tested and installed a new custom-made dishwasher which cuts diswashing water use by 40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about our measures to encourage an eco-friendly lifestyle. Sir, our long-term target is to bring down our daily per capita&nbsp;domestic water consumption to 147 litres by 2020 and 140 litres by 2030. Today, we are at 154 litres, down from 165 litres in 2003.&nbsp; Using water-efficient products can further reduce our water usage. The Mandatory Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MWELS) was introduced in 2009 for taps, flushing cisterns and urinals. Currently, more than 5,000 models with water efficiency rating of one tick and above are registered under this scheme. \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3692</p>\r\n\r\nMWELS has allowed consumers to make more informed choices when making purchases. The labelling scheme&nbsp;will be extended to clothes washing machines this October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I thank Mdm Ho for her suggestion on water-saving practices. We will continue to work with the community but, as part of its ongoing efforts to get people to use water wisely,&nbsp;PUB launched the Water Conservation Awareness Programme on 27th February, aimed at various segments of the population, including households. These initiatives include teaching students how to conduct water audits at home with their family and working with maid employment agencies to include water conservation as part of the training given to domestic helpers. Sir, the public has responded well since the launch, with more than 1,800 requests for water-saving kits. I hope Members would have caught some of the TV commercials used by the PUB for this campaign.&nbsp; Indeed, Sir, everyone can play a part by adopting simple water-saving habits in our daily lives. So, whether they want to use wet wipes or they want to use water, if they use it wisely, we leave it to the households to decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, PUB will continue to explore innovative technologies to ensure water sustainability, such as a smart water grid to optimise our operational of effectiveness and resource efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Striving for effective water management has turned a strategic vulnerabililty into a competitive advantage for Singapore. In the last four years, the local water cluster has grown from 50 to more than 70 companies. The new investments secured will add more than $550 million to our economy and more than 2,200 jobs will be created when all the projects are fully ramped up. The annual&nbsp;Singapore International Water Week, which was co-located with the World Cities Summit last year, drew over 14,000 participants from \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3693</p>\r\n\r\n112 different countries and regions, and has positioned Singapore as a global hydro hub for the sharing of ideas and technologies at the forefront of water research and innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, like water, energy, as mentioned by Members, is a critical resource of Singapore. We have limited access to alternative energy sources such as geothermal and wind energy. Our small physical size also constrains how much we can rely on solar energy. Mr Cedric Foo asked about our energy efficiency in Singapore. So, we all know that greater energy efficiency benefits the consumer, companies, economy and the environment. For families, this translates into lower utility bills.&nbsp; For companies, this reduces business costs and raises productivity.&nbsp; For&nbsp;the economy, energy efficiency enhances our energy security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving energy efficiency is a primary strategy in our whole-of-Government efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Our energy intensity has improved by about 8% from 2005 to 2009, and we will need to continue our efforts to meet our target, under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, to reduce Singapore's energy intensity by 35%, from 2005 levels by 2030. We can meet this target, Sir, through the joint efforts of Government, businesses and the community.&nbsp; All infocommunications technology equipment purchased by our public agencies today&nbsp;meet the latest Energy Star standards. We are encouraging public agencies to install or retrofit their buildings with more efficient chiller systems as these account for the largest part of the building's energy use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as announced in last year's Committee of Supply, energy management practices will be made mandatory for companies that consume more than 15GWh of energy yearly from 2013, to ensure the efficient use of energy. This will be legislated through an Energy Conservation Act.&nbsp; This Bill will be \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3694</p>\r\n\r\npublished later this year to gather public feedback. Sir, in April last year, NEA, EMA and EDB jointly launched the Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP) to help our companies build up the energy management capabilities required to comply&nbsp;with the Energy Conservation Act. Companies have benefited from sharing energy efficiency best practices at the EENP events. For instance, a waste&nbsp;heat recovery workshop prompted 3M to actively look for opportunities to manage energy through heat recovery systems within their plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Certified Energy Manager (SCEM) programme has also equipped energy&nbsp;managers from companies with skills to manage energy use in their organisations more effectively. To defray part of the training cost, NEA administers a SCEM Training Grant to co-fund about 80% of the SCEM professional-level course fees. As at December 2010, 475 applications have been approved. We target to train 1,000 energy managers by 2013. Sir, in addition, NEA administers incentive schemes to encourage industry players to adopt energy-efficient measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to further address Dr Teo's query and how the Government will encourage households to go green, let me add that much has been done to encourage the adoption of more energy-efficient practices. NEA's 10% Energy Challenge was launched in 2008 to encourage households to save 10% or more of their household electricity use. We have enjoyed strong community support. As an example, in 2010, the South West CDC and NEA launched the South West Carbon Buster Roadmap, which spells out actions that businesses, community organisations, schools and residents in the district can adopt to reduce carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One simple step that the public can take is to opt for more energy-efficient appliances. Sir, I announced in 2009 that \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3695</p>\r\n\r\nMinimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) will be implemented for air-conditioners and refrigerators, which are the two highest energy users of a typical household. From September 2011, all of the most inefficient 0-tick appliances and some of the 1-tick and 2-tick appliances will no longer be available. There will nonetheless still be a wide range of energy-efficient brands and models. We will be exploring the possibility of extending MEPS to other appliances, such as lighting, in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;as an illustration of the kind of savings a typical household in a 4-room flat can expect to enjoy, if they choose a 4-tick refrigerator, switch to energy-efficient light bulbs, turn off standby power, they can save about 15% of their monthly electricity bill. In addition, Sir, if they opt for a 4-tick air-conditioner when they replace their old one, keep the themostat at about 25 degrees Celsius, they can achieve up to 30% savings. Sir, this is very significant, and&nbsp;is over and above the U-save rebate of $320 that a 4-room flat household will receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the status of the green vehicles take-up rate. Indeed, making energy-efficient choices also extends to our mode of travel and the vehicles that we use.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are encouraged by the healthy response to the Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) scheme. As of December 2010, there were 8,700 green vehicles, up from 7,200 in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Green Vehicle Rebate was introduced in 2001 to minimise the cost differential&nbsp;between green vehicles and their conventional equivalents. To continue supporting vehicle owners in making greener purchases, the existing scheme will be extended until the end of next year for electric and petrol-electric hybrid vehicles.&nbsp; As mentioned by the Finance Minister, the Government will be undertaking a comprehensive review on \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3696</p>\r\n\r\nthe measures to promote the adoption of green vehicles as part of our overall efforts to promote sustainable development.&nbsp; We have to wait until the review is over to know what will happen to the scheme and what are the measures that we need in place for other types of vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim has a specific request on motorcycles. At the moment, as he rightly noted, they already enjoy 10% rebate on their ARF and they are only paying 5%.&nbsp; We think that is sufficient at this point in time.&nbsp; He also asked about the infrastructure to support green vehicles.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier by&nbsp;MTI, the Government is embarking on an electric vehicle pilot project and we are currently developing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure.&nbsp;The first charging stations are due to be completed in mid-2011 and the first electric vehicle should arrive in Singapore at that time. So, these are the efforts done by the Government to enlarge infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;as we roll out, we have to test both for&nbsp;their efficiency and&nbsp;cost effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let us now turn to our waste management system. Singapore's land constraints necessitate effective waste management. Currently, an average Singaporean, you and me, disposes of 860 gm of waste a day, which is about a third more than places like Germany or Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;While individually, this might not seem much, it adds up to about 300 kg per person in a year. Just to understand what this translates, taking the whole population of Singapore, in one year, just for domestic waste alone, we collectively dispose enough to cover an eighth of Singapore's surface area.&nbsp;Waste minimisation and recycling are therefore important strategies for us to reduce the land needed for waste disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked what we are doing to ensure a sustainable waste management system. Our approach to \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3697</p>\r\n\r\nwaste minimisation is encapsulated in the 3Rs&nbsp;&ndash; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle -&nbsp;reduce our use of materials where possible, re-use the items in working condition, instead of throwing them away, and recycle what we cannot use to recover its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have made good progress so far towards our target of a 70% recycling rate by 2030, with our recycling rate increasing from 40% in 2000 to 58% in 2010.&nbsp; Recyling rates for scrap metals is at 94% while construction waste is at 99%.&nbsp; So for some of the&nbsp;waste streams,&nbsp;we have achieved very good numbers; others, we need to work even harder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By reducing the amount of waste generated and implementing more recycling initiatives, companies can reap cost savings in waste disposal fees.&nbsp; Commercial premises such as Intercontinental Singapore and&nbsp;313@Somerset&nbsp;have already implemented programmes to recycle paper, plastic, glass and metal waste, and we hope&nbsp;that more will follow the example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce waste at source, NEA signed a voluntary agreement with industries to encourage them to reduce packaging waste.&nbsp; So it is encouraging that over 120 organisations have already joined the Singapore Packaging&nbsp;Agreement and we&nbsp;encourage more companies to do the same.

Mr Lim asked how NEA ensures high standards of public cleansing.&nbsp; Similar to Town Councils' cleansing frequency of HDB housing estates, NEA has in place a regime to clean our roads and private estates at least two to three times a week.&nbsp; In fact, the contractors are also required to give their phone numbers and contact to the residents so that they can give their feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA also works with PUB to ensure drains are cleaned regularly.&nbsp;

Encouraging greater community&nbsp;ownership&nbsp;and civic responsibility, thus remain the dominant approach in curbing the irresponsible and dangerous behaviour of&nbsp; high-rise littering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new anti-littering campaign which was launched in June last year, was geared towards promoting personal ownership for public cleanliness and good social behaviour.&nbsp; It integrates increased visibility of enforcement as a deterrence with improved location and frequency of emptying litter bins as well as more targeted public&nbsp;outreach and education efforts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Litter Free Ambassador programme was introduced to empower members of the community to reduce the incidents of littering.&nbsp; Over 2,000 grassroots youth and students have been recruited as Ambassadors to conduct educational outreach efforts, petrol community spaces and act as positive role models to discourage littering&nbsp;in the neighbourhoods and we appreciate the efforts and leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Hygiene Council was formed in November 2010 to encourage greater partnership in support of public hygiene.&nbsp; The Council, comprising representatives from the people, private and public sectors, aims to role out its initiatives progressively later this year, focusing on issues such as anti-littering, clean public toilets and good personal hygiene.&nbsp; There was a close to 50% drop in the number of littering offenders caught in the six months immediately after the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3707</p>\r\n\r\ncampaign was launched, when comapred with the same period in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of Corrective Work Orders&nbsp;imposed has also fallen by 13%.&nbsp; However, more work still needs to be done to shape our anti-littering behaviour and attitude.&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng mentioned Singapore's ranking on the Yale Environmental Performance Index.&nbsp; I would like to clarify that the Index does not include cleanliness as a component.&nbsp; An inaugural litter count survey was conducted last year, covering some 1,900 sites in different categories of public places across Singapore.&nbsp; It was found that on average, 33 pieces of litter were accumulated over a 12-hour period in an area of just a 100 square metres; the size of a typical&nbsp;4-room flat as shown in the slide which aims to give Members a better visual feel of what this implies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The study points to the need to continue its stronger engagement efforts in schools and communities to improve shared ownership in the cleanliness of public spaces that&nbsp;we want to enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa raised an issue on food hygiene.&nbsp; This is a concern given the increasing number and diversity of retail food outlets.&nbsp; We have continued to strengthen the regulation of our food hygiene standards focusing on food handlers as they&nbsp;are an important link in the food safety chain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since October last year, NEA has progressively rolled out the requirement for food handlers to undergo refresher training every three years.&nbsp; Stiffer penalties were also introduced in April last year for food hygiene-related offences.&nbsp; Catered food is an area of emphasis.&nbsp; As caterers typically serve meals to large numbers of people, any lapses in their food handling processes could potentially result in mass food poisoning.&nbsp; We will focus on \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3708</p>\r\n\r\neducating both&nbsp;food caterers and consumers on good practices for preparing and consuming catered food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the end of this year, food caterers will be required to time-stamp their packet meals and put up advisory notices at buffet meals to inform consumers when food should be consumed by as shown in this slide.&nbsp; Studies have shown that food may not be safe for consumption beyond four hours from the time it has been cooked,&nbsp;if not properly stored or held at an appropriate temperature.&nbsp; Consumers therefore need to be careful with food that has exceeded the consume-by time stipulated by the caterer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dengue control, public cleanliness and food hygiene are all areas which require the support of the community.&nbsp; We can all do our part to continue ensuring that the areas in and around our homes do&nbsp;not become potential mosquito breeding grounds, and also help maintain a high standard of public cleanliness in all our common areas.&nbsp; As consumers, we can set the expectation for food handlers to be more hygiene conscious.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One area where many of the lower-income citizens are affected is the rising cost of food and drink prices&nbsp;in hawker or food centres.&nbsp; It has been reported that cooked food at some foodcourts at ION Orchard,&nbsp;Nex and Marina Bay Sands are sold at more than $10 a plate.&nbsp; It has also been reported that prices of coffee, tea&nbsp;and soft drinks have also increased in many other hawker centres.&nbsp; Recently, NTUC FairPrice announced its \"Stretch Your Dollar Programme\" to help consumers cope with inflation.&nbsp; This is most commendable because this programme places a certain downward pressure on the market for the cost of certain groceries to be contained.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to call on NEA to reconsider its policy not to build anymore markets and hawker centres.&nbsp; I also urge NEA to reconsider its policy of tendering cooked food and wet market produce stalls at market prices.&nbsp; If such stalls are allocated at subsidised prices to the less educated or lower-income Singaporeans, NEA can impose price caps on the food sold by these stalls.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that this is what some schools ask of their stall operators in their schools or what some commercial companies do &ndash; impose price caps on the food sold in their staff canteen as a form of service to their workers in the factory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are currently several stalls which have been given up by stallholders during the Hawkers Upgrading Programme (HUP).&nbsp; There is scope for these stalls to be set aside and allocated for Singaporeans who are lower income or less educated.&nbsp; NEA can work with the CDCs to see how they can allocate hawker stalls at subsidised prices to \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3710</p>\r\n\r\nlower-income or poorer Singaporeans.&nbsp; The CDC can then work with these residents to assist them to learn to operate a cooked food or market-produce stall.&nbsp; NEA can also impose strict conditions like not allowing subletting and any interested stall operator must agree to the price cap and submit the prices of their food to NEA for approval.&nbsp; In this way, we can help the lower-income or poorer in our society to learn to make a living; at the same time provide alternative to residents and also help place some pressures on other food or market stalls to keep food prices affordable, similar to what NTUC&nbsp;FairPrice is doing for groceries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recognise that there are many issues to be resolved and, in a certain sense, we are interfering with the free market.&nbsp; But why not try the scheme on a limited basis for stalls given up under the HUP and see how this works out?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We are remaking&nbsp;it into a City within a Garden as well.&nbsp; As an island, we should make full use of the water element to enhance our&nbsp;quality of life.&nbsp; The MEWR's ABC Waterways&nbsp;programme is a key programme that can take us forward in this regard.&nbsp; The efforts so far, I believe,&nbsp;have yielded very encouraging results.&nbsp; The look and feel of our rivers and waterways are progressively being restored to appear ever more natural and less canal-like.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The options of activities in the water and along the banks have thus also increased.&nbsp; Waterside living is also becoming progressively more available to our broad population as opposed to being available only to the wealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the HDB, that vision of sustaining and enhancing the value of properties and quality of living has&nbsp;led it to introduce many programmes over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, look at the upgrading programmes of HDB, in terms of the hardware and the living quarters, and within our waterways for&nbsp;the MEWR's ABC Waterways programme&nbsp;as providing a complementary upgrading programme to enhance the overall value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3713</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of&nbsp;my constituency in Whampoa, there is a stretch of river&nbsp;&ndash; the Sungei Whampoa&nbsp;&ndash; that lies within its boundaries.&nbsp; Part of this river is currently shared between two divisions of the Jalan Besar GRC &ndash; one side is Whampoa and the other side is Kolam Ayer.&nbsp; Recently, a project under the ABC Waterways programme is&nbsp;completed.&nbsp; Beautiful surroundings and I could actually see the delight and joy of the residents as they witnessed the completion of the project.&nbsp; Certainly, in terms of what they&nbsp;can enjoy, it goes far beyond just having a park connectors that run along a canal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I know from&nbsp;this specific experience that the ABC Waterways programme can and will make a big difference to the look, feel and usefulness of our river and canal systems.&nbsp; I hope that MEWR can give us an update on the overall progress of this important programme, as well as what other projects are being planned under this programme going forward and, in particular, how could the rest of the&nbsp;Sungei Whampoa fare within this project?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the Government's hawker stalls policy.&nbsp; Sir, we recognise that over time our hawker centres have evolved to become not&nbsp;just a source of affordable food but also an important shared community space.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 42% of the nearly 15,000 cooked food and market stalls that NEA manages are paying subsidised rentals.&nbsp; This has helped to keep food prices affordable, although there may be other several factors that affect food prices.&nbsp; Sir, there are no immediate plans to build \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3715</p>\r\n\r\nnew hawker centres but we will continue to ensure that hawker centres provide patrons with a comfortable dining environment through our Hawker Centre Upgrading Programme.&nbsp; Since 2001, over 80% of our 110 hawker centres have been upgraded with improvements made in ventilation, utilities and layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim also asked about allocating stalls at subsidised rent to low-income individuals, while Mr Chiam See Tong asked about NEA's approach to illegal hawking by&nbsp;disabled people.&nbsp; There are currently various schemes to support families in hardships and persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Low-income families who need assistance with basic living can approach the Community Development Councils for help.&nbsp; Persons with disabilities can be referred to the various job placement or support services for employment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked what the Government is doing to minimise noise nuisance.&nbsp; As I shared at last year's COS, construction sites near residential and noise-sensitive areas that started work from 1st September 2010 have not been allowed to carry out construction activities from 10.00 pm on the night before Sunday or public holiday till 10.00 am the day itself.&nbsp; This prohibition will be extended to cover the rest of the day for construction sites that commence work from September 2011. Going forward, we will also consider tighter noise limits for construction equipment and methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA is also taking steps to reduce traffic noise. Noise standards for new vehicles were tightened in October last year, and standards for existing vehicles will be tightened in April this year.&nbsp; NEA is also working with the LTA to look into the feasibility of measures to further manage traffic noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3716</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I share Dr Maliki's concern that community noise is a growing challenge.&nbsp; However, stepping up on legislation and enforcement is not necessarily the most practical approach in such instances.&nbsp; While NEA has established and enforced noise limits for noise sources such as construction sites, factories and motor vehicles which could pose a risk to public health, community noise cannot be addressed as easily.&nbsp; This is because of its transient and subjective nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we work, live and play in a compact city, greater civic mindedness is very important.&nbsp; This is especially so given our high population and urban density which amplify the impact of noise. Even as we review noise mitigation measures through improved infrastructure design and more effective enforcement, for a better quality of life for all, everyone in the society needs to continue exercising consideration and tolerance for one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the challenge of realising our vision of a sustainable Singapore is as much one of partnership and personal responsibility, as it is of public policy.&nbsp; To build a future that we desire and that our children deserve, we need to embrace the idea that taking care of the environment is everyone's shared responsibility, and not just the Government's.&nbsp; In doing so, we will also play our part as a responsible global citizen to tackle climate change, as suggested by Mr Seah Kian Peng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Seah also asked if we can make it mandatory for major national events to be carbon-neutral going forward.&nbsp; On his suggestion for NDP, I will refer the suggestion to Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean for MINDEF to consider.&nbsp; Given their high visibility, major national events provide a good opportunity for us to promote environmental protection and ownership.&nbsp; In fact, NEA has been engaging the organisers and stakeholders of major events, including the NDP \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3717</p>\r\n\r\norganisers, to make their events environmental-friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These include introducing measures to cut down on packaging and litter, providing adequate recycling bins, using energy-efficient lighting and encouraging participants to use public transport.&nbsp; These all will help reduce the carbon footprint of such large scale events.&nbsp; For example, NEA has worked with organisers of the Youth Olympic Games, National Day Parade, the River Hongbao and Chingay to encourage participants and visitors to keep the venues litter-free through the provision of adequate refuse bins, display of educational materials and public announcements at event sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond using national events as platforms to build up a stronger sense of community ownership and responsibility, our officers at the five regional offices islandwide have engaged the grassroots through CCC meetings and grassroots events to better understand and address the community's concerns.&nbsp; A $1.5 million 3P Partnership Fund is also available to support 3Ps efforts by grassroots, schools, NGOs and companies.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to grow our network of teachers, youth, grassroots and corporate partners to champion the environment in their respective communities and organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such community partnership has been a centre-piece of our water sustainability efforts. The Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) Waters programme&nbsp;was launched by our Prime Minister in 2006 to encourage the public to get closer to water so that they can better value and enjoy this precious resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address Mr Heng Chee How's query on the status of the ABC Waters programme, I am pleased to share that 15 projects have been completed and these have been well-received by the community.&nbsp; 2011 promises an equally exciting array of projects for the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3718</p>\r\n\r\ncommunity.&nbsp; The flagship project this year is the Kallang River-Bishan Park project where the river will become the focus of the park following its transformation into a natural meandering waterway.&nbsp; The project also features innovative bio-engineering techniques and natural cleansing systems using plants.&nbsp; At MacRitchie Reservoir, amongst other improvements, visitors can expect a new submerged boardwalk that will allow people to work through shallow waters and appreciate water from a totally different perspective. These projects are part of more than 100 identified islandwide under the ABC Waters Masterplan, including Sungei Whampoa in Mr Heng's ward, which will be implemented in phases over the next 20 years.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUB is also working closely with other public and private agencies to encourage the adoption of ABC Waters design features within their developments.&nbsp; ABC Waters design features have been introduced in public housing projects such as the Punggol Waterway and private developments like the Tree House Condominium by CDL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, water we can drink from the tap, reservoirs we can canoe in, vibrant hawker centres, clean streets, fresh air&nbsp;&ndash; these are for us to use, but not to be taken for granted.&nbsp; We have to nurture a clean and liveable home for everyone through the combined efforts of all.&nbsp; Our efforts are recognised internationally today, with Singapore ranked first out of the 151 countries in Gallup's 2010 Air and Water Survey and maintaining its top placing among Asian cities in Mercer's Quality of Living Survey for the past three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, doing our part in safeguarding the environment does not have to be an extraordinary event or \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3719</p>\r\n\r\nactivity.

The trial site was fogged to kill all mosquitoes and the site will be monitored for several more months and we understand that there is no plan to release more mosquitoes until the results of this trial are analysed.&nbsp; So given the small scale of the Malaysian trial&nbsp;and the long distance between Singapore and the trial site, NEA assessed that it is unlikely to be of significant concern to Singapore. Should larger trials be carried out in the future or should the trial sites be located nearer to Singapore, NEA has the necessary surveillance capability to detect the entry of any transgenic mosquitoes in Singapore.&nbsp; So you do not need passports!</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Chairman, I have three&nbsp;clarifications for the Minister of State.&nbsp;First,&nbsp;I would like to check how the litter count survey will&nbsp;be used to mitigate the littering problem in Singapore.&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;is there a more robust grading scheme for food stalls than what is currently being used since many people feel that food stalls should either be graded a pass or a fail?

A total of 1,954 sites were actually surveyed.&nbsp; The results of the inaugural survey actually found, as I have shown earlier in the slide, that, on average, 33 pieces of litter were accumulated over a 12-hour period in every 100 square metres of public space, which is the equivalent of a standard 4-room flat and this shows that more needs to be done to sustain public cleanliness and, of course, the public has a role to play to keep the public areas clean by being responsible and clearing their litter after them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA will continue&nbsp;its stronger engagement efforts in schools and communities to improve shared ownership in the cleanliness of the public spaces that we want to continue to enjoy. In fact, in addition to our Litter-Free Ambassador Programme that we have launched as well as the Students Embrace Litter-Free (SELF) Programme,&nbsp; we also intend to launch&nbsp;a Litter-Free Ambassador Programme for preschoolers in June this year, so that children will be aware of how they can contribute to a clean environment and develop a good habit of always throwing litter in a bin from&nbsp;an early&nbsp;age. We are&nbsp;going to also have \"litter monitors\" appointed to remind their classmates to keep the preschool centres clean and to conduct simple checks within the premises.&nbsp; So the litter count survey really acts as a baseline and we will carry out another litter count survey in 2012 to assess the situation again. This will help&nbsp;us to see the effectiveness of the initiatives that we have already implemented&nbsp;or are implementing between now and the next survey in 2012.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> I would like to ask the Minister about electric cars in Singapore.&nbsp; Does he have a sense of how much they will cost and how successful they will be?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3723</p>\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

She leaned closer, 'What's that dear?'&nbsp; I was also up close, and could barely make out what he was saying.&nbsp; What last words would he whisper, I thought to myself.&nbsp; I pictured myself in his position&nbsp;&ndash; maybe I would tell my wife how much I loved her or enjoyed us being together.&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncle leaned closer to my aunt and mumbled in his feeble voice, 'I am sorry I have not listened to you all these years.&nbsp; I love my cigarettes but I love you even more.&nbsp; Please forgive me.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3726</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found myself immediately pondering how fleeting life is, how everything can change in a split second.&nbsp; After hearing this, I decided to quit smoking myself.&nbsp; Sometimes, it takes a wake-up call to truly appreciate things&nbsp;&ndash; you do not realise how good and important it is to have a healthy body until you lose it!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this testimonial of an ex-smoker illustrates very well the importance of good health.&nbsp; Good health does not come naturally and will not last forever.&nbsp; It is a goal that can be achieved easily through healthy living, healthy eating and regular exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>&nbsp; Falling sick and going to the hospital is never a happy occasion, with the exception of giving birth to one's newborn child.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the good reputation of our medical institutions, going to one can be a stressful experience.&nbsp; Patients can wait up to one hour, sometimes even two hours, to see the doctor for consultation that lasts only a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spending another hour just to collect the medication at the pharmacy.&nbsp; Thus, I believe that it is the wish of all Singaporeans to avoid going to hospitals as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once stricken with a disease, the qualitative added life years of a person can be severely limited, even with treatment.&nbsp; For example, a transplanted renal patient will be on immune-suppressant drugs for the rest of his life and this can often lead to all kinds of other diseases due to the side effects of the immuno-suppressive therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp;healthcare system must therefore strive to keep patients away from the hospitals as much as possible.&nbsp; Even better, manage their health such that a person's entire lifetime visits to&nbsp;the hospital is kept to the minimum.&nbsp; This must be the key performance indicator\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3727</p>\r\n\r\n(KPI) we should strive more in a wellness-centric healthcare model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this KPI, it is crucial to maintain a healthy lifestyle, exercise and go for regular health screening.&nbsp; Although the grassroots organisations and many VWOs have taken the right step in organising mass health screening for the residents, following up on cases that need medical attention is even more important so that early intervention can be instituted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, Medisave has been liberalised progressively for payment of medical-related insurances, outpatient treatment and investigations.&nbsp; An example will be the Chronic Diseases Management Programme (CDMP) where Medisave is allowed to be used for the cost of outpatient treatment, up to a cap of $300 per Medisave Account per year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we know that early detection and subsequent prompt treatment of diseases can improve the prognosis and outcome.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to consider allowing the use of Medisave for health screening but still subject to similar restrictions of capping the maximum withdrawal limit to $300 per account per year and strict guidelines on the types of screening allowable.&nbsp; This would prevent premature depletion and potential abuse of the Medisave savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the challenges facing affluent societies, including Singapore, is obesity.&nbsp; Obesity is one of the most important factors causing an upsurge in the twin diseases of hypertension and diabetes.&nbsp; These two diseases are the major contributing cause for the 18 million cardiovascular deaths in the world.&nbsp; Hypertension and diabetes can&nbsp; be prevented with regular exercise and by leading a healthy lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3728</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obesity is linked to many other diseases and one of the most well-known is diabetes.&nbsp; Diabetes is one disease, if not well-controlled, can lead to many medical complications, such as kidney failure, heart disease, blindness and disability from leg amputations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister for an update on the prevalence of obesity in Singapore and what is MOH's strategy in tackling the issue of obesity in Singapore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003, the World Health Assembly adopted the global strategy on diet, physical activity and health which targets lifestyle modifications that can combat the increase in non-communicable diseases.&nbsp; The WHO issued objectives for developing countries regarding school meals and healthy living.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister if his Ministry has studied this strategy and whether this is relevant in our local context?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staying healthy is actually one's responsibility.&nbsp; You cannot force a person to stay healthy if the person is not motivated to do so.&nbsp; Smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse and living a sedentary lifestyle are important risk factors for a future plagued by illness, pain and sufferings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of the challenges faced by the Ministry and the Health Promotion Board in promoting a healthy lifestyle amongst Singaporeans, I would like to ask the Minister for his strategy in helping Singaporeans lead healthier and happier lives.&nbsp; Has the Ministry considered ways to incentivise Singaporeans to stay healthy, such as lowering premium or rebates for health insurances?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister can share with us his words of wisdom in building a wellness-centric healthcare for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3729</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Healthcare infrastructural development</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next cut.&nbsp; The population of Singapore has increased significantly over the past five years and the current resident population in Singapore stands close to five million.&nbsp; However, the speed of healthcare infrastructural development did not keep pace with the population increase, resulting in the long waiting times and the shortage of hospital beds in our clinics and hospitals respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) has relieved the high workload in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), and several months into its opening, KTPH is already experiencing high occupancy of its inpatient beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, with the rapidly ageing population, there is an urgent need to look into infrastructural requirements to meet the increased demand.&nbsp; I had also received feedback that the increasing population in new towns like Sengkang and Punggol has resulted in long waiting times at the polyclinics such as Sengkang Polyclinic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update&nbsp;on the healthcare infrastructural development, especially the Ministry's strategies in tackling the rapidly greying population.&nbsp; I would also want to ask the Minister for his plans in promoting community rehabilitation of patients with mental illnesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Infectious diseases and flu pandemics</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>&nbsp; Sir, my third cut.&nbsp; Singapore is a globalised and connected world with a very busy seaport and airport.&nbsp; Our tourist arrival reached 11.6 million last year.&nbsp; As the economy picks up, more and more Singaporeans are going for holidays abroad, judging from the sell-outs at recent travel fairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The excellent air, sea and land connectivity has resulted in our borders \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3730</p>\r\n\r\nbeing highly porous and highly susceptible to all kinds of infectious diseases.&nbsp; An infectious strain in one corner of the world can spread to Singapore overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our battles with SARS and H1N1 have taught us the importance of close collaboration between various Government agencies and multi-disciplines in dealing with epidemics and pandemics.&nbsp; A breakdown in communication could result in dire consequences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the infectious diseases and flu pandemic preparations.&nbsp; Are there scenario planning exercises to ensure the readiness of the various relevant agencies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Homecare and intermediate and long-term care</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my fourth cut.&nbsp; Singapore is one of the fastest ageing populations in the world.&nbsp; Coupled with our low fertility rate, more than 20% of our population will be above the age of 65 by the year 2030.&nbsp; In addition, Singaporeans are also living longer and a significant number of years of our lives will be spent in sickness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, the demand for intermediate and long-term care for the patient, especially the elderly, will increase.&nbsp; This forms a very important component in the&nbsp; holistic care of a patient, from acute to rehabilitation to eventually recuperating in a nursing home or homecare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More resources must be put into developing the intermediate and long-term care sector, as this is currently under-developed, judging from the long waiting list that these institutions are experiencing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, being an Asian society, the family has traditionally been the main source of support for our elderly.&nbsp; Many elderly sick patients would definitely\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3731</p>\r\n\r\nprefer to stay in the comfort of their homes than be placed in nursing institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homecare will not be possible without the dedicated participation of the caregiver, who is a family member most of the time.&nbsp; In order for the elderly to age and recuperate properly and happily in their homes, the Ministry would need to look into building up the necessary resources and expertise in growing the homecare sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) What is the current state of homecare and intermediate and long-term care in Singapore and how does the Ministry plan to develop these sectors in the coming years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Can the Minister consider setting up a one-stop caregiver resource centre to provide a range of supportive services, including dedicated homecare medical teams to conduct medical review of stable patients at their homes so as to minimise the hassle of frequent travels to the hospitals or clinics for reviews?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Can the Minister also consider the provision of monetary allowance for caregivers to compensate family caregivers for their hardwork and sacrifices in looking after the elderly, rather than taking the easy way out of dumping their old folks in nursing homes?&nbsp; This would also help to free up the limited resources and vacancies in nursing homes for those families who really need them most.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

As we prepare to ride the silver tsunami, we must be prepared from now our mindsets, infrastructure, facilities and services to support this.&nbsp; With the existing numbers of nursing homes now, it is not uncommon to hear families and spouses lamenting that long waits to get family members into one are quite long really.&nbsp; Moreover, many of us are unable to afford the fees of private nursing homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are our future plans to meet this need?&nbsp; We need to project the expected numbers of elderly&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;elderly elderly and elderly sick, who will be requiring these facilities in the next five, 10 or 20 years.&nbsp; Can we also plan to have more of these nursing homes located conveniently in close proximity to our heartlands?&nbsp; This would facilitate family members visiting the seniors regularly and maintaining inter-generational family ties and bonds.&nbsp; Currently, about half of our nursing homes are already located near heartlands.&nbsp; We always prefer our elderly to be close to our homes or in our homes or in the community but nursing homes may be an inevitable reality in today's world where families face conflicting responsibilities.&nbsp; We must give thought to what makes our seniors truly happy in the nursing homes.&nbsp; More amount of modern amenities and parties organised by staff cannot replace the true joy that they see when they have their family members and friends visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issues of funding, currently MOH is doing a lot through Medifund contributions.&nbsp; With the recently announced Community Silver Trust in this year's Budget which confers one-to-one matching for donations to VWOs involved in long-term care, this will lighten the load and burden a little more and stimulate more money into this important area.&nbsp; When it comes to manpower and staffing of nursing homes, we must also inject \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3733</p>\r\n\r\nmore zest so that people will tend to choose this career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I would like to ask the Minister how his Ministry intends to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-term care should be provided seamlessly, from acute hospital care to community hospital, nursing homes and home-based care.&nbsp;

Sir, I have four suggestions to make.&nbsp; First, there is a need to provide an integrated home and community programme comprising medical, nursing and social services to the frail elderly who need intensive long-term care so that they can remain at home instead of being placed in a nursing home.&nbsp; The current day rehabilitation centres are inadequate as they provide only therapy and day-care services.&nbsp; Integrated care will include a wider scope of services with an addition of a multi-disciplinary team comprising nurses, therapists, case managers and healthcare workers.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Third, Sir, I urge the Minister to ensure that healthcare is affordable to our elderly, as many suffer from chronic illnesses requiring long-term treatment and medication.&nbsp; With rising cost of healthcare, many are concerned that they will not be able to pay for their bills and, in this regard, I am glad to hear that the $10 \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3735</p>\r\n\r\nmillion that has been set aside to help the elderly in mobility.&nbsp; Could the Minister provide more details on this?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, manpower is a big challenge in the healthcare sector.&nbsp; We are short of not only doctors but nurses, therapists and other healthcare workers as well.&nbsp;

There is an urgency in view of our fast ageing population and the increasing need for geriatric care.&nbsp; Despite the opening of the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, the problem is not fully resolved.&nbsp; The construction of the new Jurong General Hospital will take some years to be fully ready.&nbsp; Meanwhile, primary and step-down care alone may not be the dynamic panacea.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a person is very sick, his family members will naturally think of the hospital&nbsp;as the most appropriate place for the sick person because&nbsp;they want the sick person to be better taken care of by doctors and nurses.&nbsp; Singaporeans seem to have lost the ability to take care of sick members of our family, or have no time to do so due to work demands or because the family has shrunk due to fewer and fewer or no children or siblings.&nbsp; In fact, for some ailments and chronic illnesses, I believe the home environment may well be the most conducive and curative environment.&nbsp; There are at present some groups such as the NTUC Eldercare and our hospitals which provide some form of training assistance to family members and domestic helpers to care for the elderly\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3736</p>\r\n\r\nand the&nbsp;sick.&nbsp; I believe to a certain extent home care when it is properly taught and supported by a good back up team at the hospital that can be easily reached in times of need, may well be the most economical option in view of the rising healthcare costs.&nbsp; I therefore ask the Minister if he would consider vigorously promoting such home care as being the right care for patients and what support and programmes can be put in place to support this drive.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As such, I believe that we should offer more options to cater to the healthcare needs of senior citizens.&nbsp; There is a need to have&nbsp;more Government-subsidised home support services available for senior citizens living alone or with their family members.&nbsp; Mobility issues and physical weakness are common reasons for senior citizens to avoid seeking medical help.&nbsp; For some senior citizens, their limbs are so weak&nbsp;that just stepping out of their house is an onerous task that inflicts great amount of pain on them.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government must encourage the availability of more doctors and medical personnel to do home visits to treat and care for these senior citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should provide support for these families to encourage them.&nbsp; Hence, education and relief-care support for caregivers need to be building up over time.&nbsp; If we are able to have a pool of relief caregivers, this would allow the caregivers to be able to walk away for a while and come back with renewed energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings us to the day-care centres and nursing homes in the community.&nbsp; The concerns of the community are that do we have enough day care-centres and nursing homes.&nbsp; If there is a shortage, how \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3737</p>\r\n\r\nbad are we?&nbsp; Recently, we have a boost in the number of child-care centres and they were created within a short period of time.&nbsp; We know the numbers of elderly coming over the next 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the planning parameters and the Ministry's estimation and its strategies on day-care and nursing homes in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the elderly, do we need a geriatric care unit in the community, for example, at each of the polyclinic?&nbsp;&nbsp; This should be a separate queue as the immune systems of senior citizens are significantly weaker than that of the young and the standard medication and treatment does not apply across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, can we look into the subsidy for the elderly for day-care services and nursing homes for families since we have allowed levy subsidy of maid for such home care?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the increasing elderly, we need to have more people knowing how to care for our elderly from the doctors, qualified nurses to step-down care nursing assistants and basic health care personnel.&nbsp; What are the plans of the Ministry to increase this pool of expertise?&nbsp; In addition, at the community level, some regular checks like&nbsp;monitoring tests, for example, the high blood pressure test and the sugar level test, can be done by certified medical personnel who are trained to do this work.&nbsp; In such cases, the residents do not need to travel far and this can be done near their homes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, if we have a good medical IT system, long-distance consultation could also be done since all our flats are going to be wired by a new fibre network.&nbsp;

Currently, 10% of Singaporeans are aged 65 and above.&nbsp; By 2030, 20% of Singaporeans will be over 65 years old.&nbsp; Our total population by then will be 5 million while seniors aged 65 and above will be 1 million. We must prepare early, especially in the areas of healthcare and nursing homes. We cannot wait until 10 or 20 years later.&nbsp; We must start right now.&nbsp; The Minister has announced the building of&nbsp;more nursing homes in HDB estates.&nbsp; It is welcomed by the elderly.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how many nursing homes we are going to build in the next five years.

They mostly suffer from chronic ailments and need long-term medication and care. We need to train a group of doctors and nurses that understand the elderly so as to provide them good services. I suggest we set up clinics for the elderly at the same time as we build the nursing homes to provide medical services to the seniors.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Although our polyclinics run by SingHealth and National Health Group (NHG)&nbsp;cater mainly to patients in the heartlands, they are increasingly being sought after by those living in the private \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3740</p>\r\n\r\nestates as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The usage of polyclinic services appears to be extremely high as we see many of our polyclinics having long queues with daily patient load that could well exceed 1,000 patients.&nbsp; This could be due to the fact that their operating hours are from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm and that their costs for consultation and medicine are generally lower compared to the privately-run clinics, especially those that remain open after 9.00 pm or 10.00 pm at night.&nbsp; I believe that there is a surcharge or a premium that is being paid for staying opened when all others are closed.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, these polyclinics remain open for&nbsp;only six days a week&nbsp;and they are closed on Sundays which means that the crowds on Mondays are usually higher.&nbsp; That there is a growing demand for healthcare services at our local polyclinics is never in doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister, in view of our increased population and greater demand for healthcare services and the high healthcare costs, if our polyclinics can remain open for 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans' lifestyle has changed tremendously and many do not keep strictly to the&nbsp;nine to&nbsp;five regime, especially those who are working.&nbsp; School-going children who attend the afternoon sessions are reaching homes after 7.00 pm and their working parents are returning home much later than that.&nbsp; When someone falls sick in the night, even the private clinics near their homes may have closed for the night.&nbsp; The few clinics that run 24 hours are charging much higher fees.&nbsp; It is at this time that if the polyclinics are open 24 hours, they will be serving a huge void.&nbsp; Further, minor ailments need not be rushed into the Accident and Emergency units of the hospitals.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In view of this essential service, the polyclinics are always very busy and crowded and see the whole spectrum of citizens, from infants to the common flu to the follow-up of&nbsp;chronic diseases of the elderly.&nbsp; We know we need more polyclinics simply by the virtue of the increasing population and our increasing elderly population.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time for the Ministry to review the roles and responsibilities of the polyclinics in the community.&nbsp; What are its KPIs &ndash; baby care,&nbsp;geriatric care,&nbsp;step-down care of the hospitals&nbsp;or walk-in care for the public?&nbsp; The needs are many and varied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the target customers of the polyclinics?&nbsp; What income levels are polyclinics serving which population segments?&nbsp; How about our foreign workers?&nbsp; They do need care too.&nbsp; Is it part of the polyclinics' role to serve this community as well?&nbsp; In view of the range of needs and the target customers, it will be a challenge for the Health Ministry to ensure that the community or the target customers the polyclinics set to serve are being served well and at affordable rates for the medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure of the Health Ministry's&nbsp;planning parameters for the number of polyclinics in the community in relation to population.&nbsp; Could the Minister let us know the Ministry's direction on the roles and responsibilities of polyclinics?&nbsp; Who are the target customers of the polyclinics and its plan on the expansion of the polyclinics in the community?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, just to highlight the concern on the grounds.&nbsp; The long queues and the&nbsp;waiting time: what are the measures the polyclinics are taking to cut down the waiting time?&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to highlight that this essential service needs to be accessible to the community and near to transport hubs as our people are getting older.&nbsp; The other concern on the ground is \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3742</p>\r\n\r\nthe opening hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the rehabilitative and follow-up cases would not be able to go to the polyclinics during office hours and, in general, they would prefer the Saturdays.&nbsp; However polyclinics operate for half a day on Saturdays and the ground is asking for longer hours on the weekends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On medical IT, there are two areas of interest: one is the data collection and sharing and the other are the use of medical IT for distant consultation and diagnosis.&nbsp; With&nbsp;the integrated medical information system, this would enable the polyclinics to extend its services to the heartland.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Osteoporosis suffers on increased risk in fractures which may\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3747</p>\r\n\r\nrequire hospitalisation and cause their health to deteriorate due to prolonged immobilisation.&nbsp; Many patients who&nbsp;sustain&nbsp;fracture do not return to their previous functional status and may require long-term institutional care.&nbsp; Figures from Singapore show that the incidence&nbsp;of hip&nbsp;fractures has gone up significantly since the 1960s, five times more in women&nbsp;and 1.5 times more in men.&nbsp; One year post-hip fracture, between 20%&nbsp;and 25% die, 30% of survivors are&nbsp;semi- or fully dependent.&nbsp; The costs to the individual, family and&nbsp;society are thus significant.&nbsp; Adequate treatment of osteoporosis is best&nbsp;essential to reduce these effects.&nbsp; What efforts have been made towards increasing public&nbsp;awareness and prevention so that this disease is not undertreated?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Long-term care</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, long-term care. &nbsp;The Eldercare Fund was set up in the year 2000 to grow income and&nbsp;provide funding for&nbsp;nursing homes and other long-term care providers.&nbsp; The Government has stated that the&nbsp;Eldercare Fund would not replace community support in this sector, and that community donations are vital in financing step-down care&nbsp;for those of low and&nbsp;low-middle income.&nbsp; According to the MOH website's write-up on eldercare, \"voluntary welfare organisations should continue to raise funds&nbsp;from the community and do their part in helping the needy and indigent patients to foot their share of the charges using the donations raised.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Budget, the Government has set up the Community Silver Trust to provide donations for long-term care providers.

While most people are honest, some patients and some providers do abuse the system at the expense of the vast majority of honest people.&nbsp; More healthcare does not always deliver better health.&nbsp; Beyond some point, there are limits to medical science.&nbsp; Many healthcare problems are self-inflicted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lam gave the example of the patient with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).&nbsp; No medicine, for example, can help a patient with COPD unless he or she stops smoking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incentives can work in healthcare but poorly-designed though well-intentioned health policies can end up distorting behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, and most importantly, we are all mortals and eventually we all have to die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other healthcare systems choose to ignore these hard truths and are, for instance, based on wishful thinking that people can live forever, that more treatment is better, and there is a cure for every disease, \"a pill for every ill\".&nbsp; For the terminally ill, they will strive to prolong life at all costs, never mind the quality of life nor the futility of such efforts.&nbsp; The US spent 18% of its GDP on healthcare and they know that much of that is unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My recent heart bypass has sharpened my sense of my own mortality.&nbsp; I have regained my fitness level.&nbsp; In fact, today is exactly 10 months after my bypass and I have become even more diligent in my regular exercises.&nbsp; Before coming here, I did four and a half&nbsp;kilometres on the treadmill.&nbsp; But I know the score of having to live with&nbsp;heart disease.&nbsp; I am 59 and I do my best to keep my body in good condition, live a full life, and hope to grow old with dignity.&nbsp; But I am under no \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3752</p>\r\n\r\ndelusion and I know that someday I, too, will leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is how?&nbsp; Like others, I have my share of worries.&nbsp; Will I suffer a stroke that condemns me to severe disability?&nbsp; Will I develop dementia and lose my mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At every Chinese New Year,&nbsp;I wish my residents \"&#20581;&#24247;&#38271;&#23551;\" or good health and longevity.&nbsp; They said \"yes\" to the first part, good health.&nbsp; But on longevity, many said: \"not too long please\" and I know what they mean.&nbsp; We all strive for a long, meaningful life, but the two words \"long\" and \"meaningful\" have to come together in order to make a happy person.&nbsp; A long life of pain and suffering is a miserable life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reading Susan Jacoby&rsquo;s latest book &ldquo;<I>Never Say Die</I>&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is my bedside reading at the moment.&nbsp; She was most critical of the American approach to end-of-life care.&nbsp; In it, she related her last conversation with her grandmother in a nursing home when she was nearly 100 years old.&nbsp; This was what she recalled: \"A small boy tossed a beach ball in our direction.&nbsp; Gran tried to rise from her chair and throw the ball back but she was too frail to stand without help.&nbsp; Collapsing backward, she said in a soft voice devoid of either self-pity or anger, 'the worst thing about having lived too long is you know you are of absolutely no use to anyone.'&nbsp; It was agonising for me to hear my grandmother said this, because she defined herself by her usefulness.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often visit nursing homes with my grassroots leaders.&nbsp; Some patients welcome our visit as it breaks their daily routine and we do bring cheer to them.&nbsp; But many with severe dementia live in their own lost world, oblivious to what is going on around them. Many others are clearly suffering.&nbsp; Often, I just looked at my grassroots leaders and by our body language, without a word being spoken, we say to one another: \"Let&rsquo;s hope we do \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3753</p>\r\nnot end our life this way.\"&nbsp; I would silently offer a prayer for the patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my Ministry, we have crafted a phrase \"with peace of mind\" into our vision to help Singaporeans \"live well, live long and with peace of mind\".&nbsp; We meant this seriously.&nbsp; I took this mission diligently.&nbsp; My personal mission in life is to help serve the young and the old so that they have peace of mind.&nbsp; In Chinese we call it \"&#32769;&#32773;&#23433;&#20043;&#65292;&#23569;&#32773;&#24576;&#20043;\". This came from Confucius.&nbsp; That was his personal mission in life when asked by one of his students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot eliminate death and suffering.&nbsp; But we can avoid inflicting unnecessary pain and suffering to the natural process of dying by being wise in our healthcare policies and in how we structure our healthcare system.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her book, Susan Jacoby also wrote about an American woman who, just a month before her 100th birthday, underwent surgery to install a special defibrillator and pacemaker in her failing heart.&nbsp; When it happened, it was front page news on <I>New York Times</I>. That is a great achievement in medical science.&nbsp; The surgery postponed her death and extended her life for a while. But it was a life full of suffering, requiring the full-time services of a home healthcare aide, paid for by taxpayers and being confined to a wheelchair with both failing vision and failing hearing.&nbsp; This may be an extreme example, but in the US healthcare system, such cases of aggressive medical intervention during one&rsquo;s last few months or weeks are not uncommon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a good and relatively inexpensive healthcare system because we have sensible and wise doctors.&nbsp; We must not port in mindlessly foreign practices based on fallacies and unrealistic expectations.&nbsp; That will only bring misery to the patients and their families at great cost to society.&nbsp; Singaporeans are living longer and, with it, there will be greater demand for healthcare services. They also\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3754</p>\r\n\r\nwant to age in place, at home and in the community, except for the occasional emergencies to the acute hospitals.&nbsp; Much of the healthcare services for the elderly can be competently delivered in the community, away from costly hospitals.&nbsp; That is why Budget 2011 places so much emphasis on long-term care. Even as we improve our hospitals, we will do even more to transform our long-term care sector and many MPs spoke about this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already started this journey and we are on track. The new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) illustrates how we are making progress.&nbsp; Most MPs have visited it.&nbsp; You have seen how we have raised services, especially for patients in Class B2 and Class C, to a higher level, delivering a \"hassle-free\" hospital experience.&nbsp; You have also heard how KTPH is reaching out to the community outside of the hospital and supporting them to look after the discharged patients.&nbsp; In other words, all the hospitals&rsquo; CEOs know that their responsibility now extends beyond the hospital walls.&nbsp; It is not just within the hospital walls.&nbsp; And this transformation is not just in KTPH. &nbsp;There is also a quiet revolution in Changi General Hospital (CGH), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), National University Hospital and polyclinics.&nbsp; We have made progress in mental health, chronic disease management, integrated care between hospitals and the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the work is not finished yet.&nbsp; I still have a substantive agenda of things to accomplish.&nbsp; If we stay the course, over the next five to 10 years, we can further transform our healthcare, to be among the best in the world.&nbsp; Let me sketch out our plan in seven areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will realise our vision of a general hospital in every region.&nbsp; In the north, KTPH has added 550 beds to our bed capacity.&nbsp; In the west, the Jurong General Hospital (JGH) is on track to open in 2014 with 700 beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3755</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam will be pleased to know that a new general hospital will come up in his constituency to serve the residents living in the north-east.&nbsp; The new Sengkang General Hospital will be located next to the Cheng Lim LRT Station.&nbsp; It will also be within walking distance to the Sengkang MRT Station which is in Mr Charles Chong&rsquo;s constituency.&nbsp; It will open by 2020.&nbsp; Given a lead time of six or seven years to design and build, it is not too soon nor too late to start planning.&nbsp; I have asked the SingHealth Cluster to assemble a young outstanding team to take charge of this project.&nbsp; I will challenge them to build a hospital, even better than KTPH and JGH, measured from the patients&rsquo; point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the three general hospitals will have community hospitals adjoining them, and this will significantly expand our community hospital capacity.&nbsp; These are multi-billion-dollar investments but they are worthy investments.&nbsp; Together with TTSH serving the central region and CGH serving the east, they will realise our vision of bringing healthcare close to the residents living in each region of Singapore.&nbsp; Good healthcare will be within 30 minutes of every patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we have achieved very good mortality indicators, including life expectancy, child mortality and other disease-specific death rates.&nbsp; We will now measure how specific diseases impact the overall well-being of Singaporeans.&nbsp; To do so, we will track morbidity indicators and strive for further improvement.&nbsp; My vision is to get our morbidity indicators to match the top tier of OECD countries in the key disease areas which matter to us, like heart disease, diabetes, mental disorders and cancer.&nbsp; We are currently about average, among the OECD countries. Let us&nbsp;move up to a higher tier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means knowing how to better treat these common diseases, whether in \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3756</p>\r\n\r\nterms of prevention, early detection, treatment, rehabilitation or continuing care.&nbsp; For example, Assoc. Prof. Straughan mentioned just now our mammogram screening rate.&nbsp; We are below OECD average and we have to make progress there.&nbsp; This will require us to raise the capabilities and outcomes of our national specialist centres to match the best elsewhere.&nbsp; Where appropriate, we will invest in building new capability peaks in areas such as organ transplant, geriatrics and rehabilitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have been redeveloping our polyclinics to meet the challenges of an ageing population.&nbsp; Over \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe past five years, we have upgraded eight polyclinics, including Woodlands, Bukit Batok,&nbsp;Pasir Ris and Hougang Polyclinics.&nbsp; As Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef put it, strengthening primary care is important.&nbsp; Several MPs toured the upgraded Pasir Ris Polyclinic recently. &nbsp;The upgraded polyclinics are now paperless, fully computerised.&nbsp; They are film-less with tele-radiology services.&nbsp; X-rays are being read in India by US Board-certified radiologists and returned within half an hour.&nbsp; They are scriptless, that is no more paper prescription, with e-prescription (electronic prescription) capability.&nbsp; They are also piloting tele-ophthalmology to cut down unnecessary referrals to the hospital ophthalmologist.&nbsp; The use of technology&nbsp;&ndash; a point that Mdm Cynthia Phua mentioned&nbsp;just now &ndash; all those are happening in our upgraded polyclinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are also multi-disciplinary, no longer just doctors, nurses and patients,&nbsp;but with advanced practice nurses, clinical pharmacists, podiatrists and clinical psychologists providing consultations, side by side with family physicians.&nbsp; Patients with chronic diseases are given clinic appointments for their regular follow-ups.&nbsp; It is no longer just simply walk-in. This has cut down their waiting time for those with appointments.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, our polyclinics are no longer like in \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3757</p>\r\n\r\nthe past and that is why I have arranged some MPs to visit them so that they do not live with&nbsp;the image of the polyclinics of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One patient emailed me last month, pleasantly surprised by the transformation.&nbsp; I quote him: \"I visited the Marine Parade Polyclinic.&nbsp; The service was fast, friendly and efficient.&nbsp; The time from registration to payment was less than half an hour, a far cry from the days when a visit to the polyclinic was a two-hour affair\".&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that waiting remains a problem in polyclinics for walk-in patients without any appointments.&nbsp; But for those with appointments, waiting is now manageable.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to upgrade the other polyclinics.&nbsp; Over the next five years, Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Geylang, Tampines and Yishun Polyclinics will benefit from this polyclinic redevelopment programme.&nbsp; This will cost us $50 million.&nbsp; For the rapidly expanding population in Punggol, we are also planning a new polyclinic in that town.&nbsp; This will help relieve Sengkang Polyclinic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we will transform long-term care like community care hospitals, nursing homes, day rehabilitation and home health care, which many MPs spoke about.&nbsp; Done well, this will particularly benefit the elderly with chronic diseases.&nbsp; The objective is to help them manage the disease well, so that they can have a good quality of life.&nbsp; Transforming long-term care is our top priority in the next decade.&nbsp; We will sharpen our focus on geriatric care.&nbsp; We will equip all our doctors, nurses and allied health professionals with knowledge of geriatric medicine as a core competency.&nbsp; Of course, the healthcare professionals must also acquire the soft skills to understand the needs and concerns of the elderly patients in order to deliver better care, as Mr Ang Mong Seng pointed out just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3758</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have begun preparations to set up a&nbsp;Geriatric Education and Research Institute this year to develop, coordinate and implement various initiatives to strengthen geriatric education and research.&nbsp; We will develop integrated care pathways starting with five groups of patients with hip fractures, stroke, heart failure, COPD and diabetes.&nbsp; By standardising critical elements of care and defined clinical indicators, these integrated care pathways will enable patients to transit smoothly from one healthcare provider to another across the care continuum.&nbsp; This is what I meant by a \"hassle-free healthcare system\".&nbsp; This is also the sort of preferred outcome that Mdm Halimah spoke about just now.&nbsp; Truly integrated care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our AIC &ndash; the Agency for Integrated Care is just one year old, but it is already making impact in the long-term care sector.&nbsp; They are doing what Dr Lam described as supportive services to facilitate care in the community.&nbsp; To give an example, AIC stations teams of what we call Aged Care TransitION (ACTION) care coordinators in hospitals to help patients with complex needs transit smoothly from the hospital back into their homes and communities.&nbsp; Their services include helping the patients to arrange relevant community services for the patient and their caregivers.&nbsp; They have already touched the lives of over 10,000 patients.&nbsp; \"Hassle-free\", \"integrated care\", \"clinical pathways\" are abstract technical terms.&nbsp; But when translated into actual actions on the ground, they make a world of difference for the patients and their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ask Mdm Samsiah Saifi.&nbsp; Her husband suffered a stroke, became paralysed and bedridden.&nbsp; Overnight, she became both sole breadwinner and sole caregiver.&nbsp; She was at her wits' end. Her ACTION care coordinator from NUH slowly coached her on the appropriate \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3759</p>\r\n\r\nhomecare services that her husband will need&nbsp;and followed up by visiting her husband to check on his condition and medication.&nbsp; Mdm Saifi has her handphone number to consult round the clock.&nbsp; This has given her confidence and peace of mind.&nbsp; AIC has brought cheer back to her life and that of her family.&nbsp; With AIC, there are now many such success stories.&nbsp; We are scaling up AIC operations nationwide to benefit even more patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One primary objective is to help Singaporeans avoid unnecessary hospitalisation.&nbsp; For example, old folks falling resulting in emergency hospital admission are common stories.&nbsp; You avoid falls, you avoid hospitalisation.&nbsp; Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH)&nbsp;works closely with the elderly in the community to assess or measure what is your risk of falling and then pick up the high-risk group, coach them to help them improve their balance because it is a skill that can be coached.&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp;admissions to hospitals by this group of elderly come down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day, some seniors in some nursing homes will develop some complications.&nbsp; Without resident geriatricians, the only recourse is to call for an ambulance to send them to&nbsp;A&amp;E.&nbsp; Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH)&nbsp;works with St Joseph&rsquo;s Home on tele-consultation, so that the nursing home can consult the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's geriatrician, over the Internet, before they call the ambulance.&nbsp; Not all admissions are necessary and timely advice from the hospital geriatrician is often what is needed.&nbsp; Patients, doctors, nursing homes and hospitals&rsquo; A&amp;Es save time as a result.&nbsp; Everyone benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our healthy elderly who are living at home, we want to help them stay active within the community.&nbsp; Some eventually may suffer from age-related functional decline.&nbsp; In particular, mobility\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3760</p>\r\n\r\ncan become a problem.&nbsp; It raises the risk of falls and the need for greater caregiver support.&nbsp; A simple mobility device like a walking frame or a wheelchair can make a difference.&nbsp; But VWOs have told us that some of their clients cannot afford such devices.&nbsp; They cannot pay, so they make do with umbrellas.&nbsp; But umbrellas are lousy substitutes, so they still fall.&nbsp; The VWOs&nbsp;raise funds to help them pay for those walking frames and wheelchairs.&nbsp; What they can do is limited by how much they can collect from public donations.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;why we&nbsp;are setting up the Senior&rsquo;s Mobility Fund and we will put in $10 million for a start.&nbsp; The objective is to help the VWOs reach out to more such low-income elderly and provide them with basic mobility devices.&nbsp; There will, of course, be some means-testing, needs-assessment and some co-payment. All these will be&nbsp;done by the VWOs.&nbsp; This way, we allow greater flexibility and responsiveness in adapting the scheme to local needs.&nbsp; For example, there may also be cases where some sort of transport assistance to help seniors go for their regular rehabilitation exercises may be greatly beneficial.&nbsp; The desired outcome is to enable the elderly achieve independence so that they can move around with greater ease to perform necessary tasks like getting to their day rehabilitation exercises or simply just going downstairs to the void deck or to the coffee shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming our long-term care includes transforming our nursing homes.&nbsp; One significant step is our Nursing Home Development Programme to build new nursing homes in HDB towns.&nbsp; I have discussed this before, including on how to raise their rehabilitative capabilities to help their patients get well and go home.&nbsp; In other words, as Mr Ang Mong Seng put it, to regain their ability&nbsp;in a nursing home and&nbsp;not an old folks&rsquo; home.&nbsp; I will, in due course, try to&nbsp;explain in Mandarin the difference between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3761</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such improved outcomes also require us to transform our home healthcare sector.&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee,&nbsp;Dr Lam and several MPs stressed this point.&nbsp; This means putting in place supportive structures and services in the community.&nbsp; We are ramping up the Home Nursing Foundation (HNF).&nbsp; They now have nurses in TTSH to connect up with patients about to be discharged to ensure a smooth handover for patients who are likely to require home healthcare.&nbsp; Once the patient is home, HNF coordinates with other providers to meet the patient&rsquo;s care needs in the community.&nbsp; There are now over 300 patients under their care.&nbsp; We will expand this programme to the other regions so that more Singaporeans can benefit from home care.&nbsp; But it is not just HNF, we will similarly support other VWOs like Touch Community Services and other providers such as NTUC ElderCare to expand home care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For home and community care to work, I agree with Members on the central role of the caregivers.&nbsp; They are the unsung heroes and heroines, making huge personal sacrifices, whether out of love, filial piety or simply&nbsp;plain human decency.&nbsp; My Ministry will do all we can to support them with skills training, counselling, psychological support, and sometimes just a shoulder to cry on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam&nbsp;asked about caregiver allowance.&nbsp; Obviously, this goes beyond my Ministry&rsquo;s purview.&nbsp; Minister Lim Boon Heng has addressed this point a few days ago.&nbsp; Let me give you my personal take on this issue.&nbsp; I believe paying caregivers to provide care-giving is an insult.&nbsp; It cheapens the sacrifice that they are making.&nbsp; If you believe in this cause, the whole society ought to be supportive.&nbsp; We have our fair share of and&nbsp;we have met some of these dedicated caregivers.&nbsp; When we see them and to help them,&nbsp;me and my grassroots leaders, we simply take money out of our own pockets, or to periodically&nbsp;top up the Welfare Fund.&nbsp; Or,&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3762</p>\r\n\r\nit may be&nbsp;within our clan, our own&nbsp;extended family.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own extended family, I have a handful of those very dedicated caregivers who sacrificed their lives, sometimes staying single in order to look after somebody that they love.&nbsp; Chinese New Year, we distribute <I>ang pows,</I> I&nbsp;give extra big <I>ang pows</I> for those people.&nbsp; Not to say, \"this is your allowance or your bonus\", but to say, \"thank you for being a kind person and sorry that&nbsp;I cannot be with you shoulder to shoulder to help look after this relative\".&nbsp; I think that is how we should address this whole issue of supporting caregivers as a society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, we will step up efforts to help Singaporeans stay healthy.&nbsp; As stressed by Dr Lam, this is ultimately the most basic strategy: Singaporeans must take ownership of their own health, and embrace a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; We have increased the budget for the Health Promotion Board to $120 million.&nbsp; They will find creative ways to promote the healthy lifestyle message and to involve the community extensively.&nbsp; Taking Senior Minister Goh&rsquo;s advice, we will shift the National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign from being top-down to a more ground-up initiative. &nbsp;Soon we will be coming to the MPs to seek your support and active involvement to help us achieve this breakthrough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A healthy lifestyle includes a habit to go for regular health checks.&nbsp; Last month, the Academy of Medicine published very useful guidelines on what to screen.&nbsp; My Ministry has accepted the guidelines in full.&nbsp; It will help Singaporeans, in consultation with their General Practitioners (GPs) to choose the appropriate health screening tests that they should undergo given their age and individual risk profile.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">5.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the guidelines, there are two relatively costly items: colonoscopy and \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3763</p>\r\n\r\nmammogram. I agree with Dr Lam that we should make these tests affordable through Medisave. Dr Lily Neo and Mdm Halimah made a similar call for mammograms before. I agree with them. We will extend Medisave, within withdrawal limits, to cover mammograms for breast cancer screening in women aged 50 and above, and colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening for persons aged 50 and above. We will get this implemented as soon as we can make the necessary changes to the computer programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, we will strongly involve the community on healthcare issues. There are several aspects to it. Keeping Singaporeans healthy requires the community to collectively keep the environment clean. Peer support helps to sustain a healthy lifestyle among all Singaporeans. Fighting viruses requires a united community response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our society is built on meritocracy and equal opportunities for all. But some will do much better than others. The more successful, in turn, help the less fortunate. That is how philanthropy underpins social bonding and unites people as one. Hence, the Chinese saying \"&#28404;&#27700;&#20043;&#24681;&#65292;&#24403;&#28044;&#27849;&#30456;&#25253;\" (<I>di shui zhi en, dang yong quan xiang bao</I>), to exhort people to pay it forward in society when able to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our migrant forefathers walked such talk. For example, in healthcare, the late Mr Tan Tock Seng and Mr Lee Kong Chian left behind their philanthropist legacies in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the Lee Kong Chian Medical School. They were the eminent philanthropists of the last century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are spearheading a modern version of philanthropy by pledging at least half of\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3764</p>\r\n\r\ntheir fortune to charity. At least 40 billionaires have joined their cause. Their efforts are softening the \"winners take all\" capitalist model. The American system has always had philanthropists who supported their top universities and their top hospitals. What is different this time is that they are parting with their fortune while they are still alive. As Mr Michael Bloomberg, one of the 40 billionaires, put it, I quote: \"You don't have to wait to die to give it away. It never made a lot of sense to me why you'd&nbsp;want to change the world for the better and not be around to see it.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several years ago, the family of the late Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat indicated that they would like to donate to the healthcare sector. I suggested that they consider supporting the new hospital which we were then building in Yishun. They readily responded with a generous donation of $125 million. Tan Sri Khoo was an eminent philanthropist of this century and deserved the recognition when we named the new hospital at Yishun after him. There are other eminent philanthropists. I am happy to inform this House that the family of the late Mr Ng Teng Fong has decided to donate $125 million towards the new hospital in Jurong. That is a big boost to our efforts to provide high quality healthcare for Singaporeans living in the west. And in recognition of the significant donation, we will name it Ng Teng Fong Hospital. Both are Government hospitals fully funded by the Government. But the private donations provide additional assistance to needy patients, besides funding other worthy services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In similar spirit, through the $1 billion Community Silver Trust, we hope to inspire successful Singaporeans to come forward to co-develop our long-term care sector. This sector has always been served by the VWOs with passion and compassion. But for the next stage of&nbsp;development, we need to inject more \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3765</p>\r\n\r\nfunds, more skills, more resources,&nbsp;more diversity to help raise capabilities and make them world-class. By matching donations, we preserve the legacy of the long-term care sector being driven largely by VWOs and the community. I think it will be wrong if we&nbsp;move in in a big way and displace the VWOs.&nbsp; By matching public donations, we hope to attract larger donations into this relatively less glamorous sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community support does not merely come in the form of financial donations. Many Singaporeans have been volunteering their services in the hospitals. For example, a team of volunteers has been nursing the roof-top garden at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital,&nbsp;contributing their labour and expertise every day.&nbsp; I go there quite often, different time of the day, sometimes at noon.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see them sweating away like farmers.&nbsp; And when I spoke to them, they said,&nbsp;<I>wo men zuo de hen kai xin</I> (&#25105;&#20204;&#20570;&#24471;&#24456;&#24320;&#24515;) or we are so happy doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because they know that the harvests go to benefit the patients in the wards. We will continue to encourage and support such community spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, our commitment to continue ensuring that healthcare remains affordable for all Singaporeans is firm. Our 3Ms framework&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Medisave, MediShield and Medifund&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;is time-tested. It is an important supplement to the Government subsidy framework which is the main financier of inpatient care. This year's Budget will put nearly $7 billion into healthcare&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;$4 billion in MOH budget and $3 billion in the various top-ups to help Singaporeans pay their medical bills. This has enabled us to help more needy Singaporeans and we will also continue to enhance our 3Ms. In the new financial year:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) We will increase&nbsp;Medifund budget allocation to $85 million, from $80 million to help more subsidised patients;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3766</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) We will double the Medication Assistance Fund (MAF) to $20 million, to help needy patients pay for expensive drugs. MAF will be extended to cover six more drugs&nbsp;&ndash; I cannot even pronounce their names&nbsp;&ndash; they are drugs&nbsp;to treat heart diseases, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) We will double the subsidy cap for surgical implants to $1,000.&nbsp; I remember Mdm Halimah made this request last month. This will now cover up to 90% of all implants used in our public hospitals;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) We will expand Medisave to cover outpatient treatment for two more diseases&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;dementia and bi-polar disorder -&nbsp;in addition to eight existing chronic diseases, making it a total of 10. And this should have covered practically all the major chronic diseases;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) We will expand the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS)&nbsp;that Mr Low mentioned just now, to cover all the 10 major chronic diseases. This will, as he put it,&nbsp;make it convenient for the elderly to receive subsidised care from the many participating GPs in their neighbourhood; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)&nbsp;We will also extend PCPS to cover two specialist dental procedures&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;root canal treatment and crowning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I conclude, let me briefly address some specific comments made by Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee asked whether we could run polyclinics 24 hours. &nbsp;I am not keen. The reason is there are only so few polyclinics but there are thousands of GPs outside.&nbsp; I think we should&nbsp;try to leverage on the network of the GPs&nbsp;through PCPS. I think that&nbsp;is a much more cost-effective solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam and Assoc. Prof. Straughan suggested that we incentivise healthy\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3767</p>\r\n\r\nbehaviour, like health screening, giving credit for citizens who participate in&nbsp;health screening. We do subsidise such&nbsp;screening for the seniors. But I am not persuaded that we need to bribe them to do what is good for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam had a question on utilisation of Medisave overseas. So far, only 58, less than 60,&nbsp;have withdrawn about $125,000 from their Medisave for the treatment in Malaysia. What is the benefit of the scheme when I introduced it? It is to widen&nbsp;choices, and I still believe in it.&nbsp; It widens choices but the low utilisation&nbsp;re-affirms the confidence that Singaporeans have in Singapore healthcare.&nbsp;And I think we should be proud of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam also asked about our preparedness for pandemics. We have now experienced two: SARS and H1N1. We did very well in both. But I agree with Dr Lam that we must never become complacent or arrogant. We must always be prepared for surprises. Our preparedness plans are multi-sectoral and they are regularly tested, reviewed, enhanced. The plan includes stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines as soon as they become commercially available. For example, we have&nbsp;&ndash; I forgot the quantity&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a lot of pre-pandemic H5N1.&nbsp; Remember bird flu?&nbsp; It is still around in the birds and, therefore, one day it may just jump species and&nbsp;there is a vaccine available.&nbsp; We spent quite a lot of money stockpiling it.&nbsp; Hopefully, we never have to use it. &nbsp;We have also secured new funds to support research in infectious diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim talked about Standard Drug List (SDL) and also osteoporosis. She asked a question before in the House which&nbsp;I had answered. The SDL is a list prepared by experts and chaired by the Director of Medical Services, and the professionals have various criteria. I outlined them previously in this House to \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3768</p>\r\n\r\ndecide which drugs go in and which drugs should stay out. She talked about the SDL list,&nbsp;or what is called the Essential Drug List in Australia and some other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to clarify that the two are different.&nbsp; In many countries, with national health insurance system, the Essential Drug List&nbsp;is the list of drugs available.&nbsp; In other words, if a drug is on the list,&nbsp;only then will the insurers&nbsp;pay.&nbsp; If a drug is not on the list, you cannot even get the drug.&nbsp; Whereas our SDL is for the purpose of deciding on the degree of subsidy in public hospitals.&nbsp; So&nbsp;if a drug is not on the list, it does not mean the drug is not available. It is available, you can buy it from Guardian or even from&nbsp;our hospital pharmacies except that they have got to pay for it, without subsidy, that is all.&nbsp; So that is the reason why we did not think it necessary to make it a public document but&nbsp;there is nothing secretive about the list.&nbsp; If you ask any Government doctor, he will know what the list is. She mentioned that some doctors are ignorant about it.&nbsp; If it is&nbsp;private doctors, I suppose they ought to be ignorant because they do not work in public hospitals. Osteoporosis is something which I am not too familiar.&nbsp; I am not old enough yet, I suppose.&nbsp; But her concern is a real one, which is that with&nbsp;ageing, the incidents will grow and that&nbsp;women seem to be&nbsp; affected by osteoporosis more than men and, therefore, it is something that we should not take it lightly, and we do&nbsp;not.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Promotion Board is, in fact, in the midst of including the screening for osteoporosis in their integrated screening programme.&nbsp; They have piloted the screening programme, found it useful and they will now include it&nbsp;in this national integrated screening programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef asked about our medical intake. The third Medical School is on track to take the first batch of students in 2013. Together with the other medical schools, they will train at a steady state&nbsp;of about 500 doctors annually. That is not a small number.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3769</p>\r\n\r\nSupplemented by some foreign graduates, that should be adequate for our needs. Current efforts have already improved our doctor to population ratio&nbsp;of 1:580, which is quite good. But I agree with her that ill distribution among specialties is a bigger challenge and we&nbsp;must address that. Meanwhile, the public hospitals' Pre-Employment Grant for Singaporean medical students overseas in their final years of study has been very well received. From the UK, more than&nbsp;30 Singaporean students studying there have committed to come back&nbsp;under this scheme. I expect even a bigger number from those studying in Australia and their applications are being processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">5.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang talked about PCPS and found it&nbsp;a useful scheme. I think he commended on it that it is convenient for the patients, etc.&nbsp; But he asked whether&nbsp;we could review the criteria to make it less stringent. We designed this scheme for the seniors and that is why we pegged it at 65 and above.&nbsp; Should we reduce the age?&nbsp; Offhand, I say \"no\" because we are living longer, beyond age 65, and we are promoting re-employment all the way to 65.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But at the margin, we&nbsp;can allow for discretionary power when we assess the applicants, whether to put them onto the PCPS scheme. He has an interesting suggestion, which is, why can we&nbsp;not have&nbsp;subsidy which is tiered, instead of a common subsidy. I am not&nbsp;keen&nbsp;because the current&nbsp;subsidy is already quite heavy, so I do not know how much more tiering can we do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;end-of-life care, he mentioned&nbsp;the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)&nbsp;&ndash; Quality of Death Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I discussed this in this House before and explained the ranking. It was quite a good ranking&nbsp;&ndash; 18 out of&nbsp; a whole list of&nbsp;many countries. But if you look at the list of countries which are ranked, I myself consider the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3770</p>\r\n\r\nassessment fair because of the efforts we have put in the last few years.&nbsp; If we were to be&nbsp;rated five years ago, I think our ranking would be poorer. But at No.18,&nbsp;we are No. 2 in Asia.&nbsp; And the reason for the lower ranking <I>vis-a-vis,</I> say, some European countries like&nbsp;Belgium has nothing to do with being first-world or third-world, but it has to do with the degree of ageing of the society.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are still a very young society as compared to Europe. Relatively, Europe is rather old and because it is older, their facilities for providing and looking after end of life care would be much better developed.&nbsp; But our ageing is coming on strongly, definitely in 10 years' time, so we have started the planning exercises five to&nbsp;10 years ago. I am quite sure, in five years' time, if EIU were to do a similar assessment, our ranking will further improve.&nbsp; I am confident about that one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I take his point that end-of-life care is a very important topic in healthcare. I spend time thinking about it all the time because this is the last stage of one's life. You really want everyone to part not just with peace of mind, but gracefully, with dignity. And I think, as a society, we should do our best to do so. And do not just look to the Government to be the provider because that will always be a sub-optimal solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just reading an interview given by Harvard Professor Clayton Christensen to <I>Forbes Magazine</I> and he was talking about how he looked after his dying father. He just dropped everything he was doing and spent time with him. And he told the <I>Forbes</I> interviewer \"that was the best period of my life\".&nbsp; Reading it reminded myself of my mother. She died of ovarian cancer many years ago when I was&nbsp;the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade and Industry.&nbsp; After doing all the necessary surgery, chemotherapy, etc,&nbsp;my eldest brother who lives in Canada&nbsp;&ndash; he has been living in Canada for many years&nbsp;&ndash; did what&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3771</p>\r\n\r\nProfessor Clayton did. &nbsp;He just dropped everything, came home to Penang and looked after my mother.&nbsp; I often look back and think, how I wish I could have done the same thing too. That is what end-of-life care is all about. As a Ministry, we will do all we can to support end-of-life care as much as we can. The important thing is, as I have said earlier, do not, without wisdom, mindlessly port in all the American practices, wrong practices&nbsp;of aggressive treatment and putting the terminally-ill in costly acute hospitals, subjecting them to all sorts of pain and sufferings, with zero improvement in quality of care, if anything, just introducing harm and sufferings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef and Dr Lam Pin Min asked if Medisave or MediShield can be extended to cover congenital diseases. I am sympathetic to this request, but I am not ready yet to reform MediShield.&nbsp;When we do, I intend to extend it to cover congenital illnesses and also mental illness. The key is how to do it in a way to make sure that the premiums remain affordable. And that is the challenge.&nbsp;I think we will find creative solutions to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about Medisave 300, whether we can raise this cap of 300 to a higher level. Of course, the cap is not cast in stone and we will review it periodically. An immediate adjustment is not necessary because the vast majority of patients do not have difficulty with the cap. Do not forget this is the cap per account. So, if a patient has several children, it is 300 times whichever number of Medisave Accounts. She&nbsp;asked about the adequacy of the Medisave minimum required amount.&nbsp; That is a figure that we adjust periodically to take into account&nbsp;medical inflation.&nbsp;The recent increase in Medisave contribution rate of 0.5%, I am quite sure, will help many \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3772</p>\r\n\r\nmore members to achieve&nbsp;higher savings later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have addressed all the cuts submitted by Members. There were a few cuts on obesity, and so on, which we will tackle&nbsp;in the later part of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in the last five years, we have made a lot of progress&nbsp;&ndash; it was making&nbsp;our healthcare system better. In independent surveys, our patients rated our public hospitals and polyclinics as either \"good\" or&nbsp;\"very good\". Three in four rated them as \"excellent value for money\". Many foreign experts have studied and praised our healthcare system. But we must press on with reforms, underpinned by wisdom and realism, and a generous dose of humanity. If we stay the course, in another five years, Singapore healthcare will be even better than today. I thank Members for&nbsp;their continuous support for my Ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Mental health</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Madam, mental healthcare has always been costly and medical treatment has to be given on a long-term basis. Low and mid-range income groups who are caring for mentally-ill family members would need financial assistance to cope with the long-term medical care, especially when the family members are not working. Many a time, within the family, there are many mental patients as well.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last October, we raised this issue in Parliament. I wish to take this opportunity to request for more funds to be allocated to management of their welfare. We need to address the needs of the patients&nbsp;who are recovering from mental illness or whose illness is under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;We really need more day care and rehabilitative facilities at the community and the number and sufficiency would entail the Ministry to do an in-depth study for these mental patients. Alternatively,&nbsp;could the&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3773</p>\r\n\r\nMinister&nbsp;set aside funding to support VWOs who provide such services and to help them set up such centres? Funding will need to go into training volunteers and subsidising these facilities for needy families. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s support for more of these day care centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real issue on the ground and&nbsp;the community is that many do not know the condition of mental illness.&nbsp; More education and engagement of the families and the community need to be done.&nbsp;Just recently, there is an article by the <I>Straits Times</I> on the good work done by a psychiatrist from Australia. He mentioned that if the mental patient can be detected early and given the right treatment, they would be able to recover. However in our society, mental illness is still being stigmatised and many people may know but refuse to do treatment early. The Ministry needs to work with the&nbsp; schools and universities for early detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the community, we came across many new cases where family could not manage to persuade the patient to have early treatment, resulting in nuisances being caused to the neighbourhood and the patient himself who suffers the mental illness. The present law does not allow the Ministry to do direct intervention of bringing new mental patient for treatment. As a result, the community suffers. Recently, it took me a while to persuade the Police to help the Residents&rsquo; Committee members, with the support of the family, to bring a resident who had been causing stress to his fellow block of residents to IMH for treatment. Basically, he switched on the radio at full blast 24 hours of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotline mobile team of IMH will only respond if the person is a known patient of IMH.&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry to look into the need to amend the necessary&nbsp;law and allow the Ministry personnel for direct intervention to bring \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3774</p>\r\n\r\nnew mental patients for treatment; if not, the community would be even more disturbed and stressed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> Madam, mental health problems still hold&nbsp;some stigma in the society and will prevent patients from seeking help and professional advice early and impede their re-integration &nbsp;into the workforce and community after treatment.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister about the progress we have made with our present framework to educate, identify and treat Singaporeans with mental health problems, including milder ones, such as depression and mood swings. Would the Minister also share with us the programmes to prepare and re-integrate patients into mainstream society?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of concern in a rapidly ageing population, as data from other countries has indicated is that longevity does not guarantee good health or mental health. We must be prepared for cases of elderly dementia and other mental health problems which afflict the elderly.

The increasingly hectic and fast paced life in Singapore has been impacting Singaporeans in many ways, notably emotionally, physically and mentally. Even&nbsp;people who look sane and \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3775</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nsound reasonable may be undergoing some stress, but they are not revealing or seeking help as nobody wants to see a shrink or be seen with one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people in Singapore suffering from psychiatric problems are still severely disadvantaged in the quantity and quality of care available to them. There is&nbsp;not much understanding and regard given to their rights and needs.&nbsp;And these are, often times,&nbsp;due to family members not wanting to admit that one of their members may need psychiatric help or treatment. The problem extends to their caregivers, close relatives including neighbours, as they are affected directly or indirectly by those who suffer from psychiatric morbidity within their close physical proximity.&nbsp;The stresses and pains of these caregivers and neighbours, especially those living in the heartlands and&nbsp;high-rise buildings, often go unrecognised and are, therefore, untreated or unmanaged. As a result, families have broken up and neighbours' disputes are on the increase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate referrals to psychological services, professional help and timely intervention are imperative to ensure those requiring help are identified and addressed.&nbsp;Would the Ministry consider enhancing and provide higher funding for current programmes? Would it be possible to rally institutions such as the HDB,&nbsp;NEA (in relation to noise pollution), Town Councils, grassroots organisations, professional medical help and counsellors to assist such vulnerable groups of people?&nbsp; If the general public, caregivers and community groups are sufficiently aware of households struggling with a member of the family, relative or neighbour who suffers from psychiatric problems, they could be advised on constructive ways to manage the person&rsquo;s condition in a constructive manner and be linked to support services at the same time.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3776</p>\r\n\r\nMadam, given that there is an increasing trend, we should act quickly.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Mental health providers</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> Children and adults with special needs deserve better protection.

Madam, it is natural for parents to be very anxious and concerned when their young are not developing normally.&nbsp; Their fears, most times, are&nbsp;unfounded, hopefully, but sometimes&nbsp;they become a reality.&nbsp; One example, a mother whose child, now 22 months old, was later&nbsp;diagnosed with a Global Developmentally Delayed (GDD)&nbsp;syndrome.&nbsp; When she first brought her son for medical attention, the paediatrician, after examination, reassured her then that her son's condition is temporary and the child will soon outgrow the system.&nbsp; However, as the days went by, her instincts and suspicions became stronger since, as a reference point, she based her son's behaviour <I>vis-a-vis</I> the older brother &ndash; a typical child.&nbsp; Remember \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3777</p>\r\n\r\nthe saying \"parents are the children's first teachers\".&nbsp; After seeking proper assessment and diagnosis by the psychologist, her fears were confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point number one: may I suggest to the Minister that medical personnel in contact with parents should pay careful attention to what the clientele are saying.&nbsp; Though they may be laypersons, the&nbsp;service&nbsp;should be friendly-centric as far as possible.&nbsp; I think this is more of an enforcement issue rather than policy as I see it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point number two: to help parents make informed decisions, frontline medical personnel should be more aware of the different types of services available so as to provide timely, appropriate advice to parents.&nbsp; Otherwise, they have to do their own homework, going around asking for information or going to the Internet to search, especially now with the current situation of intake of more foreign doctors in our healthcare service system.&nbsp; In this way, we are, first, enabling our parents; and, two, empowering them to be their own advocate for their children's well-being at the end of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, however, may I place on record the good work and progress of our national healthcare system in addressing the numerous issues and challenges as it strives to make Singapore a hub of excellence for a&nbsp;world-class healthcare system.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There is now even greater awareness of the usefulness of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its unabated use is evident in Singapore.&nbsp; With more robust legislation and greater professionalism of TCM practitioners, I am glad to see TCM clinics across our \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3778</p>\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals and polyclinics such as in Yishun.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am asking the Minister if he would consider extending TCM clinics across all polyclinics.&nbsp; Many heartlanders, no longer just the elderly but younger people including non-Chinese, are embracing TCM and related services and acupuncture for their ailments.&nbsp; TCM services can be housed within our polyclinics so that strict codes of practice are adhered to, thus ensuring that there is quality service.&nbsp;It could also lower the costs for needy people in addition to providing accessibility.&nbsp; By the same token, perhaps selective use of Medisave monies for chronic illnesses management, such as rheumatism and arthritis, can also be extended to TCM.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Singapore is the only country other than China that legislates the registration of TCM practitioners. With the registration, there has been a significant improvement of professional standard and image of TCM practitioners. As a result, as my colleague Ms Ellen Lee mentioned, TCM has&nbsp;increased its popularity, with more and more Singaporeans seeking TCM treatment.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Ministry of Health have plans to further raise the standard of TCM practitioners and the quality of TCM practice in Singapore in the future?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there plans to encourage our local universities and institutions to do more in terms of research and development of TCM?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, some TCM practitioners told me that due to the restrictions of the current legislations, TCM organisations could no longer offer Degree courses in TCM with overseas, mainly mainland \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3831-3832.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3779</p>\r\n\r\nChinese TCM universities. If this is the case, would there not&nbsp;be negative impact on our efforts to raise the standard of TCM practitioners in Singapore, as some TCM practitioners who intend to upgrade their professional standards will not be able to obtain a Bachelor Degree locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of concern amongst the TCM circle in Singapore is whether the Government has any plans, at some point of time, to recognise the medical certificates issued by TCM practitioners, or to allow medical benefit claims to be extended to TCM treatment. As my colleague Ms Ellen Lee pointed out, are we going to recognise the medical care provided by TCM practitioners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, the Government's stand is that it depends on the policy of the respective employer. As the public sector is a major employer in Singapore, may I ask whether the public sector as an employer is willing to recognise the medical certificates issued by TCM practitioners and allow medical benefit claims for TCM treatment? If not now, then how about some time in the future when professional standards of TCM further improve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Madam, we launched the National Mental Health Blueprint in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister&nbsp;for Finance&nbsp;gave us very strong support, with $178 million invested so far. &nbsp;The key thrust is to strengthen and develop mental health services in the community. &nbsp;The two key words are: de-institutionalisation and de-stigmatisation.&nbsp; We are half way through the implementation, but some impact is already being felt on the ground.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;I met a group of psychiatrists. I asked them point blank&nbsp;how do they compare, how do they rate the current state of mental health as compared with, say,&nbsp;five years ago.&nbsp; They told me that the progress was significant as a result of the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3780</p>\r\n\r\nBlueprint but they added that we still have much to do. &nbsp;The situation, as described by Ms Ellen Lee and the others,&nbsp;confirms the psychiatrists' assessment that the cup is half-full. We will press on to top up the cup.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua, Ms Ellen Lee, Mr Sin Boon Ann asked for more help, more services, more&nbsp;support for this programme and for the patients, and I agree with them. We will do more, we are doing more, a lot more will continue to happen&nbsp;over the next few years.&nbsp; The key is&nbsp;we need to detect patients early so that there is timely intervention. &nbsp;But to do so, we&nbsp;need to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness so that the patients can be confident to come forward to be treated and, after receiving treatment, to integrate back into the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Blueprint, we have set up a series of multi-disciplinary community mental health teams to bring about early detection and to initiate treatment. &nbsp;They are organised under&nbsp;four different programmes, separately targeting children, youths, adults and the elderly. &nbsp;Each programme caters to a specific age group. &nbsp;The programmes are at different stages of implementation. &nbsp;By that I mean we have tried it out in small areas of Singapore and now, in the final stage,&nbsp;we want to bring it up nationwide. But the initial results are promising, improving quality of life for the patients and their families&nbsp;and, importantly,&nbsp;reduce their re-admissions to hospitals &ndash; usually IMH. We are scaling up the programmes nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We certainly need to involve the community much more intimately.&nbsp; First, we are building up a community network to support the patients through neighbourhood social services, general practitioners (GPs), polyclinics and other care centres.&nbsp; Today, we have a GP Partnership network where stable patients are put on a shared-care programme with GP partners managing and providing \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3781</p>\r\n\r\nfollow-up in the community. &nbsp;This way, patients do not have to go back to IMH and it&nbsp;is also&nbsp;much more convenient for them. There are nearly 50 GPs and more than 600 patients on the programme. We are also putting multi-disciplinary mental health intervention teams in the community. &nbsp;They will support the GPs to manage simpler cases as well as provide basic psychotherapy, counselling or case management. This is an area where we will always be short of physiatrists and the more we can train up and make use of&nbsp;allied health professionals to support the doctors the better it will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we are strengthening the capabilities amongst the community organisations and social service providers to better manage the patients in the community. &nbsp;Training&nbsp;is being rolled out to equip staff with the right skill sets. &nbsp;So far, we have trained over 2,000 grassroots leaders and frontline staff in eldercare agencies. &nbsp;We have also put in place community support mechanisms such as helplines to link up patients with the appropriate services or resources they need.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua&nbsp;talked about the hotline in IMH currently serving essentially their discharged patients. The intent, certainly,&nbsp;is for such a&nbsp;national helpline to look after all patients, not necessary just ex-IMH patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will help our patients pick up skills needed to return to the workforce so that they can achieve independence in the community. &nbsp;This is key.&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid relapse, the better we are able to get them properly reintegrated back, the best chances of recovery for those patients.&nbsp; But to do so, I need the support of&nbsp; many more enlightened employers to provide job opportunities for these ex-patients.&nbsp; The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has a \"Job Club\" which helps to support patients' reintegration to the workforce. Since its launch in 2009 &ndash;&nbsp;so that is less than two years &ndash; more than 550 patients have been successfully placed within the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3782</p>\r\n\r\nJob Club scheme.&nbsp; We certainly need&nbsp;more employers to come forward to help us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For us,&nbsp;we will continue to provide&nbsp;the service providers with adequate funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Tote Board Community Healthcare Fund has pumped in an additional $15 million for us to push this programme. &nbsp;It is&nbsp;a very&nbsp;important boost to our efforts and I will always try my best to seek more funds to support this cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;My sense is this: that actually&nbsp;money is not the real bottleneck, but enlightened people, whether it is&nbsp;employers or&nbsp;family members or neighbours who are prepared to keep their minds open and to accept that this somebody &ndash; fellow Singaporeans, fellow human beings &ndash; let us give them a hand. If IMH decided that they can be&nbsp;returned to the community, it&nbsp;is safe. There is&nbsp;a wide spectrum of mental illness, not everyone and it is only a small number who may cause danger to themselves or to others, and&nbsp;those&nbsp;patients are all in IMH.&nbsp; Those that we released back to the community, they have stabilised.&nbsp; The key is we support them and, from the doctors' side,&nbsp;make sure&nbsp;that&nbsp;they take their medications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Laurence Wee and Mr Chiam See Tong spoke&nbsp;up about&nbsp;a different subject of helping the parents of children with special needs. &nbsp;Children with development difficulties are prone to displaying difficult behaviour; aggression, disobedience or even engaging in dangerous activities, and&nbsp;it is a major, major source of stress for the parents and can even impact their mental health. &nbsp;All these can take a toll on family relationships and, often, parents are just&nbsp;at a loss&nbsp;of what to do.&nbsp; KKH and NUH have been conducting Parents' Forums&nbsp;for a long time for such parents.&nbsp; More recently, we have a new initiative which we are very proud of &ndash;&nbsp;KKH&nbsp;is partnering an Australian Parenting Research Centre to launch a training programme to equip parents to understand their child's difficult behaviour \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3783</p>\r\n\r\nand&nbsp;develop their own ways&nbsp;to manage them effectively and prevent the further development of behavioural concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a parenting support course, delivered through a network of qualified facilitators.&nbsp; The original programme in the state of&nbsp; Victoria, Australia, has been around for several years and has been very successful. We are&nbsp;bringing to Singapore, adapting it to local conditions. We hope we can achieve the same results as it did in Victoria.&nbsp; Here again, money was not an issue. We get the support of Temasek Care which is a foundation of Temasek Holdings.&nbsp; They pumped in money so that the course is heavily subsidised and parents will find the fees affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee and Mr Chan Soo Sen spoke on TCM. As pointed out by Mr Chan, we have now 10 years of TCM regulation and we have made some progress in raising the standard of practice and training. Of course, there is scope to do much more.&nbsp; To me, the key question is this.&nbsp; Going forward, do we simply just copy what China is doing and then adapt it here?&nbsp; Or do we try to forge a niche role for ourselves in Singapore, given our different history and greater exposure to western medicine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe either approaches are sensible. The second approach is, of course, much more challenging but it also opens up new opportunities. Let me give some illustrations. For example, for western drugs, it is standard practice to report adverse events. Some patients may take the drugs and had some problems, and adverse events have to be reported to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) routinely so that we collect those information, get&nbsp;them analysed and we can give proper advisory to the consuming public.&nbsp; But this is not done for Chinese herbs.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3784</p>\r\n\r\nLikewise, there could be adverse events as a result of taking Chinese herbs and western drugs. Are there adverse events as a result of the interaction between the two?&nbsp; If so, I think somebody, somewhere, need to know. There are really no such good resource centres, not even in China.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been discussing with HSA because of their expertise in western drugs&nbsp;and I have also discussed with the leadership of TCM recently. Can we not do something like this? We can develop a resource centre. It will not only be good for Singapore but it may become a very good resource centre for the region, or even for China.&nbsp; I think that is a possible niche role for us in TCM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, some of our&nbsp;western-trained doctors are very interested in TCM and I know they have started doing joint studies and clinical trials with TCM physicians.&nbsp; I know of a small group in SGH which has been doing similar studies for several months now, looking at diabetes because the Chinese have their own way of treating diabetes too. Of course, there are western ways of treating diabetes.&nbsp; We want to see, through such joint efforts,&nbsp;if TCM improves the effectiveness or outcomes.&nbsp; If we can subject those TCM practices to scientific scrutiny and then publish them in western medical journals, that would&nbsp; be of benefit to the world. Perhaps, this could be another niche area for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next few years, I certainly hope the TCM leadership can think through these questions, and there could be other&nbsp;possibilities to&nbsp;help us determine the way going forward.&nbsp; If the TCM legislation needs to be amended to facilitate the next stage of TCM development, I would be happy to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must acknowledge the vast difference between TCM and western medicine, both in philosophy and in approach.&nbsp; They are two different things,\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3785</p>\r\n\r\nalmost like two different religions. The different regulatory regimes reflect these differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;The global healthcare system is based on western medicine.&nbsp; TCM is considered as a complementary medicine, regulated to different benchmarks.&nbsp; A TCM physician is not regulated to the same extent as a western-trained doctor.&nbsp; A Chinese herb is not regulated to the same degree as a western drug.&nbsp; That is the reason why Medisave does not cover TCM and that is also the reason why many employers do not accept medical certificates (MCs) issued by TCM physicians.&nbsp; Whether this will change in the future will depend on how TCM intends to reform its practice and approach.&nbsp; In fact, it is also not obvious if TCM needs to or even if it wishes to, can reform and emulate the western medicine approach.&nbsp; China, for&nbsp;many years,&nbsp;has tried to integrate TCM and western medicine and&nbsp;has not found it easy.&nbsp; One professor in Nanjing TCM University, when I visited them,&nbsp;told me they tried and the result was <I>liang bai ju shang</I> (&#20004;&#36133;&#20465;&#20260;), that&nbsp;means both sides suffered when they tried to integrate east and west.&nbsp; <I>Zuo bu lai</I> ( &#20570;&#19981;&#26469;), that is, they cannot do it.&nbsp; If you look at the outcome, there are many times more western-trained doctors in China than TCM-trained physicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, we will continue to raise their level of professional standards within the traditional TCM framework.&nbsp; TCM practitioners wishing to upgrade themselves with a degree have several options.&nbsp; The two local TCM colleges have partnered PRC TCM universities.&nbsp; Their Diploma graduates can go on to acquire a recognised PRC degree.&nbsp; The NTU also runs a double degree programme in Biomedical Science and Chinese Medicine course.&nbsp; I heard Mr Chan Soo Sen's comments just now.&nbsp; He might be mistaken.&nbsp; It is not as if the Diploma graduates of the local TCM school cannot continue to&nbsp;train and get a China university TCM.&nbsp; They can.&nbsp; It is no \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3786</p>\r\n\r\ndifferent than&nbsp;say a nurse in Nanyang Polytechnic and with a twinning degree programme that we are now trying to set up through MOE, will finally get a degree from, say,&nbsp;the University of Manchester, or whatever.&nbsp; Likewise, it is the same thing here. What MOE does is to regulate&nbsp;which&nbsp;institution in Singapore can issue a Singapore Degree but for Diploma, that is a different story. They do facilitate the Diploma graduates from continuing on to get a foreign degree. That approach will continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ellen Lee noted the setting up of TCM clinics in many hospitals and asked if we should allow them to be set up in polyclinics.&nbsp; There are more than 1,000 TCM clinics in Singapore, mostly in HDB towns.&nbsp; I believe access to TCM clinics is not a major issue.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef, Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan and Mr Ong Ah Heng have all given useful suggestions on how to make our healthcare system more wellness centric and pro-health. Indeed, this shift to prevention has been one of the biggest health trends in the past decade. People are more empowered than ever before to take personal ownership over their health. Information on how to eat and live healthily is readily available. Just whip out a smart phone, or log onto the Internet and you will find \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3792</p>\r\n\r\ndozens of applications to help you count your calories, track your exercise regime and even help you quit smoking.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare systems around the world are responding to these challenges.&nbsp; In Singapore, we are too.&nbsp; In Minister Khaw's speech, he has outlined wellness as one of the main priorities of MOH over the next few years.&nbsp; What this means is that our healthcare system should not only focus on taking care of the 10% of Singaporeans who fall sick but also ensuring that the 90% of Singaporeans who are well can continue to stay healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a significant shift.&nbsp; It will require fundamental changes in the way our healthcare institutions work.&nbsp; It will involve community partners coming together to champion health.&nbsp; Make no mistake about it.&nbsp; It will be a very difficult and uphill journey, but we should strive to succeed because if we do, it will mean that people will lead longer, fuller and healthier lives.&nbsp; In the final analysis, this is really what the Ministry of Health should aim to achieve for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why I was quite intrigued to learn about \"blue zones\". Blue zones are communities of people tucked away in different parts of the world who are living out the mantra&nbsp;\"live long, live well\".&nbsp; People there commonly lead active lives past the age of 100 years, with high levels of well being.&nbsp; One of the \"blue zones\" is Okinawa in Japan, which Dr Lily Neo has spoken about, and which Minister Khaw has visited.&nbsp; Another \"blue zone\" is Sardinia in Italy, which has one of the highest rates of centenarians in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers have gone to study these \"blue zones\" and have come back with a list of common lifestyle characteristics from these areas. If you allow me to paraphrase, they include simple things like: keep moving, eat till you are 80% \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3793</p>\r\n\r\nfull, put more vegetables in your diet, manage stress, surround yourself with supportive friends and belong in your community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these \"secrets\" sound familiar to all of us, they are in fact quite similar to some of the simple prevention messages that the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been advocating:&nbsp;stay active, eat wisely and strive for positive mental well-being.&nbsp; However, the difference is that the people in the \"blue zones\" have made it a way of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we know this is the hardest part. Many of us eat out and work late.&nbsp; I think some Members&nbsp;have alluded to this that we are working longer and we want to put more years into our working life.&nbsp; By the time we get home from work, we are too tired to exercise.&nbsp; This has led to more sedentary lifestyle and rising obesity as Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Sin Boon Ann have pointed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was why we launched the National Healthy Lifestyle campaign in 1992.&nbsp; We introduced programmes to help Singaporeans make prevention a way of life.&nbsp; We are reaching the 20th year anniversary of the campaign now, and it is timely to do a stock take. The campaign has led to a greater awareness of healthy lifestyle among Singaporeans, but as&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef has said, we need to do more to encourage proactive health promotion. The prevalence of obesity has increased to double digits, that is, 11% last year.&nbsp; If we do not do anything to arrest the increase, we will soon be plagued with an obesity epidemic and the associated chronic conditions, which would be a huge drain on our healthcare system, let alone at the personal, family&nbsp;level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach towards promoting healthy lifestyles amongst Singaporeans has been largely top-down thus far. To successfully move towards a wellness \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3794</p>\r\n\r\ncentric healthcare system, we will need a more ground-up approach as articulated by Minister Khaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what they do in the \"blue zones\":&nbsp;rely on social capital to live long and live well. They surround themselves with supportive friends and community.&nbsp; In Okinawa, they have what they call \"<I>moais</I>\" &ndash;&nbsp;groups of five friends committed to each other for life. Many of these social circles support healthy behaviour which can be equally, if not more, \"contagious\" than obesity and smoking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing about the \"blue zones\" is that communities work out what makes best sense to them.&nbsp; The communities have different diets, different ways of managing stress.&nbsp; The Sardinians, for example, manage stress by gathering in the streets to laugh with each other.&nbsp; The Okinawans like to do gardening. They recognise that different things work for different people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a similar way, we need to find out&nbsp;what works for us.&nbsp; Members have raised some suggestions.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef has urged more health promotion programmes to increase awareness of health risks associated with certain personal behaviour.&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked if more can be done to engage our well developed and well connected grassroots organisations and networks to nudge us toward better health behaviour.&nbsp; I agree with these suggestions.&nbsp; We should find ways to better empower the individuals to take ownership of health, and leverage on the power of social capital in our communities, or what we call our \"<I>kampung spirit</I> \".&nbsp; We need to inspire Singaporeans to health.&nbsp; From there a movement will emerge with a natural momentum.&nbsp; We are hopeful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign will be remade to support this. &nbsp;Together, we will build a new health \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3795</p>\r\n\r\npromotion model, with a ground-up approach supported by all Singaporeans. In reply to Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Sin Boon Ann, we will also make obesity the focus of the campaign.&nbsp; MOH and HPB will work with&nbsp;grassroots leaders to co-create a model of health that works for each community and which targets obesity.&nbsp; We will provide the expertise, tools and training to develop a team of Health Champions in each constituency, who will then act as agents of change to champion healthy living.&nbsp; The analogy I would use is that we are handing Singaporeans the keys to health and together, we will open the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know of one of these Health Champions, Mohamad Hashim Mohamad Shah, the Chairman of Marsiling Malay Activity Executive Committee, who has started his own journey. Before becoming a Health Champion, he weighed 91 kg.&nbsp; However, after a year of exercising and adopting a healthier diet, he now weighs 83 kg!&nbsp; Seeing the benefits of his efforts, together with seven other Health Champions in the constituency, they have formed a health interest group with about 80 residents in Marsiling.&nbsp; Having learned about elements of chronic illnesses and how to be effective health advocates from the HPB, they each reach out to 10 residents.&nbsp; That is why they are called \"<I>Ketua Sepuluh</I> \"&nbsp; (Leaders of 10) because each one of them&nbsp;reached out to a group of 10 residents.&nbsp; The health interest group meets every month to share tips on healthy cooking and weight management.&nbsp; Many of them go for brisk walks every weekend, while others&nbsp;take up aerobics, cycling or swimming.&nbsp; Some ladies who did not learn swimming at an earlier age are now learning to swim which is encouraging.&nbsp; The Champions are not stopping there.&nbsp; They intend to grow the interest group to 200 people. In fact, there is also a pipeline of residents being trained to become Health Champions.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3796</p>\r\n\r\nHPB provides the expert guidance and North West Community Development Council helps to coordinate the Health Champions Network in Sembawang GRC and Nee Soon Central and Nee Soon East SMC.&nbsp; I applaud the Health Champions for the efforts to start their own \"blue zones\" and hope others can also share their enthusiasm and keep the momentum going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Health Champions, we move to activities.&nbsp; Activities tailored to the needs of the local community will be developed, and include Healthy Cooking Demonstrations and physical activity programmes like community aerobics and <I>qigong</I>.&nbsp; Non-traditional stakeholders will also be roped in.&nbsp; For example, childcare centres and schools will be engaged to roll out programmes like \"Walk-to-school with Kids\". Shopping malls will also be encouraged to implement health promoting initiatives for shoppers.&nbsp; One of these initiatives is \"Mall Walks\" where Singaporeans can do brisk walking and other exercises in a safe and weather-proof setting.&nbsp;Well, we did that when we launched the last National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign led by Senior Minister Goh and we thought that walking together in a shopping mall was quite fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prototype of this new \"ground-up\" National Healthy Lifestyle model has already started in the Southwest CDC District.&nbsp; Here, the Health Promotion Board and National Environment Agency (NEA)&nbsp;are partnering with Yuhua Hawkers Association to engage hawkers on using healthier ingredients like whole-grain noodles, brown rice and healthier oil.&nbsp; Other prototypes in Northwest CDC and Sembawang GRC are in the works; they will develop their own unique arrangements.&nbsp; I believe when Nee Soon GRC is formed after the GE, they will also be included in the programme.&nbsp; Where best practices emerge, we will see if we can work for the rest of Singapore.&nbsp; We hope to gain a natural momentum that will lead\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3797</p>\r\n\r\nto other such initiatives being rolled out across the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about workplace health.&nbsp; This movement towards health has another important setting&nbsp;&ndash; the workplace.&nbsp; As Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef, Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Heng Chee How have pointed out, the workplace is an ideal place to promote wellness and good health practices, since working Singaporeans spend a significant portion of their time at the workplace.&nbsp; But it is not just about being pro-health, it is also about being pro-business and pro-worker.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;agree with Assoc. Prof. &nbsp;Fatimah Lateef&nbsp;and Mr Heng that workplace health is intricately tied to productivity.&nbsp; Better health means better effectiveness on the job, more alert employees, lower absenteeism and overall improvements in workforce morale and engagement. &nbsp;For employers who&nbsp;want to promote workplace health, it must make business sense, and it does.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many organisations have effectively created health-oriented work cultures.&nbsp; In the US, Kaiser Permanente, a leading healthcare group, eliminated trans-fats from its patient menus, employee cafeterias, and vending machines in 2008 to protect its patients and employees from the risk of coronary heart diseases.&nbsp; In Singapore, some of our hospitals have also made healthier foods cheaper.&nbsp; The Austrian Health Minister, whom Mr Khaw talked about earlier, recently visited the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and was impressed by how health promotion was built into the design and workings of the hospital.&nbsp; They were pleasantly surprised when fruit grown on the hospital&nbsp;ground was served to them as snacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For smaller employers&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a matter which Mr Ong Ah Heng spoke about&nbsp;&ndash; there are understandably more challenges, but it is not impossible. &nbsp;Some SMEs have\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3798</p>\r\n\r\nshown the way.&nbsp; Asia Polyurethane Manufacturing, for example, is a small outfit of just 29 employees.&nbsp; Yet, they have launched initiatives like health screening, aerobics classes and talks on nutrition for their employees.&nbsp; To their CEO Mr Erman Tan, the business case for workplace health is strong.&nbsp; It enhances employee morale and teamwork, and has a huge impact on productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs will be our focus over the next few years to spark this health movement.&nbsp; Collectively, they are Singapore&rsquo;s largest employers.&nbsp; In reply to&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah&nbsp;and Mr Heng on what our plans are to enhance health at the workplace, we will do three things to persuade business leaders.&nbsp; First, we will make it simple for SMEs to implement workplace health programmes.&nbsp; We will offer customisable off-the-shelf workplace health packages to SMEs.&nbsp; They will simply have to choose the package they want.&nbsp; This frees them from the administrative hassle of sourcing and coordinating health activities for their employees.&nbsp;Second, we will continue our funding support for SMEs through the Workplace Health Grant which offers 90% funding to implement programmes, up to a cap of $10,000 per application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Fatimah may be pleased to learn that since the scheme was extended to SMEs in 2009, 90 SMEs, including Asia Polyurethane Manufacturing, have benefited.&nbsp; For larger companies, a further 200 firms benefited each year from the Workplace Health Grant.&nbsp; Third, we will strengthen and form new partnerships with trade associations so that health activities can be offered to their member companies.&nbsp; The Singapore Manufacturers' Federation (SMa) is the first to partner HPB&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;100 of its member companies have pledged to implement comprehensive workplace health promotion for their employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Tripartite Committee (TriCom) on Workplace Health, which I\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3799</p>\r\n\r\nspoke about last year, has been key in driving these ideas.&nbsp; They have just reported their recommendations in November last year.&nbsp; Under the TriCom, Workplace Health Promotion elements have been integrated into national frameworks, like SPRING&rsquo;s Business Excellence Framework and the Guidelines for the Re-employment of Older Employees. &nbsp;HPB is now collaborating closely with&nbsp;the Ministry of Manpower&nbsp;to further tie Workplace Health with Workplace Safety, as Mr Heng Chee How suggested.&nbsp; MOH has set up a group to oversee and monitor the implementation of the TriCom&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move to children's health.&nbsp; Children and their parents are a key link in the health movement.&nbsp; We see many parents attending parenting seminars to find out from experts how to bring up their children to be healthy, confident individuals.&nbsp; Here, we have many opportunities to create healthy habits in the way our children eat and keep fit.&nbsp; We know that what we learn when young stays with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, we are approaching this from many angles.&nbsp; The National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign this year will focus on the family. Parents will find accessible resources right at the community level throughout Singapore, such as organised walks, classes and support groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools are also an important setting&nbsp;of influence. Jamie Oliver, the British celebrity&nbsp;chef, is leading the school food revolution in Britain.&nbsp; He said that \"eating a healthy school meal is a great foundation for a kid&rsquo;s education and future health.\"&nbsp; We share the same vision.&nbsp; HPB has thus worked hard to change children&rsquo;s eating habits and attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min spoke about school meals.&nbsp; In Singapore, HPB has partnered\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3800</p>\r\n\r\nwith schools to incorporate guidelines on healthy eating and to limit student&rsquo;s exposure to foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar&nbsp;&ndash; all those things that make food tastes nicer.&nbsp; We are encouraged by the efforts schools have undertaken to translate this vision into reality. &nbsp;About 90% of our schools have adhered to HPB&rsquo;s guidelines and achieved Healthy Eating Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HPB has also partnered infant and child care centres and pre-schools to provide supportive environments.&nbsp; Through the Healthy Eating in Child Care Centres Programme, centres are provided with guidelines on offering healthy food and drinks to children. This is now included as one of the items in the licensing of childcare centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the supply side, culinary training workshops have been introduced for tuckshop vendors to raise their awareness of nutritional guidelines and healthy meal preparations.&nbsp; We are also working with the food suppliers to modify and introduce healthier food items in school tuckshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may know now that schools are not allowed to sell certain types of aerated drinks, which are&nbsp;too gassy and too sweet, and they are not allowed to sell fried food more than once a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from diet, we know that exercise is also important. Research has shown that exercise helps children to be more attentive and think better.&nbsp; I am happy that MOE has reviewed its physical education curriculum and increased physical activity time across the various educational levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from targeting school-going children, there is evidence that suggests that conditions in the womb and during early childhood can influence health later in life, including risk of obesity and chronic diseases.&nbsp; This is why HPB has expanded its target audience to include parents-to-be as well as parents of young\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3801</p>\r\n\r\nchildren through the Healthy Origins and Firm Foundations programme. &nbsp;Here, HPB, in partnership with maternity and children&rsquo;s hospitals,&nbsp;is developing resource packages for new mothers-to-be to provide them with tips on how to maintain healthy pregnancies and raise healthy children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, we have spoken about changes that will be taking place across many physical sites in our communities.&nbsp; There is one development, however, that will place active health management right at the fingertips of Singaporeans, so that health promotion can be 24/7, anywhere and everywhere.&nbsp; Members already know about MOH&rsquo;s development of the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR).&nbsp; While most of the NEHR will transform the way that hospitals work, one part of that will directly impact you and I.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the development of a personal health management platform.&nbsp; While this will take a couple of years to develop, we have already taken steps towards better personal health management, like the HPB Diet Tracker iPhone app.&nbsp; What we can look forward to are mobile applications built upon the platform that will support healthy behaviour and personal responsibility for health.&nbsp; In fact, this is the way that many countries around the world are moving toward &ndash; telehealth and mobile apps for personal health management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting healthy is a process, a journey of small steps.&nbsp; And if we go back to the \"blue zones\", it is the simple things that make a difference &ndash; what we eat, whether we exercise, how much we sleep.&nbsp; We can all take small manageable steps in our everyday life.&nbsp; These small changes will lead to big improvements in our health.&nbsp; When these changes become a natural part of our routines, we would have formed our own personal blue zones.&nbsp; If we can expand this in the community, get volunteers and advocates amongst community leaders to sell the ideas to our\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3802</p>\r\n\r\nresidents, then we will be able to develop blue zones in our community.&nbsp; Let us journey together to live long and live well.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> Time for clarifications.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Madam, the size of the Sengkang General Hospital is one of the subjects that we are studying now.&nbsp; It is part of the planning.&nbsp; But Members can assume that it will be similar to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.&nbsp; It should have a capacity of 500-600 beds.&nbsp; It depends on the catchment population size.&nbsp; That is some of the data that we are looking at.&nbsp; But it will&nbsp;definitely be a full-fledged general hospital,&nbsp;meaning that it covers all the major disciplines.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of a regional general hospital concept is that in each region of sufficient population, the general hospitals plus its partners&nbsp;&ndash; community hospital, nursing home and so on&nbsp;&ndash; should be able to look after&nbsp;maybe 85% to 90% of the healthcare needs of the region.&nbsp; It is only \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3803</p>\r\n\r\nthe occasional&nbsp;patient with cancer or severe transplant requirements, who need to go to SGH or NUH.&nbsp; In this way, it brings convenience for the people but, of course, it does not mean that if you are a resident in Sengkang, you must go to Sengkang General Hospital.&nbsp; You are free to choose to go to Changi General Hospital or Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.&nbsp; That contestability must always be there, and that will bring about better service level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Seniors Mobility Fund: the key word is \"mobility\".&nbsp; We are quite prepared to define it widely and loosely.&nbsp; Anything that will help the seniors move around.&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at it from the outcome point of view.&nbsp; Right now, you are stuck and you need a wheelchair or you need a walking frame so that you can move around, and move out of your apartment.&nbsp; I think talking to our patients, one clear conclusion is always this for the elderly.&nbsp; The moment they lock themselves up in an apartment, almost certainly their health condition just goes downhill.&nbsp; It does not get better.&nbsp; Therefore, the more we are able to get them socially engaged, that is most crucial.&nbsp; That is why Minister Lim Boon Heng's Committee is so busy, working with all Members on the Wellness Programme in the community.&nbsp; Let us support him and his Committee&nbsp;&ndash; get our residents out of their apartments.&nbsp; But for some who have difficulty because they are not able to move about, this Fund of $10 million will come in handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach we are taking is not a macro bureaucratic way, whereby the Ministry of Health is the one who invites applications and then assess them.&nbsp; That is a wrong way of doing it.&nbsp; But we will give money to the local VWOs.&nbsp; Our job is to sniff around and see which are the good VWOs doing good work on the ground, helping these residents to move around, and then we will support them with the \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3804</p>\r\n\r\nmoney.&nbsp; It is not restricted to&nbsp;just devices.&nbsp; That is why I talked about services.&nbsp; It could be a transport service, if necessary, to bring&nbsp;the seniors to a day rehabilitation centre, which we know is a major gap on the ground currently.&nbsp; We will work through the VWOs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we should set up a technology centre of a higher caliber research type, then $10 million is not enough.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

She is also&nbsp;a&nbsp;recovered cancer patient.&nbsp; So, she has to go to three different places: Singapore General Hospital, the Cancer Centre as well as the polyclinic for the follow-up consultations.&nbsp;

The second issue is the mental patients again.&nbsp; Currently, in the community, we are really finding it very difficult to bring&nbsp;the patients to IMH to seek treatment and they are not known patients to IMH.&nbsp;

tele-radiology, tele-opthalmology, tele-stroke,&nbsp;because tele-medicine&nbsp;certainly has a great scope for further exploitation, and we will push along this line.&nbsp; But for the specific example that Mdm Cynthia Phua mentioned about tele-consultation, we do that to a certain degree.&nbsp; Tele-opthalmology belongs to that category, but you&nbsp;must have enough volumes,&nbsp;because it is not just&nbsp;a technology, you&nbsp;must&nbsp;have a specialist at the end of the line who is there to do the consultation, even though not in front of the patient.&nbsp; So, that has to be organised.&nbsp; For opthalmology, I think there are sufficient cases to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the specific example that she mentioned, I am not so sure whether&nbsp;there are enough cases.&nbsp; But, in terms of priorities, this is the priority which we will always push.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mentally-ill hotline, I do not know yet, but it is&nbsp;something that I am pushing.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

But if you look at the current day rehabilitation centres, they are really inadequate because&nbsp;they only provide social services and a little bit of therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The day rehabilitation centres need to be upgraded to cover other services, for instance, nursing,&nbsp;medical care,&nbsp;or even if you need a&nbsp;manager&nbsp;to manage and help the family when they move from the hospital to the home.&nbsp; It also provides some respite and relief to the caregiver so that the caregiver can put those who are ill at the day rehabilitation centre and go to work, and&nbsp;not depriving themselves of a source of income.&nbsp; We do not need this problem.&nbsp; We do not have this issue being raised many times in Parliament about the need for caregiver allowance.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;the&nbsp;Minister would consider that because the current centres are really inadequate.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The objective is really to upgrade long-term care.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy with current level of long-term care as provided by the VWOs all these years.&nbsp; I think we are grateful to them for delivering this level of service, but what we are hoping in the next decade is to raise it to a much higher level of capabilities, especially in rehabilitation.&nbsp; They would need money, they would need skills, they would need training and they would need resources.&nbsp; That is what this $1 billion injection of fund is meant to achieve, and we would do it in a way without displacing the VWOs.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said just now, if we come in a big way, and then get them out of business,&nbsp;push them out and become a public service,&nbsp;I think we would be poorer for it.&nbsp; The ideal situation is how we can combine funding both from the Government as well as from society, but, more importantly, professional skills&nbsp;of the Ministry of Health with the community VWOs' passion and compassion.&nbsp; If we can combine the two and fuse it well, I think we will get a world-class long-term care.&nbsp; This, I am optimistic and I am confident.&nbsp; We cannot achieve it in one year.&nbsp; I think we probably need a decade to achieve this transformation.&nbsp; But if we&nbsp;do it well, in five years we should be able to see&nbsp;significant difference.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First, it relates to the Standard Drug List (SDL).&nbsp; I think when the Minister first started his response to me, he suggested that I was making him rehash things which he had answered before in Parliament but really the crux&nbsp;of my cut is about transparency, and I do not believe that there was any Parliamentary Question (PQ) filed previously about transparency concerning the SDL.&nbsp; The first clarification for the Minister is this.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3809</p>\r\n\r\nThe lists which are readily available online, which I mentioned,&nbsp;include the WHO's essential drug lists which&nbsp;the Minister had previously mentioned that our SDL was based upon&nbsp;with local adaptation.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is published online and the Minister was saying that it is&nbsp;really not a secret.&nbsp; So, if the SDL is not a secret, then why not consider publishing it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point: the&nbsp;Minister mentioned that he did not see why it&nbsp;was necessary to publish it, but I would like his comments on these possible benefits which have been pointed out to me as well.&nbsp; First of all, private doctors have commented that they would find it useful to look at the lists because they could refer their&nbsp;private patients to get the subsidised drugs from polyclinics.&nbsp; Secondly, they will also be in a better position to price their own drugs.&nbsp; And, thirdly, for sick people or families with sick people, they would find publication of the lists useful in their own research about treatment options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third clarification from the Minister is concerning transparency of the decision-making process which I do not think the Minister really touched on.&nbsp; He has mentioned in the past about factors taken into account by the Drug Advisory Committee but exactly how they weigh the factors, and so on, is not very clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my speech, there have&nbsp;been pharmaco-economists&nbsp;who have said that our process appears to be a trade-off because it is a simplified evaluation.&nbsp; So, would it not be in the public interest to give more information in order to let the public have confidence in this assessment process?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last of all, just now, the Minister mentioned the 3Ms again.&nbsp; From what I know,&nbsp;from data in year 2000,&nbsp;the 3Ms only accounted for 10% of our total health expenditure.&nbsp; Recently, I filed a Parliamentary Question to ask whether the Minister could update on this but he\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3810</p>\r\n\r\nonly gave the inpatient coverage but not the general.&nbsp; So I wonder whether the Minister could update on how much the 3Ms cover the national health expenditure.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My colleagues know me well that in the Ministry of Health, I have a statement, which is \"there is&nbsp;no secret in the Ministry of Health\".&nbsp; There are only two secrets in the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; One is personnel records of staff; two is patients' records.&nbsp; That is privacy.&nbsp; Everything else is to be open because health policies&nbsp;ought to be argued on logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I formulate a particular policy, those are the assumptions and&nbsp;reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a better way of doing it, I would like to know too so that we can change the policy.&nbsp;

One of the reasons why we spend 4% and America 18% is this&nbsp;&ndash; we use lower cost alternatives, because they are equally effective.&nbsp; Why should we over-spend and spend additional money?&nbsp; But we will take a look&nbsp;and see if it is really so important to many people to put this list on the website. &nbsp;I personally have no problem at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3811</p>\r\n<p>6.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the contribution&nbsp;for the&nbsp;3Ms?&nbsp; I cannot recall the answer in 2000 that Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned.&nbsp; But the recent reply I gave about the 3Ms was because I wanted to give a meaningful answer.&nbsp; National health spending is&nbsp;a big basket of things.&nbsp; It perhaps includes&nbsp;buying and selling of herbs like ginseng, or cordyceps.&nbsp; All these, we all know, are personal expenditures.&nbsp; Over-the-counter drugs, like supplements, aesthetic treatments, and they too are in the national health spending.&nbsp; Whereas&nbsp;3Ms is very specific, largely for&nbsp;inpatient care in public hospitals.&nbsp; In fact, it is also for private hospitals, because we also open it to private hospitals, largely for inpatient care.&nbsp; In recent years, we have opened it up to some outpatient care, but it remains small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I have said that if we want to look at contribution, then we should compare apple&nbsp;with apple, ie, we should look at 3Ms spending versus total spending on inpatient care. Then it is a more meaningful figure. Whereas if we look at 3Ms spending versus total health spending, which includes aesthetic medicine, etc, and worse&nbsp;in the case of Singapore, because we have a significant medical tourism sector, even foreigners' spending also comes into our national health spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what meaning does it give?&nbsp; If I give&nbsp;her a figure, what does that mean to her?&nbsp; That is why I compute it to say, 3Ms versus inpatient care which includes public and private hospitals.&nbsp; And I thought the figure says a lot about our funding system in Singapore.&nbsp; If&nbsp;she reads the answer carefully, half of inpatient care was borne by Government. This is not just inpatient care in public hospitals but also inpatient care in private hospitals, which includes foreigners' spending, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all those things, it is half.&nbsp; So, if&nbsp;we look at public hospital inpatient \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3812</p>\r\n\r\ncare, the Government subsidy is much more than half.&nbsp; I do not know&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;maybe 70%, or 80%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;half of the remainder is 3Ms&nbsp;&ndash; Medisave, MediShield and insurance.&nbsp; And the rest is employers and out-of-pocket. When I gave that figure and I dived deeper into the breakdown, it gave me a lot of comfort. I think with many years of careful planning in our 3Ms healthcare financing sector, we have got a system which is not bad.&nbsp; Let us do not do silly things to destroy it.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</B> Could the Minister brief the House, if possible in Mandarin, on&nbsp;the differences between a nursing home and a home for the aged?&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Madam, since it is rather late in the day, let me continue in English.&nbsp; In layman's terms, the simplest is to look at the length of stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at nursing homes as a facility, not unlike a hospital.&nbsp; When&nbsp;a patient&nbsp;goes to a hospital,&nbsp;he expects to get well and then&nbsp;he goes home.&nbsp; Likewise, if&nbsp;a person&nbsp;goes to a nursing home, because&nbsp;he has some disability,&nbsp;he hopes to improve so that&nbsp;he can also go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;But because rehabilitation takes a longer time, it may take several weeks or, often, several months.&nbsp; Whereas an old folks' home is one where somebody may not be severely disabled, but because he has no home to go back to&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he has been forsaken, and therefore&nbsp;he is in&nbsp;a sheltered home. That is an old folks' home.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, over the years, our nursing homes are behaving almost like&nbsp;old folks' home, because the patients go there and hardly come out, except when they die.&nbsp; So I am putting this challenge to the nursing homes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;let us improve on our ability to rehabilitate the patients.&nbsp; If a patient goes in and, say, he&nbsp;is unable to do three activities of daily living (ADL), we hope,&nbsp;after a while, we can reduce it to two activities, and then reduce it to one, and then&nbsp;the patient can&nbsp;go home. That, I think, is success.&nbsp; In some\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3813</p>\r\n\r\ncountries, they have been able to do it.&nbsp; But to do that,&nbsp;we need many more physiotherapists, occupational therapists, rehabilitation specialists, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need money which we will inject.&nbsp; Again, coming back to the $1 billion Community Trust Fund, that is what I want to tap on, to work together so that we can upgrade the nursing homes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But because of this historical baggage of nursing homes, which are&nbsp;almost like sheltered old folks' homes, Senior Minister Goh has a suggestion for me.&nbsp; He says, \"you have&nbsp;to re-brand it&nbsp;&ndash; stop calling it a nursing home.\" For this new generation of &nbsp;nursing homes that I hope to create, he said, we&nbsp;should call&nbsp;it \"convalescent homes\".&nbsp;&nbsp;A patient goes there for convalescence with a view of going home.&nbsp; In fact, the Chinese translation of nursing home is quite a good one,&nbsp; <I>liao yang yuan&nbsp;</I>(&#30103;&#20859;&#38498;) (nursing home), and that is different from&nbsp;<I>lao ren yuan</I> (&#32769;&#20154;&#38498; )&nbsp;(old folks' home).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110304/20110304VS_115122.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.] When you go to an old folks' home, you go there because you have no home and no children who look after you.&nbsp; So it becomes a home for old folks.

I see this whole journey as trying to improve quantity, that means scale it up;&nbsp;quality, that means, for example, the nursing home's rehabilitative activities must be able to be scaled up,&nbsp;ie, upskilled, and also have diversity.&nbsp; Because, in terms of different kinds of services, the needs may vary,&nbsp;different families have different needs and different patients may have different needs.&nbsp; So all those efforts will be what we are embarking upon over the next few years.&nbsp; We definitely&nbsp;would have \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3837-3838.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 3815</p>\r\n\r\nto pump in more money and resources into all these.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But back to the Member's point about home hospice and home care,&nbsp;the VWO home&nbsp;hospices are all funded by the Ministry of Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;While they raise donations and get supported by the public,&nbsp;they also receive subventions from the Ministry of Health. But as we scale up, of course,&nbsp;more subventions will have to flow down&nbsp;by the sheer increase in clientele and services that they are providing. But I took comfort&nbsp;that when I last looked at cancer patients&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;because cancer is more predictable, in the sense that&nbsp;we know there is a prognosis, and if&nbsp;the patient is&nbsp;at&nbsp;an advanced stage, the doctor cannot be precise about how many weeks or months but, at least, if it is end stage, they can plan for their end of life&nbsp;&ndash; the majority are able to die at home supported by us, whether it is HNF, hospice movement, home care or&nbsp;whatever.&nbsp; And we will see many more such cases, going forward.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Dr Lam, having listened to the responses, would you like to withdraw&nbsp; your amendment?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Madam, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the comprehensive and engaging debate in this House.
