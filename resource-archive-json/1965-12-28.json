The  Government  has\r\n\r\nspent  $40 million to look after the health and  medical\r\n\r\nservices for the people. Clinics have been built to look\r\n\r\nafter the people's health. In spite of the smallness  of\r\n\r\nour country, our health services can be said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nto  be  on par with the standard obtainable in any other\r\n\r\ncountry.  For  this, I have to thank  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth and our Government for their able leadership. But\r\n\r\nthere  is nothing perfect in all respects. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nhave   to   comment  somewhat  on  the   drawbacks   and\r\n\r\nshortcomings of the General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Hospital has been set up for quite a long\r\n\r\ntime.  It has an important place in Singapore's  medical\r\n\r\nhistory.  It has set up an exemplary record  in  medical\r\n\r\nservice.   Nevertheless,   I   have   received   several\r\n\r\ncomplaints from members of the public about the  General\r\n\r\nHospital.  Firstly, I would like to give an example.  In\r\n\r\nmy  constituency, there is a spinster 60 years  old  who\r\n\r\ncannot  see beyond several yards. She went for treatment\r\n\r\nat  the  General Hospital. But the officer-in-charge  of\r\n\r\nthe  Eye Clinic there did not treat her eye disease  and\r\n\r\ndid  not  give  any  reasons.  So  this  lady  was  very\r\n\r\nfrustrated and came to see me. I sent her with a  letter\r\n\r\nto  see  the  Medical Officer-in-charge on  the  6th  of\r\n\r\nDecember.  He  recorded her particulars,  including  her\r\n\r\nname and address, and asked her to go back, telling  her\r\n\r\nthat  she  would be called when necessary. As far  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  the lady, after three weeks, has  not  been\r\n\r\ncalled  back  for any attention. Sir, I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  to see whether  there  is  such  an\r\n\r\nincident,  and I would like to know what is  the  reason\r\n\r\nfor this happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in respect of doctors and nurses, they do\r\n\r\nnot  promptly  deal with emergency cases. Of  course,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  there are lots of sick people going  to  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital to seek treatment, and I understand the\r\n\r\ndoctors  and nurses are overworked. But in emergency  or\r\n\r\nacute  cases, doctors and nurses seem not to have  acted\r\n\r\npromptly   in  dealing  with  them.  Sometimes  patients\r\n\r\nsuffering from appendicitis have had to wait for two  or\r\n\r\nthree  hours,  and this delay might have been  fatal  to\r\n\r\nthem.  So  I  urge the hospital authorities to  be  more\r\n\r\nconcerned  with these emergency cases and  act  promptly\r\n\r\nwhen they arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, concerning the attitude of some nurses in the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nMany  members  of  the public have complained  that  the\r\n\r\nnurses have not been courteous enough when dealing  with\r\n\r\npatients.  Sometimes they have been contemptuous.  So  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  authorities concerned  will  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  I hope such incidents have been very rare,  and\r\n\r\nthat there will not be any more of these to destroy  the\r\n\r\ngood  reputation of our medical institutions. The  staff\r\n\r\nshould  be  taught courtesy and to be kind  and  \r\n\r\ntender-hearted especially when dealing with patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I understand the Ministry of Health has\r\n\r\nbeen  conducting  a  nurse-training course.  Apart  from\r\n\r\ngiving  nurses  medical training, they  should  also  be\r\n\r\ngiven  courtesy training so that they may treat  members\r\n\r\nof the public well, especially the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I believe the Member for  Sembawang  has\r\n\r\nthree sets of complaints to make against the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth. I would like to take them in the order in  which\r\n\r\nthey have been presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first complaint, in one particular case, is that\r\n\r\nthere  was  a 60-year old woman who had an eye complaint\r\n\r\nand  who did not receive any attention when she went  to\r\n\r\nthe  Opthalmic  Department of the General Hospital;  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the complainant saw the Member for Sembawang about\r\n\r\nthis,  he  gave her a letter of introduction  which  was\r\n\r\nduly considered by the people in charge, taken note  of,\r\n\r\nand  she was asked to go back and she would be told when\r\n\r\nto  appear again at the hospital. But up till now - it is\r\n\r\nthree weeks since he wrote the letter of introduction - there\r\n\r\nhas been no news requesting her to turn up at  the\r\n\r\nhospital  for attention. I want to say that I myself  do\r\n\r\nget  similar requests for letters of introduction to see\r\n\r\nthis doctor or that surgeon and I have to tell them that\r\n\r\nalthough I personally may be the Minister for Health,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  a Doctor of Medicine and I am not in a position\r\n\r\nto  give any letters of introduction. So I think my good\r\n\r\nfriend  the Member for Sembawang has taken upon  himself\r\n\r\nquite a lot by issuing letters of introduction addressed\r\n\r\nto the doctors in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhospital.  The proper procedure would be to  advise  the\r\n\r\npatient,  or whoever is not feeling too well,  to  first\r\n\r\nsee  a  doctor,  who  would then be  in  a  position  to\r\n\r\ndiagnose the complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the condition of the patient, this\r\n\r\nparticular  doctor would then give a letter  -  what  is\r\n\r\nknown as a letter of referral; that is to say, a general\r\n\r\npractitioner refers a patient to a specialist, who would\r\n\r\nthen  attend  on him. So I hope in future instances,  my\r\n\r\nhon. friend  from Sembawang would do better  to  follow\r\n\r\nthis  line  of  routine  rather than  issue  letters  of\r\n\r\nintroduction  addressed  to  various  officials  of   my\r\n\r\nMinistry. However, if he will be good enough to  let  me\r\n\r\nknow  the  name of this particular patient, the  60-year\r\n\r\nold woman, I will try to assist him in this respect,  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that she gets some attention, but this  does\r\n\r\nnot go for all other cases in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second complaint is that many patients in the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  have  to  wait  a  long  time  before\r\n\r\nreceiving attention. I am afraid he is not so particular\r\n\r\nin  this  complaint  in  that he makes  a  very  general\r\n\r\nstatement. It is very difficult to try to follow it  up,\r\n\r\nand  I  would  prefer  if  he  could  give  me  specific\r\n\r\ninstances  of so-called delays encountered  by  patients\r\n\r\nbefore  they received attention. I must, however,  state\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  more than one and a half years ago,  since\r\n\r\nAugust  1964,  that  the Outpatient  Dispensary  of  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital was closed down. In its place, there is\r\n\r\na 24-hour Emergency Unit in the General Hospital to deal\r\n\r\nwith serious emergencies or with cases where people have\r\n\r\nbeen  involved in motor accidents. Ever since that time,\r\n\r\nI have been given to understand that all such cases have\r\n\r\nbeen promptly look after, and many of those who have had\r\n\r\noccasion to go to this emergency unit have indicated how\r\n\r\npleased they were that the reorganisation has now  given\r\n\r\nthem  more  efficient  and  quicker  service  than   was\r\n\r\navailable hitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the case of an emergency patient having to\r\n\r\nwait for a long time for a doctor to examine his case, I\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate it if the Member for  Sembawang  would\r\n\r\nindicate the patient concerned and the day on which this\r\n\r\nincident  happened,  so that I can then  follow  it  up,\r\n\r\nrather than making just a complaint that people have  to\r\n\r\nwait  for  a long time to see a doctor and just stopping\r\n\r\nthere.  I am afraid I am not in a position to follow  up\r\n\r\non a general complaint of that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third complaint about the attitude of some\r\n\r\nnurses - I am glad that he says some nurses but not  all\r\n\r\nnurses - who may appear to be somewhat ill-mannered  and\r\n\r\nshow  a lack of patience with some of those who are ill,\r\n\r\nI  think it is almost impossible to expect a hundred per\r\n\r\ncent of all nurses to be very well-mannered and full  of\r\n\r\npatience  all  the time. Here again I do  not  think  it\r\n\r\nwould  be fair to make just a general statement  without\r\n\r\ngiving specific instances of bad, ill-mannered treatment\r\n\r\nof  patients  in hospitals. It is almost  impossible  to\r\n\r\ndefend  against such a complaint. But in regard  to  the\r\n\r\nremarks  of  the Member that perhaps in  the  School  of\r\n\r\nNursing there should be established a courtesy course, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  is  a matter which the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein has already raised some time ago, namely,  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  we should institute a courtesy course  for  our\r\n\r\nnurses.  This is part and parcel of the general training\r\n\r\nof nurses, and I do not think it is necessary to have  a\r\n\r\nspecific courtesy course for nurses in general. They are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  treat  everyone  with  courtesy,  more  so\r\n\r\ntowards those who are ill and who would really need  not\r\n\r\nonly their attention but also normal courtesy which  one\r\n\r\ncitizen would extend to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have been able to answer all the three points\r\n\r\nraised by the hon.

Quite   a   number  of  our  girls   who   have\r\n\r\nqualifications  higher  than the minimum  necessary  for\r\n\r\nassistant nurses prefer to go for other jobs rather than\r\n\r\napply as assistant nurses. The reason is that they  have\r\n\r\nto  undergo  training for not less than two  years,  and\r\n\r\nthey have to pass an examination. Once they are accepted\r\n\r\ninto  the  medical service, they have  to  go  on  shift\r\n\r\nduties.  There are times when they have to be awake  the\r\n\r\nwhole  night  until morning. There are times  when  they\r\n\r\nhave to work while others have their day off on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  holidays.  However  that  may  be,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsufficient number of our girls who wish to work  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals in order to give assistance to members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  who  require medical attention, by  joining  the\r\n\r\nservice  as assistant nurses. The spirit of these  girls\r\n\r\nwho  do want to join as assistant nurses is dampened  by\r\n\r\nthe  existence  of  the  new government  system  -  this\r\n\r\napplies  to pupil assistant nurses - whereby  those  who\r\n\r\npassed  their examination after their training  have  to\r\n\r\nreapply in order to become assistant nurses and serve in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals. Those who are selected will continue  to\r\n\r\nserve as assistant nurses and those who are not selected\r\n\r\nwill  be victimised. They cannot work in private clinics\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have  qualifications  only  as  assistant\r\n\r\nnurses,  and  private  clinics do not  employ  assistant\r\n\r\nnurses.  I  do  not know whether there  are  nurses  and\r\n\r\nmidwives who, after having passed their examination, are\r\n\r\nrequired to reapply. If the conditions of employing  the\r\n\r\nnurses  and  midwives are the same as assistant  nurses,\r\n\r\nand  those  who  are not selected can  work  in  private\r\n\r\nclinics,  and so also the midwives can work  in  private\r\n\r\nclinics,  or  become  private certified  midwives,  then\r\n\r\ntheir  time  and  training would not have  been  wasted.\r\n\r\nThese  assistant nurses cannot work as private assistant\r\n\r\nnurses.  The only place where they can work  is  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital. Therefore, I hope the Minister concerned  will\r\n\r\nsee  to it that the system whereby assistant nurses have\r\n\r\nto  reapply  in  order that they  can  be  taken  on  as\r\n\r\nassistant  nurses  will be abolished. This  will  enable\r\n\r\nthose   who  have  passed  their  examination  to   work\r\n\r\nstraightaway as assistant nurses, because they have  had\r\n\r\ntraining  for  not less than two years.  Otherwise  they\r\n\r\nwill  merely be victims of circumstances, and  it  would\r\n\r\nnot be possible for them to earn their living by working\r\n\r\nelsewhere in a private capacity. Two years of their time\r\n\r\nwould  thus  have been wasted. I hope the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth will see to it that the assistant nurses who have\r\n\r\npassed  their examination will be accepted rightaway  to\r\n\r\nserve as assistant nurses in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan is raising the question of some\r\n\r\nassistant nurses who are now in the Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nHospital over their recruitment policy, which has shown\r\n\r\na slight change as compared with previous years. There\r\n\r\nis no question at all regarding the value of assistant\r\n\r\nnurses in our hospital service. When opening the School\r\n\r\nfor Assistant Nurses in Thomson Road Hospital some\r\n\r\nmonths back, I had occasion to pay tribute to the\r\n\r\nassistant nursing service which has become one of the\r\n\r\npillars of our hospital service in assisting staff\r\n\r\nnurses to run our hospitals. There is a shortage of\r\n\r\ntrained nurses as well as trained assistant nurses in\r\n\r\nour hospitals, and this will be so for quite some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, owing to the fact that a number of\r\n\r\napproved  posts  in the hospitals for  assistant  nurses\r\n\r\nwould  appear  to be a little less than  the  number  of\r\n\r\npupils in the School of Nursing, it was necessary in the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  this year (that is to say, in July),  for  a\r\n\r\ntripartite  discussion  to be held  between  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission, the Treasury, and the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth, to ensure that by next year, 1966-7, a situation\r\n\r\nwill not arise where there are less posts than there are\r\n\r\nnumbers  of trained assistant nurses who have graduated;\r\n\r\nin  other  words,  we will be having  trained  assistant\r\n\r\nnurses and not having posts for them. Therefore, it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided  that the few batches of assistant  nurses\r\n\r\nthat  will graduate this year will be informed  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  necessary for them to go through a  selection\r\n\r\nexercise  by the Public Service Commission. It  was  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to do so in the past because there were  more\r\n\r\napproved posts than there were trained assistant nurses.\r\n\r\nSo  it  was  actually  a  case  of  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission having waived the requirements of a selection\r\n\r\nexercise  after graduation. Hence, there  was  a  little\r\n\r\nunhappiness amongst assistant nurses in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTan Tock Seng Hospital, that there has been a change  in\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of service. So I would like to assure  those\r\n\r\nwho  have graduated this year from the School of Nursing\r\n\r\nas  assistant nurses, that there should be no difficulty\r\n\r\nin placing them on the permanent establishment, but this\r\n\r\nis  a precautionary measure being taken by the officials\r\n\r\nso  as  not  to  have  a  situation  whereby  they  find\r\n\r\nthemselves caught, as it were, with more trained  nurses\r\n\r\nthan there are established posts approved by Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to say that the question of nurses\r\n\r\nin  our  hospital service is a matter that is  receiving\r\n\r\nattention  by the Nursing Board. This is a  question  of\r\n\r\nreviewing  the whole position of staffing of  nurses  in\r\n\r\nour  hospitals.  A memorandum is already in  preparation\r\n\r\nand it will be studied by the Ministry during the course\r\n\r\nof  the  next  few months. It is hoped  that  when  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is  finally  considered, a situation  like  that\r\n\r\nwhich has recently taken place in Tan Tock Seng Hospital\r\n\r\nwill not have to take place at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

So far, we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to install T.V. sets  through  private\r\n\r\ndonations.

There are places available in our  leper\r\n\r\nsettlement  known  as Trafalgar Home.  In  fact,  unlike\r\n\r\nother  hospitals,  we are in the fortunate  position  of\r\n\r\nhaving  accommodation for more than a thousand  patients\r\n\r\nsuffering from leprosy, but at the moment there are less\r\n\r\nthan 600 patients receiving attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the number in Sungei Buloh is around 24.\r\n\r\nLeprosy  is  a condition which could take  a  number  of\r\n\r\nyears  to  cure,  so  that  many  of  the  patients  are\r\n\r\npractically permanently settled down there. It would  be\r\n\r\nquite   a  difficult  matter  to  bring  them  back   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  although we could handle  the  situation  if\r\n\r\nthey  were here.

The  mosquito   nuisance   is\r\n\r\nsomewhat correlated to a number of other factors besides\r\n\r\njust  dealing  with  mosquitoes by our  so-called  \r\n\r\nAnti-Malarial Department. If public cleansing is \r\n\r\ndefective - and  unfortunately it is to a great extent -  this  will\r\n\r\nbring about considerable piles of refuse not being taken\r\n\r\naway  and dealt with, and such refuse will block  drains\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, there will be stagnant water which will\r\n\r\nultimately bring about mosquito-breeding and  hence  the\r\n\r\nnumerous  hordes of mosquitoes which worry not only  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol  but also many  residents  on  this\r\n\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated that there will be licensing of\r\n\r\nthe 40,000 to 50,000 hawkers during the coming year, and\r\n\r\nthat  will  be the first step in the control of  hawkers\r\n\r\nwhich will, of course, affect the reorganisation of  the\r\n\r\npublic cleansing services. And when this is tackled,  it\r\n\r\nwill  somewhat reduce the mosquito nuisance, because  we\r\n\r\nwill  then be able to clear away stagnant pools of water\r\n\r\nnow collecting in numerous drains throughout the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to deal with the mosquito nuisance\r\n\r\nparticularly, as the tendency up to the present for  the\r\n\r\nlast  40  to  50 years has been to tackle  the  mosquito\r\n\r\nproblem  as an anti-malarial measure, which is  correct,\r\n\r\nbecause as far back as 50 years ago - 1910 to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexact  -  there used to be tens of thousands of malarial\r\n\r\ncases with over 2,000 deaths each year from malaria. And\r\n\r\nthen an Anti-Mosquito Ordinance was passed which brought\r\n\r\nabout  concerted  action against the anopheles  mosquito\r\n\r\nwhich  was  responsible for malaria. Over  a  period  of\r\n\r\nyears,  malaria became controlled in Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\ncases  of malaria began to drop considerably. But during\r\n\r\nthe Japanese occupation - the years 1941-1945 - the\r\n\r\nanti-malarial measures collapsed and again by 1945,  we  came\r\n\r\nback  to the 1910 situation where over 2,000 people died\r\n\r\nfrom  malaria. Steps were again taken to put  our  \r\n\r\nanti-malarial measures back to their original footing, and it\r\n\r\nwas  only  in  1952  that we went back  to  the  pre-war\r\n\r\ncontrol of malaria. So all this while, we have had  more\r\n\r\nor  less  been concentrating on anti-malarial  measures.\r\n\r\nThey have been fairly effective, but unfortunately, with\r\n\r\nthe  considerable urban development within the city area\r\n\r\nand  less  attention being paid to the  construction  of\r\n\r\nsubsoil  drainage and open drains for  the  carriage  of\r\n\r\ndrainage  water, we are beginning to have  the  mosquito\r\n\r\nnuisance because of the collection of stagnant pools  of\r\n\r\nwater.  And  I am afraid also that since May 1963  there\r\n\r\nhave been some difficulties with the workers in the \r\n\r\nAnti-Malarial Department who refuse to cut grass if they  are\r\n\r\noilers.  They insist on division of labour. For example,\r\n\r\nan anti-malarial oiler who distributes oil over surfaces\r\n\r\nof  water in the past used to cut grass every sixth day,\r\n\r\nbut  unfortunately they now say that they want something\r\n\r\nextra  for  cutting  grass,  and  there  has  been  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in agreeing to this request of  division  of\r\n\r\nlabour. So for the forthcoming year there will be a \r\n\r\nre-organisation  to put this matter right. Also  mosquitoes\r\n\r\nare  no  longer a nuisance when they just  bite  people,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  beginning to find that  the  so-called\r\n\r\nmosquito nuisance is no longer a nuisance. There  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  other  types  of  diseases  appearing,  like\r\n\r\nfilariasis, more commonly known as elephantiasis, caused\r\n\r\nby   mosquitoes   biting  individuals   and   there   is\r\n\r\nencephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhemorrhagic  fever (that is bleeding into the  skin  and\r\n\r\norgans)  - all caused as a result of mosquito bites.  We\r\n\r\nare getting something like a hundred cases per year.  So\r\n\r\nbecause  of  these new trends arising  out  of  mosquito\r\n\r\nbites, it has been decided to make malaria what is known\r\n\r\nas a notifiable disease, that is to say, if a person has\r\n\r\nmalaria, which is confirmed by taking a blood slide,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  obligatory of the doctor to notify the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health.  We shall be bringing out a new Bill  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  the Destruction of Mosquito Act so that we  will\r\n\r\nbe able to have the legislative authority to deal rather\r\n\r\nstrongly   with  people  who  are  breeding   mosquitoes\r\n\r\nprobably very innocently in their gardens by putting out\r\n\r\nshanghai   jars  for  collecting  rainwater  for   their\r\n\r\ngardens,  but at the same time for breeding  mosquitoes,\r\n\r\nand  they may all the time be complaining why there  are\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  in  their  houses when they  are  themselves\r\n\r\nhelping  mosquitoes to breed. There will also be created\r\n\r\na new Anti-Mosquito Control Unit. As I have said, in the\r\n\r\npast, the tendency has always been on anti-malarial work\r\n\r\n-  but  now  we shall call it the Anti-Mosquito  Control\r\n\r\nUnit  -  to cover anti-malaria and other diseases caused\r\n\r\nby   mosquitoes.  We  have  been  fairly  successful  in\r\n\r\ncontrolling the T.B. problems by establishing  an \r\n\r\nAnti-T.B.  Control Unit. So we intend very soon to  establish\r\n\r\nwhat  is known as the Anti-Mosquito Control Unit to  \r\n\r\nco-ordinate the activities of the Anti-Mosquito Department,\r\n\r\nand to cover the whole island. We hope that within a few\r\n\r\nyears  the so-called mosquito nuisance will be gradually\r\n\r\nreduced  and Singapore will be mosquito-free as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.  We  can say that Singapore has been  free  of\r\n\r\nmalaria  for a number of years, but we are really  right\r\n\r\nin  the heart of a very malarious region, which includes\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and our next-door neighbour, Malaysia.  Every\r\n\r\nyear we have a few hundred cases of malaria recorded  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but they are all cases that are imported  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  none  indigenous to Singapore,  although\r\n\r\nlast year at the Foo Yong Estate in Bukit Timah we had a\r\n\r\nlocal outbreak of malaria which resulted in 29 cases of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfirmed malaria, and this occurred in what is known as\r\n\r\na controlled area; that is to say, although we had taken\r\n\r\nanti-malarial  measures, yet there was a small  outbreak\r\n\r\nof  malaria.  Therefore,  all this  while,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a very vigilant attitude towards the  mosquito\r\n\r\nproblem.  We have been reasonably successful for  nearly\r\n\r\n50   years  in  the  control  of  malaria.  But  it   is\r\n\r\npreferable,  now  that there is such  a  large  mosquito\r\n\r\nnuisance  in Singapore, that we should take one  further\r\n\r\nstep in establishing a centralised unit to control it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the  Minister's assurance  that  urgent\r\n\r\nsteps will be taken to destroy such nuisances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Kampong Kembangan is not\r\n\r\nfree  from  it. It is a low-lying area and the  fly  and\r\n\r\nmosquito  nuisance  is  very  widespread.  However,  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has  given  an  assurance  to   improve   the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which concerns rubbish in\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan. In this constituency,  many  of  the\r\n\r\nroads  are  kampong roads and the labourers  dump  their\r\n\r\nrubbish  at one place where the rubbish bins are placed.\r\n\r\nBut the Public Health Division does not send its garbage\r\n\r\nlorries  to collect the rubbish on the ground  that  the\r\n\r\nroads are narrow. Therefore, the labourers are forced to\r\n\r\nburn the rubbish there, but when it rains, it cannot  be\r\n\r\nburnt.  Further rubbish is dumped there as the  days  go\r\n\r\nby. In those kampongs where the people rear poultry,  if\r\n\r\nthe  rubbish  is  not removed, the poultry  scatter  the\r\n\r\nrubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask the Minister to give consideration to provide\r\n\r\na  small  lorry or a jeep which can go over the  kampong\r\n\r\nroads  for the collection and disposal of rubbish  which\r\n\r\nhas been collected from house to house and dumped by the\r\n\r\nlabourers. I believe that, in this way, the drains  will\r\n\r\nbe  kept  in  a  better condition and that the  sanitary\r\n\r\ncondition of the surrounding area will not be neglected.\r\n\r\nI  hope consideration will be given by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth to providing a jeep for the collection of rubbish\r\n\r\nwhich is dumped there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  associate  myself with  the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol  and  the Member for Kampong Kembangan  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  complaint that I wish to lodge in this House. Sir,\r\n\r\nno  one  can  deny  that the health  facilities  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry are one of the best in South-East Asia, for  the\r\n\r\ncleanliness  of  roads  and so on.  Sir,  owing  to  the\r\n\r\nincrease in the population of our country, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  take this opportunity to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  the fact that not only in my constituency,\r\n\r\nbut  also in many other constituencies, there is a great\r\n\r\nneed for additional labourers to clean kampong roads, to\r\n\r\nremove  rubbish and to clean drains, etc. This not  only\r\n\r\napplies  to our main island, but also applies to pulaus,\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency. If we can recruit more of these labourers,\r\n\r\nI  think  we  can  look  after the  cleanliness  of  the\r\n\r\nkampongs much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point which the hon.

I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  Minister step up  the  anti-mosquito\r\n\r\nmeasures  so that the Ministry can concentrate  more  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  rather than in  town  areas,  because\r\n\r\nmosquitoes usually breed in rural areas where we get pig\r\n\r\nsties, poultry, pot-holes and ponds in the rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas.

Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  just  now  my colleagues  have  discussed  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of mosquitoes and rubbish. I also wish to  draw\r\n\r\nthe attention of the Ministry concerned to the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  administration of health facilities  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  is  far  from satisfactory. I wish  to  quote  an\r\n\r\nexample  in my constituency, Geylang Serai. The  rubbish\r\n\r\nin  rubbish  bins is not removed by the Health  Division\r\n\r\nfor  as  long as three days or four days, and  sometimes\r\n\r\nfor  even one week. This rubbish dumping and stench from\r\n\r\nthe  rubbish  will affect the health of members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  There  are places in congested areas  where  no\r\n\r\nrubbish  bins  are  provided, and this  results  in  the\r\n\r\nresidents throwing rubbish indiscriminately. I have  had\r\n\r\noccasion  to inform the health officers in Katong  about\r\n\r\nthe  state  of affairs there. I personally  visited  the\r\n\r\narea with a health inspector from Katong, after which he\r\n\r\ninformed  me  that lorries cannot go into the  roads  in\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai as the roads are narrow. As this matter is\r\n\r\nknown to the Health Ministry, I hope it will be remedied\r\n\r\nas early as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are drains which are not serviced by the\r\n\r\nAnti-Malarial  Department. I would like  to  know  where  the\r\n\r\nfault  lies,  and whether this Department  has  adequate\r\n\r\nemployees   or   otherwise.  I  hope  the  Anti-Malarial\r\n\r\nDepartment  will get rid of this nuisance. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  pumping of anti-malarial oil should be done for all\r\n\r\ndrains in the kampongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the market at Geylang Serai, the Markets and\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department  has  allocated  one  stall  to  two\r\n\r\npersons - one a night stall and the other, a day  stall.\r\n\r\nThe  area  of the stall itself is very small indeed.  It\r\n\r\ncan  accommodate only one table and there is no room for\r\n\r\nstools and tables. What is more regrettable is that when\r\n\r\nthe  day-time stall-holder finishes his work, he has  to\r\n\r\nremove his utensils and equipment. The night-hawker does\r\n\r\nlikewise. Both the night and day stall-holders sell  for\r\n\r\nlimited hours and they have to use their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransport  to  remove their utensils.  I  have  received\r\n\r\npetitions  from  such stall-holders  saying  that  their\r\n\r\nprofits  are  insufficient to cover the rentals  of  the\r\n\r\nstalls. For this reason, they find it hard to make  both\r\n\r\nends meet. Hence, they give up their stalls and hawk  by\r\n\r\nthe  roadside.  We will find that it is  so  in  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  where  they can hawk for unlimited  hours  rather\r\n\r\nthan  sell  in  the stalls provided by the  Markets  and\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department. I hope the Ministry concerned  will\r\n\r\nbe flexible in the allocation of stalls. This will be  a\r\n\r\ngreat  relief  to hawkers to find a means of  living.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  if  this  can be overcome,  the  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nmarket will be a boon to the hawkers there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  my  colleagues who spoke before me were  unanimous\r\n\r\nabout  one  thing. They gave an adequate explanation  of\r\n\r\nthe  health conditions in our State. I wish to add a bit\r\n\r\nto  that. For example, in big streets one does not  find\r\n\r\nmuch rubbish. This rubbish is gathered in one corner and\r\n\r\ntaken  away  in vans. If one goes there in the  evening,\r\n\r\none  sees a big rubbish dump. The next morning too,  one\r\n\r\nfinds  the  same  rubbish dump there. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  is fully aware of what the consequences will  be\r\n\r\nif  this  rubbish  is left there. If one  takes  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  Road  for  example, there are  stalls  along  the\r\n\r\nroadside.  Even then the place is clean in the  morning.\r\n\r\nBut  at  five or six, there is a lot of rubbish  in  the\r\n\r\ncentre of the road. We want those who visit Singapore to\r\n\r\nspeak  highly  of it. If they were to see this  rubbish,\r\n\r\nthey would be very much ashamed of it and we should feel\r\n\r\ndisgraced.  We would like others to come  and  say  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  streets  are clean and  well-kept,  but  this\r\n\r\nrubbish is a setback for us. We shall be insulted  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this rubbish. There are smaller  streets  as\r\n\r\nwell,  I  remember one thing. During the colonial  days,\r\n\r\nall  rubbish was swept up, kept in dumps and taken away.\r\n\r\nBut  nowadays I do not see this happening. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Cleansing Department employees are sweeping\r\n\r\nup  the  rubbish at all. If you go to the small streets,\r\n\r\nyou can see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  yourself,  Mr Speaker, Sir, what happens  to  this\r\n\r\nrubbish.  Even the people who live in those streets  are\r\n\r\nnot the least bothered about it. If such is the state of\r\n\r\nthings, what will happen to the health of this State? We\r\n\r\nmust  know how to remove rubbish and how to get  rid  of\r\n\r\nall  the dirt and filth. I feel that all the Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Parliament should volunteer to go  and  sweep  the\r\n\r\nstreets on a Sunday and set an example to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, in Narcis  Street,\r\n\r\nthere  are no rubbish bins available. In Wallich Street,\r\n\r\nthere  are  rubbish bins. Those hawkers  who  ply  along\r\n\r\nthese  roads go and dump their rubbish in one particular\r\n\r\nplace.  If  proper bins are available, then the  rubbish\r\n\r\ncan be dumped into these bins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has said that mosquitoes breed\r\n\r\nin  water.  But I beg to disagree. Mosquitoes  breed  on\r\n\r\nrubbish. There are plenty of mosquitoes all over.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know where they come from. There are even mosquitoes\r\n\r\nin  running water. One wonders where they come from.  In\r\n\r\nThomson Road, there was a case where a child died  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  mosquito  bites. Therefore,  I  request  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health to consider this matter carefully. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to elaborate very much on this because  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have spoken on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

It is true that the matter  could\r\n\r\nbe resolved by employing more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers.  But I think that would only be just attempting\r\n\r\nto   evade   the  issue,  because  with  the   best   of\r\n\r\norganisation and the best of equipment, unless there  is\r\n\r\na reasonably efficient working force, then all our plans\r\n\r\ncan go wrong. And to have a reasonably efficient \r\n\r\nforce - I  am  not  asking for a highly efficient  force  but  a\r\n\r\nreasonably efficient force - there has got to be  normal\r\n\r\ndiscipline,   and  that  is  utterly  lacking.   It   is\r\n\r\nimpossible to run any department or organisation if  the\r\n\r\nabsenteeism which has to be faced fluctuates from  three\r\n\r\nper cent to something like 15 per cent. As a result, you\r\n\r\ncan never tell how many workers are going to turn up for\r\n\r\nwork.  That  has  been  so for  the  last  seven  years.\r\n\r\nAbsenteeism is at its lowest - three to five per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  whole  working  force - on Sundays  when  there  is\r\n\r\ndouble  pay, and on public holidays when there is treble\r\n\r\npay.  And  when it is normal pay on Mondays, absenteeism\r\n\r\nis  15  per cent. Just how can any organisation work  on\r\n\r\nsuch  a  basis? So I have not asked for the  filling  of\r\n\r\nvacancies in such a situation because it is a ridiculous\r\n\r\nsituation.  Had  we filled the vacancies,  the  position\r\n\r\nwould have got from bad to worse, because it would  have\r\n\r\ncontinued to be run on that basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, happy to say that after long\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and  negotiations, a new disciplinary  code\r\n\r\nhas  been  drawn up dated 21st October, 1965,  only  two\r\n\r\nmonths  ago,  by the Government, through the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury,  with  the Public Daily-Rated  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  Federation. It is only two months since  the  new\r\n\r\ndisciplinary code has been effective, and now steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  to pull up recalcitrant workers  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taking  advantage of the former disciplinary  code\r\n\r\nwhich  was  wholly ineffectual. Things are beginning  to\r\n\r\nimprove,  and  it  is  now  possible  to  consider   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of more workers who would then  be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  reasonably efficient work force.  So  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the Back-benchers that the new year will see  an\r\n\r\nimprovement in the public health services of  Singapore;\r\n\r\nbut  like everything else, it will take some time before\r\n\r\nit can be truly effective. I hope this time next year it\r\n\r\nwill be possible to report a much happier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation and a general improvement in the public health\r\n\r\nstandards  by way of fewer mosquitoes, fewer  flies  and\r\n\r\nless rubbish all round, whether in busy roads, in hawker\r\n\r\ncongregations or side streets. But I do not think it  is\r\n\r\nenough  just to say that I have waited for two years  to\r\n\r\nget this new disciplinary code put into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have also been taken since October of this year\r\n\r\nto  create what is known as an Emergency Cleansing Corps\r\n\r\nwhich, at the moment, has 200 workers. They are used  in\r\n\r\ntwo  shifts at various localities which require what  is\r\n\r\nknown  as  a task force to clear up piles of  refuse  in\r\n\r\nhawker congregations and markets. As an example, I  will\r\n\r\ngive some indication of the work that is being done. Let\r\n\r\nme  take 15th December, which is just an ordinary  daily\r\n\r\nreport  which  I  receive for this  Emergency  Cleansing\r\n\r\nCorps of 200 workers, which we intend to increase to 400\r\n\r\nwithin  the  next few months, and on to 600  thereafter.\r\n\r\nThey  work in two shifts; from 6 a.m, to 1.50 p.m., that\r\n\r\nis,  ten minutes to two o'clock, and from 11.30  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning  to  7.20 p.m. in the evening. The  places  that\r\n\r\nthey  go  to work, which might be of interest to Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House,  are  as follows: Kelantan  Lane,  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar, Queensway, Jalan Bukit Merah, Paya Lebar Road for\r\n\r\ndesilting  of drains. Most of our drains are being  used\r\n\r\nunfortunately by the public as if they are  just  refuse\r\n\r\ndumps.   They   just  throw  things  into  the   drains,\r\n\r\nunfortunately. And then for the maintenance of drains in\r\n\r\nNew  Bridge  Road, Bukit Timah Road, Hoi How Road,  Syed\r\n\r\nAlwi  Road,  Waterloo Street, Dorset Road, Sims  Avenue.\r\n\r\nThat is the A.M. shift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the P.M. shift, they go to the hawker\r\n\r\ncongregations, like the one at Narcis Street. On 15th of\r\n\r\nDecember, the places that were tackled by our task force\r\n\r\nwere the Kandang Kerbau market area, Syed Alwi Road (big\r\n\r\ndrain),  Hock  Lim  Street, High Street,  Queen  Street,\r\n\r\nBeach Lane, New Market Road, China Street, Pagoda Street\r\n\r\nand  Smith  Street  junction, Narcis Street,  Tai  Thong\r\n\r\nCrescent,  Idris Road, Lorong 25A, Lorong  Tahar.  Every\r\n\r\nday this task\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforce  of 200 workers is sent out specially to clean  up\r\n\r\nrefuse  dumps which are known to accumulate over a  day,\r\n\r\nand  it  goes round the island to ensure that  there  is\r\n\r\nbetter  cleansing  than hitherto. This particular  force\r\n\r\nwill be doubled to 400 within a month or so, and trebled\r\n\r\nto  600 in another few months' time. So it is hoped that\r\n\r\nby this method and by further recruitment of workers for\r\n\r\npublic cleansing and in the anti-mosquito department and\r\n\r\nso  on,  we  will be able to ensure, over the new  year,\r\n\r\nsome improvement. I hope to see in a matter of two years\r\n\r\nconsiderable improvement in the public health situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need go further into the other\r\n\r\ncomments  of  the  hon.  Members because  they  are  all\r\n\r\nrelated.  Hawkers, public cleansing,  mosquitoes  -  all\r\n\r\nhave   to   do   with  public  health,   and   standards\r\n\r\nunfortunately have come down. Partly to blame for  this,\r\n\r\nI think, would be the poor efficiency of the work force.\r\n\r\nBut  now that a new disciplinary code has been put  into\r\n\r\neffect,  I  expect a great improvement  in  the  working\r\n\r\nefficiency of our workers and that we can now  think  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  increasing the number of  workers  on  a  new\r\n\r\nbasis,  and,  therefore,  in  a  position  to  make   an\r\n\r\neffective re-organisation of our services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

But naturally what takes place in the city  will\r\n\r\naffect  the  rural  areas, because  we  are  looking  at\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a whole. May I just say that, to  give  an\r\n\r\nexample  of the size of the problem involved,  say,  for\r\n\r\nrefuse,  in  any  one  day  we are  now  collecting  and\r\n\r\ndisposing  of nearly 600 tons of refuse, of  which  over\r\n\r\n400  tons would be within the city area. The rural areas\r\n\r\nwould be 130 tons. The task force deals with about 40 to\r\n\r\n50 tons of refuse. That is the situation. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  really trying to tackle the big problem in the city\r\n\r\narea,  where  a huge pile of refuse can be  seen  to  be\r\n\r\nthere;  whereas in the rural areas there is less  refuse\r\n\r\nand  it  is also possible, as my hon. Friend, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Changi has said, for the residents there to bury the\r\n\r\nrubbish within their compound. There is ample land to do\r\n\r\nso.  But  it is not possible to bury refuse in the  city\r\n\r\narea;  one could not dig up a hole, for example, in  the\r\n\r\nconcrete  road to bury the rubbish. But it  is  possible\r\n\r\nfor farmers to dispose of their own rubbish by \r\n\r\nburning - I  am  glad some refuse is being burnt rather than  just\r\n\r\nbeing  left  alone to rot and to attract flies.  So  the\r\n\r\nproblem of disposal of refuse in the rural area, in  our\r\n\r\nview, is less urgent than that in the built-up area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at this stage I might as well answer the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson when he says that he does  not  think\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  come out from water but that they  come  out\r\n\r\nfrom  refuse. It is true that if tins collect some water\r\n\r\nin  them after rain or a shower - there is a little  bit\r\n\r\nof  water  in the tins - that will be suitable  for  the\r\n\r\nbreeding of mosquitoes. So mosquitoes can come out  from\r\n\r\ntins.  But  there is really water in the tin before  the\r\n\r\nmosquitoes can breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai. I believe his complaint was that, in  the\r\n\r\nallocation of stalls for the Geylang Serai\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket,  they  were  given to day-hawkers  and  separate\r\n\r\nstalls were given to night-hawkers and, therefore,  they\r\n\r\nwere unable to make a decent living. Unfortunately, when\r\n\r\nthis  huge market was built in Geylang Serai, there were\r\n\r\nmore  hawkers  registered for  stalls  than  there  were\r\n\r\nstalls in the market. So in order not to disappoint  the\r\n\r\nhawkers,  it  was  decided to make  everybody  happy  by\r\n\r\ngiving  each hawker a stall, whether it is  for  day  or\r\n\r\nnight,  instead  of  allowing one hawker  to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nfacilities of a stall for day and night. That was how it\r\n\r\narose,  and  there  was some dissatisfaction  over  this\r\n\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then unfortunately the two racial riots broke out,\r\n\r\nand,  I  think,  all  the market stallholders  who  were\r\n\r\nallocated stalls decided to move out. That unfortunately\r\n\r\nis  the situation. We have a brand new market erected at\r\n\r\ngreat  cost  -  I  think  over  $400,000  -  but  it  is\r\n\r\npractically empty, which is a sad state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is better to tackle the hawker problem not just\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang  Serai but for the whole of Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  is, first, to license all hawkers, and, second,\r\n\r\nafter  licensing them, to try to control  them  and  get\r\n\r\nthem  into  markets, whether built by  Government  at  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  cost  of  a few hundred  thousand  dollars\r\n\r\napiece,  or  to encourage them to go even  into  private\r\n\r\nmarkets  built  for that purpose. The  private  markets,\r\n\r\nlike Government markets, are half-empty. And it may even\r\n\r\nbe necessary to encourage hawkers to do their businesses\r\n\r\ninside  shophouses  and  not to  hawk  in  the  streets,\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore is fast growing into a large city  of\r\n\r\ntwo  million,  if  not more, people. There  are  over  a\r\n\r\nhundred thousand cars in the streets. In course of time,\r\n\r\nI  think hawkers should not be doing their businesses in\r\n\r\nthe  streets. They should be getting into shophouses  to\r\n\r\ndo their businesses properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to be the general trend, Sir. That would be\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel of the new hawkers' code  when  it  is\r\n\r\nannounced. I hope that when it is implemented, we may be\r\n\r\nwell on the road to having gradual control of the hawker\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat</b> <i>(In Malay)</i>: I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): I did not say that\r\n\r\nmosquitoes do not breed in water.

That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we  have embarked on such a  large  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I understand the Member for Anson correctly, what\r\n\r\nhe  is  asking  for  is that all Division  IV  employees\r\n\r\nshould  be  housed.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  one  of  the\r\n\r\nSessions  of  the  Assembly  sometime  ago,  I  think  a\r\n\r\nquestion  was asked by the Member for Moulmein  and  the\r\n\r\nanswer  given to her was that about 79 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. staff and 33 per cent of the staff in the Health\r\n\r\nDepartment  are  provided  with  quarters.   Now,   this\r\n\r\npercentage  is much more than the number of  people,  in\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income group in Singapore, who are  provided\r\n\r\nwith  houses. In spite of the completion of 51,000 units\r\n\r\nof housing during the last five years by the Government,\r\n\r\nand an additional 12,000 units this year, about only  26\r\n\r\nper   cent  of  the  people  of  Singapore  are  housed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  compared  with the general  population,  the\r\n\r\ngroup  of employees who are in the lower income  bracket\r\n\r\nare  better  treated in the matter of housing  than  the\r\n\r\nrest of the population of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually there are about 18,000 Division IV employees\r\n\r\nin  the  civil  service  and  about  9,500  Division  IV\r\n\r\nquarters,  institutional or otherwise.  Therefore,  more\r\n\r\nthan  half of them are being housed. Our duty is to  see\r\n\r\nthat  every section of the population does get the  same\r\n\r\ntreatment.  About  50 per cent, taking  an  average,  of\r\n\r\nDivision  IV employees are being housed; they are  being\r\n\r\ngiven  quarters which are heavily subsidised, much  more\r\n\r\nthan  those  belonging  to the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  emphasise  the point brought up by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta a few days ago, and that is that Government is not\r\n\r\nmaking  any  money at all in providing the  public  with\r\n\r\nHousing  Board houses. The rental charged, as you  know,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, is $20 for a one-room unit, $40 for  a\r\n\r\ntwo-room unit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   $60  for  a  three-room  unit,  excluding  service\r\n\r\ncharges.  Now,  this  is insufficient  to  amortise  the\r\n\r\ncapital  that  is put in as well as the  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthese  houses,  and  every year  Government  is  out  of\r\n\r\npocket.

The  explanation\r\n\r\nregarding change of address was not satisfactory to  the\r\n\r\npeople and there was a lot of unhappiness. I support the\r\n\r\nwish of the Minister for Finance, and it is the hope  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, as well as the hope of the people, that\r\n\r\nas  far  as  this  section  is concerned,  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndefeated if we could not harmonise law and fines and  if\r\n\r\nthis section was not improved. For example, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nA  buys a radio and takes out a radio licence. He is  of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion that he has got a licence and he would  not\r\n\r\ngo  against the law if he were to stay in another  place\r\n\r\nbefore  the  expiry  of the licence,  because  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  on  the  licence which says that  he  would  be\r\n\r\npunished  if  he did not change his address.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthere  are  regulations and by-laws in regard  to  radio\r\n\r\nlicensing. But these are not known to the public  except\r\n\r\nto  the  radio  inspectors. The  wording  on  the  radio\r\n\r\nlicence  is  only in English, and information  regarding\r\n\r\nchange  of address is also in English. The attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  owner of the licence is not drawn to the fact  that\r\n\r\nif  he  does  not note the change of address  where  his\r\n\r\nradio  has  been  installed, then he  has  committed  an\r\n\r\noffence  and he would be fined. Mr Speaker,  there  are\r\n\r\npeople  who  know English who do not even realise  this.\r\n\r\nWhat more for those people who do not know English? What\r\n\r\naction  has  been  taken by the radio licence  officers?\r\n\r\nWhen a radio licence officer discovers that the licensee\r\n\r\nhas  not changed his address he sends a compound  notice\r\n\r\nfor  $40.  This also is in English. The offence relating\r\n\r\nto  change  of  address  should  be  explained  in  four\r\n\r\nlanguages in the radio licence. And for the first  time,\r\n\r\nhe  should  be  given  one week's grace  to  change  his\r\n\r\naddress. If he still does not comply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith this, only then should he be fined.

The\r\n\r\nInland Revenue Department was collecting assessment from\r\n\r\ntwo  different persons, two different sums of money, but\r\n\r\nunder  one  house number. A certain person  had  an  old\r\n\r\nattap  house  which was numbered by the  Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment and he was paying assessment for a number  of\r\n\r\nyears ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The Planning Department  approved\r\n\r\nthe  repair under condition that the house may exist for\r\n\r\none  year  only  from the date of the  permission  being\r\n\r\ngranted. This person is illiterate and he could not understand  the  implications of the condition. He  renovated\r\n\r\nthe  house  after submitting 13 sketch  plans  and  site\r\n\r\nplans. True to the condition laid down, a year later the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department  sent a  notice  to  the  gentleman\r\n\r\nsaying  that the permission granted to his house expired\r\n\r\non  such  and  such a date, and if he  still  wished  to\r\n\r\nretain  the  house, he must submit a further  13  sketch\r\n\r\nplans and site plans in order that the existence of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding be legalised. In the meantime, another  citizen\r\n\r\nhad applied for the erection of a zinc house on the same\r\n\r\nplot  where  the previous building was situated.  Either\r\n\r\nthe  Planning Department or the Chief Building  Surveyor\r\n\r\nmust have approved this structure, because the irony  of\r\n\r\nthe fact is that this house was given the same number as\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  existing building and the assessment  was\r\n\r\ncollected  by  the Inland Revenue Department  under  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  names, but under one house number. A  further\r\n\r\nshocking factor was that there was no condition attached\r\n\r\nto the second house, as was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  case  in the first one. In other words, the  second\r\n\r\nhouse  can remain for any number of years and the  owner\r\n\r\nmay  not submit any further sketch plans or site  plans.\r\n\r\nSir,  this case happened in the Woodlands area.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance would care to look into it,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  to  give  him full details.  What  one  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand is this. Why should there be different  types\r\n\r\nof  conditions laid down for different buildings erected\r\n\r\non  the  same  plot?  If one house  can  remain  without\r\n\r\nrenewing  the  permit  annually, why  cannot  the  other\r\n\r\nhouse? Is there or is there not any device in the Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  Department to find out their own  mistake  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  charging  two different types  of  assessment\r\n\r\nunder  one  house number? I understand these houses  are\r\n\r\nnow  given  two  different numbers for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\ncollecting  assessment. But the folly of the permit  and\r\n\r\nthe difference in conditions still exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to take the request\r\n\r\nfrom the Member for Punggol first. He is suggesting that\r\n\r\nI  ignore  completely the building by-laws  and  approve\r\n\r\nillegal structures by giving them numbers. I think, if I\r\n\r\nwere to do that, then architects would be out of job and\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  Singapore would be a slum area.  If  the\r\n\r\nresidents  are really keen to see that their houses  get\r\n\r\nnumbers,  there is a way by which they can do that,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is to send the plans of their houses to the  Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding  Surveyor and to see that the houses that  they\r\n\r\nare  building  or  they are staying in  conform  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding by-laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Farrer Park, the matter\r\n\r\nhe has raised does not rightly involve me. All I can say\r\n\r\nis  that,  as  far as the Inland Revenue  Department  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I  should congratulate  them  on  collecting\r\n\r\nassessments  from two persons on the same  number.  They\r\n\r\nare  not  wrong there. Probably the numbering is  wrong.\r\n\r\nBut there are two buildings there. Therefore, two people\r\n\r\nshould  pay assessment, and correctly so. If I may,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to answer the point which  he\r\n\r\nhas brought up, and that is, why is it that there should\r\n\r\nbe different conditions for two buildings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are  on the same plot? What comes to my  mind  is\r\n\r\nthis.  Though the owner may have sent in 13,  14  or  15\r\n\r\nsketch plans, none of them conformed to the building \r\n\r\nby-laws,  and it is out of consideration for the  owner,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  that the Chief Building Surveyor allows  him  to\r\n\r\nretain  the building for a year, during which  he  hopes\r\n\r\nthat  the  owner would comply with the building  by-laws\r\n\r\nrequirements.  As for the other case, I think  the  very\r\n\r\nfirst  time the sketch plans of the building  were  sent\r\n\r\nin,  probably  they  conformed to the building  by-laws.\r\n\r\nThat is why there are different conditions laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has missed my point.

Therefore, if we are to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  they exist, then we have  got  to  take\r\n\r\naction  within these three years. As it is now,  we  are\r\n\r\ntaking  quite a realistic view of the situation, because\r\n\r\nduring  the last ten years things have got a little  bit\r\n\r\nout  of control, and, therefore, we thought that  if  we\r\n\r\nwere  really  to smack down all the illegal houses  that\r\n\r\nare   in   existence   without   providing   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation, then the people of Singapore would really\r\n\r\nsuffer  great hardships. As it is, we have been able  to\r\n\r\nclear quite a lot of illegal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructures in slum areas and rehouse these people in new\r\n\r\nhouses built by the Housing and Development Board.

Here again, I think he will have to raise  it\r\n\r\nwith  my  colleague, the Minister for Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  - whether he is able to bring up  specific\r\n\r\ninstances  where there has been undue delay in approving\r\n\r\nor  considering the plans submitted by owners  of  these\r\n\r\nhouses  in  order  to regularise the position  of  their\r\n\r\nbuildings. If there are such instances, them I would say\r\n\r\nthat it would be best if he would bring it to the notice\r\n\r\nof  my  colleague,  the Minister for  Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  and I think the Minister would  look  into\r\n\r\nthem  and study every application whether the owners  of\r\n\r\nthese  illegal structures are trying to conform  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  by-laws, and the regulations of  this  country\r\n\r\nwould then he attended to as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,907,970 for Head 0807 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0901 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 0901 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 1001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in this Session the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  introduced the National  Registration  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  was passed by this House. That Bill empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  take steps to re-register  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore into two categories - one for citizens  and  the\r\n\r\nother  for  non-citizens. I will  give  him  credit  for\r\n\r\nimposing a fee of 50 cents on citizens, and I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  imposing  a  fee  of  $1 on  non-citizens  is  very\r\n\r\ngenerous when we consider the amount of money we need to\r\n\r\nprovide social services for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, identity cards, birth certificates,\r\n\r\nand  citizenship certificates are all now very important\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birth certificates at present issued are very flimsy\r\n\r\nand  can be destroyed easily, and so are our citizenship\r\n\r\ncertificates.  I  would  ask the  Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nwhether  he  would  also take steps  to  provide  better\r\n\r\nquality   material   for  our  birth  certificates   and\r\n\r\ncitizenship  certificates, possibly like  those  plastic\r\n\r\nlaminated cards which he proposes to introduce  for  the\r\n\r\nidentity cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, I believe that a person does\r\n\r\nnot  pay  a  fee for the registration of citizenship.  A\r\n\r\npayment  of  $2  is  being imposed as  a  stamp  fee  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  the  document. This may possibly  be  so  when\r\n\r\ncitizenship  was  introduced years  back  and  when  all\r\n\r\nParties  were  trying  to  vote-catch  the  public  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, a fee was not imposed. But as citizenship  is\r\n\r\nnow  an important document for the many good things that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will provide. I feel it is time that  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  impose a nominal fee for  registration  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  and I would ask the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is  very  important and  essential  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of this country, especially after Singapore  has\r\n\r\nachieved  its independence. The people who are  citizens\r\n\r\nare   entitled  to  many  benefits,  for  example,  free\r\n\r\neducation,   housing,  employment  opportunities,   free\r\n\r\nmedical services. They are also entitled to the right to\r\n\r\nvote  and  the right to be elected. During the past  ten\r\n\r\nyears,  many  people  in  Singapore  have  realised  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of citizenship. Therefore, this  Citizenship\r\n\r\nRegistry  is very busy because the applicants  run  into\r\n\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Could the Member please go a\r\n\r\nlittle  more  slowly? The Interpreters  are  finding  it\r\n\r\nsomewhat difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, the\r\n\r\nCitizenship Office is faced with a very burdensome  task\r\n\r\nand  has  received many complaints from members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to classify these\r\n\r\ncomplaints  into several groups. First, there  are  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the effect that applications have been delayed for as\r\n\r\nlong as one year and that the Citizenship Office has not\r\n\r\ngiven   any   reply   to   these   applications.   These\r\n\r\napplications do not know whether their applications have\r\n\r\nbeen accepted or rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there are many applications which are very\r\n\r\ncomplicated.  For example, an Indian who has  been  here\r\n\r\nsince 1935 has resided here for 30 years. But during the\r\n\r\npast  30  years he has returned to India  two  or  three\r\n\r\ntimes.  According to the citizenship law, the period  of\r\n\r\nhis  return  to India cannot be taken into  account  for\r\n\r\nresidential qualifications. But the authority  concerned\r\n\r\nand  the  officials have not clearly explained  to  such\r\n\r\npeople   why  their  applications  cannot  be  accepted.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the applicants in such cases came to  see  me\r\n\r\nbecause  they reside in my constituency. They complained\r\n\r\nto  me that their applications for citizenship had  been\r\n\r\nturned  down without reason and that they had  not  been\r\n\r\ntold  of  the  reasons. They also  complained  that  the\r\n\r\nauthority concerned and the officials in the Citizenship\r\n\r\nOffice  were  not courteous to him. I would,  therefore,\r\n\r\nlike the Minister concerned to consider this matter.  If\r\n\r\nthere are certain civil servants who are discourteous to\r\n\r\nthe   public,  it  will  affect  our  reputation  as   a\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the complaint is that perhaps after\r\n\r\nindependence  many people have to apply for citizenship,\r\n\r\nand  therefore  the Citizenship Office is  crowded  with\r\n\r\napplicants. But most of the applicants have to wait  for\r\n\r\nat  least one day before their cases can be attended to.\r\n\r\nThey are not happy with this long delay and waiting.  So\r\n\r\nI hope the authority concerned will rectify this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the complaint about language difficulties. For\r\n\r\nexample, some Hakka people do not understand Hokkien, or\r\n\r\nsome Indians do not understand Malay. Although there are\r\n\r\nsome  interpreters in the Citizenship Registry who  know\r\n\r\nmany dialects, they do not know all the dialects. So  in\r\n\r\nfuture  when  we employ interpreters, we must  see  that\r\n\r\nthey   know  all  the  dialects  so  that  the  language\r\n\r\ndifficulties can be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I must thank the Member  for  River\r\n\r\nValley  for  having  said  kind  words  about   my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  As  regards  his  suggestion  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should impose a fee for the issue of  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  for citizenship, a birth certificate,\r\n\r\nand other documents, what I have to say is that we\r\n\r\nwill look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the re-registration campaign, as I\r\n\r\nhave pointed out earlier in the Second Reading  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Registration Bill, we are  going  to\r\n\r\nissue   two  categories  of  identity   cards   of\r\n\r\ndifferent  colours - one for citizens and the  other\r\n\r\nfor non-citizens. The fee charged will he 50 cents\r\n\r\nfor a citizen and $1 for a non-citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I must take the opportunity to correct\r\n\r\nmyself.  Earlier  I  had said  that  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nissuing a card was $7. This is not correct. I have\r\n\r\nnow verified it and the cost of issuing a card  is\r\n\r\nabout  $1  after  taking  into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  and equipment that we have to  purchase\r\n\r\nand the number of staff that we have to engage  to\r\n\r\nrun  the  registration centres. I  have  corrected\r\n\r\nthis  in  the Hansard. So 50 cents from a  citizen\r\n\r\nand $1 from a non-citizen would be just enough  to\r\n\r\ncover a part of the cost of the identity card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the re-registration campaign starts, we\r\n\r\nwill  set  up  centres  in various  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland,  and  the cards issued will  be  specially\r\n\r\nprocessed plastic cards. I have a sample  here  to\r\n\r\nshow  Members. This is the exact size of the  card\r\n\r\nthat  we  are going to issue as an identity  card,\r\n\r\nbut  the design of the card has not been finalised\r\n\r\nbecause we are waiting for an artist to draw up  a\r\n\r\nsuitable format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also various other technical matters\r\n\r\nto  be considered. This sample card here is  of  a\r\n\r\nvery   convenient  size,  and  it  is  waterproof,\r\n\r\nforgery-proof, and even crease-proof. When we have\r\n\r\ndealt with the issue of these identity cards,  the\r\n\r\nmachinery that we have purchased will be available\r\n\r\nto  laminate  the  other  documents  such  as  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship certificate and the birth certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we do not have this equipment. We\r\n\r\nhave  placed  an order elsewhere to purchase  this\r\n\r\nlaminating  machine. As soon as we  have  it,  and\r\n\r\nafter  the  re-registration campaign is completed,\r\n\r\nit  will  then be possible for us to go  into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of laminating the birth certificate  and\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship certificate, as suggested by  the\r\n\r\nMember just now. [Turning to the Member for  River\r\n\r\nValley} If you want this ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will lay it on the\r\n\r\nTable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes, so that Members\r\n\r\ninterested can have a look at this sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the comments of the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang on the Citizenship Registry, I think  it\r\n\r\nis inevitable that consideration of an application\r\n\r\nfor citizenship is delayed because of the shortage\r\n\r\nof  staff  in the Registry. We all know  that  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  certificate is a sacred document.  It\r\n\r\nentitles  the holder to many privileges which  are\r\n\r\nonly  extended to citizens, for instance,  in  the\r\n\r\napplication  for houses, jobs, places  in  schools\r\n\r\nfor  their  children, and so on. It is, therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessary   that  the  issue  of   a   citizenship\r\n\r\ncertificate should be properly investigated. There\r\n\r\nshould he some checks and counter-checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the issue of this citizenship\r\n\r\ncertificate  is  a  very  important  process.  The\r\n\r\nnormal  practice in dealing with an  applicant  is\r\n\r\nthis:  on  being issued with an application  form,\r\n\r\nthe  applicant  is at once sent to  the  Interview\r\n\r\nSection  where his form is to he filled up  by  an\r\n\r\nofficer   and  an  interview  takes  place.   This\r\n\r\nprocedure  can  only be adopted if there  are  not\r\n\r\nmore than 80 applicants a day; in other words, the\r\n\r\nRegistry  can  deal with about 1,600 applicants  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  From  January to July this  year,  as  the\r\n\r\naverage monthly number was 1,500-odd, the Registry\r\n\r\nstaff  was  able  to deal with all the  applicants\r\n\r\nquickly.  However, as from August 1965,  with  the\r\n\r\nseparation of Singapore from Malaysia, the  number\r\n\r\nof  applicants  rose  very  sharply.  The  average\r\n\r\nnumber  of  applicants  monthly  from  August   to\r\n\r\nSeptember was about 3,530. Therefore, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthis large increase, the Registry was unable to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintain  its usual procedure of granting interviews  to\r\n\r\napplicants  on  the  same day. In  these  circumstances,\r\n\r\ndifferent  dates for interviews have to be given.  These\r\n\r\ndates have been progressively advanced to December 1966.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  inevitable process because  of  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people wanting to get citizenship,  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of staff we have in this Registry is very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the case of the Indian applicant who has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  resident in Singapore since 1935 and still  has\r\n\r\nnot  got  his citizenship papers, I think it is probably\r\n\r\nbecause  of his various visits to India. At present  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  granting citizenship is  that,  among  other\r\n\r\nthings,  the applicant must have roots in this  country.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, he must have his family here and has  a\r\n\r\nstable job here. What we have found is that many Indians\r\n\r\nwho  have been resident in Singapore for quite a  number\r\n\r\nof  years  do not have any family roots here. They  have\r\n\r\ntheir  wives in India; their children are also in India,\r\n\r\nand every month they send remittances back to India.  In\r\n\r\ntime  to come, they may even go back to India to retire.\r\n\r\nSir,  for such cases the policy is this: apparently this\r\n\r\napplicant  is not treating this country as his permanent\r\n\r\nhome,  and he is only taking up citizenship for his  own\r\n\r\nconvenience,  and  therefore  normally  citizenship   is\r\n\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the complaint that the staff in the Registry is\r\n\r\nnot courteous to the public, I think the matter has been\r\n\r\ntaken  up  to ensure that the staff in this Registry  is\r\n\r\npolite and treat the public well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the language difficulty faced by the applicants,\r\n\r\nI  have  to point out that at present there is a  ruling\r\n\r\nthat  applicants for citizenship must understand or must\r\n\r\npass  a language test in the national language. Only  in\r\n\r\ncircumstances where the applicant is very  old  and  who\r\n\r\ncannot  be expected to pass the national language  test,\r\n\r\nwill  he  be  exempted from the language test.  But  the\r\n\r\nothers  have to pass the national language test.  If  we\r\n\r\nexpect every person to speak the national language, then\r\n\r\nthis problem of language will not arise here. But in any\r\n\r\ncase,  we have many translators and interpreters in  the\r\n\r\nRegistry who can look after these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  who are old and cannot speak any language  other\r\n\r\nthan  their mother tongue.

I would\r\n\r\nlike  to give an example. On the 9th of December,  1965,\r\n\r\nCorporal 1038 of the Naval Police died of sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there is no free transport provided as\r\n\r\na  token  to  workers who have died. This  corporal  had\r\n\r\nserved  for  a long period with the Admiralty,  no  less\r\n\r\nthan 20 years. Even before that, Mr Speaker, there  was\r\n\r\nanother  incident  where P.C. 805  of  the  Royal  Naval\r\n\r\nPolice died in an accident, while carrying out his duty,\r\n\r\ninvolving   a   van   which   went   against   Admiralty\r\n\r\nregulations.  He also faced the same fate  as  the  said\r\n\r\ncorporal.  These  workers are outside  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour,  but  they are Singapore citizens. They  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  labour union to represent them. We do not  wish\r\n\r\nthe  Admiralty  to suppress their workers who  protected\r\n\r\nthe  interests and property of the Admiralty at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  anti-nationals, led by the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nlaunched their campaign to topple the Government. I hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Labour will resolve this problem so that\r\n\r\nall  workers  can  enjoy and obtain the co-operation  of\r\n\r\ntheir employers, not only in the matter of transport, as\r\n\r\nI  have  related earlier, but also other facilities  and\r\n\r\nbenefits,   which  will  benefit  both   employees   and\r\n\r\nemployers as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns unnamed birth\r\n\r\ncertificates. I ask the Ministry of Labour  to  consider\r\n\r\nmore  sympathetically and carefully matters relating  to\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates  which have no names.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I quote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere  an  example. A person was born here 40 years  ago,\r\n\r\nbut  because  his  parents were either  conservative  or\r\n\r\nnegligent, they did not name their child. Therefore, the\r\n\r\nname did not appear on the birth certificate. Holders of\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates without names who have worked  here,\r\n\r\nwhose  names appear on the electoral register and  whose\r\n\r\nloyalty   is   to  this  country  are  not   given   due\r\n\r\nconsideration  at  all. I think  this  will  defeat  the\r\n\r\nobject of re-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the matter of birth certificates\r\n\r\nwithout  names,  it  cannot be  denied  that  there  are\r\n\r\nforgeries  and  falsifications by unscrupulous  persons.\r\n\r\nNevertheless  the Ministry of Labour must also  consider\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  bona fide cases where the  holders  of\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates  do  not have  their  names  on  the\r\n\r\ncertificates. I hope the Ministry will find a way out so\r\n\r\nthat  the would-be forgers would be caught, but the bona\r\n\r\nfide cases whose loyalty to this country has been proved\r\n\r\ncan be given due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  merely wish to add a little to what has already\r\n\r\nbeen  said  by the Member for Kampong Kapor relating  to\r\n\r\nbirth   certificates  without  names.  I  believe,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that while the Bill which has been  passed\r\n\r\nis   good   because   it  will  prevent   incidents   of\r\n\r\nmaladministration,  it will also  deprive  the  rightful\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore of many facilities. I believe that\r\n\r\nsince  the  announcement has been made  regarding  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates   without  names  and  birth   certificates\r\n\r\nsupported by statutory declarations need not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  proof  of  birth  in Singapore, the  office  of  the\r\n\r\nCitizenship  Registry has been inundated with  inquiries\r\n\r\nby  applicants for registration, because they fear  that\r\n\r\nthey will be deprived of the facilities enjoyed by them.\r\n\r\nAs  has  been  explained by the Minister for  Education,\r\n\r\nthose   who   are  not  in  possession  of   citizenship\r\n\r\ncertificates  or  are not children of Singapore  parents\r\n\r\nwill  have  to pay school fees both in the  primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. This will create a lot of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems   to  the  bona  fide  citizens  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  appeal to the Minister  for  Labour,  who\r\n\r\nlooks  after  citizenship  and  re-registration,  to  be\r\n\r\nflexible  in  the  application of this particular  rule,\r\n\r\nespecially to those whose names appear in the  electoral\r\n\r\nregister and who have voted in past elections,  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship applications may be approved and  that\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates without names but supported by other\r\n\r\ndocuments, such as school leaving certificates,  may  be\r\n\r\nconsidered   as  proof  of  birth  for  the   issue   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship certificates. This is to facilitate  matters\r\n\r\nfor  our bona fide citizens. If there is any doubt, then\r\n\r\nthe rules may be enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the Member for Kampong Kapor. However,\r\n\r\nI  want to deal with the first one which relates to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of workers in the Naval Base. What he has raised\r\n\r\nis  a matter which is not under my Ministry, because, as\r\n\r\nwe  all  know,  under the Defence Treaty with  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwhich  is still effective in Singapore, our labour  laws\r\n\r\nare  not applicable to foreign bases. So as regards this\r\n\r\ncomplaint   about  the  Admiralty  refusing  to   supply\r\n\r\ntransport  to  members under their employment  who  have\r\n\r\ndied, there is nothing we can do about it. But I am glad\r\n\r\nto hear of this complaint which I am prepared to forward\r\n\r\nto  the Admiralty for their sympathetic consideration in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of birth certificates with no\r\n\r\nnames raised by the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I have\r\n\r\nalready  made  several statements in this  House  before\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  raised   the\r\n\r\nquestion  under  the  Supplementary Estimates  and  also\r\n\r\nduring  the  Second Reading of the National Registration\r\n\r\nBill.  I  have  said  that the  provision  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nregarding certificates with no names is only a provision\r\n\r\nto  deal  with forgeries and people who use  such  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates as a means to get their citizenship. I  can\r\n\r\nquote  an example. If we do not have a provision in  the\r\n\r\nlaw  regarding unnamed certificates, then all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nabuses will occur. For instance, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  brothers are born of the same parents one  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the other in the Federation  and  if  the\r\n\r\nbrother who was born in Singapore is in possession of  a\r\n\r\nbirth  certificate without name dies, then  the  brother\r\n\r\nwho was born in the Federation will he able to come down\r\n\r\nto Singapore, using the unnamed birth certificate of his\r\n\r\ndead  brother and claiming it as his own.  In  fact,  he\r\n\r\ncould  get  his parents to file a statutory  declaration\r\n\r\nstating  that the birth certificate actually belongs  to\r\n\r\nhim.  Now if this is the case, then there would be quite\r\n\r\na  lot  of abuses in this respect. And so this provision\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill  is  necessary only  to  deal  with  these\r\n\r\nforgeries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the person who is genuinely born in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  who is in possession of a birth certificate without\r\n\r\nname, he has nothing to worry about. In fact, this is an\r\n\r\nopportunity for him to rectify his position once and for\r\n\r\nall,  because  it  is  very inconvenient  for  a  person\r\n\r\nholding  an  unnamed  birth  certificate  to  apply  for\r\n\r\nsomething   from  the  Government  whenever   proof   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship is required. When the registration  campaign\r\n\r\nstarts,  a  person  holding an unnamed  certificate  can\r\n\r\nalways.  If  he  can  prove to the satisfaction  of  the\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer that he was born in Singapore, have\r\n\r\nthat fact registered in his future identity card, and he\r\n\r\nwill  not  have to face all kinds of trouble  in  future\r\n\r\nwhen his citizenship status is examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the present, I think it is not necessary for\r\n\r\nholders  of  unnamed birth certificates to rush  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistry to have their status verified. A person born in\r\n\r\nSingapore and holding an unnamed birth certificate and a\r\n\r\nstatutory declaration made by either of his parents  has\r\n\r\nalso to produce other supporting documents, such as  the\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates of his brothers and sisters, or  his\r\n\r\nSchool Leaving Certificate, or the birth certificates of\r\n\r\nhis  children, or his vaccination certificate. If he can\r\n\r\nproduce  all  these relevant documents to establish  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship status, then he will be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  ample  proof to the Registration  Officer,  and\r\n\r\nthus he will have his status rectified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I clarify a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  on  what  my colleague,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour,  has  said  and also with regard  to  the  query\r\n\r\nraised  by the Member for Kampong Kapor?

Students are sent to the  College\r\n\r\non a scholarship, tenable for four years, with an annual\r\n\r\nvalue  of  $1,500 which is paid direct  to  the  College\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Muslim Scholarship was awarded to a scholar\r\n\r\nwho was admitted to the College in 1961 and he graduated\r\n\r\nin  1964.

In the  light\r\n\r\nof  recent developments after Singapore was evicted from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   first,  is  the  Government   allowing   the\r\n\r\nregistration of the M.C.A. and the M.I.C., which, as  is\r\n\r\nwell  known, are now defunct? Second, is the  Government\r\n\r\npaying attention to the status of U.M.N.O.? According to\r\n\r\nthe  constitution  of  U.M.N.O.,  as  I  understand  it,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. stands for United Malays National Organisation.\r\n\r\nIf  the  constitution  of U.M.N.O. provides  that  only\r\n\r\nMuslims  can  be  members of U.M.N.O., then  it  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the Ministry of Culture  and  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs to get a suitable name for the Party so that the\r\n\r\nword  \"Malay\"  will not be misused by people  of  Arabic\r\n\r\norigin  who  have  the title \"Syed\" to their  names,  by\r\n\r\npeople  of  Pakistani origin who have the  names  \"Hamid\r\n\r\nKhan\"  or the name \"Khan\" at the end of their names,  by\r\n\r\npeople of Muslim Indian origin with such names as \"Naina\r\n\r\nMohamed\"  or  \"Naina  Hashim\", by people  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\norigin  with such names perhaps as \"Parjo\" or  \"Pardjoe\"\r\n\r\nor  by people from the Bawean Islands, perhaps with  the\r\n\r\nnames of \"Masmawi\" or \"Masmawal\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I bring out these points because\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  political matter which is  related  to  the\r\n\r\ninternal  peace  of the State. We do  not  wish  to  see\r\n\r\ninnocent  people  involved in differences  of  political\r\n\r\nideology,  so that each political Party in  this  island\r\n\r\ncarries out its functions, not by representing people of\r\n\r\none   particular  origin  but  people  of  all   origins\r\n\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the people in Singapore have come to a\r\n\r\nmidway stage in their political progress where they  are\r\n\r\nable to differentiate between Parties which are communal\r\n\r\nand  those  which are non-communal and for  the  general\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  all.

Because  of   this,   it   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of this Ministry to ensure that there  is\r\n\r\na  progressive  policy so that these  political  Parties\r\n\r\nshould  be  based on the welfare of the people  of  this\r\n\r\nState as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kapor, who spoke before me,  talked\r\n\r\nabout  political  Parties.

One point relates to my  request  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for an answer concerning the establishment of a\r\n\r\nWomen's Institute to study the problems of women and  to\r\n\r\ngive  facilities for the study of such problems; and  to\r\n\r\nask   the  Minister  for  the  date  when  this  Women's\r\n\r\nInstitute  will be established. This is because  women's\r\n\r\nproblems are very important and our Party - that is, the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party - made some  mention  of  giving\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  the solution of such problems  in  1959\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Party first came to power. At that  time,  we\r\n\r\nmade a promise to the people of Singapore that when  the\r\n\r\nParty  came  to power we would pay special attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  general problems of women. Since we came to  power,\r\n\r\nseveral  years have elapsed. I am glad to note, however,\r\n\r\nthat with the co-operation of our Party colleagues, many\r\n\r\npromises have been kept. For example, the Government has\r\n\r\nalready  made it a policy to safeguard the interests  of\r\n\r\nwomen by having the Women's Charter passed to look after\r\n\r\ntheir  welfare. The Women's Charter goes a step  forward\r\n\r\nin  safeguarding the position of equality of women  with\r\n\r\nmen,  and  the status of women in society has also  been\r\n\r\nclarified and established, particularly in the field  of\r\n\r\neconomics.  They  are given equal pay  for  equal  work,\r\n\r\nirrespective of their sex. We have given women a  status\r\n\r\nequal to that of men. A few months after the passage  of\r\n\r\nthe  Women's  Charter, the former Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\ntook  steps to see that women civil servants were  given\r\n\r\nequal   pay   for  equal  work  in  all  the  Government\r\n\r\nDepartments. Furthermore, steps have also been taken  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  burden of working wives arising  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir great number of children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since we came to power, many, many creches\r\n\r\nhave  been set up throughout the island of Singapore  in\r\n\r\norder  to look after the children of working women.  All\r\n\r\nthese  steps have been taken in the interest  of  women,\r\n\r\nand we are happy to note that throughout the island many\r\n\r\ncreches are available for use by working wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning some young girls who have been `misled',\r\n\r\nthe  Social Welfare Department has also taken  steps  to\r\n\r\nsolve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  problem.  As  a result, this problem  is  not  so\r\n\r\nserious  now.  In  fact,  the  number  of  young   girls\r\n\r\nindulging in immoral activities has decreased, and  they\r\n\r\nare no longer posing a problem in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to point out that in spite of all\r\n\r\nthese   achievements  and  attention  given  to  women's\r\n\r\nwelfare, the Government does not seem to have done  much\r\n\r\nwith  the  plan  for  the  establishment  of  a  Women's\r\n\r\nInstitute.   We   all  know  that   Singapore   is   now\r\n\r\nindependent. We also know that in the past it  was  said\r\n\r\nthat we intended to set up a society in which there  was\r\n\r\nno exploitation of man by man, so that socialism will be\r\n\r\nestablished  and  its  principles  carried  out  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest extent. Under such conditions, there would be no\r\n\r\nproblems   for   women.  Now  that  we   have   achieved\r\n\r\nindependence, we must give due respect and due weight to\r\n\r\nthe  possible  contribution that women  are  capable  of\r\n\r\nmaking   towards  nation-building.  This,   of   course,\r\n\r\nrequires  encouragement  from the  Government,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  duty bound to give women  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nassistance  and  facilities  to  help  them  make  their\r\n\r\ncontribution towards nation-building. I think that, with\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of a Women's Institute,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nable to unite women of all races under one organisation,\r\n\r\nto  study  the  problems of women, and to advance  their\r\n\r\ninterests  so  as  to enable them to contribute  towards\r\n\r\nnation-building and to tell them what they  can  do  for\r\n\r\nour  country.  In this connection, I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned will give due consideration to my request  for\r\n\r\nimmediate steps to be taken for the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nWomen's Institute which is, in fact, urgently needed  at\r\n\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise, Mr Speaker, concerns\r\n\r\nthe  Commercial Service under the Ministry  of  Culture.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  the  Chinese-educated  people  read  the\r\n\r\nChinese   newspapers  every  day  and  see  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nadvertisements and news items relating to advertising.
