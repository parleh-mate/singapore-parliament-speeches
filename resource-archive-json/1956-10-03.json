Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hospitals\r\n\r\nBoard  recommended an increase in the ward charges\r\n\r\nin  the  General  Hospital and the Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital.   This  was  carefully   considered   by\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and Government, after  going  through\r\n\r\nthe   various  aspects,  decided  to  accept   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation to raise costs as it was considered\r\n\r\nthat  the  present charges were most uneconomical.\r\n\r\nIt is also the policy of Government, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith   the  Labour  Front  programme,  to  provide\r\n\r\nhospitalisation and specialist treatment  free  to\r\n\r\none and all, and the provision of special wards to\r\n\r\nbe  maintained for those who can afford it.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  difference  whatsoever  in  treatment  of\r\n\r\npatients, whether they are paying or non-paying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be of interest to Members to know that\r\n\r\nthe  1956  recurrent cost of running our hospitals\r\n\r\nis estimated at more than $21 million, whereas the\r\n\r\ntotal  revenue from hospital charges is  estimated\r\n\r\nat  only  $1,500,000. The cost of  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nbeds  in  the General and Kandang Kerbau Hospitals\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated from 1955 figures to be as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n General Hospital\r\n\r\n  Paying patients (A) cost $27.74 per bed;\r\n\r\n  Paying patients (B) cost $26.07 per bed;\r\n\r\n  Free patients cost $24.33 per bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kandang Kerbau Hospital\r\n\r\n  Paying patients (A) cost $22.62 per bed;\r\n\r\n  Paying patients (B) cost $21.76 per bed;\r\n\r\n  Free patients cost $20.61 per bed.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br>It  will  therefore be seen that even  the  first-class patients have been subsidised by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of first and second class beds in\r\n\r\nthese two hospitals are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the General Hospital, out of a total of 1,005 beds, there are only 46 first-class beds\r\n\r\nand 121 second-class beds and 838 free beds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, out of a total of 390 beds, there are only 29 first-class, 37 second-class and 324 free beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hospitals in which there is\r\n\r\naccommodation for paying patients are the General,\r\n\r\nthe  Kandang Kerbau and the Woodbridge  Hospitals.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Tan  Tock Seng, the Middle Road  and  St.\r\n\r\nAndrew's Orthopaedic Hospitals, all beds are free.\r\n\r\nIt  will  therefore  be seen  that,  for  a  great\r\n\r\nmajority  of  patients, no charge of any  kind  is\r\n\r\nlevied  and  Government  considered  that  it  was\r\n\r\njustified in asking first-class patients to pay an\r\n\r\neconomic  fee and to ask the second-class patients\r\n\r\nto  pay a slightly higher contribution towards the\r\n\r\ncost  of  upkeep of second-class beds.

Goode):</b> Sir, I move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Bill, Sir, to assist the police in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  secret  society  gangsters.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfortunately   notorious  that   secret   society\r\n\r\ngangsters here in Singapore depend on violence, or\r\n\r\nthe  threat  of violence, for their existence  and\r\n\r\nfor  their  power over the unfortunate people  who\r\n\r\nget into their clutches. They get their funds by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreats, and to be effective, threats have got  to\r\n\r\nbe  backed up by deeds. So it is that victims  who\r\n\r\nfail   to   pay   extortion  money  are   brutally\r\n\r\nassaulted,  stabbed  and even  murdered.  Further,\r\n\r\nthese  gangs have to fight for their own existence\r\n\r\nin the jungle war that goes on between rival gangs\r\n\r\nto   secure   control  of  particular  places   or\r\n\r\nparticular  rackets.  Before  the  recent   police\r\n\r\ncampaign  against  secret  societies,  these  gang\r\n\r\nfights  and  threats  of gang fights  were  almost\r\n\r\ndaily occurrences. In the three months April,  May\r\n\r\nand June, there were no less than 70 occasions  on\r\n\r\nwhich  there was either a gang fight or the threat\r\n\r\nof  a  gang fight, and in these fights, as I think\r\n\r\nit is well known, all sorts of vicious weapons are\r\n\r\nused - knives,   bottles,  knuckledusters,   bicycle\r\n\r\nchains,  iron  bars  and other  such  things.  The\r\n\r\nvictims are very often assaulted in the dark or in\r\n\r\na  crowded public place where the thugs can easily\r\n\r\nmake  their  escape. But it does  very  frequently\r\n\r\nhappen that the police, getting information that a\r\n\r\ngang  fight  is about to take place, are  able  to\r\n\r\narrive at the scene and prevent the fight actually\r\n\r\ndeveloping, even though the strong-armed thugs are\r\n\r\nthere  with their weapons ready. But if no  breach\r\n\r\nof  the  peace has actually occurred,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to charge these thugs in court, and it is\r\n\r\nto  remedy  that  difficulty  that  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nbrought to the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will make it an offence to carry,\r\n\r\nwithout  lawful authority or reasonable excuse,  a\r\n\r\nknife  over 2\u00bd inches long or any other offensive\r\n\r\nweapon.  That means that if the police can  arrest\r\n\r\nthese thugs who have gathered for a gang fight and\r\n\r\nfind  them in possession of these vicious weapons,\r\n\r\nthey will be able to charge them in court and,  on\r\n\r\nconviction,   have  them  sent  to  prison.   Now,\r\n\r\nunfortunately in these affrays we do not get  much\r\n\r\nhelp from the victims or even from bystanders  who\r\n\r\nmay   witness   what  is  going  on.   They   are,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, too frightened of the brutal  power\r\n\r\nof  the  secret  society gangs to  come  and  give\r\n\r\nevidence in court, and in order to help successful\r\n\r\nprosecution, this Bill therefore puts  the  burden\r\n\r\nof  proof on an accused person to explain  why  he\r\n\r\nwas  carrying a weapon at that particular time and\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, that any measure designed to\r\n\r\nassist  the police in dealing with this menace  of\r\n\r\ngangsterism will command the full support of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  of  the public. But  it  may  be  that\r\n\r\nMembers feel some uneasiness that innocent persons\r\n\r\nmay   be   put  in  jeopardy  by  the  presumption\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Bill making it necessary  for  a\r\n\r\nperson, found  in  possession  of  one  of  these\r\n\r\nweapons  in a public place, to explain his  lawful\r\n\r\nauthority  or reasonable excuse for carrying  that\r\n\r\nweapon. I trust, Sir, that this uneasiness is  not\r\n\r\nreally justified. After all, an accused person  in\r\n\r\nthose  circumstances has only got to show that  he\r\n\r\nhas  some reasonable cause to be carrying a knife.\r\n\r\nFew  of the weapons that we have in mind are  such\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  not themselves  raise  a  strong\r\n\r\npresumption of malicious purpose; but in the event\r\n\r\nof  a  law-abiding citizen being found carrying  a\r\n\r\nknife in a public place, he has only to show  that\r\n\r\nhe  had some reasonable cause to be carrying  that\r\n\r\nknife,  for  example, that he  needed  it  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of his business, or that he was on his  way\r\n\r\nto  use  it for some lawful purpose, and  he  must\r\n\r\nthen  be  released.  I would hope,  Sir,  that  we\r\n\r\ncould, with confidence, rely on the police and the\r\n\r\ncourts   to  judge,  on  the  evidence   and   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  whether or not a  person  carrying\r\n\r\none  of  these weapons had discharged his duty  of\r\n\r\nexplaining  why.  I myself, Sir, will  have  every\r\n\r\nconfidence  that we can confidently  rely  on  the\r\n\r\ncourts to safeguard the liberty of the law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizen.  It  seems  to me that provided  innocent\r\n\r\npersons  do not go round carrying weapons of  this\r\n\r\nsort  without good reason, then they have  nothing\r\n\r\nto  fear  from  this Bill. Much, of  course,  will\r\n\r\ndepend   on  the  circumstances,  and  should   it\r\n\r\nunfortunately  be the practice  for  a  number  of\r\n\r\npersons to carry knives about with them, by day or\r\n\r\neven  by  night, for no proper purpose, then  they\r\n\r\nmust stop doing so. I think it is right and proper\r\n\r\nthat people should not be in the habit of carrying\r\n\r\nknives on their persons for presumably the purpose\r\n\r\nof attacking other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, even if there is some uneasiness and\r\n\r\neven  if some embarrassment or indignity is caused\r\n\r\nto the law-abiding citizen by being called upon to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplain why he is carrying a weapon, then I  would\r\n\r\nurge that that should be accepted in good part  as\r\n\r\na  small  price  to pay for helping  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nstreets  and public places free from these violent\r\n\r\nand often deadly affrays and for, making them safe\r\n\r\nfor the law-abiding citizen to go about his lawful\r\n\r\noccasions  without  fear for  his  person  or  his\r\n\r\nproperty. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen this Bill was received by\r\n\r\nme  I  indeed felt very uneasy about  it.  I  have\r\n\r\nheard  the  explanation  by  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  about the type of people the Government\r\n\r\nis  after. We do want to support the Government in\r\n\r\nany  measures against unlawfulness,  but  we  must\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind  that  we must always  protect  the\r\n\r\ninnocent people and, wherever possible, to exclude\r\n\r\nthem from any inconvenience. This Bill, when it is\r\n\r\npassed, will make the police the sole authority to\r\n\r\ndetermine whether a person is, in fact, guilty  or\r\n\r\nnot  guilty of the offence. New section 24 (1)   of\r\n\r\nthe Minor Offences Ordinance reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any person who without lawful authority or\r\n\r\nreasonable excuse the proof whereof shall  lie  on\r\n\r\nhim has with him any knife or offensive weapon  in\r\n\r\nany public road...\" shall be guilty of the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of lawful authority, it would be\r\n\r\ndifficult to imagine that any person who carries a\r\n\r\nweapon  would want a permit from the police.  That\r\n\r\nrules out \"lawful authority\". The term \"reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse\" can be interpreted in many different  ways\r\n\r\nby different people. Is it reasonable for a person\r\n\r\nto carry a knife in an omnibus after he has bought\r\n\r\nit?  If  a  policeman should find that  he  has  a\r\n\r\nknife, the first thing he would do is to haul that\r\n\r\nperson  into  a police station and thereafter  the\r\n\r\npoor chap will have a lot of explanations to make.\r\n\r\nI am thinking particularly of those people who buy\r\n\r\nknives for kitchen purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask Government to look at the problem\r\n\r\nfrom this angle: that a person with a knife on him\r\n\r\ndoes not necessarily mean that he will want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncause some other people voluntary hurt; but  if  a\r\n\r\nperson has a knife concealed on him, then there is\r\n\r\nreasonable  suspicion that  that  knife  is  being\r\n\r\ncarried for unlawful purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there are many people in Singapore who\r\n\r\nhave  to carry knives about in the course of their\r\n\r\nwork.  I cite the case of Harbour Board labourers.\r\n\r\nIn the process of loading or unloading, they might\r\n\r\nhave  to cut boards or string or ropes with  their\r\n\r\nknives  which, I would say, are necessarily  of  a\r\n\r\nlength  of  2\u00bd inches or a bit more. Such  knives\r\n\r\nare  usually  carried about by the labourers  with\r\n\r\ntheir bunches of keys and other working tools, and\r\n\r\nit  would be difficult for the person concerned to\r\n\r\ndetach  his knife when he is not on duty. Probably\r\n\r\nbecause  of  long habit, he might be carrying  the\r\n\r\nknife with him and he may be arrested off duty.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  Bill is going to put  such  types  of\r\n\r\npeople  to a great deal of inconvenience.  If  the\r\n\r\nBill,  however, is passed and the spirit in  which\r\n\r\nit  is passed is not clearly stated to the police,\r\n\r\nwhat  I am afraid of is that there will be a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of petty tyranny. That should be avoided  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible in order that the right  of  the\r\n\r\ninnocent  citizen to go about his lawful  business\r\n\r\nis safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish to elaborate a little on the\r\n\r\npoint  raised by the Member for Serangoon. I think\r\n\r\nthere are very few in this Assembly who have  much\r\n\r\nintimate knowledge of workers as to how they work.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of workers in Singapore who do\r\n\r\ncarry,  for the purposes of their work, a whistle,\r\n\r\na  knife and a long needle and these people can be\r\n\r\nfound in the Havelock, Tanjong Pagar and the  Boat\r\n\r\nQuay, Telok Ayer, areas. If the Bill is passed  as\r\n\r\nit  is, thousands of workers can be stopped by the\r\n\r\npolice  and  taken to police stations  and,  after\r\n\r\ngiving their explanations, they may or may not  be\r\n\r\nreleased.  We do not know, but they  may  even  be\r\n\r\nharassed.  What  is  the protection  provided  for\r\n\r\nthese thousands of honest workers in this Bill?  I\r\n\r\nam  not against the spirit of the Bill, but I want\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief Secretary to tell  us  how  these\r\n\r\nworkers  can  be  protected from arrest  and  from\r\n\r\nbeing disturbed by the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nat first glance this Bill appears to\r\n\r\nbe  very onerous on the public in that the onus is\r\n\r\nnow  thrown  on the person carrying a knife  in  a\r\n\r\npublic  place  to  prove a reasonable  excuse  for\r\n\r\nhaving  that knife with him. In view, however,  of\r\n\r\nthe  explanation  given  by  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  that this Bill is required  because  of\r\n\r\nthe   recent  violent  outbreaks  by  the   secret\r\n\r\nsocieties  in the form of extortion,  gang  fights\r\n\r\nand  intimidation, I do not think we should oppose\r\n\r\nthe passage of the Bill, except to warn Government\r\n\r\nthat, being given such wide powers, it should  use\r\n\r\nthem wisely and carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to draw the attention of the  previous\r\n\r\nspeakers to the definition of \"knife\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"'knife' means any knife whether clasp knife or\r\n\r\notherwise, the blade of which is more than two and\r\n\r\na  half inches in length and which is capable,  in\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  of  the Court, of being  used  as  a\r\n\r\nstabbing  or  cutting instrument and includes  any\r\n\r\nsword, dagger, blade or similar instrument adapted\r\n\r\nfor use as a cutting or stabbing instrument;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  does  not  mean  that if you  carry  a  pocket\r\n\r\npenknife, you will be charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, after having heard the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Telok Ayer, it seems that they\r\n\r\ndo  not  have sufficient confidence in the  police\r\n\r\nforce.  We  should have confidence in  our  police\r\n\r\nforce.  We should also assume that members of  the\r\n\r\npolice  force are intelligent enough not to arrest\r\n\r\npersons,  ordinarily  good  citizens,  carrying  a\r\n\r\nlittle knife in their pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

So\r\n\r\nthere is no reason why there should be any fear in\r\n\r\nanybody's heart that the police will not act  with\r\n\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Secretary, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I would, in reply, like to say\r\n\r\nthat  we  on  this side of the House do  have  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  sympathy for some of the expressions  of\r\n\r\nuneasiness  which have been raised  by  the  other\r\n\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon spoke of the word\r\n\r\n\"inconvenience\". I think, in my speech moving this\r\n\r\nBill,  I did say that I hoped inconvenience  would\r\n\r\nbe  accepted.  But it is not only the  police  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  judges. After all, if a  person  is\r\n\r\narrested,  he  has  also  the  courts  which  will\r\n\r\nconsider his case. I have no doubt, as I have said\r\n\r\nin moving my motion, that the courts will be quick\r\n\r\nto   safeguard  the  liberties  of  the   innocent\r\n\r\ncitizen.  Most of the examples which were  quoted,\r\n\r\nsuch  as labourers who need knives for their work,\r\n\r\nand who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay be going to or from their work, would, I hope,\r\n\r\nbe   quite  clearly  covered  by  the  \"reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse\" which is given in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may perhaps comfort Members if I inform the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  we have taken the substance  of  this\r\n\r\nprovision   from  Ceylon.  The  Ceylon  Government\r\n\r\nintroduced,  quite  a  number  of  years  ago,  .a\r\n\r\nsimilar   provision   in  their   Minor   Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and at that time they specified a blade\r\n\r\nlength  of  3\u00bd inches in a knife. We  are  advised\r\n\r\nfrom  Ceylon that that provision had an  extremely\r\n\r\ngood  effect  on decreasing the use of  knives  by\r\n\r\ncriminals, and their experience was such that they\r\n\r\nhave  since  amended  their law  and  reduced  the\r\n\r\nlength  of  the knife to two inches, which  is  an\r\n\r\neven  shorter length than that we are giving here.\r\n\r\nIt  would  appear, from what we  can  gather  from\r\n\r\nCeylon, that the police have not abused the  power\r\n\r\nand  that  it has achieved its effect in  stopping\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  knives and other  weapons  in  these\r\n\r\nbrawls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally we would like, if we could, to meet\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  points which have been raised.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  it  was suggested that we should  relate\r\n\r\nthe  offence only to a concealed weapon, but I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that would raise great difficulties because\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see  how we could define  \"concealed\".\r\n\r\nWould  a weapon carried in a pocket or in a sheath\r\n\r\nor  on  a  belt be concealed or not? I would  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that it would be concealed, so that  if,  by\r\n\r\nputting  in \"concealed\", you still brought  within\r\n\r\nthe  law weapons carried in pockets or sheaths  or\r\n\r\non belts or under jackets, you would not, in fact,\r\n\r\nmake any very tangible change in the position. But\r\n\r\nI think all I can do, Sir, is to give an assurance\r\n\r\nto the House that the police will be instructed to\r\n\r\nuse  every endeavour to see that this power is not\r\n\r\nused  to  harass  innocent citizens  or  to  cause\r\n\r\nvexation. The power is given to them to deal  with\r\n\r\nsecret   society  gangsters,  and  it  should   be\r\n\r\ndirected at them; and I have every confidence they\r\n\r\nwill  do  that.  In the event of there  being  any\r\n\r\nabuse  of  the  power, I am sure  that  both  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers here and the courts will raise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplaints of which we shall take notice.

As Members of  the  House  are\r\n\r\nprobably  aware,  the Criminal Justice  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Ordinance was enacted last  year  for\r\n\r\nthe   special  purpose  of  dealing  with   secret\r\n\r\nsocieties  and gangsters, and its main  provisions\r\n\r\nwere  that when a member of a secret society or  a\r\n\r\nperson  connected with a secret society  has  been\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  one of the offences listed  in  the\r\n\r\nFirst Schedule, then the courts may sentence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim either to corrective training or to preventive\r\n\r\ndetention,  taking  into  account  the   age   and\r\n\r\npossibilities of reforming the person concerned or\r\n\r\nthe  need to prevent him from continuing to  be  a\r\n\r\nmenace to his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Ordinance lists the offences\r\n\r\nfor  which those sentences can be imposed  by  the\r\n\r\ncourts, but it omits from that list the offence of\r\n\r\ncriminal  intimidation under section  506  of  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code. This is a patent omission in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith secret societies because intimidation is  the\r\n\r\nprimary activity and, indeed, the lifeblood of the\r\n\r\nsecret societies. They depend for their existence,\r\n\r\nfor their funds, on getting money by extortion  or\r\n\r\nby  protection  money exacted  from  taxi-drivers,\r\n\r\nstall-holders,  hawkers and  all  sorts  of  other\r\n\r\npeople.  The members of secret societies  threaten\r\n\r\nthose  persons  with injury to  themselves  or  to\r\n\r\ntheir property unless the money is paid over,  and\r\n\r\nthat,  of  course,  is precisely  the  meaning  of\r\n\r\n\"criminal   intimidation\".   So   this   Bill   is\r\n\r\nintroduced,  Sir, to include criminal intimidation\r\n\r\nin the Schedule to the Criminal Justice (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make a\r\n\r\nsmall  correction in the Bill to bring  it  up  to\r\n\r\ndate.  Paragraph (g)  of the First Schedule  refers\r\n\r\nto  two Emergency regulations which were in  force\r\n\r\nwhen   the   Bill   was  enacted.  The   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations have now lapsed and this amending Bill\r\n\r\nsubstitutes  a  reference  to  section  7  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  has  replaced Emergency Regulation  4,  and\r\n\r\nthereby  brings the Ordinance up to date with  the\r\n\r\nlaw as it now is.

Section 3 of that Ordinance provides  that\r\n\r\nthe  Trustees  of the Fund shall be a  corporation\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  the  persons for  the  time  being\r\n\r\ndischarging the duties of the Chief Secretary, the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary, the President  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, and two persons not in the service of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from  time to time  appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered undesirable that Ministers\r\n\r\nshould  serve on statutory bodies which are  under\r\n\r\nthe   aegis   of  another  Minister.

Hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalcolm  MacDonald,  with a generous  donation  of\r\n\r\n$5,000, opened a fund for a very practical and yet\r\n\r\nimaginative  purpose. That purpose,  Sir,  was  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  Singapore Youth Sports Centre  where\r\n\r\nyoung  people of every race and creed  could  meet\r\n\r\ntogether  for sport and friendship. In  suggesting\r\n\r\nthe   establishment  of  the  Sports  Centre,  Mr\r\n\r\nMacDonald  pointed out that Malayans were  already\r\n\r\ndistinguishing themselves in many fields of  sport\r\n\r\nand  athletics and that some of their  names  were\r\n\r\nknown throughout the world. Mr MacDonald went  on\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If our school children can have expert training\r\n\r\nin   many  such  activities,  their  standards  of\r\n\r\nattainment  will  be high. I think  of  the  youth\r\n\r\ncentre  as  a  place where capable instructors  in\r\n\r\nvarious  branches of sport would  train  boys  and\r\n\r\ngirls to be healthy in body and therefore also  in\r\n\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days after Mr MacDonald had made his\r\n\r\ndonation, an Appeal Committee was set up to manage\r\n\r\nthe  fund and the public were invited to subscribe\r\n\r\nto   it.   The  Singapore  public  has   responded\r\n\r\nmagnificently  to  the appeal for  funds  and  the\r\n\r\ntotal   collected  now  amounts  to  approximately\r\n\r\n$300,000.  The  City  Council  has  undertaken  to\r\n\r\ndonate 50 cents for every dollar subscribed by the\r\n\r\npublic   up   to   a  maximum  of  $150,000.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir, for its part,  has  donated  the\r\n\r\nKallang  Terminal Building together with 13  acres\r\n\r\nof  land  to  the centre. The total value  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding and land is estimated to be $2,500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after consultation with the Appeal\r\n\r\nCommittee, it was decided that the setting-up of a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board would be the most  efficient  and\r\n\r\nsuitable  way of managing the fund and  organising\r\n\r\nthe  centre. The Bill before this House  today  is\r\n\r\ndesigned to effect this. It provides the machinery\r\n\r\nfor  the establishment, construction, conduct  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the Singapore Youth Sports Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to describe\r\n\r\nthe Bill clause by clause as this has already been\r\n\r\ndone  very fully in the Explanatory Note  attached\r\n\r\nto  the Bill. But before I conclude, Sir, I should\r\n\r\nlike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto pay tribute to the hard work done by the Appeal\r\n\r\nCommittee.

Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the objects\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  are commendable.  It  is  one  way\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  youth of Singapore  may  be  brought\r\n\r\ntogether on the same sports field so that they can\r\n\r\nmix  with  one  another  freely  and  be  able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   one  another  more  thoroughly;   but\r\n\r\nlooking  through this Bill, I find there are  many\r\n\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the youth leaders in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nfirst  time that I knew of the existence  of  this\r\n\r\nBill was when it was brought up for First Reading.\r\n\r\nThe  second  time that I knew about the  Bill  was\r\n\r\nwhen  it  was sent to me by the Assembly. I  bring\r\n\r\nthis  point  to  the notice of the Assembly,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause,  since  this Bill is  to  be  called  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Youth Sports Centre Incorporation  Bill,\r\n\r\nthe accent on it should be youth; and if the youth\r\n\r\norganisations   of   Singapore   are   not   fully\r\n\r\nconsulted,  then I say that those who have  framed\r\n\r\nthis   Bill  have  overlooked  the  necessity   of\r\n\r\nbringing   all  youth  organisations  into   their\r\n\r\nconfidence and getting the best ideas from them so\r\n\r\nthat  there might be better cooperation later  on.\r\n\r\nYou   might  have  a  good  centre  providing  all\r\n\r\nfacilities for the youth of Singapore, but  unless\r\n\r\nthere  is going to be cooperation from all  sides,\r\n\r\nit might turn out to be a white elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of money that is going to be expended\r\n\r\non  this  Youth Sports Centre is in the region  of\r\n\r\nhalf a million dollars up to date, and it will  be\r\n\r\na  pity  if this centre is going to cater for  the\r\n\r\nneeds of only those who live around it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at clause 3 (4) of the Bill and I find\r\n\r\nthat the Board of Management shall consist of  two\r\n\r\nmembers nominated by the City Council; two by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education; two by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Welfare; one member nominated  by  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary; one member by the  Singapore\r\n\r\nChamber of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommerce, one  member by the Chinese  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce;  one  member by the  Indian  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce;  and one member by the Malay Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce. Only under paragraph (e)  can I find  two\r\n\r\nmembers  nominated by the Singapore Youth Council.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  going to be an institution  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  youth, then we must have  people  who\r\n\r\nunderstand  youth. We must have  people  who  have\r\n\r\nworked for youth and know the needs of youth;  but\r\n\r\ninstead of that, I find that we have on the  Board\r\n\r\nmore people who are interested either in their own\r\n\r\nbusiness or just interested in making more  money.\r\n\r\nThat  is  going to be a very serious setback.  The\r\n\r\nyouth  leaders of today are not young people under\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 16 or 21. In fact, most of  them  are\r\n\r\nwell over their 30's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Like the World Assembly of Youth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, and they are people who\r\n\r\nare  capable of managing their own affairs. If  it\r\n\r\nis   to  be  an  institution  for  the  youth   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, then youth leaders must be brought into\r\n\r\nthis  Board to manage their own affairs, to  voice\r\n\r\ntheir  opinions, and to plan programmes that  will\r\n\r\nbe acceptable to the young people of Singapore. If\r\n\r\nclause  3 (4)  is allowed to stand, we will have  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of old people trying to  manage  the\r\n\r\naffairs of the young. Old people sometimes may  be\r\n\r\ngood   in  the  sense  that  they  may  have  some\r\n\r\ninfluence and they can rake in the money  that  is\r\n\r\nrequired  for setting up this sports  centre:  but\r\n\r\napart  from  that, I do not think they  understand\r\n\r\nthe needs of the young people thoroughly. Probably\r\n\r\nnomination  on  to  this Board  will  just  add  a\r\n\r\nfeather  to their cap, but apart from that,  their\r\n\r\ncontributions   towards  the  promotion   of   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of this youth centre will  not  be  as\r\n\r\nthey should be, nor will the progress made be  so.\r\n\r\nI  suggest there must be amendments to this clause\r\n\r\nto  allow  for greater participation by recognised\r\n\r\nyouth leaders of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about training and ordinary\r\n\r\nactivities, I think if the Youth Sports Centre  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  cater for ordinary sports, it will  not\r\n\r\nachieve  that object. In fact, there are  so  many\r\n\r\npeople  living so far away from the sports  centre\r\n\r\nthat it may not be possible or convenient for them\r\n\r\nto  come  down to the centre to take part  in  its\r\n\r\nactivities. If that is one of the objects  of  the\r\n\r\nyouth  centre,  then  I  consider  that  it   will\r\n\r\nprobably  degenerate into one of  the  many  other\r\n\r\nyouth  organisations, instead of one that is above\r\n\r\nall this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the fear of many youth\r\n\r\norganisations  that, with the facilities  afforded\r\n\r\nby  this  Youth  Sports Centre, it  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndamaging  to them because they may not  have  that\r\n\r\nmuch of facilities to offer to their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of training, we cannot train all\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore. There  is  only  a  limited\r\n\r\nnumber of coaches and if promising young men queue\r\n\r\nup  for training, in all probability they will  be\r\n\r\nserved on two or three occasions in a year's time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if this Bill is going to be for\r\n\r\nthe  good of the young people of Singapore,  youth\r\n\r\nmovements must be consulted, and I would recommend\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill be committed to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nso  that  more views may be collected from  people\r\n\r\ninterested  in  youth work and not  interested  in\r\n\r\njust making money. Further, if those youth leaders\r\n\r\nwho  have  shown themselves to be responsible  and\r\n\r\ncapable  are given this work, I believe they  will\r\n\r\ndo  the  job much better than a few of the  people\r\n\r\nwho  have been nominated to the Board. I hope that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  will  give  this  Bill   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration  and  put it into  the  hands  of  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Sir,  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will recall that the McNeice  Report  was\r\n\r\npresented to this Assembly on 8th February,  1956,\r\n\r\nas  Sessional  Paper Cmd. No. 10 of 1956.  I  feel\r\n\r\nsure  that hon. Members will agree that much  work\r\n\r\nhad  been  put  into it to provide  an  exhaustive\r\n\r\nexamination of a complex problem and that  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  very valuable contribution to the  future\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the local government  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Assembly sitting on 4th April, 1956, my\r\n\r\nhon. Colleague the Chief Secretary stated that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  accepted the basic principles  of  the\r\n\r\nReport  and  that  a White Paper would  be  tabled\r\n\r\nbefore  the  June  sitting of the  Assembly.  This\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper, which is a statement of Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  with  regard  to the  McNeice  Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations, was presented to this Assembly on\r\n\r\n2nd June, 1956, as Sessional Paper Cmd. No. 30  of\r\n\r\n1956.  In  accepting the basic principles  of  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice Report, the Government is convinced that a\r\n\r\nmore  democratic framework should  be  set  up  in\r\n\r\nwhich greater opportunities will be afforded to  a\r\n\r\nlarger  number of the community to  take  part  in\r\n\r\nLocal government administration, which would never\r\n\r\nhave been possible under the concept of a City and\r\n\r\nIsland   Council,  as  proposed  by   the   Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitutional Commission, to be the only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal government authority with jurisdiction  over\r\n\r\nthe  whole  island of Singapore. It  endorses  the\r\n\r\nview,  Sir,  of  the McNeice Committee  \"that  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic opportunities offered by the  existence\r\n\r\nof  five  elected local authorities  significantly\r\n\r\noutweigh the advantages of centralisation.\" As can\r\n\r\nbe  seen  in Chapter II of the Report, the McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee  has adduced very strong arguments why\r\n\r\nthe  basic  pattern  of  future  local  government\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  City Council  and  four  District\r\n\r\nCouncils. This basic pattern brings the public  in\r\n\r\ndifferent parts of the island into closer and more\r\n\r\nintimate  touch  with  local  government   bodies,\r\n\r\nwhereas a single local authority on an all-island-wide  basis  could  become an impersonal  body  to\r\n\r\npeople living in areas on the island far away from\r\n\r\nthe  centre of activity. As the McNeice  Committee\r\n\r\npointed out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There are few similarities, so far as.\r\n\r\ngovernment is concerned, between the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  farmer in Lim Chu Kang and the shopkeeper  in\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer  or  between  the  fisherman  of  Ayer\r\n\r\nGemuruh and the clerk in Queenstown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This new basic pattern also extends to the citizen\r\n\r\na  greater  opportunity to be of  service  to  his\r\n\r\nfellow-men.  I  would  also  like  to  quote   the\r\n\r\nfollowing words of the Committee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are, moreover, in greater doubt than the\r\n\r\nCommission  (the  Rendel  Commission)  about   the\r\n\r\npolitical advisability of constituting an  Island-wide  authority in addition to central  government\r\n\r\nand  investing it with wide powers, and  financial\r\n\r\nresources  which might well, at some future  time,\r\n\r\nweigh   more  heavily  than  those  of  Government\r\n\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  Government has no doubt whatever that it  is\r\n\r\npolitically  inadvisable to have such  an  island-wide authority on this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as stated in the White Paper, Government has\r\n\r\naccepted  the  majority of the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe   McNeice   Report,   in   some   cases   with\r\n\r\nmodifications   and   reservations.   There   are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  a  number of recommendations which  have\r\n\r\nnot   been  accepted,  and  in  place  of   these,\r\n\r\nalternative proposals are made. From a perusal  of\r\n\r\nthe White\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPaper, hon. Members will have known which of these\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been accepted by  Government,\r\n\r\nwith or without modifications, and which have  not\r\n\r\nbeen accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is largely an adaptation of the\r\n\r\nexisting  Municipal Ordinance in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  statement of Government policy  contained  in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper. The opportunity has  also  been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  make certain changes which will  remove\r\n\r\ndifficulties encountered in administering the  law\r\n\r\nand  improve certain procedures found to have been\r\n\r\ndefective. Care has been taken to make only  those\r\n\r\nchanges of the law which are not considered likely\r\n\r\nto prove controversial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note attached to the Bill is\r\n\r\ngiven  at some length and draws attention  to  the\r\n\r\nmore  important of the changes referred to in  the\r\n\r\npreceding  paragraph  as  well  as  to  the  major\r\n\r\nchanges required by the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, however, at this stage, to draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of hon. Members to some of the more\r\n\r\nimportant features of this Bill. The provisions of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill extend only to Singapore Island and  to\r\n\r\nthe smaller islands to the north of Singapore,  as\r\n\r\nGovernment  agrees with the views of  the  McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee   that   the  responsibility   for   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  Southern  Islands  should\r\n\r\nremain   with   the   Central   Government.    The\r\n\r\nadministration  of  these  Southern  Islands  will\r\n\r\naccordingly  be  taken over by  Government,  which\r\n\r\nfeels, however, that consideration should be given\r\n\r\nto  any future demand arising from some or all  of\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands to be amalgamated into one or\r\n\r\nother of the District Council areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions made in the Bill\r\n\r\nfor the constitution of the new local authorities,\r\n\r\nI  am  confident that Members will agree that  the\r\n\r\nnew  proposals  for the City Council  are  a  far-reaching  advance on the present  constitution  of\r\n\r\nthat  body, and that the constitution as  proposed\r\n\r\nfor  the  District Councils for an initial  period\r\n\r\nwill be best in the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the present City Council, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich  consists  of an official as  President,  18\r\n\r\nelected  Members and 9 nominated Councillors,  the\r\n\r\nCity   Council   will  have  a   totally   elected\r\n\r\nmembership of 32 Councillors one of whom they will\r\n\r\nelect  annually  to the office of Mayor  with  the\r\n\r\nright  of  re-election. The intention is that  one\r\n\r\nCouncillor will represent one constituency, making\r\n\r\n32  constituencies in all, and not, as at present,\r\n\r\nsix electoral wards returning 18 elected Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Council will have an official\r\n\r\nChairman,  12  elected  Councillors  and,  for  an\r\n\r\ninitial period of 4 years, 3 nominated Councillors\r\n\r\nas  well.  It is considered that, as the  District\r\n\r\nCouncils  will be new bodies in the  rural  areas,\r\n\r\nwhere   the   constitution  of  local   government\r\n\r\nauthority was limited in the past, and as the work\r\n\r\nand  responsibility  of  these  councils  will  be\r\n\r\nconsiderable,  it  would  be  appropriate  for   a\r\n\r\nstrictly  limited period to include  some  persons\r\n\r\nwith   experience  in  the  management  of   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  affairs  to the  membership  of  these\r\n\r\ncouncils. The reasons, Sir, for the appointment of\r\n\r\nan official as Chairman during this initial period\r\n\r\nare,  to  quote  the words again  of  the  McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have said that membership of a local\r\n\r\nauthority  is  a  job to be learned  and  this  is\r\n\r\ndoubly so in relation to the position of Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe  experience  required to conduct  meetings  of\r\n\r\ncouncils and to direct the day-to-day business  of\r\n\r\na  local authority is not easily acquired  and  we\r\n\r\nthink it would be unfair and unwise to require  an\r\n\r\nelected  or  nominated member of a rural  district\r\n\r\ncouncil to bear this responsibility in the initial\r\n\r\nperiod.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will note that, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  White Paper, the present Bill has  been\r\n\r\ndrafted  to  allow  the City Council  to  continue\r\n\r\nsupplying  the public utility services  of  water,\r\n\r\ngas  and  electricity on an island-wide basis  for\r\n\r\nthe  present. The matter of the transfer of  these\r\n\r\nservices  to  a  statutory corporation  does  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore, arise at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill preserves the status quo of the\r\n\r\nlocal  authorities with regard to planning  powers\r\n\r\nand  control  of  buildings. Until  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust ceases to exist and a new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthority  set up to replace it, it will  continue\r\n\r\nto  be  the  planning authority for the island  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It has not been possible to establish a\r\n\r\nnew  authority  and prepare legislation  for  this\r\n\r\nauthority  and  for  comprehensive  town  planning\r\n\r\nlegislation at the same time as the present  local\r\n\r\ngovernment   legislation.  In  due  course,   Sir,\r\n\r\nlegislation will be prepared to transfer  planning\r\n\r\npowers  to  local  authorities. In  the  meantime,\r\n\r\nbuilding  control will continue  to  be  exercised\r\n\r\nunder building by-laws by the local authorities in\r\n\r\ntheir respective areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, although in the White Paper it was\r\n\r\nstated that the Government agreed in principle  to\r\n\r\nthe Committee's recommendation that an improvement\r\n\r\nrate  should be levied over the whole  island  and\r\n\r\npaid  into  a fund administered by Government,  in\r\n\r\nthe  present Bill authority is given to  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  to continue to collect this rate  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  area  only under section 22 of the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Ordinance, as long as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  continues  to  exist  and  the\r\n\r\nconditions  which led the Committee  to  make  its\r\n\r\nrecommendation have not yet arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, it was stated in the White Paper that\r\n\r\nGovernment    agreed    with    the    Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendation   that  the  City  Council   should\r\n\r\ncontinue to administer the registration, licensing\r\n\r\nand  mechanical inspections of vehicles on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  all  local  authorities, but has  not  finally\r\n\r\ndecided   whether   the  Registrar   of   Vehicles\r\n\r\nDepartment should remain a City Council department\r\n\r\nor  be  transferred to Government. In the  present\r\n\r\nBill, however, these responsibilities still remain\r\n\r\nwith  the  Registrar of Vehicles as an officer  of\r\n\r\nthe City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the payment of rates by the\r\n\r\nImperial Departments and by this Government, which\r\n\r\nthe   Committee  recommended  and  the  Government\r\n\r\nagreed  to  in  principle, the  present  Bill,  as\r\n\r\ndrafted, continues to exempt them from payment  of\r\n\r\nrates, since this question of payment of rates  by\r\n\r\nthe  Imperial Departments must first be  taken  up\r\n\r\nand agreed with the United Kingdom Government, and\r\n\r\nthe  question of rating the Singapore Government's\r\n\r\nproperty will require more time in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamine  the  full implications of this  proposal.\r\n\r\nAmending legislation, Sir, can be introduced later\r\n\r\nwhen the matter has been settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in the Explanatory Note, provisions\r\n\r\nare  made  for District Councils to be run  during\r\n\r\nthe  interim  period after their  constitution  on\r\n\r\nlines  similar  to  those of  the  present  Board,\r\n\r\nparticularly  with  regard to  finance,  staffing,\r\n\r\nvesting of properties, acquisition and disposal of\r\n\r\nland  and  other immovable property. It  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat for some years to come District Councils will\r\n\r\nnot    be   self-supporting   and   will   require\r\n\r\nsubstantial assistance from the Government in  the\r\n\r\nway  of  capital  expenditure, annual  grants  and\r\n\r\nprovision  of staff. It would be best,  therefore,\r\n\r\nto  start  each council off on Rural Board  lines,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that  the budgets will be  subject  to  a\r\n\r\nmeasure of government control and incorporated  in\r\n\r\nthe Colony estimates. The staff will be Government\r\n\r\nservants and all land vested in or acquired by the\r\n\r\ncouncils  will  be vested in or  acquired  by  the\r\n\r\nCrown  on  their behalf. When these councils  have\r\n\r\nbeen set on their feet and have become financially\r\n\r\nviable, amending legislation will be introduced to\r\n\r\nenable  them  to function independently  like  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council.  I feel sure that this  House  will\r\n\r\nagree with these interim provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitional provisions have also been included\r\n\r\n(see clause 324 of the Bill) which will allow  any\r\n\r\npowers  of  the  existing law to  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nexercised  despite  the repeal  of  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and for the City Council or  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard  to continue to function in respect  of  any\r\n\r\ndefined   area   whenever  it   is   required   by\r\n\r\nadministrative exigencies. In particular, there is\r\n\r\nenabling provision for the Rural Board to continue\r\n\r\nto  perform  its present functions  in  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard   area  in  the  event  of  delay   in   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the District Councils  and,  if\r\n\r\nrequired, to administer those parts of the present\r\n\r\ncity  area  which are to be merged  into  the  new\r\n\r\nDistrict Council areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a transitional provision for the\r\n\r\ndistricts of Bukit Panjang and Jurong to be merged\r\n\r\ninto one district for a prescribed period for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance. This is in keeping, Sir, with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the McNeice Committee that these\r\n\r\ntwo  districts should, in the first  instance,  be\r\n\r\namalgamated  and administered by a single  council\r\n\r\nand  that the municipal centre should be at  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang.  These  two districts are  too  small  in\r\n\r\npopulation to enable them to operate separately at\r\n\r\nthe  present time. Jurong especially,  because  of\r\n\r\nits  small  population, will have a weak financial\r\n\r\nposition at the start, but there can be no  doubt,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the population of these districts  will\r\n\r\ngrow  rapidly in the future so that  they  can  in\r\n\r\ntime   be   administered  by   separate   District\r\n\r\nCouncils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes significant changes in the\r\n\r\nqualifications and disqualifications  relating  to\r\n\r\ncandidates  for election as Councillors.  I  would\r\n\r\ninvite the attention of hon. Members to the  notes\r\n\r\ngiven  at  some  length  in the  Explanatory  Note\r\n\r\ndealing with clauses 21 and 22 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to improve the\r\n\r\narrangements  of  certain  parts  of  the  present\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance  and  to  omit  a  number  of\r\n\r\nprovisions  which it is considered can  be  better\r\n\r\ndealt  with by means of by-laws. At the same time,\r\n\r\nthe  various existing provisions relating  to  the\r\n\r\nmaking of by-laws have been replaced by clause 322\r\n\r\nof  the present Bill and the Sixth Schedule  which\r\n\r\nmay  be varied by the Minister from time to  time.\r\n\r\nEvery  by-law or alteration, amendment or addition\r\n\r\nthereto, cancellation of or substitution therefore\r\n\r\nwill have to be published in the Gazette and shall\r\n\r\nnot  have  effect  unless it is confirmed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister and notice of such confirmation has  been\r\n\r\npublished in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundaries of the new City and District\r\n\r\nCouncils  are  described in the First  and  Second\r\n\r\nSchedules  to  the  Bill.  It  has  been   thought\r\n\r\ndesirable to provide for this detailed description\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  substantial alteration  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  limits of the city that will result  from\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation of local government  envisaged\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill, so that both hon. Members  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  will be fully aware of the changes  to  be\r\n\r\nmade.  Sir,  hon.  Members will  recall  that  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice Committee's boundary proposals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere shown on the map attached to the Report.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  recommended  that  the  city   boundary\r\n\r\nshould  be  extended to the West and withdrawn  in\r\n\r\nthe  East, it also recommended that an  Electoral\r\n\r\nBoundaries' Delimitation Committee be appointed to\r\n\r\ndefine  exact boundaries for the local  government\r\n\r\ndistricts  and  electoral  divisions,   and   that\r\n\r\nelectoral boundaries for the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nshould  be  adjusted  so  that  a  common  set  of\r\n\r\nboundaries could serve all electoral purposes. The\r\n\r\nlatter  Committee was duly appointed, and  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper Government stated that it accepted the\r\n\r\nrecommendations which this Committee made for  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  of the local government  areas.  These\r\n\r\nboundaries were set out in a map attached  to  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper. The White Paper map also showed where\r\n\r\nthese  boundaries differed from those proposed  by\r\n\r\nthe  McNeice Committee. It was pointed  out,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  boundaries as proposed by  the  McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee  did not conform to existing Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  electoral  divisional  boundaries.   The\r\n\r\nElectoral   Boundaries'  Delimitation  Committee's\r\n\r\nboundary  proposals have kept  as  close  as  they\r\n\r\npossibly  could to the boundary proposals  of  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice   Committee,  while  at  the   same   time\r\n\r\nfollowing   the   boundaries   of   the    present\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  electoral   districts   as\r\n\r\nclosely  as  possible.  Sir,  Chapter  IV  of  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice   Report  contains  the  views   of   that\r\n\r\nCommittee  with regard to its boundary  proposals.\r\n\r\nIt  will be seen that it has taken the Master Plan\r\n\r\nproposals into consideration in its deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt  is  true  that  this plan  has  not  yet  been\r\n\r\napproved by Government, but it can be safely  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  general principles governing the  Plan,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  product of some  years  of  expert\r\n\r\nstudy,  aided by the valuable work of a number  of\r\n\r\ncompetent  study groups and working parties,  have\r\n\r\nwon general acceptance since its publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to say that, by giving a\r\n\r\ndetailed  description of the new local  government\r\n\r\nareas  in the First and Second Schedules  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  both Members of the Assembly and the public\r\n\r\nwill be fully aware of the changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  made. I would like to point out that until\r\n\r\nthe exact boundaries of the city and districts are\r\n\r\nfirst   defined  and  approved  under  the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance, no action can be taken under\r\n\r\nthe   Local  Government  Elections  Ordinance   to\r\n\r\nspecify  the names and boundaries of the electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions  and  to  subdivide the  divisions  into\r\n\r\npolling   districts  for  purposes  of  elections.\r\n\r\nProvision has been made for subsequent alterations\r\n\r\nof  local  government boundaries to be subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  set  out in  section  362  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I have made a somewhat lengthy speech\r\n\r\nwhich was unavoidable owing to the very nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  I  have tried, for the most  part,  to\r\n\r\nindicate to the House the principles and merits of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. I have, at the same time, tried to avoid\r\n\r\nreferring to matters of detail as far as possible.\r\n\r\nMatters of detail should, of course, be dealt with\r\n\r\nin  the  ordinary way in Committee and it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention  that  after  the   Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  this  Bill,  which  is  of   such   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive nature and of such importance to the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, that it be committed  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee. I am confident, Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nprinciples of the Bill will commend themselves  to\r\n\r\nhon. Members and that they will give this Bill its\r\n\r\nSecond Reading. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was\r\n\r\ndisappointed   when   the   Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands  and  Housing  enumerated   the\r\n\r\ndifferences  between  the Report  of  the  McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  sat on it and the  Bill  itself,\r\n\r\ndisappointed  because, in listing what  he  termed\r\n\r\nthe   \"minor  differences\",  he  had  skated  over\r\n\r\ncertain    important   departures    from    those\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  The most astonishing  departure,\r\n\r\nwhich he has only referred to en passant by asking\r\n\r\nus  to  refer to the Explanatory Note,  is  clause\r\n\r\n21 - Qualifications of candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have nothing against the machinery which\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will set up in so far as they  are  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the advice of experts to  replace\r\n\r\nthe  machinery under the Municipal Ordinance.  But\r\n\r\nwe take strong exception to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe     not    disinterested    \"tailoring\"     of\r\n\r\nqualifications. Under clause 21 (b)   a  person  is\r\n\r\neligible  to  be a candidate \"if  he  is  able  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  and, unless incapacitated by blindness  or\r\n\r\nother  physical cause, to read and  write  with  a\r\n\r\ndegree of proficiency sufficient to enable him  to\r\n\r\ntake an active part in any proceedings as a member\r\n\r\nof   the   local  authority\".  Let  us   see   the\r\n\r\nexplanatory note on clause 21, which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...sets out the qualifications for councillors of\r\n\r\na  local  authority. The most important difference\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of section 6 of the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is in paragraph (b)  of this  clause  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the  present requirement  that  councillors\r\n\r\nmust  be able to speak, read and write the English\r\n\r\nlanguage  is omitted. Paragraph (c)  provides  that\r\n\r\ncandidates for election to the City Council  shall\r\n\r\nbe  resident  in the City and that candidates  for\r\n\r\nelection to District Council shall reside  in  the\r\n\r\ndivision in which they stand for election.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  effect, this means that you can speak  Hebrew,\r\n\r\nyou can speak Urdu, you can speak any language  in\r\n\r\nthe  world,  provided  it is  \"with  a  degree  of\r\n\r\nproficiency sufficient to enable you  to  take  an\r\n\r\nactive part in any proceedings as a member of  the\r\n\r\nlocal authority\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When multi-lingualism was first mooted as a\r\n\r\ndeparture  from  the  sole and  exclusive  use  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  in  the constituted organs of government,\r\n\r\nthose  who opposed the use of vernacular languages\r\n\r\nin  Government  councils used  the  argument  that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  utter  and  absolute  confusion.\r\n\r\nFinally everybody agreed that only certain limited\r\n\r\nand specific languages with the widest use in this\r\n\r\ncolony   would   be  allowed.   Those   were   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the McNeice Committee.  We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  when people are confined  to  speaking\r\n\r\nonly  English,  Malay,  Mandarin,  or  Tamil,  the\r\n\r\nchances are, as far as Mandarin is concerned,  the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation will predominate as  they  are\r\n\r\nthe   persons  educated  and  proficient  in  this\r\n\r\nimportant language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does one then cover up one's intentions? How\r\n\r\ndoes  one overcome what is right in principle  but\r\n\r\nis  inexpedient because it militates against party\r\n\r\ninterests? One does not want to confine it to  the\r\n\r\nMandarin-speaking,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  one's supporters are 83-year old men  who\r\n\r\nspeak  the dialects and not Mandarin! At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  if  one starts enumerating all the  Chinese\r\n\r\ndialects, it might attract unnecessary attention.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  one  blankets the whole  by  remaining\r\n\r\nsilent  on the languages or dialects that  can  be\r\n\r\nspoken.  One puts it in this curious clause  which\r\n\r\nis glossed over, en passant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could perhaps try to justify clause 21 (c)\r\n\r\nthat - although  this  was not  recommended  by  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice Committee and is not the accepted practice\r\n\r\nin  civilised countries - a candidate can only be  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  if he resides in the area. If  you  get\r\n\r\npeople  like the young intellectuals of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nall  grouped  together living in  suburban  areas,\r\n\r\nthen let them stand for election in those suburban\r\n\r\nareas  where they will be defeated. Now  if  young\r\n\r\nmaster  Lee  has to stand for Cairnhill  where  he\r\n\r\nlives, that would fix him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giving way to expediency and abandoning of\r\n\r\nprinciples  is the most disheartening  development\r\n\r\nof  the last six months. I shall have more to  say\r\n\r\non those matters in this session of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this Bill itself I would like to draw\r\n\r\nattention  to certain other points. For  instance,\r\n\r\nin   its  recommendations  the  McNeice  Committee\r\n\r\nagreed  that for the first four years the Chairmen\r\n\r\nof  these District Councils should be appointed by\r\n\r\nthe Governor and that subsequently they should  be\r\n\r\npopularly elected. But there is nothing in  clause\r\n\r\n17,  as  there  is in clause 16, to  say  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  only for the first term.  The  McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee  agreed  that  there  should  be   three\r\n\r\nnominated  members in each council for  the  first\r\n\r\nfour  years, and that limitation is  set  out  in\r\n\r\nclause 16 (1) :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that for the first four years from the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the first ordinary elections held  under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Local Government  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1956, there shall in addition be  three\r\n\r\nnominated councillors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Clear and specific - three nominated councillors for\r\n\r\nfour  years and no more. This limitation for  only\r\n\r\none  four-year  period for  the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Council has been quietly dropped and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  reference  was  made to it when  the  Minister\r\n\r\nexplained  where  this  Bill  departed  from   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  a  Committee  on  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment had the deciding voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in clause 4, the mechanics of varying\r\n\r\nboundaries:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may by notification in the Gazette,\r\n\r\nalter or vary the limits of the City.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a later clause, clause 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may by notification in the Gazette,\r\n\r\nalter or vary the limits of any District.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  if we want to avoid any gerrymandering,  any\r\n\r\nalteration  of boundary lines to suit  whoever  is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and his Party, then let  us  have  a\r\n\r\nBoundaries Commission - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

But I would like to point\r\n\r\nout   that,   although  I  am  not  imputing   any\r\n\r\ndishonourable,  base, vile or selfish  motives  to\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Minister for Local Government, Lands\r\n\r\nand  Housing, I am stating, as a proposition, that\r\n\r\nin  any part of the world, and more especially  in\r\n\r\nthis  part  of  the world, people who  assume  the\r\n\r\nduties  of government are somewhat tempted to  use\r\n\r\nthe  powers with which they are temporarily vested\r\n\r\nto  weight things permanently in their favour.  If\r\n\r\nwe  want  to avoid gerrymandering, the drawing  of\r\n\r\nboundary  lines  to include kampongs  where  one's\r\n\r\nsupporters are and to exclude kampongs where one's\r\n\r\nopponent's  supporters are, then  let  us  have  a\r\n\r\nproper  Boundaries' Commission. Let the  mechanics\r\n\r\nof  it  be  by the Minister notifying  it  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette,  but  let  us  have proper  machinery  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   the   working   of   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  this wholesale importation of  Western\r\n\r\nideas  of political organisation, is not perverted\r\n\r\nby feudalistic Eastern ideas of personal survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to say this on the question\r\n\r\nof disqualification. Clause 22 says, amongst other\r\n\r\nthings,  that a man is disqualified if he  has  in\r\n\r\nany  part of the British Commonwealth (it does not\r\n\r\nmatter if he commits a crime in Indonesia and gets\r\n\r\nsix  years  jail for gun smuggling  or  some  such\r\n\r\ntrivial  crime, but he must not break any rule  in\r\n\r\nany   part  of  the  British  Commonwealth)  \"been\r\n\r\nsentenced to death or to imprisonment by  whatever\r\n\r\nname  called, for a term exceeding six months  and\r\n\r\nhas  not suffered the punishment to which  he  was\r\n\r\nsentenced  or such other punishment as  may  by  a\r\n\r\ncompetent    authority   have   been   substituted\r\n\r\ntherefore or received a free pardon\". This  clause\r\n\r\nis  common form. But I think in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  we ought to say specifically that political\r\n\r\noffences  like sedition, particularly  these  days\r\n\r\nwith  a Government becoming very legalistic  about\r\n\r\noffences like sedition and section 3 of the  Trade\r\n\r\nDisputes    Ordinance,    should    not    be    a\r\n\r\ndisqualification. After all, the man to  whom  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of Singapore sent  a  telegram  of\r\n\r\ncongratulation, came out from prison to become the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Gold Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my hon.\r\n\r\nFriend  and  Colleague  the  Minister  for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing spoke this  morning\r\n\r\non  the  principles and the merits that went  into\r\n\r\nthe  making of this piece of legislation. I  shall\r\n\r\ntherefore  now  content myself with going  briefly\r\n\r\ninto  the details of this Bill so that the salient\r\n\r\npoints  can  be brought forth in this  House.  The\r\n\r\nfinal   details  will,  of  course,  have  to   be\r\n\r\nconsidered in Select Committee later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, is divided into 13 parts and the\r\n\r\nopportunity  has  been taken to rearrange  certain\r\n\r\nparts  of the existing law, which is the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Chapter 133 of the 1936 Edition).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note outlines the principal\r\n\r\nchanges part by part, and in the case of Part  II,\r\n\r\nwhich  contains  the  major  alterations  to   the\r\n\r\nexisting  law, an explanation is given  clause  by\r\n\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Sir, I need add anything to what\r\n\r\nhas been said in the Explanatory Note in regard to\r\n\r\nPart I of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is explained clause by clause as it deals\r\n\r\nwith the new constitution and organisation of  the\r\n\r\nlocal authorities. Hon. Members will read it, I am\r\n\r\nsure,  with  particular interest. In  addition  to\r\n\r\nwhat  has been said in the Explanatory Note,  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  note  that the  present  tenure  of\r\n\r\noffice of City Councillors, namely, 3 years,  with\r\n\r\none-third retirement annually, has been changed to\r\n\r\na  four-year period with half retirement every two\r\n\r\nyears. The Bill also provides that appointments to\r\n\r\ncertain  senior City Council posts shall  only  be\r\n\r\nmade with the concurrence of the Minister and that\r\n\r\nthe  holders of these posts shall not  be  removed\r\n\r\nwithout  the Minister's consent. I would, however,\r\n\r\nrefer  hon.  Members to the views of  the  McNeice\r\n\r\nCommittee on this matter at page 44 of the Report.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  now  makes provision to  preserve  the\r\n\r\nvalidity  of  acts  done  in  his  capacity  as  a\r\n\r\ncouncillor  by a person subsequently found  to  be\r\n\r\ndisqualified.  Provision  is  also  made  for  the\r\n\r\npayment   to  councillors  of  such  remuneration,\r\n\r\nallowances or expenses as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Governor  in  Council  may  direct.  Another\r\n\r\nprovision   prohibits   councillors   from   being\r\n\r\nemployed  by  the local authority  whilst  holding\r\n\r\noffice and for twelve months afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure hon. Members will be pleased to see\r\n\r\nthat provision is made for the appointment by  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council of a Mayor and a Deputy  Mayor,  and\r\n\r\nthis  will  be  the first occasion, when  the  new\r\n\r\nCouncil comes into being, that Singapore will have\r\n\r\na Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part III it will be noted that, in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the White Paper, the  minutes  of\r\n\r\nthe proceedings of meetings of the local authority\r\n\r\nshall  be recorded in English, although it is  not\r\n\r\nobligatory on the part of the councillors to speak\r\n\r\nonly in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 of the Bill now makes it obligatory for\r\n\r\na  local authority to appoint a Finance Committee,\r\n\r\nand  clause 49 gives a local authority  powers  to\r\n\r\ndelegate the exercise of many of its functions  to\r\n\r\ncommittees or to employees. At present,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nlack of these powers in certain cases is hampering\r\n\r\nthe  quick  carrying out of the work of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and  the present system  is  that  every\r\n\r\ndecision of the committee in the City Council  has\r\n\r\nto  go  to  a  full board meeting and consequently\r\n\r\nthere  is  delay  in carrying out  certain  urgent\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part IV, as stated in the Explanatory Note,\r\n\r\nprovision  is made for any public street,  or  any\r\n\r\npart  thereof,  to  be exempted from  the  general\r\n\r\nvesting  in  the local authority by order  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.   This  is  an  enabling  provision   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  White  Paper  statement  of\r\n\r\npolicy   with   regard   to   the   division    of\r\n\r\nresponsibility, in respect of the  main  road  and\r\n\r\ndrainage  systems  in  the  island,  between   the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government and the local  authority.  The\r\n\r\nMinister referred to here, hon. Members will note,\r\n\r\nis the Minister for Communications and Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no additional comments to make on Part V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note states quite clearly and at\r\n\r\nsome  length what the changes in Part  VI  dealing\r\n\r\nwith finance are. I may mention, however, that two\r\n\r\nnew purposes for which a local authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfund  can  be expended are: firstly, provision  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres,  children's social  centres,\r\n\r\ncreches and youth clubs, and of hostels other than\r\n\r\nthose  established by written law. I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon will welcome that provision.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  payments in connection with  visits  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of,  or its employees on behalf  of,  the\r\n\r\nlocal  authority  including travelling  and  other\r\n\r\nexpenses in any part of the world. Clause 71  lays\r\n\r\ndown  how  the Municipal Fund accounts are  to  be\r\n\r\nkept.  I  wish  to  stress  again  that  financial\r\n\r\nprovision regarding District Councils is only  for\r\n\r\nan interim period and amending legislation will be\r\n\r\nintroduced to enable them to budget like the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil when they become fully financially viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to rates and taxes under Part VII, my\r\n\r\nhon.  Friend  and Colleague the Hon. the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  has\r\n\r\nalready made some remarks in his speech. I  would,\r\n\r\nhowever,  point  out  that  the  present  Bill\r\n\r\nreproduces  the  existing law which  provides  for\r\n\r\nexemption  from  rates  of  all  S.I.T. premises\r\n\r\nexcept  premises  used for profit,  and  also  now\r\n\r\nprovides for exemption for all premises, vested in\r\n\r\na  local authority. By clause 111 referred  to  in\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory Note, it will be possible for the\r\n\r\nMinister to order, within a certain period,  after\r\n\r\ndue  consideration, parts of the Rural Board  area\r\n\r\nnow incorporated into the city area, for instance,\r\n\r\nto  be  rated at less than the rate prevailing  in\r\n\r\nthe city, and for any part of the former city area\r\n\r\nincluded in the District Council area to be  rated\r\n\r\nat  more  than  the rate ceiling for the  District\r\n\r\nCouncil. With regard to taxes, in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper which states that all veterinary\r\n\r\nservices should be transferred to Government,  dog\r\n\r\nlicensing has been omitted from the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to what has already been said in the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Note regarding Part VIII which relates\r\n\r\nto  streets, sewers and buildings, I might mention\r\n\r\none  or  two  other  matters. In  clause  144,  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the submission of a plan for a new\r\n\r\nstreet, a local authority is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  empowered to give written directions  to  the\r\n\r\nperson submitting such a plan, for example, on the\r\n\r\nmaterials and construction of a new street and the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  foot-paths in a  new  street.  With\r\n\r\nregard  to  sewers, in accordance with  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper,  provision is made for the City Council  to\r\n\r\nremain in control of, public sewerage on an island-wide  basis, with appropriate charges being levied\r\n\r\non   the  other  local  authorities  for  services\r\n\r\nprovided.  There is provision for the Minister  to\r\n\r\ndirect  the  amount  of contribution  in  case  of\r\n\r\ndisagreement or dispute between the various  local\r\n\r\nauthorities  and the City Council.  In  accordance\r\n\r\nalso  with the White Paper, provision is made  for\r\n\r\nthe division of responsibility for drainage in the\r\n\r\nisland  between  the  Central Government  and  the\r\n\r\nlocal  authorities. Regarding buildings,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe existing provisions are reproduced, with a few\r\n\r\nadditional  ones, as, for instance,  under  clause\r\n\r\n171  (12)   concerning the payment  of  a  sum  not\r\n\r\nexceeding ten times the prescribed fees in respect\r\n\r\nof  submission  of plans in certain circumstances;\r\n\r\nand  clause  173 (2)  with regard to action  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  in  respect  of  unauthorised  erection  of\r\n\r\nbuildings on land vested in the local authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Part IX I have already mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  is  given  power  to  continue\r\n\r\nsupplying water, gas and electricity on an island-wide basis. One important additional provision  of\r\n\r\nnote  here  is  that  under clause  203  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil can now sell and not merely let for  hire,\r\n\r\nwater,   gas   and   electrical   apparatus    and\r\n\r\nappliances,  including  air-conditioning   plants.\r\n\r\nSir, concern has been expressed to me by importers\r\n\r\nand  distributors of air-conditioning  plants  and\r\n\r\nother  electrical appliances in respect  of  these\r\n\r\npowers. I would suggest that the right course  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  take is to make representations  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee when the Bill goes to the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of clauses under Part X, which relates\r\n\r\nto  public health, have been altered to make  them\r\n\r\nmore effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvision  is made for more effective  control  of\r\n\r\nmarkets,  including private markets.  The  control\r\n\r\nand  supervision of burial and  burning  grounds\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  island  are  now  made  a   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  responsibility, whereas previously  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas such control was in the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government. Among those dangerous and\r\n\r\noffensive   trades  which  will  be   subject   to\r\n\r\nlicensing   are   sawmills  and  those   producing\r\n\r\ninjurious or offensive dust or fumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the White Paper, Part XI\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  City Council  to  continue  to\r\n\r\noperate the Fire Brigade on an island-wide  basis,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  expenditure being met proportionately\r\n\r\nby all local authorities. Here again, the decision\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister shall be final in the  event  of\r\n\r\ndisagreement between the local authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part XII, which relates to vehicles, although\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Vehicles is still responsible for\r\n\r\nregistration,   licensing   and   inspection    of\r\n\r\nvehicles,  the  licensing  of  drivers  of  public\r\n\r\nservice vehicles will no longer be carried out  by\r\n\r\nhis  Department,  since  this  function  is  being\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the police in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\npolicy stated in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIII deals with the supplementary provisions\r\n\r\nand, as stated in the Explanatory Note, is largely\r\n\r\na  reproduction  of  Part  XVI  of  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance, with slight alterations in some clauses\r\n\r\nand  with  a few new provisions, as, for  example,\r\n\r\nclause    319   which   provides   that    certain\r\n\r\ninaccuracies   in   documents   shall   not   make\r\n\r\nproceedings invalid for want of form,  and  clause\r\n\r\n320   which  relates  to  the  proving  of   local\r\n\r\nauthority records in legal proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have briefly outlined the details\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Bill, and I hope that  when  the\r\n\r\nBill  goes to Select Committee all those who  have\r\n\r\nviews  to  express  will come forward  before  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I,\r\n\r\nunder  Standing Order 7 (4) , move the  suspension\r\n\r\nof this sitting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That\r\n\r\nthere is need for it brooks no argument but as  it\r\n\r\nis  a  Bill which affects the private citizen more\r\n\r\nintimately  than  perhaps any other  Bill  on  the\r\n\r\nStatute  Book,  it  is clearly important  to  have\r\n\r\nrepresentations  from the public given  a  careful\r\n\r\nhearing by Members of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to speak this afternoon on the\r\n\r\nwhole  Bill.  It  contains  325  clauses  and   an\r\n\r\nexhaustive  examination  of  it  would  be  almost\r\n\r\nimpossible and lengthy. But I would content myself\r\n\r\nwith  consideration of certain points to be  found\r\n\r\nin Parts I to III comprising the first 55 clauses.\r\n\r\nThese  Parts are concerned with what I might  call\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional side of local  government  and\r\n\r\nnot  the side affecting the ratepayer directly and\r\n\r\nyet even in these three Parts, there are points of\r\n\r\nprinciple  which require very careful  examination\r\n\r\nbefore we accept the Government's proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are forging a new instrument for local\r\n\r\ngovernment which we wish to see effective for many\r\n\r\nyears   to   come  and  while  political   Parties\r\n\r\ndoubtless will hold sway in the new councils to be\r\n\r\nset up, the shaping of that instrument seems to me\r\n\r\nto be a matter above Party. With these preliminary\r\n\r\nobservations,  I will proceed to consider  certain\r\n\r\nof  the  clauses in the first three Parts  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in clause 3, Interpretation, I will\r\n\r\nmention  in  passing that the terms \"Chairman\"  \"\r\n\r\nChief Administrative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficer\" and \"Mayor\" are not included and I  think\r\n\r\ntheir importance to local government is such  that\r\n\r\ntheir  status and functions should be  defined  at\r\n\r\nthis stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards clause 5, while it is true\r\n\r\nthat  this  clause cannot become  operative  until\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  becomes law, nevertheless, I  consider\r\n\r\nthat  the attention of the public should be  drawn\r\n\r\nto  the proposed changes in the limits of the city\r\n\r\nboundary  by the method of advertisement  intended\r\n\r\nby  this  clause.  There are one or  two  proposed\r\n\r\nalterations  in the city limits which are  clearly\r\n\r\ncontroversial, namely, the exclusion  of  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  suburban area of Katong and the inclusion  of\r\n\r\nthe  rural area of Ulu Panjang. It is strange,  to\r\n\r\nsay  the  least,  that only  a  few  months  after\r\n\r\nbringing  Katong so much closer to the  centre  of\r\n\r\nthe  city by the opening of the great new  highway\r\n\r\nand  bridge,  there  should  be  contemplated  its\r\n\r\nexclusion  from  the city area  to  which  it  has\r\n\r\nbelonged for so long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that if the residents in the proposed\r\n\r\narea  of the new Katong District Council have read\r\n\r\nclause 110 (3)  of this Bill, they will perhaps not\r\n\r\nobject  to  banishment  from  the  city,  as  this\r\n\r\nsubsection puts the ceiling of 20 per cent on  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  assessment leviable by District Councils\r\n\r\nas  opposed  to  30 per cent in the  city.  But  I\r\n\r\nwonder  what the ratepayers in, for example,  Haig\r\n\r\nRoad  who  will continue to pay 30  per  cent  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  say to their ex-fellow rate-payers  in,\r\n\r\nfor example, Joo Chiat Road who will in future pay\r\n\r\n20  per  cent, bearing in mind that both  sets  of\r\n\r\nrate-payers  enjoy the same municipal services  of\r\n\r\nmade-up    roads,   street   lighting,   sewerage,\r\n\r\nelectricity, water and gas, and bearing further in\r\n\r\nmind that Haig Road is purely residential and  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  Road  has considerable business  interests,\r\n\r\nand  that the latter has a bus service. If I  were\r\n\r\nliving  in Haig Road, I should have some questions\r\n\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an obvious anomaly here and in view\r\n\r\nof   the   fact   that  clause  111   allows   for\r\n\r\ndifferential rating, it seems to me that we should\r\n\r\ngive  very  careful consideration to  establishing\r\n\r\nthe  principle of fixing a ceiling for  the  rates\r\n\r\nleviable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  both  the city area and the district areas  at\r\n\r\nthe  same figure, differential rates being  levied\r\n\r\naccording  to  the number of municipal  and  other\r\n\r\nservices  enjoyed. This would seem to be  more  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with the Government's general  policy  on\r\n\r\ntaxation  and,  Sir, there seems  to  be  no  good\r\n\r\nreason  why  the  principle of the \"haves\"  paying\r\n\r\nmore than the \"have-nots\" should not apply to  the\r\n\r\nmunicipal level as well as the national  level.  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister will study this matter with\r\n\r\nthe greatest care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important matter of principle comes in\r\n\r\nclause  6 (2)  in which it is laid down that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  32  Members of the City  Council,  all\r\n\r\nelected. Now, this is purely a Government proposal\r\n\r\nbecause the Committee on Local Government made  no\r\n\r\nrepresentations on the numbers of elected Members,\r\n\r\neither  to  the  City Council or to  the  District\r\n\r\nCouncils.   Is  this  number  sufficient?   First,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind that as the Mayor and Deputy Mayor\r\n\r\nmust  remain apart from contention and controversy\r\n\r\nand  will,  I  think, have to remain out  of  most\r\n\r\nCommittees   in  view  of  their  positions,   the\r\n\r\neffective working strength of the Council will  be\r\n\r\n30,  or  only  3  more  than  the  present  number\r\n\r\nexcluding  the City President. It is an  undoubted\r\n\r\nfact that the present number of 27 is insufficient\r\n\r\nto  run the City Council really competently and an\r\n\r\nincrease in only 3 is patently not enough. Because\r\n\r\nof the paucity of numbers, each Standing Committee\r\n\r\nat   present   consists  of  only  five   or   six\r\n\r\nCouncillors which, to my mind, is insufficient and\r\n\r\nthere  have  been many instances of the  requisite\r\n\r\nquorum  of  three only being obtained  with  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Standing Committees cover a very wide range\r\n\r\nof responsibilities and subjects. A Councillor who\r\n\r\nhas,  as  his two Committees, for example,  health\r\n\r\nand public utilities, has to acquaint himself with\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of health prevention, anti-malarial\r\n\r\nand  veterinary  projects,  hawkers,  stand-pipes,\r\n\r\nmarkets,   infant   welfare  as   well   as   gas,\r\n\r\nelectricity and water. Now I doubt whether any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncillor  however competent and conscientious\r\n\r\ncan  master all these problems during his term  of\r\n\r\nfour  years,  and  I  mean no disrespect  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers in this House who are City Councillors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the system in the United Kingdom? lt\r\n\r\nis  simply this: of having larger Councils, larger\r\n\r\nStanding Committees, a sub-division of work of the\r\n\r\nStanding  Committees  through  SubCommittees   and\r\n\r\ngreater  delegated powers. The City of  Worcester,\r\n\r\nwhere  my  father was a Councillor and an Alderman\r\n\r\nfor  over  twenty years and a Mayor for  three  of\r\n\r\nthem,  has  a  population of  only  60.000  and  a\r\n\r\nCouncil of over fifty Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the City of Singapore were to have a Council\r\n\r\nof   64  Members,  not  32,  what  would  be   the\r\n\r\nadvantage?  It  would  then be  possible  to  have\r\n\r\nStanding Committees of 12 to 15 Members as they do\r\n\r\nin  the United Kingdom to which you could delegate\r\n\r\nfar  greater powers than is desirable in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the  present Committees of five or six.  These\r\n\r\nStanding   Committees  could  elect  SubCommittees\r\n\r\nlarge  enough  to  maintain some kind  of  balance\r\n\r\nbetween the Parties and which could concentrate on\r\n\r\na  smaller  number  of  subjects.  In  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, a Municipal Health Committee has  a  Sub-Committee   for   infant  welfare,   another   for\r\n\r\nveterinary  matters, another for markets,  and  so\r\n\r\non.   A   Councillor   therefore   becomes   fully\r\n\r\nacquainted  with one or two aspects  of  municipal\r\n\r\nwork on which his opinion can become authoritative\r\n\r\ninstead  of  attempting to become a  Jack  of  all\r\n\r\ntrades under the present Singapore system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Public Utilities Committee of fifteen Members,\r\n\r\nfor  example, would be large enough  to  have  the\r\n\r\nrequisite  leaven of responsibility and sufficient\r\n\r\nauthoritative  knowledge  to  be  delegated   wide\r\n\r\npowers  of  executive action without reference  to\r\n\r\nthe  full  Council. This would result  in  quicker\r\n\r\ndecisions  which after all the public is  entitled\r\n\r\nto expect from the municipal service which affects\r\n\r\ntheir  day-to-day  lives  and  that  leads  me  to\r\n\r\nanother point in favour of a larger Council. It is\r\n\r\nthe  same argument at the municipal level that has\r\n\r\nbeen used in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  doubling of membership  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, namely, that there is too much work  for\r\n\r\ntoo few people if the country is to be efficiently\r\n\r\nrun.   Not  only  does  this  apply  to  Municipal\r\n\r\nCouncillors but it affects every one of us in this\r\n\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that all hon. Members will agree\r\n\r\nthat a large percentage of the calls upon our time\r\n\r\nfrom  our  constituents - it may be 75 per  cent  or\r\n\r\neven  as  much  as 90 per cent - is  connected  with\r\n\r\nlocal  government  problems.  Their  problems  are\r\n\r\nthose   nearest  to  their  daily  lives - in  their\r\n\r\nbuildings,   electricity  or  water   connections,\r\n\r\nstandpipes, roads, drains, assessment, and so  on.\r\n\r\nBy  and large, the public are not deeply concerned\r\n\r\nabout  legislative  matters except  at  infrequent\r\n\r\nintervals.  Now we Members of the Legislature  are\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  to  deal with these  problems  which\r\n\r\nbelong  more properly to the sphere of  the  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  Councillors and it seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nthese  problems can only be fully tackled  if  the\r\n\r\nwards  are  smaller  so that a  City  or  District\r\n\r\nCouncillor  can  really know the  people  whom  he\r\n\r\nrepresents. And if this argument has force, is  it\r\n\r\nwise   to  raise  the  effective  number  of  City\r\n\r\nCouncillors  from  27 to only 30 -  I  exclude  the\r\n\r\nMayor and Deputy Mayor - when you are increasing the\r\n\r\nmuncipal electorates by tens or maybe hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that this whole problem - and it is\r\n\r\na problem with obvious difficulties in having much\r\n\r\nlarger   Councils - must  be  considered  with   the\r\n\r\ngreatest  care and that is why I feel it necessary\r\n\r\nto give it an airing today before the Bill goes to\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave the question of the composition of\r\n\r\nthe  City Council, I must refer to one other point\r\n\r\nwhich has not received the attention either of the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Local Government or the  Government\r\n\r\nitself. I refer to the question of Aldermen.  Now,\r\n\r\nI  am  well aware that the idea of having Aldermen\r\n\r\nhas been derided in many quarters in Singapore but\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the House will have the patience  to\r\n\r\nlet  me put the case for them as objectively as  I\r\n\r\ncan, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think  that  the  arguments in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\nAldermen  system  are at least  strong  enough  to\r\n\r\nwarrant their having further consideration at this\r\n\r\nstage.  Now, Sir, I am quite aware that the  chief\r\n\r\nargument against having Aldermen is that it is  or\r\n\r\ncan  be  a  pernicious device by which a  majority\r\n\r\nParty   in  the  Council  can  increase  its   own\r\n\r\nmajority. I accept that argument as an exceedingly\r\n\r\nstrong  one  and  the crux of the whole  question.\r\n\r\nBut,  in  theory at least, the system of  Aldermen\r\n\r\nhas  much to recommend it. The idea is to  have  a\r\n\r\ngroup of experienced elder statesmen, if I may  so\r\n\r\ncall  them, who can provide continuity  in  policy\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  a  special stability of  opinion  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of their being non-Party men. Because  they\r\n\r\nare  subject to less pressures through  not  being\r\n\r\nelected, they can use more objective judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, it will be agreed that there should\r\n\r\nbe  much  less government by political Parties  at\r\n\r\nthe  municipal  level than at the  national  level\r\n\r\nbecause  most  municipal  matters  are  not  party\r\n\r\nmatters   at   all.   It  is  unfortunate   though\r\n\r\ninevitable that the Party system should have crept\r\n\r\ninto  municipal affairs in the United Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nin  Singapore but, that being the case, a group of\r\n\r\nnon-Party  Aldermen who can keep the balance  when\r\n\r\nparty  politics  get out of hand over  some  quite\r\n\r\ntrivial  matter  has considerable point.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  nominated Members on the  City  Council\r\n\r\nhave   in  recent  years  shown  this  virtue   of\r\n\r\nobjective  independence on numerous occasions  and\r\n\r\nthat  elected  Councillors have been  grateful  to\r\n\r\nthem for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question however is: whether it is within the\r\n\r\nwit  of someone in this Assembly or outside it  to\r\n\r\ndevise a means whereby City Councillors can  elect\r\n\r\nAldermen   to  the  Council  by  a  method   which\r\n\r\neliminates  party bias. That may be a  tall  order\r\n\r\nbut  I submit to this House that it is worth  more\r\n\r\nthan a passing consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point that arises for consideration\r\n\r\ncomes  in  clause 11 where we have a new proposal,\r\n\r\nnamely,   of   the   Minister   controlling    the\r\n\r\nappointment of the City Council's senior  officer.\r\n\r\nI hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister in his reply will explain  the\r\n\r\nreasons for this and not reserve it for the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, particularly as there seems  to  be  no\r\n\r\nsimilar  provision  in  respect  of  the  District\r\n\r\nCouncils. Does this mean that there are to  be  no\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council  employees, no District  Council\r\n\r\nhealth officers, assessors, engineers, and so  on?\r\n\r\nIf not, how are the District Councils to carry out\r\n\r\ntheir  work  effectively and not  degenerate  into\r\n\r\nadvisory bodies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 16, there is laid down twelve elected\r\n\r\nCouncillors for each District Council and here  we\r\n\r\ncome  up  against the same problem  which  I  have\r\n\r\nalready posed in respect of the City Council.  The\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council must have for its  Committees  a\r\n\r\nbare   minimum - finance,  public  works,   health,\r\n\r\nassessment,  staff - and twelve  Members  are  surely\r\n\r\ninadequate for this purpose. From clause 41 (3)  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill, it seems evident that the Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  aware of this difficulty by fixing eight  as\r\n\r\nthe  quorum for Council meetings. A normal  quorum\r\n\r\nis  about  one-third  of the total  members  on  a\r\n\r\nCouncil or a Committee. The Government has had  to\r\n\r\nfix it at about two-thirds as anything less would,\r\n\r\nof  course, put decisions of District Councils  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  too  few.  Logic  alone  therefore\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  24  would be a better  number  for\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council. lt is further  borne  out  by\r\n\r\nclause 34 (4)  of the Bill where the quorum for the\r\n\r\nCity Council is fixed at 11 out of 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come, Sir, to clause 45 (2) which is a new\r\n\r\nsubsection  not  to  be  found  in  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance. In referring to this, Sir, I hope  that\r\n\r\nit  will not be considered that I am straying into\r\n\r\npoints  of  detail for it seems that a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple may be involved. To make my point clear,\r\n\r\nI  must  draw  the attention of the House  to  the\r\n\r\nentire clause. Clause 45 (1)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A local authority may appoint from among their\r\n\r\nown number such and so many committees either  of\r\n\r\na  general  or  special nature and consisting  of\r\n\r\nsuch  number of councillors as it thinks fit  for\r\n\r\nany  purposes which in the opinion of  the  local\r\n\r\nauthority  would be better regulated and  managed\r\n\r\nby means of such committees.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubclause (2)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A local authority shall appoint a Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee  consisting of such  councillors  as  it\r\n\r\nthinks  fit  for  regulating and  controlling  the\r\n\r\nfinance of the authority and shall fix the term of\r\n\r\noffice of the members of the Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It will be noticed that the unspecified committees\r\n\r\nin subclause (1)  will regulate and manage, but the\r\n\r\nFinance Committee will regulate and control.  This\r\n\r\nwould seem to suggest that Finance Committees  are\r\n\r\nto  be statutory Committees not accountable to the\r\n\r\nCouncils  themselves. I cannot believe, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  what the Government intends and I  would\r\n\r\nask   the  Minister  to  explain  what  this   new\r\n\r\nsubclause means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to my last point with reference to clause\r\n\r\n50.  This  clause enables the Chief Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficer  of the City Council in times of emergency\r\n\r\nto  use  extraordinary  executive  powers  without\r\n\r\nreference   even   to   the   Mayor.   The   Chief\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officer under  clause  11  (1)   is\r\n\r\nnevertheless  appointed by  the  City  Council.  I\r\n\r\nthink therefore an important question of principle\r\n\r\nis involved here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised a number of points in respect\r\n\r\nof  the  first  55 clauses which I  consider  need\r\n\r\nexamination  in Select Committee.  There  will  be\r\n\r\nmany  others in the remaining 270 clauses. I  have\r\n\r\nput  them  as objectively as I can because,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said before, I do not consider this Bill  to\r\n\r\nbe  one in which party politics should be involved\r\n\r\nbut  a problem of how to make our local government\r\n\r\nwork efficiently, smoothly and economically in the\r\n\r\nbest interests of the ratepayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One further question needs to be answered by the\r\n\r\nMinister and I hope he will answer it. What is the\r\n\r\nextra  cost to the country going to be of  setting\r\n\r\nup  District  Councils with their offices,  staffs\r\n\r\nand  equipment  compared with the  running  of  an\r\n\r\nisland-wide   Council  which  was   the   previous\r\n\r\nproposal?  I  think  that the  taxpayers  and  the\r\n\r\nratepayers ought to know that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the introduction of this Bill  into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. I feel that this Bill is in keeping with\r\n\r\nthe constitutional progress of Singapore. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind, Sir, that this Bill has preserved the status\r\n\r\nof  Singapore as a City which got its Charter  six\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  I also see, Sir, that in  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision for the setting up  of  rural\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils which give a wider  measure  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  self-government  in  rural  districts.\r\n\r\nBeing  a  member of the Rural District in Seletar,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  endorse  the views of the  people  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  that this is indeed a  very  welcome\r\n\r\nmove and they wholeheartedly support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few comments to make on the various\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill. The first one is that the\r\n\r\nPublic Services Commission is to be consulted when\r\n\r\nappointments are made in the City Council.  For  a\r\n\r\nlong time, Sir, the staff of the City Council have\r\n\r\nfelt  that this should be done and I am sure  that\r\n\r\nthey will welcome this new move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications for City Councillors have been\r\n\r\ndealt  with  by the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan Yew). Sir, this particular clause was  a\r\n\r\nsubject  of considerable discussion in  our  Party\r\n\r\nand I can assure this House that, when we endorsed\r\n\r\nit,  we had no ulterior motive behind this clause.\r\n\r\nWe  felt  that  if Members are elected  from  each\r\n\r\nDivision  and who are resident there,  the  people\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to draw representatives from  their\r\n\r\nown    place - representatives   whom   they   like,\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  whom they love.  I  thought  that\r\n\r\nprobably  this would be a very good  argument  for\r\n\r\nmore representation from rural districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language qualification for councillors was\r\n\r\nalso dealt with by the Member for Tanjong Pagar. I\r\n\r\nthink,  Sir, that Government was very wise in  not\r\n\r\nspecifying  the language required because  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat   at  this  early  stage  of  rural  district\r\n\r\nelections, there might be people who know  various\r\n\r\nlanguages  and  who will be equally  qualified  to\r\n\r\nbecome  District Councillors, and  I  think,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is another example whereby we could draw  out\r\n\r\npeople   who  are  able  to  tackle  the  job   of\r\n\r\ncouncillors for these posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Including Eskimos!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

In the\r\n\r\ncity  area at present, Sir, there are one  million\r\n\r\nresidents  and  for this number, I  feel  that  32\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  adequate. If,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of the hon. Member, we are  increasing\r\n\r\nthe  number, the Council will be larger  than  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly itself.

I\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  more  decentralisation  rather   than\r\n\r\ncentralising the whole City Council machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member further suggested that the\r\n\r\nmembership of committees in the City Council would\r\n\r\nalso  be  benefited by an enlarged number of  City\r\n\r\nCouncillors.   I  think,  Sir,  in   effect,   the\r\n\r\nmembership of the City Council is adequate.  I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve  that a committee of 15 Members would  not\r\n\r\nbe   able  to  do  much  work.  The  smaller   the\r\n\r\ncommittee, the more efficient the work  would  be.\r\n\r\nIf  there  is  any slackening in the work  of  the\r\n\r\ncouncillors,  it  is  not  entirely  due  to   the\r\n\r\ndecreased  number.  I was a  Member  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil for three years and I know that, to  be  a\r\n\r\nCity  Councillor  and  to  do  the  work  that  is\r\n\r\nexpected, only two or three hours a day  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired to go through all the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I do not think for a moment that the\r\n\r\nenlarged committees would help in any way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a shame to me, Sir.I said three hours\r\n\r\na  day on paper work.

It  is  no  fault\r\n\r\ngiving  the  Minister the power for the adjustment\r\n\r\nbecause we feel that, when the Minister decides to\r\n\r\nhave a new boundary, he will automatically consult\r\n\r\nthe  people concerned and fix the boundary to  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All the Members on his side!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I do believe, Sir, that this is not a\r\n\r\nquestion  which  the Minister  will  tackle  on  a\r\n\r\npolitical  basis  because he, in his  capacity  as\r\n\r\nMinister,  ought to know the views of  the  people\r\n\r\nand  anything  that he does, we can  all  imagine,\r\n\r\nwill be in the best interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hooray!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, before I conclude, I think that it\r\n\r\nis  very  appropriate at this juncture  to  pay  a\r\n\r\ntribute to the Members of the City Council and the\r\n\r\nRural  Board for the work that they have done  for\r\n\r\nour  people.

May I,  Sir,  ask\r\n\r\nhim  to read that particular sub-clause again?

Butterfield):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, legislation was brought into force early in 1955 which made certain temporary amendments to\r\n\r\nthe Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, the Dangerous Drugs\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  of  course, being the Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nregulates     the    importation,     exportation,\r\n\r\nmanufacture,  sale  and use of opium  and  certain\r\n\r\nother  dangerous drugs. Sir, the purpose  of  that\r\n\r\ntemporary   legislation  was   to   enable   Opium\r\n\r\nTreatment  Centres to be established and  also  to\r\n\r\nenable  certain classes of persons to be  sent  to\r\n\r\nthose  Centres. I should remind hon. Members  that\r\n\r\nunder  that legislation, persons who are convicted\r\n\r\nfor the first time of an offence of either smoking\r\n\r\nprepared opium or of being in possession of  pipes\r\n\r\nor utensils used for smoking or consuming prepared\r\n\r\nopium   must   be  remanded  by  the   Court   for\r\n\r\nexamination  and  report by  the  Opium  Treatment\r\n\r\nCentres  Advisory Committee. That Committee,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  required, amongst other things, to assess  the\r\n\r\nprospects  of the person on remand being  able  to\r\n\r\novercome or assisted to overcome his addiction and\r\n\r\nthe  Committee is also required to say whether  in\r\n\r\ntheir  opinion a period of treatment at  an  Opium\r\n\r\nTreatment  Centre would be likely to cure  him  of\r\n\r\nhis  habit. Now, after considering such a  report,\r\n\r\nthe  Court  is required either to send  him  to  a\r\n\r\nCentre for a period which may be for between 3 and\r\n\r\n12  months  or  to  send him to prison  for  three\r\n\r\nmonths.  Second offenders go to prison for  twelve\r\n\r\nmonths. What this Bill proposes, Sir, is to  allow\r\n\r\nmagistrates a discretion as to whether or  not  to\r\n\r\nsentence to a term of imprisonment first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffenders  who  are  not considered  suitable  for\r\n\r\ntreatment   at  an  Opium  Treatment  Centre   and\r\n\r\naccordingly, Sir, if this amendment is  made,  the\r\n\r\nCourt will be enabled in suitable cases to fine or\r\n\r\notherwise deal with the first offender, perhaps by\r\n\r\nputting him on probation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this Bill is also concerned with\r\n\r\nanother  matter.  It  proposes  another  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  relates to the use of medical  certificates\r\n\r\nwhich  are issued following a Court Order  that  a\r\n\r\nperson  accused either of possession  of  prepared\r\n\r\nopium  or  of  consuming prepared opium  shall  be\r\n\r\nmedically   examined.  At  present,   Sir,   these\r\n\r\ncertificates are admissible as evidence during the\r\n\r\ncourse of a trial and what is now proposed is that\r\n\r\nthey  should not be admissible in evidence  except\r\n\r\non  the  application of the accused or  after  his\r\n\r\nconviction should he be convicted. I think I might\r\n\r\nusefully add, Sir, that these certificates can  be\r\n\r\nof  considerable assistance to an accused  who  is\r\n\r\ncharged  with  a possession offence  because  that\r\n\r\noffence carries a sentence of up to five years and\r\n\r\nalso  the  liability to a fine of up  to  $10,000.\r\n\r\nThey  might be of great assistance because if  the\r\n\r\nCourt   is  satisfied  that  the  opium   in   the\r\n\r\npossession  of the convicted man was for  his  own\r\n\r\nimmediate personal consumption, the Court may deal\r\n\r\nwith  him as if he had been convicted of a smoking\r\n\r\noffence which carries a lesser penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two amendments with which Bill is\r\n\r\nconcerned  are  amendments which are  put  forward\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  experience of the working  of  the\r\n\r\ntemporary legislation relating to dangerous  drugs\r\n\r\nand  Opium Treatment Centres and I hope that  they\r\n\r\nwill commend themselves to the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Butterfield):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill comes before the Assembly as a\r\n\r\nseparate  measure because the amendments  proposed\r\n\r\nare   not   directly  related  to  the   temporary\r\n\r\nprovisions of the law relating to Opium  Treatment\r\n\r\nCentres  with which the last Bill, which has  just\r\n\r\nbeen before the Assembly, dealt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members will have seen from the\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Note which is attached to  this  Bill\r\n\r\nthat the main purpose of the amendment proposed by\r\n\r\nit is to empower police officers who are not below\r\n\r\nthe rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police  as\r\n\r\nwell  as,  as at present, magistrates and Justices\r\n\r\nof  the Peace, to authorise the search of premises\r\n\r\nin which there is reasonable cause to believe that\r\n\r\nthere  is  concealed any dangerous  drugs  or  any\r\n\r\narticles relating to the commission of an  offence\r\n\r\nunder the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will do away with the\r\n\r\nprocedure involving a very considerable  waste  of\r\n\r\ntime which has to be followed when the Officer  in\r\n\r\ncharge of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Narcotics  Branch of  the  C.I.D. is  not  a\r\n\r\nJustice of the Peace. Sir, briefly, this procedure\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  transportation from the  old  Kreta\r\n\r\nAyer  Police Station to the Central Police Station\r\n\r\nof  the  Duty Officer and of each detective  whose\r\n\r\ninformation forms the basis of an application  for\r\n\r\na  search warrant. This normally involves a  large\r\n\r\nproportion of the detective staff attached to  the\r\n\r\nNarcotics Branch every day and sometimes,  indeed,\r\n\r\nit involves the transportation of the whole of the\r\n\r\ndetective staff to the Central Police Station.  It\r\n\r\nis clear therefore, Sir, that if this amendment is\r\n\r\nmade,  the  Narcotics Branch will  be  enabled  to\r\n\r\ndevote   all   its  time  and  energies   to   the\r\n\r\nsuppression  of  the traffic in  opium  and  other\r\n\r\ndangerous drugs instead of, as at present, using a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount  of  time  in  obtaining  the\r\n\r\nwarrants  which  are  necessary  before  they  can\r\n\r\nundertake their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view, Sir, of the importance of the work of\r\n\r\nthe  Narcotics  Branch, I hope that this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwill support this motion. I would, before formally\r\n\r\nmoving   the  Second  Reading,  Sir,   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity of indicating to Members that  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  of the Bill being given its Second Reading,\r\n\r\nI  propose  to move in Committee the  deletion  of\r\n\r\nparagraph  (d)  in clause 2 which is considered  to\r\n\r\nbe unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Sir,  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nElections Bill is of its very nature complementary\r\n\r\nto  the  Local Government Bill in that  while  the\r\n\r\nlatter  Bill makes provision for the establishment\r\n\r\nof  the  City  Council and District Councils,  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nelections of Councillors to those Councils and, in\r\n\r\nparticular, to enable the registration of electors\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes of elections  to  the  proposed\r\n\r\nCouncils  to  take place. That is  why  these  two\r\n\r\nBills   are   introduced   concurrently   in   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the drafts of the relevant legislation stand\r\n\r\nat  present, while the Local Government Bill  sets\r\n\r\nout   the   qualifications  and  disqualifications\r\n\r\nrelating   to   candidates   for   elections    as\r\n\r\nCouncillors,  the Local Government Elections  Bill\r\n\r\nsets  out the qualifications and disqualifications\r\n\r\nof  electors. Again, while the boundaries  of  the\r\n\r\nnew  local government areas are defined under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Local Government Bill, the names\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand boundaries of electoral divisions within these\r\n\r\nlocal  government  areas and the  sub-division  of\r\n\r\nthese  electoral divisions into polling  districts\r\n\r\nare  made  under  the  Local Government  Elections\r\n\r\nBill. Until the boundaries of the local government\r\n\r\nareas   have   been   defined  and   approved,   a\r\n\r\nProclamation  specifying the names and  boundaries\r\n\r\nof   the   electoral  divisions  and   a   Gazette\r\n\r\nNotification  specifying  the  polling   districts\r\n\r\ncannot be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper, Sir, it was pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  McNeice  Committee  did  not  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  franchise for local  government\r\n\r\nelectors  as it was not included in its  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference, but Government has, however,  given  it\r\n\r\nconsiderable thought and proposes that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(a) the basis of the franchise for the proposed\r\n\r\nnew   City  Council  and  District  Councils\r\n\r\nshould be\r\n\r\nuniversal  adult suffrage qualified by a  period\r\n\r\nof   at  least  five  years'  residence   in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nelector  being  required to be resident  in  the\r\n\r\ndivision in which he wishes to vote;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) registration of electors should be effected\r\n\r\nby a system of automatic registration based on\r\n\r\nidentity cards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  Bill  accordingly makes provision for  these\r\n\r\ntwo proposals. These are the two major changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill which, in the main, follows closely  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the Municipal Elections  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1948,  to  be  repealed on the  enactment  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Explanatory Note to the Bill,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Clause 5 provides that any person who was not\r\n\r\nless than twenty-one years of age on, and has been\r\n\r\nordinarily resident in the Colony for a period  of\r\n\r\nnot less than five years immediately prior to, 1st\r\n\r\nApril  in  any year shall be entitled to have  his\r\n\r\nname  entered in the register of electors  in  the\r\n\r\ndivision in which he is resident that year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  will  thus  be seen that the new franchise  is\r\n\r\ndifferent from the qualifications of City  Council\r\n\r\nelectors  described under the Municipal  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1948. This means that the right to vote\r\n\r\nwill  be extended to a far greater number  of  the\r\n\r\nadult    population   resident    in    Singapore.\r\n\r\nCitizenship    will   not   be   a   pre-requisite\r\n\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Bill, the system of automatic\r\n\r\nregistration  of  electors,  now  in   force   for\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly elections, is to replace  the\r\n\r\nformer system of voluntary registration under  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Elections Ordinance, 1948. The  register\r\n\r\nwill be prepared automatically from identity cards\r\n\r\nand  provision  is accordingly made for  presuming\r\n\r\nthat  persons  to  whom identity cards  have  been\r\n\r\nissued  before 1st April in any year are  on  that\r\n\r\ndate  ordinarily resident in the Colony. Provision\r\n\r\nis also made for particulars in the identity cards\r\n\r\nregarding age and addresses to be presumed  to  be\r\n\r\naccurate  for purposes of preparation and revision\r\n\r\nof registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper, it was proposed that plural\r\n\r\nvoting should be permitted so as to allow a person\r\n\r\nliving in one local government area to have a vote\r\n\r\nin  another local government area in which he owns\r\n\r\nproperty  if he registers himself voluntarily  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose.  Therefore, a person living  in  one\r\n\r\narea and owning properties in all other four areas\r\n\r\ncould  exercise  five votes in all,  one  in  each\r\n\r\nlocal  government area. This proposal has  however\r\n\r\nbeen reconsidered and it was felt that the present\r\n\r\nBill  should  not include any provision  for  such\r\n\r\nplural voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then, Mr Speaker, are the general features\r\n\r\nof   the  Bill.  It  is  the  intention  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to commit this Bill immediately  after\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have one plea to\r\n\r\nmake  with  regard to this Bill  and  that  is  in\r\n\r\nclause 28 regarding deposits by candidates.

It may be a new practice in Singapore but\r\n\r\nI  would like the Government to give consideration\r\n\r\nto   this  suggestion  when  it  goes  to   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is only\r\n\r\none  point I wish to bring to the attention of the\r\n\r\nHouse  on this Bill, namely, that it has  made  no\r\n\r\nprovision   whatsoever  for  the   limitation   of\r\n\r\ntransport  of  candidates. Any man who  has  taken\r\n\r\npart  in  elections in Singapore  knows  that  the\r\n\r\navailability of friends with free motor  cars  and\r\n\r\nfree  petrol is a very useful advantage in getting\r\n\r\npeople to the polls to vote for a candidate. It is\r\n\r\na   principle   in  countries  which   profess   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic system that factors such as the  wealth\r\n\r\nof  a  candidate or the wealth of his friends  are\r\n\r\nnot allowed in any way to affect the result of  an\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have in this Bill a provision carried\r\n\r\nover  from  the old Municipal Elections  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that no money shall  be  expended  on\r\n\r\ntransport. But the dodge is to get friends to  provide  not only free cars but also free petrol  and\r\n\r\nfree syces. I suggest that when this Bill goes  to\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, the Government should seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  putting  in  provisions  to  stop   this\r\n\r\nreprehensible practice and to limit each candidate\r\n\r\nto  a specified number of cars depending upon  two\r\n\r\nthings: the size of a constituency and the  number\r\n\r\nof  voters on the electoral register. In that way,\r\n\r\nthe Government can ensure - and I am sure all honest\r\n\r\ndemocratic  governments want to ensure - that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  free competition  of  opinions  and\r\n\r\ncandidates popularly and democratically elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Bedok (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin\r\n\r\nHaji  Jumat) in the days before he became a Member\r\n\r\nfor   Ulu Bedok  must  have  experienced   great\r\n\r\ndifficulty getting transport to get the voters  of\r\n\r\nUlu  Bedok  to  the polls, particularly  competing\r\n\r\nwith other candidates who happened to be wealthier\r\n\r\nthan  he was. I am sure that in the next election,\r\n\r\nhe  would not like to undergo all the stresses and\r\n\r\nstrains of worrying about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe wealth of his opponents and their friends.  We\r\n\r\ncan  do  that  by putting a proviso ensuring  that\r\n\r\nevery candidate is limited to the same number  of\r\n\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  by  the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar  to\r\n\r\nlimit the candidates to a fixed number of cars  is\r\n\r\na  very good one provided it could be carried  out\r\n\r\nby our candidates in the right spirit in which,  I\r\n\r\nhope, it is meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that there is another\r\n\r\nclause  in this Bill which says that electors  are\r\n\r\nfree   to   provide  their  own  transport   which\r\n\r\npresumably  means that four or five  electors  can\r\n\r\njoin  together, hire a taxi and go to the  polling\r\n\r\nstations. Therefore, if we provide a limit on  the\r\n\r\nnumber of cars a candidate can use, obviously  the\r\n\r\nway  out  is for the candidate's friends  to  band\r\n\r\ntogether and provide another hundred cars and  say\r\n\r\nthat it does not concern the candidate; that these\r\n\r\ncars  are  used  by the electorate  on  their  own\r\n\r\nvolition and that the candidate has no say in  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they can easily defeat the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Members will remember that during the last\r\n\r\nSession,  the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon Mong) introduced \r\n\r\na Shop and Office Employees Bill.\r\n\r\nAt  the  Second Reading of this Bill, the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment introduced Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  11\r\n\r\nwhich  laid down the labour policy of the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment and included as an annexure a  Bill  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the conditions of employment  of  clerks\r\n\r\nand shop assistants. In committing the Bill of the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon to Select  Committee,  this\r\n\r\nAssembly ordered that it be an instruction to that\r\n\r\nSelect Committee that regard be had to the terms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the draft Bill annexed to the Government White\r\n\r\nPaper.  The  Select Committee, Sir, did  not  have\r\n\r\ntime to conclude its investigations before the end\r\n\r\nof the last Session and the Bill therefore lapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable amount of further study has been\r\n\r\ndone  on  the  Bill  attached as  an  annexure  to\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Cmd. 11. Due regard  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  representations  made  before  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee by employers and trade unions  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the  advice of the  Labour  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard to which the Bill was referred for comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest change that has been made, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthe  splitting of the Bill into two: one  relating\r\n\r\nto  clerks  and  the  other  to  shop  assistants.\r\n\r\nDespite  the fact that both Bills are  similar  in\r\n\r\nthe protection and benefits they give to these two\r\n\r\ntypes of employees, it is considered that separate\r\n\r\nBills  are  desirable. Clerks and shop  assistants\r\n\r\nare  after all two distinct types of employees and\r\n\r\nit  may  well  be  that the experience  gained  in\r\n\r\nadministering  this Bill over a  number  of  years\r\n\r\nwill  show that the type of amendment and addition\r\n\r\nwhich  is necessary to one Bill is unnecessary  to\r\n\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the drafting of two separate\r\n\r\nBills, the main difference from the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe previous Government's Bill is the inclusion of\r\n\r\na  new  designation of \"industrial clerks\" in  the\r\n\r\nBill  which is the subject of my motion. This  has\r\n\r\nbeen done to meet objections that many clerks, for\r\n\r\nexample,  tally clerks, storekeepers,  etc.,  must\r\n\r\nhave  the conditions of employment with regard  to\r\n\r\nhours  of  work and holidays as the  workmen  with\r\n\r\nwhom they work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the matter of legislation for clerks has\r\n\r\nalready been debated at considerable length during\r\n\r\nthe  previous Session of this Assembly, Sir, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  propose to cover the ground again.  The  need\r\n\r\nfor  legislation to protect clerks is too  obvious\r\n\r\nto require a lengthy oration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend therefore, Sir, merely to summarise the\r\n\r\nmain features of the Bill, a Bill which I am quite\r\n\r\nsure will go a long way to give fair conditions of\r\n\r\nemployment to a hitherto neglected section of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, this Bill regulates contracts of\r\n\r\nservice,  lays down conditions for the payment  of\r\n\r\nsalaries  and limits the type of deductions  which\r\n\r\nmay be made from salaries. It provides for, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of clerks, 16 days paid public holidays,  14\r\n\r\ndays  paid annual leave. It limits their hours  of\r\n\r\nwork  to  39  a week and provides for overtime  at\r\n\r\ntime and a half for hours worked in excess of this\r\n\r\nlimit.  In  the  case of industrial  clerks  whose\r\n\r\nconditions of service must be similar to those  of\r\n\r\nworkmen  for the reasons I have already given,  it\r\n\r\nprovides for 11 days paid public holidays, 7  days\r\n\r\npaid annual leave. It limits the hours of work  to\r\n\r\n44 per week and also provides for overtime at time\r\n\r\nand  a  half. Paid sick leave up to a limit of  28\r\n\r\ndays  is  provided for both clerks and  industrial\r\n\r\nclerks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important feature of the Bill, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthat it permits clerks to lay their complaints  in\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Court thus saving them the  formality\r\n\r\nand  expense of proceedings in the Civil  District\r\n\r\nCourt.   It   provides  for  adequate  powers   of\r\n\r\ninspection and suitable penalties for infringement\r\n\r\nof   its   provisions  to  ensure   that   it   is\r\n\r\nsuccessfully enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's intention to refer this\r\n\r\nBill  to a Select Committee which will, no  doubt,\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration  any  views  which  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers may express on the Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member of\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee which sat last  Session  to\r\n\r\nconsider two Clerks and Shop Assistants Bills, one\r\n\r\ndrafted  by  the Liberal-Socialist Party  and  the\r\n\r\nother  by  the Government, I think it  had  become\r\n\r\nclear  that we had been setting ourselves problems\r\n\r\nof  legislation which it would not be at all  easy\r\n\r\nto   surmount.  I  am  glad  therefore  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has taken the course of  drafting  two\r\n\r\nBills  to  meet  two  rather  different  sets   of\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Clerks Employment Bill before us, the\r\n\r\nfurther  conundrum  with  which  the  old   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee was faced has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  met  by defining two categories  of  clerks:\r\n\r\nindustrial and otherwise. Whether this is going to\r\n\r\nbe  a  satisfactory solution or whether  it  would\r\n\r\nresult   in  invidious  distinctions  and  further\r\n\r\ncomplications is a matter on which I have an  open\r\n\r\nmind,  but  to  which a Select Committee  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse should call for evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested, Sir, that a 39-hour week\r\n\r\nwill  be  extremely  hard on  the  numerous  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in Singapore. If this is  so,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Government will call for evidence and, at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  make  their own  investigations,\r\n\r\nbecause  a  Bill  of this kind while  giving  much\r\n\r\nneeded  protection to the clerks should not impose\r\n\r\nundue  hardship on the small employer on  whom  so\r\n\r\nmuch of the ordinary trade of the country depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it has been stated that a 39-hour week\r\n\r\nis  not at present being worked in Government  and\r\n\r\nCity Council offices. This rather surprises me and\r\n\r\nI  should  like to know from the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is a fact and, if so, what will be the extra\r\n\r\nbill  which  the  ratepayer  will  have  to  meet,\r\n\r\nbearing  in  mind that the Government's  and  City\r\n\r\nCouncil's, wage bills already swallow up too  high\r\n\r\na proportion of the country's revenues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other specific point to which I wish\r\n\r\nto refer, namely, in clauses 44 to 46. It seems to\r\n\r\nme  that  they give inspecting officers very  wide\r\n\r\npowers  indeed.  An Inspector may  enter  premises\r\n\r\nunder  clause  44 without previous notice  at  any\r\n\r\nhour  of the day or night and under clause 46 (a) ,\r\n\r\nhe  may put questions concerning the employees  to\r\n\r\ntheir  employer or to the employees themselves  or\r\n\r\nto any other person whom he may consider desirable\r\n\r\nto  question. There seems no obvious justification\r\n\r\nfor  these  wide powers. Surely, it is  sufficient\r\n\r\nthat an Inspector makes his enquiries during hours\r\n\r\nwhen  the  premises are opened for  business,  and\r\n\r\nthat  there also should be the proviso to be found\r\n\r\nin  section  9 (2)  of the present Weekly  Holidays\r\n\r\nOrdinance now to be repealed, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...no person shall be compellable to answer any\r\n\r\nquestion  if  the  answer  may  tend  directly  or\r\n\r\nindirectly to incriminate himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add, Sir, that similar clauses which seem\r\n\r\nto  me  objectionable are to be found in the  Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants  Employment Bill,  clauses  48  to  50.\r\n\r\nUnless, Sir, there are good and convincing reasons\r\n\r\nfor  their  retention, I think that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould consider modifying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"clerk\" in this Bill is contained in\r\n\r\nclause 2 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"'clerk' means any person employed in or about\r\n\r\nthe  business of an office whose salary is  not\r\n\r\nmore than five hundred dollars per mensem or such other\r\n\r\nsum as may from time to time be fixed by the\r\n\r\nMinister  by  notification  in  the  Gazette  and,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  such  salary  limits,  includes  such\r\n\r\nclasses of person employed  by  the Government or by  Her  Britannic\r\n\r\nMajesty's   Government  in  the   United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nfunctioning in  the  Colony as the Governor may from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime declare to be clerks for the purposes of this Ordinance...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  it  is  true that we must have an  arbitrary\r\n\r\nfigure but I would like to know why the figure 500\r\n\r\nwas chosen. With the tendency of wages to get more\r\n\r\nand  more inflated because the money becomes  less\r\n\r\nand  less  valuable, it seems quite  obvious  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  many clerks who will  not  be  in\r\n\r\nsupervisory  or  special categories  drawing  more\r\n\r\nthan  $500  a  month.  It  is  not  an  altogether\r\n\r\nsatisfactory method of dealing with the definition\r\n\r\nof  \"clerk\"  to  allow the Minister  to  vary  the\r\n\r\ndefinition by gazetting the salary limit by  which\r\n\r\na  person is deemed to be a clerk or not a  clerk.\r\n\r\nHowever,  that  is a matter which  could  be  more\r\n\r\nusefully dealt with in Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) has stated\r\n\r\nthat he has an open mind on the subject, I see  no\r\n\r\nmerit  in  dividing  clerks into  two  categories:\r\n\r\nIndustrial clerks and ordinary clerks.  One  would\r\n\r\nhave  thought that a Socialist Government's policy\r\n\r\nwould,  as  a  matter  of  principle,  have   been\r\n\r\ndirected  towards  some  more  or  less  classless\r\n\r\nsociety.  This  process of not only creating  more\r\n\r\nclasses but sub-divisions of classes is one  which\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  Socialist heresy. A tally clerk  will\r\n\r\nhave to work 44 hours a week instead of 39 hours a\r\n\r\nweek. He will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentitled to 11 public holidays instead of  13.  He\r\n\r\nwill be entitled to 7 days annual leave instead of\r\n\r\n14,  and so on. I think this question of principle\r\n\r\nshould  be resolved at once. The Government  would\r\n\r\nbe   well  advised  to  define  its  attitude   to\r\n\r\nlegislation of this nature: whether its  intention\r\n\r\nis  to  stratify  classes  into  sub-divisions  of\r\n\r\nclasses or whether its intention is to bring about\r\n\r\na more egalitarian and less stratified society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

As I said\r\n\r\nearlier,  this Bill will be committed to a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee and the various points raised by the two\r\n\r\nspeakers, the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) and the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)  will\r\n\r\nreceive due consideration in Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has criticised that the\r\n\r\nnumber of hours of work per week of 39 is, in  his\r\n\r\nview,   not  satisfactory  in  so  far  as   small\r\n\r\nemployers are concerned. I said, Sir, earlier that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  was considered by the Labour  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard on which employers and employees are equally\r\n\r\nrepresented. He asked for information  as  to  the\r\n\r\nworking  hours of Government clerks.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  he must be aware that the working hours  are\r\n\r\nfrom  9  a.m. to 4.30 p.m. with an hour break  for\r\n\r\nlunch  on  Monday to Friday and from 9 a.m. to  1\r\n\r\np.m. on Saturday. This works out to less than  39\r\n\r\nhours a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar has said that in the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"clerk\" the figure of  $500  is  an\r\n\r\narbitrary  figure. I agree that it is an arbitrary\r\n\r\nfigure but the hon.
